First-principles\ncalculations and other computer experiments have been integrated into material\ndesign pipelines to address the lack of experimental data and the limitations\nof interpolative machine learning predictors. However, the enormous\ncomputational costs and technical challenges of automating computer experiments\nfor polymeric materials have limited the availability of open-source automated\npolymer design systems that integrate molecular simulations and machine\nlearning. We developed SPACIER, an open-source software program that integrates\nRadonPy, a Python library for fully automated polymer property calculations\nbased on all-atom classical molecular dynamics into a Bayesian\noptimization-based polymer design system to overcome these challenges. As a\nproof-of-concept study, we successfully synthesized optical polymers that\nsurpass the Pareto boundary formed by the tradeoff between the refractive index\nand Abbe number.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
