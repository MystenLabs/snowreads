Tin (Sn) plays a pivotal role here as an element due to its two\nstructural phases, $\\alpha$-Sn and $\\beta$-Sn, exhibiting topological\ncharacteristics ($\\alpha$-Sn) and superconductivity ($\\beta$-Sn). In this study\nwe show how precise control of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phases of Sn thin films can\nbe achieved by using molecular beam epitaxy grown buffer layers with systematic\ncontrol over the lattice parameter. The resulting Sn films showed either\n$\\beta$-Sn or $\\alpha$-Sn phases as the lattice constant of the buffer layer\nwas varied from 6.10 A to 6.48 A, covering the range between GaSb (closely\nmatched to InAs) and InSb. The crystal structures of the $\\alpha$- and\n$\\beta$-Sn films were characterized by x-ray diffraction and confirmed by Raman\nspectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The smooth and\ncontinuous surface morphology of the Sn films was validated using atomic force\nmicroscopy. The characteristics of $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-Sn phases were further\nverified using electrical transport measurements by observing resistance drop\nnear 3.7 K for superconductivity of the $\\beta$-Sn phase and Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations for the $\\alpha$-Sn phase. Density functional theory calculations\nshowed that the stability of the Sn phases is highly dependent on lattice\nstrain, with $\\alpha$-Sn being more stable under tensile strain and $\\beta$-Sn\nbecoming favorable under compressive strain, which is in good agreement with\nexperimental observations. Hence, this study sheds light on controlling Sn\nphases through lattice engineering, enabling innovative applications in quantum\ntechnologies and beyond.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_xn3ZgRLFty7efGKaGW-yA2CkeL3cqVfQvbYUhhJ3bc","pdfSize":"3567245","objectId":"0x8043a3caed31997224755e21279ec7d6c890c9a1004f40bcdb841bcf8fda440c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
