Conversational Query\nReformulation (CQR) improves conversational search by refining the original\nqueries into de-contextualized forms to resolve the issues in the original\nqueries, such as omissions and coreferences. Previous CQR methods focus on\nimitating human written queries which may not always yield meaningful search\nresults for the retriever. In this paper, we introduce GuideCQR, a framework\nthat refines queries for CQR by leveraging key infFormation from the initially\nretrieved documents. Specifically, GuideCQR extracts keywords and generates\nexpected answers from the retrieved documents, then unifies them with the\nqueries after filtering to add useful information that enhances the search\nprocess. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, outperforming previous\nCQR methods. Additionally, we show that GuideCQR can get additional performance\ngains in conversational search using various types of queries, even for queries\nwritten by humans.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
