We define a new invariant $\\Delta_{sym}$ of bordered\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology solid tori from an involution of the associated\nimmersed curves and relate it to both the $d$-invariants and the\nNeumann-Siebenmann $\\bar\\mu$-invariants of certain fillings. We deduce that if\n$L$ is a 2-component arborescent link and $\\Sigma_2(L)$ is an L-space, then the\nspin $d$-invariants of $\\Sigma_2(L)$ are determined by the signatures of $L$.\nBy a separate argument, we show that the same relationship holds when $L$ is a\n2-component link that admits a certain symmetry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
