While ML is widely used in TCAD, they either require access to\nthe internal solver, require extensive domain expertise, are only trained by\nterminal quantities such as currents and voltages, and/or lack\nout-of-training-range prediction capability. In this paper, using Si nanowire\nas an example, we demonstrate that it is possible to use a physics-informed\nneural network (PINN) to predict out-of-training-range TCAD solutions without\naccessing the internal solver and with minimal domain expertise. The machine\nnot only can predict a 2.5 times larger range than the training but also can\npredict the inversion region by only being trained with subthreshold region\ndata. The physics-informed module is also trained with data without the need\nfor human-coded equations making this easier to be extended to more\nsophisticated systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
