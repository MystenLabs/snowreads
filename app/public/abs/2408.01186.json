Our main result provides a framework related to the theory of\nde Branges spaces of entire functions, that allows one to find the sharp\nconstants and classify the extremizers in a broad range of situations. We\ndiscuss an application in number theory, in connection to bounds for zeros of\n$L$-functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
