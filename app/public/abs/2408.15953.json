Next to these item interactions, most systems also\nhave interactions with pages not related to specific items, for example\nnavigation pages, account pages, and pages for a specific category, which may\nprovide additional insights into the user's interests. However, while there are\nseveral approaches to integrate additional information about items and users,\nthe topic of integrating non-item pages has been less explored. We use the\nhypotheses testing framework HypTrails to show that there is indeed a\nrelationship between these non-item pages and the items of interest and fill\nthis gap by proposing various approaches of representing non-item pages (e.g,\nbased on their content) to use them as an additional information source for the\ntask of sequential next-item prediction.\n  We create a synthetic dataset with non-item pages highly related to the\nsubsequent item to show that the models are generally capable of learning from\nthese interactions, and subsequently evaluate the improvements gained by\nincluding non-item pages in two real-world datasets.\n  We adapt eight popular sequential recommender models, covering CNN-, RNN- and\ntransformer-based architectures, to integrate non-item pages and investigate\nthe capabilities of these models to leverage their information for next item\nprediction. We also analyze their behavior on noisy data and compare different\nitem representation strategies.\n  Our results show that non-item pages are a valuable source of information,\nbut representing such a page well is the key to successfully leverage them. The\ninclusion of non-item pages can increase the performance for next-item\nprediction in all examined model architectures with a varying degree.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
