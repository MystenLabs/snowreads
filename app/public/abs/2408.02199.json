We analyze the properties of the integral operator's kernel to\nderive the decay pattern of the entries in the representation matrix.\nLeveraging this decay pattern, we devise a truncation strategy that efficiently\ncompresses the dense representation matrix of the integral operator into a\nsparser form containing only $\\mathcal{O}(N\\ln^2 N)$ nonzero entries, where $N$\ndenotes the degrees of freedom of the discretization method. We prove that this\ntruncation strategy achieves a quasi-optimal convergence order of\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^{-p/2}\\ln N)$, with $p$ representing the degree of regularity of\nthe exact solution to the boundary integral equation. Additionally, we confirm\nthat the truncation strategy preserves stability throughout the solution\nprocess. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
