At the heart of this\nrequirement is the construction of lane graphs, which provide essential\ninformation on lane connectivity, vital for navigating complex urban\nenvironments autonomously. While transformer-based models have been effective\nin creating map topologies from vehicle-mounted sensor data, their potential\nfor generating such graphs from aerial imagery remains untapped. This work\nintroduces a novel approach to generating successor lane graphs from aerial\nimagery, utilizing the advanced capabilities of transformer models. We frame\nsuccessor lane graphs as a collection of maximal length paths and predict them\nusing a Detection Transformer (DETR) architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof our method through extensive experiments on the diverse and large-scale\nUrbanLaneGraph dataset, illustrating its accuracy in generating successor lane\ngraphs and highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous vehicle\nnavigation in complex environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
