An effective model is established for braiding of MZMs and MKPs.\nWe employ the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave topological superconductors to embody the\neffective model for braiding of MKPs by utilizing finite-size effects and\nlocally tunable coupling parameters. We show how to construct the state\ninitialization and readout via gate control. We also use this method for\nbraiding MZMs in s-wave topological superconductors. Our proposal presents a\npromising avenue for experimentally verifying the non-Abelian statistical\nproperties of MZMs and MKPs, with implications for topological quantum\ncomputing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
