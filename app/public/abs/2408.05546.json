And we compute the\nmetric perturbations of the Connes conformal invarints and the conformal\nLaplacian. As corollaries, some new bimetric conformal invarints on\n4-dimensional Riemannian manifolds without boundary are obtained and we get the\nfirst order and second order variations of the Connes conformal invarints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
