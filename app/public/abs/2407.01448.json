It is\nknown that the space of Iwahori fixed vectors in $V$ is one dimensional. The\nIwahori Hecke algebra acts on this space via a character. We determine this\nfixed vector and use the Hecke algebra action on it to determine in full the\nWhittaker function associated with this Iwahori fixed vector. This generalizes\nour previous result for $GL_n(F)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
