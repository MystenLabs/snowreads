In this\npaper, we propose a neural-symbolic model for plane geometry problem solving\n(PGPS), named PGPSNet-v2, with three key steps: modal fusion, reasoning process\nand knowledge verification. In modal fusion, we leverage textual clauses to\nexpress fine-grained structural and semantic content of geometry diagram, and\nfuse diagram with textual problem efficiently through structural-semantic\npre-training. For reasoning, we design an explicable solution program to\ndescribe the geometric reasoning process, and employ a self-limited decoder to\ngenerate solution program autoregressively. To reduce solution errors, a\nmulti-level theorem verifier is proposed to eliminate solutions that do not\nmatch geometric principles, alleviating the hallucination of the neural model.\nWe also construct a large-scale geometry problem dataset called PGPS9K,\ncontaining fine-grained annotations of textual clauses, solution program and\ninvolved knowledge tuples. Extensive experiments on datasets Geometry3K and\nPGPS9K show that our PGPSNet solver outperforms existing symbolic and neural\nsolvers in GPS performance, while maintaining good explainability and\nreliability, and the solver components (fusion, reasoning, verification) are\nall justified effective.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
