We\npredict the observed capacitance jump and the parallel metal-insulator\ntransition accompanied the BSCR transition. An experimental puzzle in shallow\nInAs QWs is the mobility drop at an electron density smaller than expected for\nthe bound-state second subband occupation. We explain this puzzle as a result\nof intersubband scattering involving a level-broadened continuum resonance,\nmediated by screened Coulomb impurities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
