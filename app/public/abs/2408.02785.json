The first one is that homotopy idempotents in the category of\npointed connected CW complexes split and the second one is that unpointed\nhomotopy idempotents in the category of finite-dimensional CW complexes split.\nSome of our proofs rectify gaps in the existing literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YqrolkpAwu3UJbLnmkRkIign-_pQw_KGgIdbkF2TAXU","pdfSize":"142977"}
