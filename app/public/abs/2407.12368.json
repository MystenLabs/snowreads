We\ncompare the use of a denaturing buffer including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)\nand a mild chaotropic solvent, water/ethanol, as eluent, on a model gluten\nsample. Through a thorough analysis of the data obtained from coupled light\nscattering detectors, and with the identification of molecular composition of\nthe eluted protein, we evidence co-elution events in several conditions. We\nshow that the focus step used in conventional AF4 with the SDS buffer leads to\nthe formation of aggregates that co-elute with monomeric proteins. By contrast,\na frit-inlet device enables the fractionation of individual wheat proteins in\nthe SDS buffer. Interestingly conventional AF4, using water/ethanol as eluent,\nis an effective method for fractionating gluten proteins and their complex\ndynamic assemblies which involve weak forces and are composed of both monomeric\nand polymeric proteins.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
