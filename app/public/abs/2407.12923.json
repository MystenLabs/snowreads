For full\nrank theories, they are related to odd self-dual lattices and are structurally\nof the same form as the critical non-supersymmetric theories. For dimensions up\nto 14 the associated moduli spaces are Coxeter polytopes already studied by\nVinberg and Kaplinskaya. In the heterotic string context, the Coxeter diagrams\nof these moduli spaces are related through transformations representing the\nprocess of dimension changing tachyon condensation of Hellerman-Swanson. For\ndimensions 8 and 6 respectively on $S^1$ and $T^2$ we show that at special\npoints in the moduli space the subcritical string is the CHS background for two\ncoincident NS5-branes and the intersection of two such pairs. These\nconfigurations are interpreted as an end result of condensing heterotic winding\ntachyons along one or two Scherck-Schwarz circles at self-dual radius. We give\nevidence that in the first case there is a T-duality between the pair of\nNS5-branes and a recently constructed non-supersymmetric heterotic 6-brane.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
