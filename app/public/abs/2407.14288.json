We find that for application to systems outside the scope of its\ntraining data, CHGNet\\cite{deng2023chgnet} has the potential to succeed out of\nthe box, but can also fail significantly in predicting the ground state\nconfiguration. We demonstrate that via fine-tuning or a $\\Delta$-learning\napproach it is possible to augment the overall performance of universal\npotentials for specific cluster and surface systems. We utilize this to\ninvestigate and explain experimentally observed defects in the Ag(111)-O\nsurface reconstruction and explain the mechanics behind its formation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B5u8pZP5sSkgG80Qb1Kl_8zj3-Tqtk_1BweWAk2qVw8","pdfSize":"5587639"}
