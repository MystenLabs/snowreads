However,existing methodologies\noften struggle to effectively harmonize dataset diversity with semantic\ncoordination.To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative augmentation\ntechnique leveraging pre-trained conditional diffusion models to mediate this\nbalance. Our approach encompasses the development of a Category Affinity\nMatrix, meticulously designed to enhance dataset diversity, and a Surrounding\nRegion Alignment strategy, which ensures the preservation of semantic\ncoordination in the augmented images. Extensive experimental evaluations\nconfirm the efficacy of our method in enriching dataset diversity while\nseamlessly maintaining semantic coordination. Our method yields substantial\naverage improvements of +1.4AP, +0.9AP, and +3.4AP over existing alternatives\non three distinct object detection models, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
