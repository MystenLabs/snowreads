The key idea is to build the quantum\ngates based on the particle distribution functions (PDF) within the coherence\ntime for qubits. Thus, both the operator and a state vector are linear\nfunctions of PDFs, and upon quantum state evolution, the resulting PDFs will\nhave quadraticity. To this end, we decompose the collision operator for a\n$DmQn$ lattice model into a product of $2(n+1)$ operators, where $n$ is the\nnumber of lattice velocity directions. After decomposition, the $(n+1)$\noperators with constant entries remain unchanged throughout the simulation,\nwhereas the remaining $(n+1)$ will be built based on the statevector of the\nprevious time step. Also, we show that such a decomposition is not unique.\nCompared to the second-order Carleman-linearized LB, the present approach\nreduces the circuit width by half and circuit depth by exponential order. The\nproposed algorithm has been verified through the one-dimensional flow\ndiscontinuity and two-dimensional Kolmogrov-like flow test cases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"cgF60FBirvbw75Q4vVuoBrtEhFv5Rl_A2q6_nr_U5xQ","pdfSize":"247217"}
