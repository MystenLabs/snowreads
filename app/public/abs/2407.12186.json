In this work, we show that with a sufficiently\nsample-efficient generative model, it is straightforward to directly optimize\nfor synthesizability using retrosynthesis models in goal-directed generation.\nUnder a heavily-constrained computational budget, our model can generate\nmolecules satisfying a multi-parameter drug discovery optimization task while\nbeing synthesizable, as deemed by the retrosynthesis model.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oJtSIUCGJSZu3YOHe5GJwAR76tr7-oXa-Ofkg1CUsok","pdfSize":"12905615"}
