In skill-based learning, learners need to understand the\nunderlying concepts and mechanisms of a skill to be able to apply it\neffectively. While videos are a common tool in online learning, they cannot\ncomprehend or assess the skills being taught. Additionally, while Generative AI\nmethods are effective in searching and retrieving answers from a text corpus,\nit remains unclear whether these methods exhibit any true understanding. This\nlimits their ability to provide explanations of skills or help with\nproblem-solving. This paper proposes a novel approach that merges Cognitive AI\nand Generative AI to address these challenges. We employ a structured knowledge\nrepresentation, the TMK (Task-Method-Knowledge) model, to encode skills taught\nin an online Knowledge-based AI course. Leveraging techniques such as Large\nLanguage Models, Chain-of-Thought, and Iterative Refinement, we outline a\nframework for generating reasoned explanations in response to learners'\nquestions about skills.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ycMUdhPL72e1iDgTnku2w86xDPBdBWdoHoFK3fmMM0o","pdfSize":"568866","objectId":"0xf5ea83388202a57345c7462b7849bcf3ede3305abfc49e148418c873b33f4a67","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
