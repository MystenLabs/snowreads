This allows us to prove several new embedding\nresults for groups. First, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically\ninto a boundedly acyclic group of type $F_n$ that has no proper finite index\nsubgroups. This improves a result of Bridson \\cite{Br98} and a theorem of\nFournier-Facio--L\\\"oh--Moraschini \\cite[Theorem 2]{FFCM21}. Second, every group\nof type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically into a $5$-uniformly perfect group of\ntype $F_n$. Third, using Belk--Zaremsky's construction of twisted\nBrin--Thompson groups, we show that every finitely generated group embeds\nquasi-isometrically into a finitely generated boundedly acyclic simple group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
