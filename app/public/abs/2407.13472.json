A\nphenomenon that has puzzled generations of scientists in this field is the\nso-called anomalous hydrogen evolution: the violent dissolution of magnesium\nunder electron-rich (anodic) conditions, accompanied by strong hydrogen\nevolution, and a key mechanism hampering Mg technology. Experimental studies\nhave indicated the presence of univalent Mg$^+$ in solution, but these findings\nhave been largely ignored because they defy our common chemical understanding\nand evaded direct experimental observation. Using recent advances in the\n\\emph{ab initio} description of solid-liquid electrochemical interfaces under\ncontrolled potential conditions, we described the full reaction path of Mg atom\ndissolution from a kinked Mg surface under anodic conditions. Our study reveals\nthe formation of a solvated [Mg$^{2+}$(OH)$^-$]$^+$ ion complex, challenging\nthe conventional assumption of Mg$^{2+}$ ion. This insight provides an\nintuitive explanation for the postulated presence of (coulombically) univalent\nMg$^+$ ions and the absence of protective oxide/hydroxide layers normally\nformed under anodic/oxidizing conditions. The discovery of this unexpected and\nunconventional reaction mechanism is crucial for identifying new strategies for\ncorrosion prevention and can be transferred to other metals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
