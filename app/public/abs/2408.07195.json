Balanced signed graphs are those in which all cycles contain an even\nnumber of positive edges. In the adjacency matrix of a signed graph, entries\ncan be $0$, $-1$, or $1$, depending on whether $ij$ represents no edge, a\nnegative edge, or a positive edge, respectively. The index of the adjacency\nmatrix of a signed graph $\\dot{G}$ is less or equal to the index of the\nadjacency matrix of its underlying graph $G$, i.e., $\\lambda_1(\\dot{G}) \\le\n\\lambda_1(G)$. Indeed, if $\\dot{G}$ is balanced, then\n$\\lambda_1(\\dot{G})=\\lambda_1(G)$. This inequality becomes strict when\n$\\dot{G}$ is an unbalanced signed graph. Recently, Brunetti and Stani\\'c found\nthe whole list of unbalanced signed graphs on $n$ vertices with maximum (resp.\nminimum) spectral radius. To our knowledge, there has been little research on\nthis problem when unbalanced signed graphs are confined to specific graph\nclasses. In this article, we demonstrate that there is only one unbalanced\nsigned bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with maximum spectral radius, up to an\noperation on the signed edges known as switching. Additionally, we investigate\nunbalanced signed complete bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices with a bounded\nnumber of edges and maximum spectral radius, where the negative edges induce a\ntree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
