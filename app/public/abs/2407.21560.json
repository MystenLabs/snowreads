However, existing approaches often overlook issues\nof category semantic inclusion and overlap, as well as inherent structural\npatterns within the target sequence. This study introduces a generative\nsentiment analysis model. To address the challenges related to category\nsemantic inclusion and overlap, a latent category distribution variable is\nintroduced. By reconstructing the input of a variational autoencoder, the model\nlearns the intensity of the relationship between categories and text, thereby\nimproving sequence generation. Additionally, a trie data structure and\nconstrained decoding strategy are utilized to exploit structural patterns,\nwhich in turn reduces the search space and regularizes the generation process.\nExperimental results on the Restaurant-ACOS and Laptop-ACOS datasets\ndemonstrate a significant performance improvement compared to baseline models.\nAblation experiments further confirm the effectiveness of latent category\ndistribution and constrained decoding strategy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
