{"id":"2407.05187","title":"Dimension dependence of factorization problems: Haar system Hardy spaces","authors":"Thomas Speckhofer","authorsParsed":[["Speckhofer","Thomas",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2024 21:19:59 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-09","timestamp":1720300799000,"abstract":"  For $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$, let $Y_n$ denote the linear span of the first $n+1$\nlevels of the Haar system in a Haar system Hardy space $Y$ (this class contains\nall separable rearrangement-invariant function spaces and also related spaces\nsuch as dyadic $H^1$). Let $I_{Y_n}$ denote the identity operator on $Y_n$. We\nprove the following quantitative factorization result: Fix\n$\\Gamma,\\delta,\\varepsilon > 0$, and let $n,N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be chosen such\nthat $N \\ge Cn^2$, where $C = C(\\Gamma,\\delta,\\varepsilon) > 0$ (this amounts\nto a quasi-polynomial dependence between $\\dim Y_N$ and $\\dim Y_n$). Then for\nevery linear operator $T\\colon Y_N\\to Y_N$ with $\\|T\\|\\le \\Gamma$, there exist\noperators $A,B$ with $\\|A\\|\\|B\\|\\le 2(1+\\varepsilon)$ such that either $I_{Y_n}\n= ATB$ or $I_{Y_n} = A(I_{Y_N} - T)B$. Moreover, if $T$ has $\\delta$-large\npositive diagonal with respect to the Haar system, then we have $I_{Y_n} = ATB$\nfor some $A,B$ with $\\|A\\|\\|B\\|\\le (1+\\varepsilon)/\\delta$. If the Haar system\nis unconditional in $Y$, then an inequality of the form $N \\ge Cn$ is\nsufficient for the above statements to hold (hence, $\\dim Y_N$ depends\npolynomially on $\\dim Y_n$). Finally, we prove an analogous result in the case\nwhere $T$ has large but not necessarily positive diagonal entries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
