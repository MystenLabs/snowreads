One can loosely regard this problem as a higher-dimensional analogue\nof establishing uniform bounds for the size of a sublevel set of a function in\nterms of the size of its derivatives. The resulting theorem relies extensively\non ideas from Geometric Invariant Theory to understand what appropriate\nderivative bounds look like in this context. Several examples and applications\nare presented, including a new local characterization of so-called \"model\"\nRadon-like transforms in terms of the semistability of a natural curvature\nfunctional (giving an equivalent but rather different criterion than the one\nfirst established in arXiv:2303.03325).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
