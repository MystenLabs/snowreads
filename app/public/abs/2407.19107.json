The SGBH equation is a\ndiffusion-convection-reaction type equation which consists a nonlinearity of\npolynomial order, and we take into account of an infinite-dimensional noise\nhaving a coefficient that has linear growth. We first prove the CLT which\nallows us to establish the convergence of the distribution of the solution to a\nre-scaled SGBH equation to a desired distribution function. Furthermore, we\nextend our asymptotic analysis by investigating the MDP for the SGBH equation.\nUsing the weak convergence method, we establish the MDP and derive the\ncorresponding rate function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
