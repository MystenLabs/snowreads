It is based upon a\nrigorous stochastic calculus derivation of the optimal hedging portfolio,\noptimal option price, and the corresponding equivalent martingale measure\nthrough the means of the Stackelberg game approach. A deep learning algorithm\nbased on the combination of the feedforward and LSTM neural networks is tested\non three different market models, two of which are incomplete. In contrast, the\ncomplete market Black-Scholes model serves as a benchmark for the algorithm's\nperformance. The results that indicate the algorithm's good performance are\npresented and discussed.\n  In particular, we apply our results to the special incomplete market model\nstudied by Merton and give a detailed comparison between our results based on\nthe minimal variance principle and the results obtained by Merton based on a\ndifferent pricing principle. Using deep learning, we find that the minimal\nvariance principle leads to typically higher option prices than those deduced\nfrom the Merton principle. On the other hand, the minimal variance principle\nleads to lower losses than the Merton principle.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
