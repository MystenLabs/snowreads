We provide criteria for these series to belong to\nthe specific subclasses. The primary goal of this investigation is to derive\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the Mittag-Leffler-type Poisson\ndistribution series $\\mathcal{P}(p,u,v)(z)$ to be included in the classes\n$\\mathcal{S}(\\delta,\\eta,\\tau)$ and $\\mathcal{R}(\\delta,\\eta,\\tau)$. These\nfindings enhance our understanding of the structural properties of univalent\nfunctions and extend the applicability of Mittag-Leffler-type distributions in\ncomplex analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
