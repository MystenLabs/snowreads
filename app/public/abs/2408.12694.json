In\nparallel, social science theory suggests that personal values - the abstract\ngoals that guide our decisions and behaviors - play an important role in\ncommunication: we share what is important to us to coordinate efforts, solve\nproblems and meet challenges. Thus, the values communicated in song lyrics may\nbe similar or different to those of the listener, and by extension affect the\nlistener's reaction to the song. This suggests that working towards automated\nestimation of values in lyrics may assist in downstream MIR tasks, in\nparticular, personalization. However, as highly subjective text, song lyrics\npresent a challenge in terms of sampling songs to be annotated, annotation\nmethods, and in choosing a method for aggregation. In this project, we take a\nperspectivist approach, guided by social science theory, to gathering\nannotations, estimating their quality, and aggregating them. We then compare\naggregated ratings to estimates based on pre-trained sentence/word embedding\nmodels by employing a validated value dictionary. We discuss conceptually\n'fuzzy' solutions to sampling and annotation challenges, promising initial\nresults in annotation quality and in automated estimations, and future\ndirections.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
