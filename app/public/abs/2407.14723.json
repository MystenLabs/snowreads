The project focuses\non addressing the significant challenge of polarization leakage in vector\nvortex coronagraphs (VVCs). We utilize newly manufactured multi-grating,\nliquid-crystal VVCs, consisting of a two- or three-element stack of vortex and\ngrating patterns, to reduce this leakage to the $10^{-10}$ contrast level. We\ndetail the experimental setups, including calibration techniques with\npolarization microscopes and Mueller matrix ellipsometers to enhance the\ndirect-write accuracy of the liquid-crystal patterns. The performance testing\nof these coronagraph masks will be conducted on the THD2 high-contrast imaging\ntestbed in Paris.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
