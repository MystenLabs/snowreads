While industrial motion capture systems with complex camera arrays or\nexpensive wearable sensors have been widely adopted in movie and game\nproduction, consumer-affordable and easy-to-use solutions for personal\napplications are still far from mature. To utilize a mixture of a monocular\ncamera and very few inertial measurement units (IMUs) for accurate multi-modal\nhuman motion capture in daily life, we contribute MINIONS in this paper, a\nlarge-scale Motion capture dataset collected from INertial and visION Sensors.\nMINIONS has several featured properties: 1) large scale of over five million\nframes and 400 minutes duration; 2) multi-modality data of IMUs signals and RGB\nvideos labeled with joint positions, joint rotations, SMPL parameters, etc.; 3)\na diverse set of 146 fine-grained single and interactive actions with textual\ndescriptions. With the proposed MINIONS, we conduct experiments on multi-modal\nmotion capture and explore the possibilities of consumer-affordable motion\ncapture using a monocular camera and very few IMUs. The experiment results\nemphasize the unique advantages of inertial and vision sensors, showcasing the\npromise of consumer-affordable multi-modal motion capture and providing a\nvaluable resource for further research and development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
