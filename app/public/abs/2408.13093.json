The\nexotic vector $X(4630)$ is assigned as the diquark-antidiquark state\n$[cs][\\overline{cs}]$ with spin-parity $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$. Employing the two-point\nQCD sum rule approach up to the sixth order of the operator dimension by\nincluding non-perturbative contribution, we calculate the mass and decay\nconstant of $X(4630)$ at $T\\neq0$. The numerical analyses demonstrate that the\nvalues of the mass and decay constant of $X(4630)$ near the deconfinement\ntemperature decrease up to $9.8\\%$ and $60\\%$ of their vacuum values. At\n$T\\rightarrow0$, the obtained results for the mass $m_{X(4630)}=(4649\\pm40)$\nMeV and decay constant $\\lambda_{X(4630)}=(10.07\\pm0.8)\\times10^{-3} $ MeV are\nin excellent agreement with the results reported by LHCb experiments and other\ntheoretical predictions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cwcnwYP8ZrtM7yjDn1PgZgk16tQgVkllFvMv1hvbz7g","pdfSize":"334036"}
