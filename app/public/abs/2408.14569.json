Wang $\\textit{et al}$. J. Chem. Phys.\n$\\textbf{153}$, 184102 (2020)], we generalize the theory of molecular emission\npower spectra from single molecules to multichromophoric systems in the\nframework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. This generalized theory is\napplicable to ensembles of molecules in arbitrary inhomogeneous, dispersive,\nand absorbing media. In the far-field region, the emission power spectra can be\ndecomposed into products of \\textit{electromagnetic environment factors} and\n\\textit{lineshape functions}. To demonstrate the polaritonic effect on\nmultichromophoric systems, we numerically simulate the emission power spectra\nof one to three molecules above a silver surface. The peak position redshifts\nas the number of the molecules increases, consistent with Kasha's model.\nHowever, surprisingly, the peak height does not increase with the number of\nmolecules. To understand this unusual phenomenon, we derive analytical\nexpressions for lineshape functions and find that the peak heights are\nassociated to the imaginary part of dipole-dipole interactions, which stem from\nthe absorption of the silver surface. It is worth noting that our theory not\nonly covers the key results derived from Kasha's model, but also can predict\nthe lineshape functions of molecules in complex dielectric environments. This\nstudy offers one alternative approach to directly analyze the hybrid-state\ndynamics of multichromophoric systems coupled with polariton.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
