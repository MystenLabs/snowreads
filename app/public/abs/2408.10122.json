Focusing on\nspecific examples, we show how such modifications can induce characteristic\nlocalised distortions, bumps, in the frequency profile of the stochastic\ngravitational wave background emitted from distant binary sources. We\nconcentrate on gravitational waves at nano-Hertz frequencies probed by pulsar\ntiming arrays, and we forecast the capabilities of future experiments to\naccurately probe parameters controlling modified dispersion relations. Our\npredictions are based on properties of gravitational waves emitted in the first\ninspiral phase of the binary process, and do not rely on assumptions of\nnon-linear effects occurring during the binary merging phase\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
