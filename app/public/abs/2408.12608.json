These interfaces capture rich\ninformation about neural dynamics that call for efficient, real-time processing\nalgorithms to spontaneously extract and interpret patterns of neural dynamics.\nMoreover, being able to do so in a fully unsupervised manner is critical as\npatterns in vast streams of neural data might not be easily identifiable by the\nhuman eye. Formal Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have come a long way in\nperforming pattern recognition tasks for various static and sequential pattern\nrecognition applications. However, these networks usually require large labeled\ndatasets for training and have high power consumption preventing their future\nembedding in active brain implants. An alternative aimed at addressing these\nissues are Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) which are neuromorphic and use more\nbiologically plausible neurons with evolving membrane potentials. In this\ncontext, we introduce here a frugal single-layer SNN designed for fully\nunsupervised identification and classification of multivariate temporal\npatterns in continuous data with a sequential approach. We show that, with only\na handful number of neurons, this strategy is efficient to recognize highly\noverlapping multivariate temporal patterns, first on simulated data, and then\non Mel Cepstral representations of speech sounds and finally on multichannel\nneural data. This approach relies on several biologically inspired plasticity\nrules, including Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), Short-term\nplasticity (STP) and intrinsic plasticity (IP). These results pave the way\ntowards highly frugal SNNs for fully unsupervised and online-compatible\nlearning of complex multivariate temporal patterns for future embedding in\ndedicated very-low power hardware.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BlPL69WPddNAAubl3c1sFnLmRfQ8JZyOVRqJh4v_ypE","pdfSize":"1438625"}
