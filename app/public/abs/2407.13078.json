Existing methods like CNNs,\nRNNs, GCNs, and Transformers have limitations in capturing long-range\ndependencies and temporal causality. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel TAL architecture leveraging the Selective State Space Model (S6). Our\napproach integrates the Feature Aggregated Bi-S6 block, Dual Bi-S6 structure,\nand a recurrent mechanism to enhance temporal and channel-wise dependency\nmodeling without increasing parameter complexity. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results with mAP scores of\n74.2% on THUMOS-14, 42.9% on ActivityNet, 29.6% on FineAction, and 45.8% on\nHACS. Ablation studies validate our method's effectiveness, showing that the\nDual structure in the Stem module and the recurrent mechanism outperform\ntraditional approaches. Our findings demonstrate the potential of S6-based\nmodels in TAL tasks, paving the way for future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
