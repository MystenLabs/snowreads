Human teaching, where an operator\nphysically interacts with the robot to demonstrate a new task, is a promising\nstrategy to quickly and intuitively reconfigure the production line. However,\nphysical guidance during task execution poses challenges in terms of both\noperator safety and system usability. In this paper, we solve this issue by\ndesigning a variable impedance control strategy that regulates the interaction\nwith the environment and the physical demonstrations, explicitly preventing at\nthe same time passivity violations. We derive constraints to limit not only the\nexchanged energy with the environment but also the exchanged power, resulting\nin smoother interactions. By monitoring the energy flow between the robot and\nthe environment, we are able to distinguish between disturbances (to be\nrejected) and physical guidance (to be accomplished), enabling smooth and\ncontrolled transitions from teaching to execution and vice versa. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is validated in wiping tasks with a real\nrobotic manipulator.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
