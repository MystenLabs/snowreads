However, rarely do we\ncollectively explore the challenges and failures we experience within PD and\ndigital civics, to enable us to grow as a community. This workshop will explore\nreal-world experiences that had to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Through\ncase presentations and thematic group discussions, participants will reflect on\nthe challenges faced, the causes that led to these challenges, and\ncollaboratively problem-solve effective solutions. Furthermore, we aim to\ndiscuss well-being impact on researchers and communities when faced with these\nobstacles, the strategies participants use to overcome them and how this can be\nfed back into the digital civics community. By that, the workshop seeks to\nfoster dialogue, reflection, and collective learning, empowering participants\nwith insights to navigate complexities effectively and promote resilient design\npractices in digital civics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
