By identifying\nconceptual gaps in the literature and existing reviews, we devise a taxonomy\ngrounded on the inductive bias of neural imputation frameworks, resulting in a\nclassification of existing deep imputation strategies based on their\nsuitability for specific imputation scenarios and data-specific properties. Our\nreview further examines the existing methodologies employed to benchmark deep\nimputation models, evaluating their effectiveness in capturing the missingness\nscenarios found in clinical data and emphasising the importance of reconciling\nmathematical abstraction with clinical insights. Our classification aims to\nserve as a guide for researchers to facilitate the selection of appropriate\ndeep learning imputation techniques tailored to their specific clinical data.\nOur novel perspective also highlights the significance of bridging the gap\nbetween computational methodologies and medical insights to achieve clinically\nsound imputation models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
