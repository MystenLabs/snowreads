Arguments are given in the literature claiming that this\nbizarre hypothesis needs to be considered seriously, that all of our data about\nthe past is actually a mirage. We point to a difficulty in these arguments.\nThey are based on the dynamical laws and on statistical arguments, but they\ndisregard the fact that we infer the dynamical laws presupposing the\nreliability of our data records about the past. Hence the reasoning in favor of\nthe Boltzmann brain hypothesis contradicts itself, relying on the reliability\nof our data about the past to conclude that that data is wrong. More broadly,\nit is based on incomplete evidence. Incomplete evidence notoriously leads to\nfalse conclusions.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-32i_f_qkJBL739uvuXnh_bWKCC5ppxWTAU2W0MQhtI","pdfSize":"242565"}
