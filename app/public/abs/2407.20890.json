We classify vast families of these shift operators, including the\nones generated by orthogonal, diagonalizable, rotation or hyperbolic matrices.\nand this classification yields verifiable conditions which we use to construct\nconcrete examples of shift operators with a variety of dynamical properties. As\na consequence, we show that, for large classes of shift operators, generalized\nhyperbolicity is equivalent to the shadowing property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
