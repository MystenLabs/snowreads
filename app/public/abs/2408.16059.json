In the mechanism limit, these\nmetamaterials consist of rigid bodies connected by ideal hinges that deform at\nzero energy cost. However, fabrication of structures in this limit has remained\nelusive. Here, we demonstrate that the fabrication and integration of textile\nhinges provides a scalable platform for creating large structured metamaterials\nwith mechanism-like behaviors. Further, leveraging recently introduced\nkinematic optimization tools, we demonstrate that textile hinges enable extreme\nshape-morphing responses, paving the way for the development of the next\ngeneration of mechanism-based metamaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
