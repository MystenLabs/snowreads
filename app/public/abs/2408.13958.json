In the United States,\nmore than 15.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, with 96% of\nindividuals living with at least one other chronic health condition. It is the\n4th leading cause of death in the country. Over 2.2 million patients are\nadmitted to hospitals annually due to COPD exacerbations. Monitoring and\npredicting patient exacerbations on-time could save their life. This paper\npresents two different predictive models to predict COPD exacerbation using AI\nand natural language processing (NLP) approaches. These models use respiration\nsummary notes, symptoms, and vital signs. To train and test these models, data\nrecords containing physiologic signals and vital signs time series were used.\nThese records were captured from patient monitors and comprehensive clinical\ndata obtained from hospital medical information systems for tens of thousands\nof Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. We achieved an area under the Receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.82 in detection and prediction of\nCOPD exacerbation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
