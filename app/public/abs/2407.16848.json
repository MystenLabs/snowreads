Traditionally, one has to use\nseveral different measurement techniques to measure critical parameters\nseparately. In this work, we develop the use of a single species of quantum\nsensor to determine and estimate several critical parameters with the help of\nindependent simulation data. We utilize the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in the\ndiamond, which recently emerged as a promising candidate for probing exotic\nfeatures in condensed matter physics. The non-invasive and highly stable nature\nprovides extraordinary opportunities to solve scientific problems in various\nsystems. Using a high-quality single-crystalline YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{4}$O$_{8}$\n(YBCO) as a platform, we demonstrate the use of diamond particles and a bulk\ndiamond to probe the Meissner effect. The evolution of the vector magnetic\nfield, the $H-T$ phase diagram, and the map of fluorescence contour are studied\nvia NV sensing. Our results reveal different critical parameters, including\nlower critical field $H_{c1}$, upper critical field $H_{c2}$, and critical\ncurrent density $j_{c}$, as well as verifying the unconventional nature of this\nhigh-temperature superconductor YBCO. Therefore, NV-based quantum sensing\ntechniques have huge potential in condensed matter research.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
