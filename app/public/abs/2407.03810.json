The present\nweighted average of its branching ratio measurements amounts to (3.34 \\pm 0.27)\nx 10^-9, which remains in good agreement with the theoretical prediction of\n(3.64 \\pm 0.12) x 10^-9 within the Standard Model. In the present paper, we\nreview calculations that have contributed to this prediction, and discuss the\nassociated uncertainties.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
