We show\nthat this spectrum lifts the generating family homology groups. When the\ngenerating family extends to a generating family for an embedded Lagrangian\nfilling, we lift the Seidel isomorphism to the spectrum level. As applications,\nwe establish topological constraints on Lagrangian fillings arising from\ngenerating families, algebraic constraints on whether generating families admit\nfillings, and lower bounds on how many fiber dimensions are needed to construct\na generating family for a Legendrian.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
