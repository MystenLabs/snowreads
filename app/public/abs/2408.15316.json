Working at a purely geometric level,\nwe describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic\nspace naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar\n''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is\ndescribed by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that\ndiscretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of\nthese local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the\nrefinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a\ndetailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on\nglobal issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary\ndata, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a\nstack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and\nof the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible\nway. In the $\\{3,5,3\\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular\nicosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold\nsymmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related\nconjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for\nfuture analytic and numerical studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
