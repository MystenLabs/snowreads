Conformal representation is discussed. There\nis a temperature/pressure singularity and a corresponding scalar curvature\nsingularity at the horizon. The expanding singular horizon ultimately bounds\nthe entire space-time manifold. It is is preceded by an expanding light front,\nwhich separates the space-time affected by the singularity from that which is\nnot yet affected. An appropriately located observer in front of the light front\ncan have a Hubble-Lema\\^itre constant that is consistent with that currently\nobserved.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
