These foregrounds, typically\nconfined to a wedge-shaped region in Fourier space, often necessitate the\nremoval of a vast majority of modes, thereby degrading the quality of the data\nanisotropically. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep\ngenerative model based on stochastic interpolants to reconstruct the 21-cm data\nlost to wedge filtering. Our method leverages the non-Gaussian nature of the\n21-cm signal to effectively map wedge-filtered 3D lightcones to samples from\nthe conditional distribution of wedge-recovered lightcones. We demonstrate how\nour method is able to restore spatial information effectively, considering both\nvarying cosmological initial conditions and astrophysics. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss a number of future avenues where this approach could be applied in\nanalyses of the 21-cm signal, potentially offering new opportunities to improve\nour understanding of the Universe during the epochs of cosmic dawn and\nreionization.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
