We describe the asymptotics\nfor finite Toeplitz matrices, finite Toeplitz plus Hankel matrices and\ngeneralizations of these, and also finite sections of functions of Toeplitz\noperators, all with smooth matrix-valued symbols. Many of these results are\nwell-known. However, the results for certain Toeplitz plus Hankel operators\nwith matrix-valued symbol are presented for the first time and the result for\nthe finite sections of functions of Toeplitz operators is new.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
