We show that the link of a vertex in\n$T_{k,q}$ is the reduced order complexes of the product of chains and determine\nthe number of combinatorially different links of all vertices of $T_{k,q}$. The\ncombinatorial type of the link of an $s$-dimensional face of $T_{k,q}$\ncorresponds to the partition $(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_s)$ of $k$\ninto $s$ parts and further partitions of each $\\lambda_i$. We introduce a new\npermutation statistic (the faithful initial part) and use it to describe the\nfacets of the star cluster of a facet of $T_{k,q}$. Using a concrete shelling\nwe show that the $i$-th entry of $h$-vector of the star cluster counts the\nnumber of permutations from $\\mathbb{S}_k$ with exactly $i$ descents, taking\ninto account the faithful initial part as the multiplicity. Finally, we\ndescribe a concrete shelling order for $T_{k,q}$, obtain a combinatorial\ninterpretation and find a concrete formula for its $h$-vector.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FaGkGDNbD9hNVV2BBs3KCg9SOPd05F-jZ7wQVqp9BZg","pdfSize":"315968"}
