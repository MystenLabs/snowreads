A recently\nproposed generalization of contraction theory, called $k$-contraction, is a\npromising approach for analyzing the asymptotic behaviour of multistationary\nsystems. In particular, all bounded trajectories of a time-invariant\n2-contracting system converge to an equilibrium point, but the system may have\nmultiple equilibrium points where more than one is locally stable. An important\nchallenge is to study $k$-contraction in large-scale interconnected systems.\nInspired by a recent small-gain theorem for 2-contraction by Angeli et al., we\nderive a new sufficient condition for 2-contraction of a feedback\ninterconnection of two nonlinear dynamical systems. Our condition is based on\n(i) deriving new formulas for the 2-multiplicative [2-additive] compound of\nblock matrices using block Kronecker products [sums], (ii) a hierarchical\napproach for proving standard contraction, and (iii) a network small-gain\ntheorem for Metzler matrices. We demonstrate our results by deriving a simple\nsufficient condition for 2-contraction in a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
