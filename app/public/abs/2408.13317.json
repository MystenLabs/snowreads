A natural strategy is to use the Fock basis to encode\ninformation in qudits. One can perform quantum operations on the cavity mode\nqudit by coupling the system to a non-linear ancillary transmon qubit. However,\nthe performance of the cavity-transmon device is limited by the noisy\ntransmons. It is, therefore, important to develop practical benchmarking tools\nfor these qudit systems in an algorithm-agnostic manner. We gauge the\nperformance of these qudit platforms using sampling tests such as the Heavy\nOutput Generation (HOG) test as well as the linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark\n(XEB), by way of simulations of such a system subject to realistic dominant\nnoise channels. We use selective number-dependent arbitrary phase and\nunconditional displacement gates as our universal gateset. Our results show\nthat contemporary transmons comfortably enable controlling a few tens of Fock\nlevels of a cavity mode. This framework allows benchmarking even higher\ndimensional qudits as those become accessible with improved transmons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
