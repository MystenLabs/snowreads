Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order\nin their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous\nlocalized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are\ntrivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire\nHamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going\nthrough a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases\nwith short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called\nquantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to\nthat of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and\nquasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases\nwithin the same framework as static phases. The QCA framework further\ngeneralizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases), and provides\na large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators.\nIn systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the\nclassification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in\nthe literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial\nground states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
