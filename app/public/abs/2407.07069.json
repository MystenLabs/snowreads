We\nadapt our recent results for $m>1$ to show that when $H$ has a threshold\neigenvalue the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\\mathbb R^n)$ for the natural\nrange $1\\leq p<\\frac{n}{2m}$ in both even and odd dimensions. The approach used\nworks without distinguishing even and odd cases, and matches the range of\nboundedness in the classical case when $m=1$. The proof applies in the\nclassical $m=1$ case as well and simplifies the argument.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
