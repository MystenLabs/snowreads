First, we revisit a shape optimization\nreformulation of a prototypical shape inverse problem and briefly propose a\nsimple yet efficient numerical approach for solving the minimization problem.\nSecond, we examine the existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence of a\nclassical solution to a Hele-Shaw-like system, derived from the continuous\nsetting of a numerical discretization of the shape optimization reformulation\nfor the shape inverse problem. The analysis is based on the methods developed\nby G. I. Bizhanova and V. A. Solonnikov in \"On Free Boundary Problems for\nSecond Order Parabolic Equations\" (Algebra Anal. 12 (6) (2000) 98-139) and also\nby V. A.
