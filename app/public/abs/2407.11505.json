Recognizing the\nlimitations of traditional physical model-based methods and the inefficiencies\nof current attention-based solutions, we propose a new dehazing network\ncombining an innovative Haze-Aware Attention Module (HAAM) with a Multiscale\nFrequency Enhancement Module (MFEM). The HAAM is inspired by the atmospheric\nscattering model, thus skillfully integrating physical principles into\nhigh-dimensional features for targeted dehazing. It picks up on latent features\nduring the image restoration process, which gives a significant boost to the\nmetrics, while the MFEM efficiently enhances high-frequency details, thus\nsidestepping wavelet or Fourier transform complexities. It employs multiscale\nfields to extract and emphasize key frequency components with minimal parameter\noverhead. Integrated into a simple U-Net framework, our Haze-Aware Attention\nNetwork (HAA-Net) for single-image dehazing significantly outperforms existing\nattention-based and transformer models in efficiency and effectiveness. Tested\nacross various public datasets, the HAA-Net sets new performance benchmarks.\nOur work not only advances the field of image dehazing but also offers insights\ninto the design of attention mechanisms for broader applications in computer\nvision.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
