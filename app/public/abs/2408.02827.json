While our semiclassical Boltzmann approach reveals the\nexistence of electro-optic effects induced by the Berry curvature dipole of\nBloch electrons, we also find a wealth of alternative electro-optic effects\noriginating from the interplay between Berry curvature and magnetic moment. In\nparticular, our symmetry analysis indicates the existence of a magnetoelectric\nelectro-optic effect, derived from the simultaneous presence of Berry curvature\nand magnetic moment, that requires either time-reversal or inversion symmetry\nbreaking. The revealed conductivity coefficients are explicitly written and we\nderive the tensor shape describing such alternative electromagnetic responses\nfor chiral materials pertaining to space groups 152 and 198.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
