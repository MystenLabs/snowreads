But the extreme pressures required for\nthe metallization of hydrogen-based superconductors limit their applications.\nHere, we have designed a series of high-temperature perovskite hydrides that\ncan be stable within 10 GPa. Our research covered 182 ternary systems and\nultimately determined that 9 compounds were stable within 20 GPa, of which 5\nexhibited superconducting transition temperatures exceeding 120 K within 10\nGPa. Excitingly, KGaH3 and CsInH3 are thermodynamically stable at 50 GPa. Among\nthese perovskite hydrides, alkali metals are responsible for providing a fixed\namount of charge and maintaining structural stability, while the cubic\nframework formed by IIIA group elements and hydrogen is crucial for\nhigh-temperature superconductivity. This work will inspire further experimental\nexploration and take an important step in the exploration of low-pressure\nstable high-temperature superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
