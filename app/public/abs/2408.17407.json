To achieve a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR) in PG\n2130+099, we continued an ongoing high-cadence RM monitoring campaign using the\nCalar Alto Observatory 2.2m optical telescope for an extra four years from 2019\nto 2022. We measured the time lags of several broad emission lines (including\nHe II, He I, H$\\beta$, and Fe II) with respect to the 5100 {\\AA} continuum, and\ntheir time lags continuously vary through the years. Especially, the H$\\beta$\ntime lags exhibited approximately a factor of two increase in the last two\nyears. Additionally, the velocity-resolved time delays of the broad H$\\beta$\nemission line reveal a back-and-forth change between signs of virial motion and\ninflow in the BLR. The combination of negligible ($\\sim$10%) continuum change\nand substantial time-lag variation (over two times) results in significant\nscatter in the intrinsic $R_{\\rm H\\beta}-L_{\\rm 5100}$ relationship for PG\n2130+099. Taking into account the consistent changes in the continuum\nvariability time scale and the size of the BLR, we tentatively propose that the\nchanges in the measurement of the BLR size may be affected by 'geometric\ndilution'.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
