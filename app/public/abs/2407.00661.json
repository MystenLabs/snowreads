However, after calculating the phonon-phonon interactions of 128\nHalf-Heusler materials by high-throughput, we find that the acoustic phonon\nbandwidth dominates the three-phonon and four-phonon scattering channels and\nkeeps them roughly in a co-increasing or decreasing behavior. The $aao$ and\n$aaa$ three-phonon scattering channels in Half-Heusler materials are weakly\naffected by the acoustic-optical gap and acoustic bunched features respectively\nonly when acoustic phonon bandwidths are close. Finally, we found that\nHalf-Heusler materials with smaller acoustic bandwidths tend to have a more\npronounced four-phonon effect, although three-phonon scattering may not be\nsignificantly suppressed at this time.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
