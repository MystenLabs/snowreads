It was conjectured\nin~\\cite{abdesselam2023log} that $A(p, n, k)$ is log-concave with respect to\n$k$ for every $p\\geq 2, n\\geq 3$, and the log-concavity was proved in\n``$p=\\infty$\" case. In this paper, we prove that for $k=n-\\alpha$, the\nlog-concavity for $A(p, n, k)$ holds for every $p\\geq 2$ for sufficiently large\n$n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
