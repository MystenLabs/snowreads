Specifically, we first construct the model in a\ncontinuous form, study its dynamical properties, and formulate the financial\nquantities involved in our insurance. Subsequently, we discretise the model\nusing the forward Euler method, study the dynamical properties of the resulting\ndiscrete model, and formulate discrete analogues of the above financial\nquantities. We conduct a numerical simulation using two sets of parameter\nvalues, each representing a disease-free and an endemic scenario, which reveals\nthat in the latter scenario, the insurance's gross premium is higher, the\ninsurer's minimum loss-preventing start-up capital is lower, and the insurer's\ntotal profit is higher, compared to the corresponding values in the former\nscenario. Finally, through a sensitivity analysis, we show that in both\nscenarios, the disease's basic reproduction number, the gross premium, the\nminimum start-up capital, and the total profit depend most sensitively on the\npopulation's natural death coefficient, the disease's incidence coefficient,\nthe hospitalisation benefit, and the premium surcharge percentage allocated to\nprofit, respectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
