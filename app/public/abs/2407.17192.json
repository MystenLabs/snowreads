The interplay of\nvarious fields and couplings can influence the production rate, potentially\novershadowing the effect of electrons alone. The plasma mixing, which induces\nthe resonance and screening of scalar processes, is shown to be modified by the\nin-medium effects depending on the type of processes and field contents.\nIncorporating these in-medium effects into the analysis of stellar cooling via\nscalar emission allows for the emergence of various features of multi-field\neffects given in several types of scalar models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
