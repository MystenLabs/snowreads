Working on three\nfixed points for modulus, we discuss predictions of the model and show the\nallowed points satisfying the cosmological bound on neutrino mass from both CMB\nand CMB+BAO data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"r_IQQerqQdJcb5jDg7ZMToevcm8JMQl5V5_nOyE_PH8","pdfSize":"1015101"}
