The\nexperimentally unexplored plasma conditions in SPARC will require a carefully\nselected set of diagnostics for plasma monitoring and control. Here we explore\nconceptual design options and potential measurement capabilities of a\ncollective Thomson scattering diagnostic at SPARC. We show that a 140 GHz\nX-mode CTS system is the most attractive option in terms of optimizing the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and limiting sensitivity to refraction, as well as from a\ntechnological readiness perspective. Such a setup can provide core-localized\nmeasurements of the fusion -born alpha distribution function, main-ion\ntemperature and toroidal rotation, fuel-ion ratio, and 3He content with\nrelevant spatio-temporal resolution. Our proposed diagnostic layout can in\nprinciple be integrated into SPARC and could provide a valuable addition to its\ndiagnostic suite at limited development costs and time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Uf9-JQ-5TXZ6g1W77bVI9HddoMpa9o94OMqfFTWUKD8","pdfSize":"910552"}
