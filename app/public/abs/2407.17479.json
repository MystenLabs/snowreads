We launched the #Somos600M Project\nbecause the diversity of the languages from LATAM, the Caribbean and Spain\nneeds to be represented in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Despite being\nthe 7.5% of the world population, there is no open dataset to instruction-tune\nlarge language models (LLMs), nor a leaderboard to evaluate and compare them.\nIn this paper, we present how we have created as an international open-source\ncommunity the first versions of the instruction and evaluation datasets,\nindispensable resources for the advancement of Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) in our languages.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
