The SFRs located at the tangent to the 3-5 kpc rings might be\nparticularly relevant to NPS. A multi-temperature mixture of gaseous components\nand cosmic rays rises above the Galactic disk under the action of their initial\nmomentum and buoyancy. Eventually, the plume velocity becomes equal to that of\nthe ambient gas, which rotates with different angular speed than the stars in\nthe disk. As a result, the plumes acquire characteristic bent shapes. An ad hoc\nmodel of plumes' trajectories shows an interesting resemblance to the\nmorphology of structures seen in the radio continuum and X-rays.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vv6WE1TnBi5OuEe3947QJvwfKsGUfon8q_Z_bTvBYJk","pdfSize":"15405454","txDigest":"G3tEQoM5d5MjvqtQAcddgRGPF5FG5ZhM9DGfrRf4jV9h","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
