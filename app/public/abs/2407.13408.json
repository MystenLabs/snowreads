Conventional methodologies\nemployed for the study of behavior, characterized by labor-intensive data\ncollection processes and intricate analyses, frequently hinder comprehensive\nexploration due to their time and resource demands. In response to these\nchallenges, computational models have proven to be promising tools that help\nresearchers analyze large amounts of data by automatically identifying\nimportant behavioral indicators, such as social signals. However, the\nwidespread adoption of such state-of-the-art computational models is impeded by\ntheir inherent complexity and the substantial computational resources necessary\nto run them, thereby constraining accessibility for researchers without\ntechnical expertise and adequate equipment. To address these barriers, we\nintroduce DISCOVER -- a modular and flexible, yet user-friendly software\nframework specifically developed to streamline computational-driven data\nexploration for human behavior analysis. Our primary objective is to\ndemocratize access to advanced computational methodologies, thereby enabling\nresearchers across disciplines to engage in detailed behavioral analysis\nwithout the need for extensive technical proficiency. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the capabilities of DISCOVER using four exemplary data exploration\nworkflows that build on each other: Interactive Semantic Content Exploration,\nVisual Inspection, Aided Annotation, and Multimodal Scene Search. By\nillustrating these workflows, we aim to emphasize the versatility and\naccessibility of DISCOVER as a comprehensive framework and propose a set of\nblueprints that can serve as a general starting point for exploratory data\nanalysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
