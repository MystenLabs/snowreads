Domain Decomposition Aggregation-Based Algebraic Multigrid, also\nknown as the DD-$\\alpha$AMG solver, is a successful realization of an algebraic\nmultigrid solver for lattice quantum chromodynamics. Its CPU implementation has\nmade it possible to construct, for some particular discretizations, simulations\notherwise computationally unfeasible, and furthermore it has motivated the\ndevelopment and improvement of other algebraic multigrid solvers in the area.\nFrom an existing version of DD-$\\alpha$AMG already partially ported via CUDA to\nrun some finest-level operations of the multigrid solver on Nvidia GPUs, we\ntranslate the CUDA code here by using HIP to run on the ORISE supercomputer. We\nmoreover extend the smoothers available in DD-$\\alpha$AMG, paying particular\nattention to Richardson smoothing, which in our numerical experiments has led\nto a multigrid solver faster than smoothing with GCR and only 10% slower\ncompared to SAP smoothing. Then we port the odd-even-preconditioned versions of\nGMRES and Richardson via CUDA. Finally, we extend some computationally\nintensive coarse-grid operations via advanced vectorization.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
