Unlike existing techniques for network utility\nmaximization, which only consider first-order statistics, this framework models\nevery random process by its mean and temporal variance. The inclusion of\ntemporal variance makes this framework well-suited for modeling Markovian\nfading wireless channels and emerging network performance metrics such as\nage-of-information (AoI) and timely-throughput. Using this framework, we\nsharply characterize the second-order capacity region of wireless access\nnetworks. We also propose a simple scheduling policy and prove that it can\nachieve every interior point in the second-order capacity region. To\ndemonstrate the utility of this framework, we apply it to an unsolved network\noptimization problem where some clients wish to minimize AoI while others wish\nto maximize timely-throughput. We show that this framework accurately\ncharacterizes AoI and timely-throughput. Moreover, it leads to a tractable\nscheduling policy that outperforms other existing work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
