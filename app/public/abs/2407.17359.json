The [CII] emission is expected to trace\ndense cold gas in the inner CGM of these galaxies. The origin of this emission\nis still debated. In this paper, we present a post-processing model applied to\nIllustris-TNG50 star-forming galaxies at $z\\sim$4-6, and we compare our results\nwith the ALPINE observations. By incorporating C$^{+}$ abundances derived from\nUV background and young stars as radiation sources, we generate mock\nobservations, from which we extract surface-brightness (SB) profiles. We found\nthat our model predicts similar [CII] emission values on galactic scales as the\nobservations, providing validation for our approach. However, we find that the\npredicted [CII] emission in the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) falls below\nthe observed values by a factor of $\\sim$10. We discuss several model\nlimitations that may contribute to this discrepancy. We also find discrepancies\nwith observations when comparing SB profiles of low and high-SFR galaxies.\nUnlike the observations, simulations exhibit no discernible difference in the\nextended [CII] emission between the two subsamples. This discrepancy may\nreflect shortcomings in feedback model of the simulation. Finally, our analysis\nsuggests that the extended [CII] emission is likely a result of both gas from\nsatellite galaxies and outflows from central galaxies, with satellites playing\na dominant role within 0.6$<$R/R$_{\\rm vir}<$1. A firm estimate of the\nimportance of each contribution is beyond the scope of the current simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vMRBuAr9hyZKdlSZBaaJ15g0E8oLZkT19blROC5e3jY","pdfSize":"2576070"}
