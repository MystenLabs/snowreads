It is informed and\nmotivated by the software engineering practice of developing server backends\nwith a database layer and a frontend, all of which communicate with a notion of\nrequest/response. I make use of dependent types to ensure the request/response\nrelation matches and show how this idea fits in the broader context of\ncontainers and their morphisms. Using the category of containers and their\nmonoidal products, I define monads on containers that mimic their functional\nprogramming counterparts, and using the Kleene star, I describe stateful\nprotocols in the same system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
