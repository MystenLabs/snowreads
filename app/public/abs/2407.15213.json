Its high throughput and resolution could\nbenefit large-scale RF MEMS production for the telecommunication market. We\npresent a process flow to fabricate suspended acoustic resonators using DUV\nPhotolithography. This method allows for scalable production of resonators with\ncritical dimensions of 250 nm and alignment accuracy of less than 100 nm. We\nshow how photoresists and anti-reflective coatings integrate with the process,\nhelp with deposition quality and resolution, and how Ion Beam Etching allows\nfor vertical sidewalls of the resonators. We measure resonance frequencies (fr)\nup to 7.5 GHz and electromechanical couplings up to 8%, and we investigate the\nuniformity of this process by analyzing the deviation of fs over the wafer\nsurface for four main resonance modes. We show that the deviation of the S0\nmode can be kept below 1%. These results indicate the suitability of this\nprocess for quick scale-up of Lamb wave resonator technology, bridging the gap\nfrom research to industry.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
