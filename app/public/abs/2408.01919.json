Most existing models are designed to\nsolve a singular problem. Unlike these models, PRIME-DP is capable of\nmulti-task single station seismic waveform processing, including Pg/Sg/Pn/Sn\nphase picking and P polarization classification. Moreover, it can be\nfine-tunned to various tasks, such as event classification without architecture\nmodifications. PRIME-DP can achieve a recall rate of over 85% for Pg and Sg\nphases on continuous waveforms and achieves over 80% accuracy in P polarization\nclassification. By fine-tuning classification decoder with NeiMeng dataset,\nPRIME-DP achieves 95.1% accuracy on event.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
