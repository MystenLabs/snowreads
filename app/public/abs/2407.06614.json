The clinical application of CEST,\nhowever, is constrained by its low contrast and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nin the acquired data. Denoising, as one of the post-processing stages for CEST\ndata, can effectively improve the accuracy of CEST quantification. In this\nwork, by modeling spatial variant z-spectrums into low-dimensional subspace, we\nintroduce Implicit Regression in Subspace (IRIS), which is an unsupervised\ndenoising algorithm utilizing the excellent property of implicit neural\nrepresentation for continuous mapping. Experiments conducted on both synthetic\nand in-vivo data demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses other CEST\ndenoising methods regarding both qualitative and quantitative performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
