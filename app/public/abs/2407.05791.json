Specifically, we\nconsider a point-to-point near-field system where the base station (BS)\ntransmitter has multiple fixed-position antennas and the user receives the\nsignals with multiple fluid antennas. Our objective is to jointly optimize the\ntransmit beamforming of the BS and the fluid antenna positions at the user for\nmaximizing the energy efficiency. Our scheme is based on an alternating\noptimization algorithm that iteratively solves the beamforming and antenna\nposition subproblems. Our simulation results validate the performance\nimprovement of the proposed algorithm and confirm the effectiveness of FAS.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
