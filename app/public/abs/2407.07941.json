The presence of an $e$-$m$\nduality symmetry at this critical point forces anyons with nontrivial braiding\nto close their gaps simultaneously, giving rise to a critical theory that mixes\nstrong interactions with mutual statistics. An effective U(1) $\\times$ U(1)\ngauge theory with a mutual Chern-Simons term at level $k$ is proposed to\ndescribe the vicinity of the multicritical point for $k \\geq 4$. We argue\nanalytically that monopoles are irrelevant in the IR CFT and compute the\nscaling dimensions of the leading duality-symmetric/anti-symmetric operators.\nIn the large $k$ limit, these scaling dimensions approach $3 - \\nu_{\\rm\nXY}^{-1}$ as $1/k^2$, where $\\nu_{\\rm XY}$ is the correlation length exponent\nof the 3D XY model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
