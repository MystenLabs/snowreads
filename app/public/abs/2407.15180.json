Over the years, different approaches have\nbeen presented such as filtering methods (for example, Extended Kalman Filter),\ndifferential algebra or solving Lambert's problem. In this work, we consider a\nsetting of three monostatic radars, where all available measurements are taken\napproximately at the same instant. This follows a similar setting as\ntrilateration, a state-of-the-art approach, where each radar is able to obtain\na single measurement of range and range-rate. Differently, and due to advances\nin Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radars, we assume that each location\nis able to obtain a larger set of range, angle and Doppler shift measurements.\nThus, our method can be understood as an extension of trilateration leveraging\nmore recent technology and incorporating additional data. We formulate the\nproblem as a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which for some number of\nobservations is asymptotically unbiased and asymptotically efficient. Through\nnumerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method attains the same accuracy\nas the trilateration method for the same number of measurements and offers an\nalternative and generalization, returning a more accurate estimation of the\nsatellite's state vector, as the number of available measurements increases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"GrmYYYkfCTF4XK42VmcixgUSvqkoBU4Xs2_BtpKYngs","pdfSize":"7081210"}
