Specifically, a pair of matching\npluggable modules is installed: one after the semantic transmitter and the\nother before the semantic receiver. The module at transmitter uses a trainable\nadversarial residual network (ARN) to generate adversarial examples, while the\nmodule at receiver employs another trainable ARN to remove the adversarial\nattacks and the channel noise. To mitigate the threat of semantic\neavesdropping, the trainable ARNs are jointly optimized to minimize the\nweighted sum of the power of adversarial attack, the mean squared error of\nsemantic communication, and the confidence of eavesdropper correctly retrieving\nprivate information. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is capable\nof fooling the eavesdropper while maintaining the high-quality semantic\ncommunication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
