There is notably lower-on average less positive-correlation\nin the morning than in the afternoon. We develop a nonparametric testing\nprocedure to detect such deterministic variation in a correlation process. The\ntest statistic has a known distribution under the null hypothesis, whereas it\ndiverges under the alternative. It is robust against stochastic correlation. We\nrun a Monte Carlo simulation to discover the finite sample properties of the\ntest statistic, which are close to the large sample predictions, even for small\nsample sizes and realistic levels of diurnal variation. In an application, we\nimplement the test on a monthly basis for a high-frequency dataset covering the\nstock market over an extended period. The test leads to rejection of the null\nmost of the time. This suggests diurnal variation in the correlation process is\na nontrivial effect in practice.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mOdOBp29twSQsswBxJLVwyHhWzL8uJe9fpAvYMh8OUw","pdfSize":"908103","txDigest":"2vrMhSTv3nsWDbPEtbwQjVM5T4UDq4y5EX4eD813Z4qP","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
