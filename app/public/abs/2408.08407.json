Inspired by the KAN\narchitecture, we propose the Photonic KAN -- an integrated all-optical\nneuromorphic platform leveraging highly parametric optical nonlinear transfer\nfunctions along KAN edges. In this work, we implement such nonlinearities in\nthe form of cascaded ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) devices.\nThis innovative design has the potential to address key limitations of current\nphotonic neural networks. In our test cases, the Photonic KAN showcases\nenhanced parameter scaling and interpretability compared to existing photonic\nneural networks. The photonic KAN achieves approximately 65$\\times$ reduction\nin energy consumption and area, alongside a 50$\\times$ reduction in latency\ncompared to previous MZI-based photonic accelerators with similar performance\nfor function fitting task. This breakthrough presents a promising new avenue\nfor expanding the scalability and efficiency of neuromorphic hardware\nplatforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
