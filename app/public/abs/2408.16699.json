This is mainly\ndue to the lack of control over the predicate (goal function) outcome during\nresolution. Integrity constraints defined by answer set programming (ASP)\nprovide the ability to constrain the predicate outcome. However, integrity\nconstraints are headless normal clauses, and stableKanren cannot create a goal\nfunction without a valid head. There are two approaches to handling integrity\nconstraints, but they do not fit stableKanren. Therefore, we design a new\napproach to integrate integrity constraints into stableKanren. We show a\nuniform framework to solve combinatorial search problems using integrity\nconstraints in extended stableKanren.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wWANHEc1MAfvbLPK6O1Nj4Kg2fnq9MwQlcfxP5AzzmA","pdfSize":"770690"}
