Although Blockchain clearly satisfies the main\nrequirements for Fake News Management Software Systems, the prescriptive\narchitectural solutions for that domain that cohabit Blockchain with other\ntechnologies in a single proposal still need to be made available. This paper's\nmain contribution is presenting a prescriptive architectural solution for\nblockchain-based fake news management software systems. The Hoffmeister process\nfor software architecture design is systematically followed to culminate in a\nsoftware solution for that domain. The implementation of two candidate\narchitectures and a brief simulation-based evaluation show the feasibility of\nthe solution to satisfy the functional and quality requirements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
