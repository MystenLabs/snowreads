Despite their success, the existing approaches focus more on the\ngeneral framework with no prior domain expertise. High-stakes financial sectors\nhave extensive domain knowledge of the features. Hence, it is expected that\nexplanations of models will be consistent with domain knowledge to ensure\nconceptual soundness.\n  In this work, we study the group structures of features that are naturally\nformed in the financial dataset. Our study shows the importance of considering\ngroup structures that conform to the regulations. When group structures are\npresent, direct applications of explainable machine learning methods, such as\nShapley values and Integrated Gradients, may not provide consistent\nexplanations; alternatively, group versions of the Shapley value can provide\nconsistent explanations. We contain detailed examples to concentrate on the\npractical perspective of our framework.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
