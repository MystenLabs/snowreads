Focusing on the critical aspects of courier allocation and order\nfulfillment, we introduce a novel approach utilizing a GRASP metaheuristic. The\nalgorithm optimizes the assignment of couriers to orders, considering dynamic\nfactors such as courier availability, order demands, and geographical\nlocations. Real-world in-stances from a Colombian delivery app form the basis\nof our computational anal-ysis. Calibration of GRASP parameters reveals a\ndelicate trade-off between solu-tion quality and computational time.\nComparative results with a simulation-optimization based study underscore\nGRASP's competitive performance, demon-strating strengths in fulfilling orders\nand routing efficiency across diverse in-stances. This research enhances\noperational efficiency in the burgeoning food de-livery industry, shedding\nlight on practical algorithms for last-mile logistics opti-mization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
