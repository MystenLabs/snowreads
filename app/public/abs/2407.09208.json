The fabricated single mode waveguides are free of\nresiduals and re-deposition, with measured losses for straight waveguides\naround 2 dB/m (0.02 dB/cm). We present on a method offering advantages for\nlarge-scale production due to its cost-effectiveness, faster writing time, and\nsimplified processes. This work holds promise for advancing integrated\nphotonics and optical communication technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
