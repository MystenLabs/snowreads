Understanding the distribution of energy between electrons and ions\nwithin these astrophysical shock waves spanning a wide spectrum of velocities\nis a long-standing challenge. In this study, we present a unified model for the\ndownstream electron temperature within unmagnetized shock waves. Encompassing\nvelocities from Newtonian to relativistic, we probe regimes representative of\nthe gradual deceleration of the forward shock in the late gamma-ray burst\nafterglow phase, such as GRB 170817A. In our model, heating results from an\nambipolar electric field generated by the difference in inertia between\nelectrons and ions, coupled with rapid electron scattering in the decelerating\nturbulence. Our findings demonstrate that the electron temperature consistently\nrepresents $10\\%$ of the incoming ion kinetic energy in the shock front frame\nover the full range of shock velocities.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
