The cosmological models arising as\nsolutions are naturally interpreted as spatially homogeneous and isotropic on\n``large scales\". In order to show the well-posedness and applicability of such\na scheme, we specialize in a class of spacetimes filled with the general\nhomogeneous perfect fluid and inhomogeneous viscoelastic matter. We prove the\nexistence, uniqueness, and relative stability of solutions, and an additional\ninequality for the energy density. As a consequence of our theorems, a new\nmechanism of energy transfer appears involving the different components of\nmatter. A class of exact solutions is also obtained to exemplify the general\nresults.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zk4Hzx6yGTAYKdmGDwtbVAqHb0GemzEPZrN_vfl7h-0","pdfSize":"1625415"}
