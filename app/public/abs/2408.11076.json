Unlike the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization\n(QUBO) formulation, which struggles to express complex mathematical equations,\nHOBO's ability to model higher-order interactions between binary variables\nmakes it well-suited for addressing more complex and expressive problem\nsettings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
