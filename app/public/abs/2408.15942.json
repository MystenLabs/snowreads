Using this algorithm, any such finite type invariant\ncan be computed on an $n$-crossing knot in time $\\sim n^{\\lceil\n\\frac{k}{2}\\rceil}$, a lot faster than the previously best published bound of\n$\\sim n^k$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
