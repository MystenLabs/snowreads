In this study, we\ninvestigate the manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in discrete-time quantum\nwalks. We demonstrate the existence of Parrondo's paradox using space and\ntime-dependent coins without the need for a higher-dimensional coin or adding\ndecoherence to the system. Our results enhance the feasibility of practical\nimplementations and provide deeper insights into the underlying quantum\ndynamics, specifically the propagation constrained by the interference pattern\nof quantum walks. The implications of our results suggest the potential for\nmore accessible and efficient designs in quantum transport, broadening the\nscope and application of Parrondo's paradox beyond conventional frameworks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RFtPZIeromS9x6vC7iG1sF_GjxW3m-XsnCCaM01l7zM","pdfSize":"8358754"}
