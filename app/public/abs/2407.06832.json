Applying this approach to a\ngeneral multistate Landau-Zener (MLZ) model with all diabatic levels crossing\nat one point (named the one-crossing MLZ model), we derive analytical formulas\nof all its transition probabilities up to $4$th order in the couplings. These\nanalytical asymptotic solutions at the diabatic limit can serve as reliable\nbenchmarks for future studies of any unsolved one-crossing MLZ models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
