AI enabled technologies are facing the public in many ways including\ninfrastructure, consumer products and home applications. Because many of these\ntechnologies present risks either in the form of physical injury, or bias,\npotentially yielding unfair outcomes, policy makers must consider the need for\noversight. Most policymakers, however, lack the technical knowledge to judge\nwhether an emerging AI technology is safe, effective, and requires oversight,\ntherefore policy makers must depend on expert opinion. But policymakers are\nbetter served when, in addition to expert opinion, they have some general\nunderstanding of existing guidelines and regulations. This work provides an\noverview [the landscape] of AI legislation and directives at the international,\nU.S. state, city and federal levels. It also reviews relevant business\nstandards, and technical society initiatives. Then an overlap and gap analysis\nare performed resulting in a reference guide that includes recommendations and\nguidance for future policy making.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
