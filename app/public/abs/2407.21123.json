These domains correspond to the three conjugacy\nclasses of one-parameter groups in the M\\\"obius group (elliptic for the disc,\nparabolic for the upper half plane and hyperbolic for the strip). In all cases,\nreflection positive functions correspond to positive functionals on $H^\\infty$\nfor a suitable involution. For the strip, reflection positivity naturally\nconnects with Kubo--Martin--Schwinger (KMS) conditions on the real line and\nfurther to standard pairs, as they appear in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory. We\nalso exhibit a curious connection between Hilbert spaces on the strip and the\nupper half plane, based on a periodization process.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
