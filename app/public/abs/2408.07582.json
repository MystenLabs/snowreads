Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 432--483], the\nEkman boundary layer solution was investigated on the domain\n$\\mathbb{T}^2\\times [\\varepsilon B(x,y), 1]$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a small\nconstant and $B(x,y)$ denotes a periodic smooth function. This study\ninvestigates the influence of the geometric structure of the boundary $B(x,y)$\nwithin the boundary layer. Specifically, for well-prepared initial data in the\ndomain $\\mathbb{R}^2\\times[B(x,y), B(x,y)+2]$, if the boundary surface $B(x,y)$\nis smooth and satisfies certain geometric constraints concerning its Gaussian\nand mean curvatures, then we derive an approximate boundary layer solution.\nAdditionally, according to the curvature and incompressible conditions, the\nlimit system we constructed is a 2D primitive system with damping and\nrotational effects. From the model's background, it reflects the\ncharacteristics arising from rotational effects. Finally, we validate the\nconvergence of this approximate solution. No smallness condition on the\namplitude of boundary $B(x, y)$ is required.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
