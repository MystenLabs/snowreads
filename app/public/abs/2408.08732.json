In this paper, we propose two algorithms to\nsolve such a task within the formalism of Probabilistic Answer Set Programming,\nboth based on the extraction of symbolic equations representing the\nprobabilities of the interpretations. The first solves the task using an\noff-the-shelf constrained optimization solver while the second is based on an\nimplementation of the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Empirical results\nshow that our proposals often outperform existing approaches based on projected\nanswer set enumeration in terms of quality of the solution and in terms of\nexecution time. The paper has been accepted at the ICLP2024 conference and is\nunder consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3kQAf-TckZzfgRJTvqejAzH_G-SFFoi1EyVvC0ZcT3g","pdfSize":"562795"}
