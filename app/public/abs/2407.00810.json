Often associated with severe adverse impacts on\nthe formation of vital central and peripheral nervous systems during the\nneurodevelopmental process, NDDs are comprised of a broad spectrum of\ndisorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder, and epilepsy, characterized by progressive and pervasive detriments\nto cognitive, speech, memory, motor, and other neurological functions in\npatients. However, the heterogeneous nature of NDDs poses a significant\nroadblock to identifying the exact pathogenesis, impeding accurate diagnosis\nand the development of targeted treatment planning. A computational NDDs model\nholds immense potential in enhancing our understanding of the multifaceted\nfactors involved and could assist in identifying the root causes to expedite\ntreatment development. To tackle this challenge, we introduce optimal\nneurotrophin concentration to the driving force and degradation of neurotrophin\nto the synaptogenesis process of a 2D phase field neuron growth model using\nisogeometric analysis to simulate neurite retraction and atrophy. The optimal\nneurotrophin concentration effectively captures the inverse relationship\nbetween neurotrophin levels and neurite survival, while its degradation\nregulates concentration levels. Leveraging dynamic domain expansion, the model\nefficiently expands the domain based on outgrowth patterns to minimize degrees\nof freedom. Based on truncated T-splines, our model simulates the evolving\nprocess of complex neurite structures by applying local refinement adaptively\nto the cell/neurite boundary. Furthermore, a thorough parameter investigation\nis conducted with detailed comparisons against neuron cell cultures in\nexperiments, enhancing our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms\nunderlying NDDs.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
