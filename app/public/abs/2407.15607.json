As an application, we show that if $\\mathsf{E}$ is a\nWaldhausen category with small coproducts such that the class of cofibrations\nis the left part of a weak factorization system in $\\mathsf{E}$, then the\nrepresentation category $\\mathsf{Rep}(Q, \\mathsf{coE})$ of a left rooted quiver\n$Q$ is a Waldhausen category, where $\\mathsf{coE}$ is the subcategory of\n$\\mathsf{E}$ whose morphisms are cofibrations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
