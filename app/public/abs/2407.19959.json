This article focuses on information criterion-based rank\nestimators and investigates their consistency in rank selection. The gap\nconditions serve as necessary and sufficient conditions for rank estimators to\nachieve selection consistency under the general assumptions of random matrix\ntheory. We establish a unified theorem on selection consistency, presenting the\ngap conditions for information criterion-based rank estimators with a unified\nformulation. To validate the theorem's assertion that rank selection\nconsistency is solely determined by the gap conditions, we conduct extensive\nnumerical simulations across various settings. Additionally, we undertake\nsupplementary simulations to explore the strengths and limitations of\ninformation criterion-based estimators by comparing them with other types of\nrank estimators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2vK5FeIOZtm0wBWX8dAOdqtHt2HRUEgGtYjDbglAjj8","pdfSize":"1378052"}
