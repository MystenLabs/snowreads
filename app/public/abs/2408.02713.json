This is achieved through superimposing preoperative organ\nmodels onto the actual anatomy. Challenges arise from dynamic deformations of\norgans during surgery, making preoperative models inadequate for faithfully\nrepresenting intraoperative anatomy. To enable reliable navigation in augmented\nsurgery, modeling of intraoperative deformation to obtain an accurate alignment\nof the preoperative organ model with the intraoperative anatomy is\nindispensable. Despite the existence of various methods proposed to model\nintraoperative organ deformation, there are still few literature reviews that\nsystematically categorize and summarize these approaches. This review aims to\nfill this gap by providing a comprehensive and technical-oriented overview of\nmodeling methods for intraoperative organ deformation in augmented reality in\nsurgery. Through a systematic search and screening process, 112 closely\nrelevant papers were included in this review. By presenting the current status\nof organ deformation modeling methods and their clinical applications, this\nreview seeks to enhance the understanding of organ deformation modeling in\nAR-guided surgery, and discuss the potential topics for future advancements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
