Namely, using the previously known Lax matrix we\nsuggest an ansatz for the accompany matrix. The presented construction is valid\nwhen the matrix of spin variables ${\\mathcal S}\\in{\\rm Mat}(N,\\mathbb C)$\nsatisfies the condition ${\\mathcal S}^2=c_0{\\mathcal S}$ with some constant\n$c_0\\in\\mathbb C$. It is proved that the Lax pair satisfies the Zakharov-Shabat\nequation with unwanted term, thus providing equations of motion on the\nunreduced phase space. The unwanted term vanishes after additional reduction.\nIn the special case ${\\rm rank}(\\mathcal S)=1$ we show that the reduction\nprovides the Lax pair of the spinless field Calogero-Moser model obtained\nearlier by Akhmetshin, Krichever and Volvovski.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
