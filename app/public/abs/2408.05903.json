These patterns yield a particular texture of Majorana\nneutrino mass matrix. We find that this texture, combined with existing\nneutrino experimental data, predicts an Inverted Hierarchy of neutrino masses\nwith $17\\lesssim m_1/m_3\\lesssim 44$, and a hierarchy between the two VEVs of\nSM-singlet scalars. Finally, we examine the potential effect of this model on\nneutrino oscillation phenomena.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
