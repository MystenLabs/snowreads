However, many\nmodels typically obtain unsatisfactory performance when applied to few-shot\nscenarios. Some studies have attempted to combine meta-learning with graph\nneural networks to solve few-shot node classification on graphs. Despite their\npromising performance, some limitations remain. First, they employ the node\nencoding mechanism of homophilic graphs to learn node embeddings, even in\nheterophilic graphs. Second, existing models based on meta-learning ignore the\ninterference of randomness in the learning process. Third, they are trained\nusing only limited labeled nodes within the specific task, without explicitly\nutilizing numerous unlabeled nodes. Finally, they treat almost all sampled\ntasks equally without customizing them for their uniqueness. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework for few-shot node classification called\nMeta-GPS++. Specifically, we first adopt an efficient method to learn\ndiscriminative node representations on homophilic and heterophilic graphs.\nThen, we leverage a prototype-based approach to initialize parameters and\ncontrastive learning for regularizing the distribution of node embeddings.\nMoreover, we apply self-training to extract valuable information from unlabeled\nnodes. Additionally, we adopt S$^2$ (scaling & shifting) transformation to\nlearn transferable knowledge from diverse tasks. The results on real-world\ndatasets show the superiority of Meta-GPS++.
