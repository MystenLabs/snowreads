The\nlanguage itself is untyped which adds a certain specificity to the problem and\nrequires the employment of techniques conventionally used in implicit/gradual\ntyping settings. The presence of polymorphic and recursive types poses a\ncertain challenge when implementing the inferencer in miniKanren and requires a\nnumber of tricks, optimizations, and extensions to be used; we report on those\nas well.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
