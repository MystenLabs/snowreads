Using the constraints of superconformal symmetry and superfield\nconservation equations, we utilise a computational approach to analyse the\ngeneral structure of the three-point function $\\langle J^{}_{s_{1}}(z_{1}) \\,\nJ'_{s_{2}}(z_{2}) \\, J''_{s_{3}}(z_{3}) \\rangle$ and provide a general\nclassification of the results. We demonstrate that the three-point function is\nfixed up to $2 \\min (s_{i}) + 2$ independent conserved structures, which we\npropose to hold for arbitrary superspins. In addition, we show that the\nconserved structures can be classified as parity-even or parity-odd in\nsuperspace based on their transformation properties under superinversion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
