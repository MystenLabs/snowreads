However, electronic building blocks that\nsimultaneously offer low energy consumption, fast switching, low error rates, a\nsmall footprint and simple fabrication remain elusive. In this work, we\ndemonstrate a superconducting switch with attojoule switching energy, high\nspeed (pico-second rise/fall times), and high integration density (on the order\nof $10^{-2}$ $\\mathrm{\\mu m^2}$ per switch). The switch consists of a\nsuperconducting channel and a metal heater separated by an insulating silica\nlayer, prepared using lift-off techniques. We experimentally demonstrate\ndigital gate operations utilizing this technology, such as NOT, NAND, NOR, AND,\nand OR gates, with a few femtojoule energy consumption and ultralow bit error\nrates < $10^{-8}$. In addition, we build volatile memory elements with few\nfemtojoule energy consumption per operation, a nanosecond operation speed, and\na retention time over $10^5$ s. These superconducting switches open new\npossibilities for increasing the size and complexity of modern cryogenic\ntechnologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
