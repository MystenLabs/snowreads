The equation is\nsupposed to have a nonnegative solution which generates an affine term\nstructure model. The L\\'evy measure $\\nu$ of $Z$ is assumed to admit a\nspherical decomposition based on the representation $\\mathbb{R}^d=S^{d-1}\\times\n(0,+\\infty)$, where $S^{d-1}$ stands for the unit sphere. Then\n$\\nu(dy)=\\lambda(d\\xi)\\times \\gamma_{\\xi}(dr)$, where $\\lambda$ is a measure on\n$S^{d-1}$ and $\\gamma_{\\xi}$ on $(0,+\\infty)$. Under some assumptions on\nspherical decomposition, a precise form of the generator of $R$ is determined\nand it is shown that the resulted term structure model is identical to that\ngenerated by the equation $$ d R(t)=(a R(t)+b) dt+C\\cdot (R(t-))^{1/\\alpha}\ndZ^{\\alpha}(t), \\quad R(0)=x, $$ with some constants $a,b,C$ and a one\ndimensional $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy process $Z^{\\alpha}$, where\n$\\alpha\\in(1,2)$. The case when $\\nu$ has a density is considered as a special\ncase.\n  The paper generalizes the classical results on the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR)\nmodel, \\cite{CIR}, as well as on its extended version from\n\\cite{BarskiZabczykCIR} and \\cite{BarskiZabczyk} where $Z$ is a one-dimensional\nL\\'evy process. It is the starting point for the classification in the spirit\nof \\cite{DaiSingleton} and \\cite{BarskiLochowski} for the affine models with\ndependent L\\'evy processes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hh_unTG9_k9lO-2NJQ9yHlbhKiUTe4AyZPJjwSfttq4","pdfSize":"270396","objectId":"0xa6bbed8f02a601ed3e328356afff0196505a7c6c416266eafbe8a2d7867d736f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
