The algorithm uses the quantum eigenvalue transform, and quantum\nmean estimation, giving a query complexity that scales like $O(V\\log(V))$ in\nthe matrix dimension $V$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
