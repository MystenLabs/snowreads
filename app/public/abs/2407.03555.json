In this work, we introduce an SCL-perturbation decoding algorithm to\naddress this issue. A basic version of the algorithm introduces small random\nperturbations to the received symbols before each SCL decoding attempt, and\nexhibits non-diminishing gain at large block lengths. Its enhanced version\nadaptively performs random perturbations or directional perturbation on each\nreceived symbol according to previous decoding results, and managed to correct\nmore errors with fewer decoding attempts. Extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate stable gains across various code rates, lengths and list sizes. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first SCL enhancement with\nnon-diminishing gains as code length increases, and achieves unprecedented\nefficiency. With only one additional SCL-$L$ decoding attempt (in total two),\nthe proposed algorithm achieves SCL-$2L$-equivalent performance. Since the gain\nis obtained without increasing list size, the algorithm is best suited for\nhardware implementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
