In this review, we discuss the\nspatiotemporal patterns and fluctuations of membranes under nonequilibrium\nconditions. In particular, we focus on theoretical analyses and simulations.\nProtein active forces enhance or suppress the membrane fluctuations; the\nmembrane height spectra are deviated from the thermal spectra. Protein binding\nor unbinding to the membrane is activated or inhibited by other proteins and\nchemical reactions, such as ATP hydrolysis. Such active binding processes can\ninduce traveling waves, Turing patterns, and membrane morphological changes.\nThey can be represented by the continuum reaction-diffusion equations and\ndiscrete lattice/particle models with state flips. The effects of structural\nchanges in amphiphilic molecules on the molecular-assembly structures are also\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
