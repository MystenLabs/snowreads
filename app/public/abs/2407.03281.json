The event originated from active region (AR) 12975 located at N13W52\nin the field of view of the Atmospheric imaging Assembly (AIA) and exactly at\nthe west limb viewed by the EUV Imager (EUVI) of the Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) satellite. The EUV wave was associated\nwith an M9.6 class flare. The event was also well observed by MLSO and COR1\ncoronagraphs. We revealed here evident coexistence of two components of EUV\nwaves in AIA as well as in EUVI images i.e., a fast-mode wave and a nonwave,\nwhich was predicted by the EUV wave hybrid model. The speeds of the fast-mode\nand non wave EUV wave components in AIA varies from ~430 to 658 km/s and ~157\nto 205 km/s, respectively. The computed speeds in STEREO-A for the fast-mode\nwave and nonwave components are ~520 and ~152 km/s, respectively. Another wave\nemanated from the source AR and interacted with ambient coronal loops, showing\nevident reflection in the EUV images above the solar limb. The speed of the\nreflected wave in the plane of the sky is ~175 km/s. With the precise\nalignments, we found that the fast-mode EUV wave is just ahead of the coronal\nmass ejection (CME) and the nonwave component is cospatial with the frontal\nloop of the accompanied CME. The event also showed stationary fronts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
