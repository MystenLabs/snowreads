The virtual cycle for\nthis moduli space is also constructed, and an analogue of Gromov-Witten\ninvariants is defined. As an application, we recover the formula for the number\nof rational degree d curves in P3, whose image lies in a plane in P3 (known as\nplanar curves in P3), intersecting r general lines while passing through given\ns general points, where r + 2s = 3d + 2, firstly proved by R.
