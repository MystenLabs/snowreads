A novel feature for the heterotic\nstring is that the gauge symmetry must be broken by a Wilson line to ensure\nmodular invariance. We completely classify the patterns of symmetry breaking.\nWe show that the tachyonic contributions in all cases can be analytically\ncontinued, with a finite answer in the domain $0<N \\leq 1$, relevant for\ncalculating entanglement entropy across the Rindler horizon. We discuss the\nphysical implications of our results.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
