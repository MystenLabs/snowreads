The error is measured in the $p$-Wasserstein\ndistance. In particular, when $1\\le p<d$, we establish asymptotic upper and\nlower bounds as $n \\to \\infty$ on the rescaled minimal error that have the\nsame, explicit dependency on $\\mu$.\n  In some instances, we prove that the rescaled minimal error has a limit.\nThese include general measures in dimension $d = 2$ with $1 \\le p < 2$, and\nuniform measures in arbitrary dimension with $1 \\le p < d$. For some uniform\nmeasures, we prove the limit existence for $p \\ge d$ as well.\n  For a class of compactly supported measures with H\\\"older densities, we\ndetermine the convergence speed of the minimal error for every $p \\ge 1$.\n  Furthermore, we establish a new Pierce-type (i.e., nonasymptotic) upper\nestimate of the minimal error when $1 \\le p < d$.\n  In the initial sections, we survey the state of the art and draw connections\nwith similar problems, such as classical and random quantization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
