We discuss how to get heights and the future of LiDAR and\nimagery processing. SOTA object segmentation allows us to take get object\nheights with no deep learning background. Engineers will be keeping track of\nworld data across generations and reprocessing them. They will be using older\nprocedural methods like this paper and newer ones discussed here. SOTA methods\nare going beyond analysis and into generative AI. We cover both a procedural\nmethodology and the newer ones performed with language models. These include\npoint cloud, imagery and text encoding allowing for spatially aware AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OlPoa7ovz30LhZlr00p_a8uRCC-j5PxWXjmdS_bXwxY","pdfSize":"1048468","txDigest":"ETDNvXCts3VYXr4pBJ2kRqUdNqkLzhAj2JcK5V24Gzhb","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
