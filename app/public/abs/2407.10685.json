In the case where the set $E$ is finite, we derive an\nasymptotic equivalent of the Green function of the process, providing a new\nproof of a result obtained by Dussaule in 2020. This result generalizes the\nfamous theorem of Ney and Spitzer of 1966, that deals with the sum of\nindependent and identically distributed random variables, to a spatially\nnon-homogeneous case.\n  In this new proof, we generalize the arguments used in Woess's book Random\nWalks on Infinite Graphs and Groups to prove Ney and Spitzer's theorem, that\nconsists in establishing an integral formula of the Green function from which\nwe get the asymptotic equivalent. To do so, we use techniques developed by\nBabillot. In particular, we use dyadic splitting of integrals, a powerful\nFourier analysis tool that enables us to control the Fourier transform of a\nfunction that has a singularity at the origin.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
