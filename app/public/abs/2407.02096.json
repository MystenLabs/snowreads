The model exhibits a critical end point (CEP) at\n$T_\\mathrm{CEP} = \\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV and $\\mu_{B \\, \\mathrm{CEP}} = 500\n\\ldots 700$ MeV with emerging first-order phase transition (FOPT) curve which\nextends to large values of $\\mu_B$ without approaching the $\\mu_B$ axis. We\nconsider the impact and peculiarities of the related phase structure on the EoS\nfor the employed dilaton potential and dynamical coupling parameterizations.\nThese seem to prevent to design an overall trustable EoS without recourse to\nhybrid constructions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
