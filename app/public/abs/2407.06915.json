Due to some\ndeficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to\ninterferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a\npromising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based\nlocalization systems. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in\nconstructing an integrated localization system. However, most low-cost UWB\ndevices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates\nthe estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled\nGNSS/UWB integration. Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models,\nthe time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization\nof the continuous model. This work proposes a novel architecture in which\nFactor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for\ntightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT).\nFGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides\ninitailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation.\nSimulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance\nof FE-GUT. In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that,\ncompared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization\naccuracy by 58.59\\% and 34.80\\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation\naccuracy is improved by 76.80\\%.
