We apply the existence criterion\nfor good moduli spaces of stacks to show that the moduli stack of semistable\nvector bundles on a stacky curve has a proper good moduli space. We\nmoduli-theoretically prove that a natural determinantal line bundle on this\nmoduli space is ample, thus proving this moduli space is projective. Our\nmethods give effective bounds for when a power of this line bundle is\nbasepoint-free. As a special case, we obtain new and effective constructions of\nmoduli spaces of parabolic bundles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
