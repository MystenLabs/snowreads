Physics-informed convolutional\nneural networks (PICNNs) extend PINNs by leveraging CNNs for enhanced\ngeneralization and efficiency. However, current PICNNs depend on manual design,\nand inappropriate designs may not effectively solve PDEs. Furthermore, due to\nthe diversity of physical problems, the ideal network architectures and loss\nfunctions vary across different PDEs. It is impractical to find the optimal\nPICNN architecture and loss function for each specific physical problem through\nextensive manual experimentation. To surmount these challenges, this paper uses\nautomated machine learning (AutoML) to automatically and efficiently search for\nthe loss functions and network architectures of PICNNs. We introduce novel\nsearch spaces for loss functions and network architectures and propose a\ntwo-stage search strategy. The first stage focuses on searching for factors and\nresidual adjustment operations that influence the loss function, while the\nsecond stage aims to find the best CNN architecture. Experimental results show\nthat our automatic searching method significantly outperforms the\nmanually-designed model on multiple datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
