From the equation of\nstate we deduce the compressibility and observe its dependency on $t_\\perp /t$.\nMoreover, we infer thermodynamic number fluctuations from the equation of state\nby employing the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. By comparing the\nthermodynamic with local density fluctuations, we find that non-local density\nfluctuations in our bilayer Hubbard system become more prominent for higher\n$t_\\perp /t$ in the low filling regime. To validate our measurements, we\ncompare them to Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a bilayer\nHubbard system with 6$\\times$6 lattice sites per layer.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
