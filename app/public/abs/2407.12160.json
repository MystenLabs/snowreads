First, we show that $\\mathscr{L}(\\mathcal{I})$\nmay attain arbitrarily large Borel complexity. Second, we prove that if\n$\\mathcal{I}$ is a $G_{\\delta\\sigma}$-ideal then all elements of\n$\\mathscr{L}(\\mathcal{I})$ are closed. Third, we show that if $\\mathcal{I}$ is\na simply coanalytic ideal and $X$ is first countable, then every element of\n$\\mathscr{L}(\\mathcal{I})$ is simply analytic. Lastly, we studied certain\nstructural properties and the topological complexity of minimal ideals\n$\\mathcal{I}$ for which $\\mathscr{L}(\\mathcal{I})$ contains a given set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
