The\ncomplexity of modeling increases significantly with multiple ad types and\nvarying scenarios that exhibit both similarities and differences. In this work,\nwe introduce a novel multi-faceted attention model that performs task aware\nfeature combination and cross task interaction modeling. Our technique\nformulates the feature combination problem as \"language\" modeling with\nauto-regressive attentions across both feature and task dimensions.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new dimension of task ID encoding for task\nrepresentations, thereby enabling precise relevance modeling across diverse ad\nscenarios with substantial improvement in generality capability for unseen\ntasks. We demonstrate that our model not only effectively handles the increased\ncomputational and maintenance demands as scenarios proliferate, but also\noutperforms generalized DNN models and even task-specific models across a\nspectrum of ad applications using a single unified model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
