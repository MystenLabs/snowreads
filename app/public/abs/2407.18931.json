It is a key challenge to design a transform\nmethod for processing these graph M-D signals in the linear canonical transform\ndomain. This paper proposes the two-dimensional graph linear canonical\ntransform based on the central discrete dilated Hermite function (2-D\nCDDHFs-GLCT) and the two-dimensional graph linear canonical transform based on\nchirp multiplication-chirp convolution-chirp multiplication decomposition (2-D\nCM-CC-CM-GLCT). Then, extending 2-D CDDHFs-GLCT and 2-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT to M-D\nCDDHFs-GLCT and M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT. In terms of the computational complexity,\nadditivity and reversibility, M-D CDDHFs-GLCT and M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT are\ncompared. Theoretical analysis shows that the computational complexity of M-D\nCM-CC-CM-GLCT algorithm is obviously reduced. Simulation results indicate that\nM-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT achieves comparable additivity to M-D CDDHFs-GLCT, while M-D\nCM-CC-CM-GLCT exhibits better reversibility. Finally, M-D GLCT is applied to\ndata compression to show its application advantages. The experimental results\nreflect the superiority of M-D GLCT in the algorithm design and implementation\nof data compression.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
