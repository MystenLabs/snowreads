In this article, we propose a factorization of a perfectly\nclustering word on a $n$ letters alphabet into a product of $n-1$ palindromes\nwith a letter between each of them. This factorization allows us to generalize\ntwo combinatorial characterization of Christoffel words due to Pirillo (1999)\nand de Luca and Mignosi (1994).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cwVpqmu3PbpTpGoHTvgheMYzpfyn2vzP6EWT12PPD18","pdfSize":"201611"}
