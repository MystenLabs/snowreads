Recent experiments demonstrate that LLPS is qualitatively different on\ntwo-dimensional (2d) surfaces compared to three-dimensional (3d) solutions. In\nthis paper, we use mathematical modeling to investigate the causes of the\ndiscrepancies between LLPS in 2d versus 3d. We model the number of proteins and\ndroplets inducing LLPS by continuous-time Markov chains and use chemical\nreaction network theory to analyze the model. To reflect the influence of space\ndimension, droplet formation and dissociation rates are determined using the\nfirst hitting times of diffusing proteins. We first show that our stochastic\nmodel reproduces the appropriate phase diagram and is consistent with the\nrelevant thermodynamic constraints. After further analyzing the model, we find\nthat it predicts that the space dimension induces qualitatively different\nfeatures of LLPS which are consistent with recent experiments. While it has\nbeen claimed that the differences between 2d and 3d LLPS stems mainly from\ndifferent diffusion coefficients, our analysis is independent of the diffusion\ncoefficients of the proteins since we use the stationary model behavior.\nTherefore, our results give new hypotheses about how space dimension affects\nLLPS.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
