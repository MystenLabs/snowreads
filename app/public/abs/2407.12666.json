Wyne (1979) designed a pair of\ntriplet lenses to optically minimize this chromatic magnification and increase\nthe spectral bandwidth. Such a Wyne corrector could enable focal plane\nwavefront sensing at up to 50% spectral bandwidths and as a result open enable\n$>50x$ higher-speed focal plane wavefront sensing. We present results of the\ndesign and laboratory testing of a Wyne corrector prototype, including a\ndetailed tolerancing analysis considering manufactural wavelength ranges and\nalignment tolerances. These tests show promising results that this technology\ncan be deployed to current and future high speed focal plane wavefront sensing\ninstruments to enable significant performance enhancements.
