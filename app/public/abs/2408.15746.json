We propose a low-complexity hybrid approach\nfor joint AENR by employing a single model to suppress both residual echo and\nnoise components. Specifically, we integrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ULCNet\nmodel, which was originally proposed to achieve ultra-low complexity noise\nsuppression, in a hybrid system and train it for joint AENR. We show that the\nproposed approach achieves better echo reduction and comparable noise reduction\nperformance with much lower computational complexity and memory requirements\nthan all considered SOTA methods, at the cost of slight degradation in speech\nquality.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R849Rw_X9Rn1L_3uHsSHB6zNRq2Kmi8wW1urBboFkag","pdfSize":"389541"}
