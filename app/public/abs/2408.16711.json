Their\ncoordinates are spinor brackets, which we derive from the Clifford algebra\nassociated to the Lorentz group. This was proposed for $d=5$ in the recent\nphysics literature. Our kinematic varieties are given by polynomial constraints\non tensors with both symmetric and skew symmetric slices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3X0xjD-AoWxXJvMxzo2cZUkpXmRSUq3Rx7O1o2ykkIU","pdfSize":"195116"}
