In this context, we prove that\nequivariant Hochschild homology can sometimes be computed using Mackey\nfunctor-valued Tor. To compute these Tor Mackey functors for odd primes $p$, we\ndefine cyclic-$p$-group-equivariant analogues of the Koszul resolution which\nresolve the Burnside Mackey functor (the analogue of the integers) as a module\nover free incomplete Tambara functors (the analogue of polynomial rings). We\napply these Koszul resolutions to compute Mackey functor-valued Hochschild\nhomology of free incomplete Tambara functors for cyclic groups of odd prime\norder and for the cyclic group of order 9.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ggYBOAMr5Q8SrHvR9PtVLXgcuj9ziDF1j-D6Quwx7yk","pdfSize":"633071","objectId":"0x199c53b0bbcfc01e0b08998c98c4885eff931d218c61e8871a0a12f622d0797d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
