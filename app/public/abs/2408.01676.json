The manuscript\npresents the fault-tolerant techniques and mechanical designs to achieve a\nfault-tolerant multirotor, and a vision-based navigation system required to\nachieve a precision landing. Preliminary experimental results will be shown, to\nvalidate on one hand the fault-tolerant control vehicle and, on the other hand,\nthe autonomous landing algorithm. Also, a prototype of the fault-tolerant UAV\nis presented, capable of precise autonomous landing, which will be used in\nfuture experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
