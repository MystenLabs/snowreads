The time\nevolution is generated by $N^2$ coupled differential equations for the matrix\nelements of $U$, and synchronization happens when $U$ evolves into a multiple\nof the identity. The Ott-Antonsen ansatz is related to the Poisson kernels that\nare so useful in quantum transport, and we prove it in the case of identical\nnatural frequencies. When the coupling constant is a matrix, we find some\nsurprising new dynamical behaviors.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
