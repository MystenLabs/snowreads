Nevertheless, to fully realize the potential of MA systems,\ncomplete channel state information (CSI) between the transmitter-MA and the\nreceiver-MA is required, which involves estimating a large number of channel\nparameters and incurs an excessive amount of training overhead. To address this\nchallenge, in this paper, we propose a CSI-free MA position optimization\nmethod. The basic idea is to treat position optimization as a black-box\noptimization problem and calculate the gradient of the unknown objective\nfunction using zeroth-order (ZO) gradient approximation techniques. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed ZO-based method, through adaptively adjusting\nthe position of the MA, can achieve a favorable signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)\nusing a smaller number of position measurements than the CSI-based approach.\nSuch a merit makes the proposed algorithm more adaptable to fast-changing\npropagation channels.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
