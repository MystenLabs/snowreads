Gaining an insight into\ntheir physical characteristics contributes to a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of these phenomena. The GLOSTAR project aims to provide a GLObal\nview on STAR formation in the Milky Way by performing an unbiased and sensitive\nsurvey. This is achieved by using the extremely wideband (4{-}8 GHz) C-band\nreceiver of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Effelsberg 100 m\ntelescope. Using radio recombination lines observed in the GLOSTAR survey with\nthe VLA in D-configuration with a typical line sensitivity of 1{\\sigma} {\\sim}\n3.0 mJy beam{^-1} at {\\sim} 5 km s{^-1} and an angular resolution of 25\", we\ncataloged 244 individual Galactic HII regions and derived their physical\nproperties. We examined the mid-infrared (MIR) morphology of these HII regions\nand find that a significant portion of them exhibit a bubble-like morphology in\nthe GLIMPSE 8 {\\mu}m emission. We also searched for associations with the dust\ncontinuum and sources of methanol maser emission, other tracers of young\nstellar objects, and find that 48\\% and 14\\% of our HII regions, respectively,\nare coextensive with those. We measured the electron temperature for a large\nsample of HII regions within Galactocentric distances spanning from 1.6 to 13.1\nkpc and derived the Galactic electron temperature gradient as {\\sim} 372 {\\pm}\n28 K kpc{^-1} with an intercept of 4248 {\\pm} 161 K, which is consistent with\nprevious studies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
