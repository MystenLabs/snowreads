Introducing shrinkage on the error covariance\nmatrix is sometimes done but, in the vast majority of cases, without\nconsidering the network structure of the shocks and by placing the prior on the\nlower Cholesky factor of the precision matrix. In this paper, we propose a\nprior on the VAR error precision matrix directly. Our prior, which resembles a\nstandard spike and slab prior, models variable inclusion probabilities through\na stochastic block model that clusters shocks into groups. Within groups, the\nprobability of having relations across group members is higher (inducing less\nsparsity) whereas relations across groups imply a lower probability that\nmembers of each group are conditionally related. We show in simulations that\nour approach recovers the true network structure well. Using a US macroeconomic\ndata set, we illustrate how our approach can be used to cluster shocks together\nand that this feature leads to improved density forecasts.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
