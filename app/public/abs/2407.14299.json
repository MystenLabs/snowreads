Notably, certain public chains, such as Cosmos and\nTezos, which operate on a proof-of-stake mechanism, have adopted this\nalgorithm. While it is commonly assumed that these blockchains maintain a\nnearly constant block creation time, empirical analysis reveals fluctuations in\nthis interval; this phenomenon has received limited attention. In this paper,\nwe propose a mathematical model to account for the processes of block\npropagation and validation within Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus\nblockchains, aiming to theoretically analyze the probability distribution of\nblock time. First, we propose stochastic processes governing the broadcasting\ncommunications among validator nodes. Consequently, we theoretically\ndemonstrate that the probability distribution of broadcast time among validator\nnodes adheres to the Gumbel distribution. This finding indicates that the\ndistribution of block time typically arises from convolving multiple Gumbel\ndistributions. Additionally, we derive an approximate formula for the block\ntime distribution suitable for data analysis purposes. By fitting this\napproximation to real-world block time data, we demonstrate the consistent\nestimation of block time distribution parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
