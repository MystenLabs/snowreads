We move the large circle\nforward by 10cm (to 40cm) and back again (to 50cm). What distance should we\nmove the small circle forward and back, so the circles look like they are\nmoving rigidly in depth together? Constant physical distance (10cm) or constant\ndisparity (6.7cm)? Observers choose constant disparity. This leads us to four\nconclusions: First, perceived stereo depth appears to reflect retinal\ndisparities, not 3D geometry. Second, doubling disparity appears to double\nperceived depth, suggesting that perceived stereo depth is proportional to\ndisparity. Third, changes in vergence appear to have no effect on perceived\ndepth. Fourth, stereo 'depth constancy' appears to be a cognitive (not\nperceptual) phenomenon, reflecting our experience of a world distorted in\nperceived stereo depth. Finally, when angular size is not held constant, the\nillusion is no longer noticeable. However, the perceived stereo depth remains\nthe same in both conditions, suggesting that this looming cue only affects our\njudgment, but not our visual experience, of motion in depth.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
