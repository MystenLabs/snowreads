By\nanalyzing the tunable band structure and band geometry via strain, and\nperforming extensive many-body exact diagonalization of a realistic model, we\npresent compelling evidence for realizing various fractional Chern insulators\nin both strained monolayer graphene and TMDs. Our thorough analysis across\ndifferent strain parameters, accounting for experimental variability, reveals\nthat a broad spectrum of fractional Chern insulators, including the Laughlin\nstates, Halperin 112, 332 and 111 states, and Chern number |C| = 2 states, can\nbe stabilized in distinct regions of the phase diagram. These findings suggest\nthat periodically strained monolayer graphene and TMDs provide promising\nplatforms for engineering fractional Chern insulators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
