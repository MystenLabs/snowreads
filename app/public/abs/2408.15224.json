Various tools have been implemented to aid this\nprocess. Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) offers a general-purpose prompt-based\nsegmentation algorithm designed to annotate videos. In this paper, we adapt\nthis model to the annotation of 3D medical images and offer our implementation\nin the form of an extension to the popular annotation software: 3D Slicer. Our\nextension allows users to place point prompts on 2D slices to generate\nannotation masks and propagate these annotations across entire volumes in\neither single-directional or bi-directional manners. Our code is publicly\navailable on https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/SlicerSegmentWithSAM and can be\neasily installed directly from the Extension Manager of 3D Slicer as well.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DMj8qZuOq7NDL92oLqk5qbsd-QsrUh9jdj5iriG4Jy4","pdfSize":"1591522"}
