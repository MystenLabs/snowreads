We present MUSIC-lite, which exploits approximate computing to\ngenerate a design space exploring accuracy-area-power trade-offs. This is\nspecifically applied to the computationally intensive singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) component of the MUSIC algorithm in an orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar use case. MUSIC-lite incorporates\napproximate adders into the iterative CORDIC algorithm that is used for\nhardware implementation of MUSIC, generating interesting accuracy-area-power\ntrade-offs. Our experiments demonstrate MUSIC-lite's ability to save an average\nof 17.25% on-chip area and 19.4% power with a minimal 0.14% error for efficient\nMUSIC implementations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nOHxgQdPPDqlGMPNEmSQ0FEi1D7YWpC0ocykZEdPMY4","pdfSize":"3736351"}
