This study introduces a groundbreaking\ncalibration-free method for estimating focal depth, leveraging machine learning\ntechniques to analyze eye movement features within short sequences. Our\napproach, distinguished by its innovative use of LSTM networks and\ndomain-specific feature engineering, achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of\nless than 10 cm, setting a new focal depth estimation accuracy standard. This\nadvancement promises to enhance the usability of autofocal glasses and pave the\nway for their seamless integration into extended reality environments, marking\na significant leap forward in personalized visual technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
