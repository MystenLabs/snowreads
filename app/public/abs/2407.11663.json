This challenge consists of three tasks: action\nunit detection, facial expression recognition, and valance-arousal estimation.\nWe address the research problems of this challenge from three aspects: 1)For\nlearning robust visual feature representations, we introduce the pre-trained\nlarge model Dinov2. 2) To adaptively extract the required features of eack\ntask, we design a task-adaptive block that performs cross-attention between a\nset of learnable query vectors and pre-extracted features. 3) By proposing the\nAU-assisted Graph Convolutional Network(AU-GCN), we make full use of the\ncorrelation information between AUs to assist in solving the EXPR and VA tasks.\nFinally, we achieve the evaluation measure of \\textbf{1.2542} on the validation\nset provided by the organizers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
