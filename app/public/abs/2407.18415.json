In addition to the\npositively charged layer close to the Si/SiO$_2$-interface, surface damage\nintroduced by radiation in SiO$_2$-passivated silicon particle detectors\nincludes the accumulation of trapped-oxide-charge and interface traps. A\nprevious study of either n/$\\gamma$ (mixed field)- or $\\gamma$-irradiated\nMetal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitors showed evidence of substantially\nhigher introduction rates of acceptor- and donor-type deep interface traps\n($N_\\textrm{it,acc/don}$) in mixed-field environment. In this work, an\ninter-electrode resistivity ($\\rho_\\textrm{int}$) TCAD-simulation study of\n$n$-on-$p$ sensors with and without $p$-stop isolation implants was conducted\nfor both irradiation types. Higher levels of $\\rho_\\textrm{int}$ showed\ncorrelation to higher densities of deep $N_\\textrm{it,acc/don}$, with the\nisolation performance of the mixed-field irradiated sensors becoming\nindependent of the presence of $p$-stop implant between the $n^+$-electrodes\nthroughout the investigated dose range up to about 100 kGy. The low\nintroduction rates of deep $N_\\textrm{it,acc/don}$ in $\\gamma$-irradiated\nsensors resulted in high sensitivity of $\\rho_\\textrm{int}$ to the presence and\npeak doping of $p$-stop above the lowest dose of 7 kGy in the study. Because of\nthe advantageous influence of radiation-induced accumulation of deep\n$N_\\textrm{it}$ on the inter-electrode isolation, position sensitive $n$-on-$p$\nsensors without isolation implants may be considered for future HEP-experiments\nwhere the radiation is largely due to hadrons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
