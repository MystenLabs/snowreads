This\npaper contributes to research focused on the robustness of FL models in object\ndetection, hereby presenting a comparative study with conventional techniques\nusing a hybrid dataset for small object detection. Our findings demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of FL over centralized training models and different deep\nlearning techniques when tested on test data recorded in a different\nenvironment with a variety of object viewpoints, lighting conditions, cluttered\nbackgrounds, etc. These results highlight the potential of FL in achieving\nrobust global models that perform efficiently even in unseen environments. The\nstudy provides valuable insights for deploying resilient object detection\nmodels in manufacturing environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6jpLBITfU9MrsjmHP8S_vc3xy7fukGWoaFY5XmdO2Ek","pdfSize":"21938122"}
