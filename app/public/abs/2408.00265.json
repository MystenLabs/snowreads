Votes are aggregated\nwithin the groups by the winner-take-all rule or the proportional rule, and the\ngroup-level decisions are combined to determine the winner. We observe that,\ncompared with the theoretical prediction, turnout is significantly lower in the\nminority camp (the Titanic effect) and significantly higher in the majority\ncamp (the behavioral bandwagon effect), and these effects are stronger under\nthe proportional rule than under the winner-take-all rule. As a result, the\ndistribution of voter welfare becomes more unequal than theoretically\npredicted, and this welfare effect is stronger under the proportional rule than\nunder the winner-take-all rule.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5tM_ubRFjrlkhJtBkliQDlI1XnyP6DUS8tYpzm92xng","pdfSize":"880246"}
