This is in large part due to the absence of\nevidence of intermediate forms. This work introduces a new open corpus, the\nMoly\\'e corpus, which combines stereotypical representations of three kinds of\nlanguage variation in Europe with early attestations of French-based Creole\nlanguages across a period of 400 years. It is intended to facilitate future\nresearch on the continuity between contact situations in Europe and Creolophone\n(former) colonies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
