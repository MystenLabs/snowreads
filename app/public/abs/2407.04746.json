However, clutters\ngenerated by obstacles and static objects are always stronger and\nnon-stationary, which results in heavy impacts on moving targets detection. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a moving target detection method based\non Range-Doppler domain compensation and cancellation for UAV mounted dual\nchannel radar. In the proposed method, phase compensation is performed on the\ndual channel in range-Doppler domain and then cancellation is utilized to\nachieve roughly clutters suppression. Next, a filter is constructed based on\nthe cancellation result and the raw echoes, which is used to suppress\nstationary clutter furthermore. Finally, mismatch imaging is used to focus\nmoving target for detection. Both simulation and UAV-based experiment results\nare analyzed to verify the efficacy and practicability of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_qBpMA0Ivb28t5BcscCGXka4oFd1MWKzwEZ-Va_1BPE","pdfSize":"4853428"}
