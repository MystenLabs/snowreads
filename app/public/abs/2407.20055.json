In this\nletter, we construct an equivalent phase model for the Izhikevich model and\napply the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, to derive the mean field dynamics in terms of\nthe Kuramoto order parameter. In addition, we show that by defining an\nappropriate order parameter in the voltage-firing rate framework, the conformal\nmapping of Montbri\\'o et al., which relates the two mean-field descriptions,\nremains valid.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
