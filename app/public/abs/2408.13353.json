It has recently been shown\nthat this disk is slowly precessing at a rate consistent with zero. Here we\ndemonstrate using N-body methods that apsidally-aligned eccentric disks can\nform with a significant (~0.5) fraction of orbits counter-rotating as the\nresult of a gravitational wave recoil kick of merging supermassive black holes.\nHigher amplitude kicks map to a larger retrograde fraction in the surrounding\nstellar population which in turns results in slow precession. We furthermore\nshow that disks with significant counter-rotation are more stable (that is,\napsidal-alignment is most pronounced and long lasting), more eccentric, and\nhave the highest rates of stars entering the black hole's tidal disruption\nradius\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
