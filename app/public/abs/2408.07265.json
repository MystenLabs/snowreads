In\nthis work, we demonstrate its utility and versatility at hand of a simple\nexample: We construct a new fault-tolerant circuit for the toric-code phase by\ntraversing its path integral on a $(x,y,z)$ cubic lattice in the $x+y$\ndirection. The circuit acts on qubits on a square lattice, and alternates\nbetween horizontal nearest-neighbor $CX$ gates and vertical nearest-neighbor\n$ZZ$ and $XX$ measurements. We show how to incorporate boundaries and corners\ninto the fault-tolerant circuit and how to perform topologically protected\nlogic gates. As a specific example, we consider performing a fault-tolerant\nlogical $ZZ$ measurement via lattice surgery of two spatial rectangular blocks\nof our fault-tolerant circuit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fqqmSEO3k1uyG-GfTzEBfflGfwi8-SL0KTMuLLAtWEI","pdfSize":"1033542"}
