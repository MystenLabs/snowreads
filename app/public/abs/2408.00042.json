Here, we determine\nthe symmetry-enforced $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies of non-magnetic\ncentrosymmetric materials with weak and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For\nweak (i.e., negligible) SOC, crystal symmetries can enforce Dirac nodal lines\nprotected by a $\\pi$-Berry phase, while for strong SOC, crystal symmetries can\ngive rise to nontrival weak $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologies in 2D subplanes of the 3D\nBrillouin zone. We catalogue all centrosymmetric space groups whose symmetries\nenforce these $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies. Suitable material realizations\nare identified and experimental signatures of the supertopologies, such as\nquantum spin Hall states, are being discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zqJgOm0VM1HPdzlLoC4vWQmox6ObJ8EkaPAd4TACRyE","pdfSize":"1981848"}
