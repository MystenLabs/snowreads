However, datasets with ground truth\ngenerated by expensive airbone Lidar exhibit limited quantity and diversity,\nconstraining the effectiveness of supervised networks. In contrast,\nunsupervised learning methods can leverage the increasing availability of\nvery-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images, offering considerable\npotential in the realm of stereo matching. Motivated by this intuition, we\npropose a novel unsupervised stereo matching network for VHR remote sensing\nimages. A light-weight module to bridge confidence with predicted error is\nintroduced to refine the core model. Robust unsupervised losses are formulated\nto enhance network convergence. The experimental results on US3D and WHU-Stereo\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed network achieves superior accuracy\ncompared to other unsupervised networks and exhibits better generalization\ncapabilities than supervised models.
