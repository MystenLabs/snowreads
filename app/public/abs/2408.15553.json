We propose a perceptual loss\nfunction to be used in deep neural network based audio watermarking systems.\nThe loss is based on the noise-to-mask ratio (NMR), which is a model of the\npsychoacoustic masking effect characteristic of the human ear. We use the NMR\nloss between marked and host signals to train the deep neural models and we\nevaluate the objective quality with PEAQ and the subjective quality with a\nMUSHRA test. Both objective and subjective tests show that models trained with\nNMR loss generate more transparent watermarks than models trained with the\nconventionally used MSE loss\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
