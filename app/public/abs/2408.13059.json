A construction for taking the `profinite direct sum' of\nan infinite family of profinite modules indexed over a profinite space has been\nfound to be useful in the study of homology of profinite groups, but hitherto\nthe appropriate dual construction for studying cohomology with coefficients in\ndiscrete modules has not been studied. This paper remedies this gap in the\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
