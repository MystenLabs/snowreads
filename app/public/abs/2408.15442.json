The couplings between proton\n($p$) and nucleon ($N$), denoted by $g_V^p g_V^N$, $g_p^p g_p^N$ are\nconstrained to be less than $1.4 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $2.7\\times 10^{-6}$,\nrespectively, for boson masses around 5 keV. The coupling constant $g_A^p\ng_A^N$ is constrained to be less than $1.0 \\times 10^{-18}$ for boson masses\n$\\leq 100$ eV. It is noteworthy that this study represents the first instance\nin which constraints on $g_V g_V$ have been established through the analysis of\nthe potential term $V_2 + V_3$ for both tritium deuteride and hydrogen\ndeuteride molecules.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
