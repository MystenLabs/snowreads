Despite significant advances, the microscopic\nprocesses governing the formation of these states remain largely unknown. This\nstudy discloses the nuclear quantum dynamics of $\\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ when excited\nby THz laser pumping. We use a first-principles machine-learning approach\naccounting for all atomistic degrees of freedom to examine the time-resolved\nenergy flow across phonon modes following the photoexcitation, revealing the\nmechanism underpinning the observed phonon upconversion and quantifying the\nlifetime of the out-of-equilibrium motion. Crucially, our simulations predict\nthat THz pump pulses can generate persistent out-of-equilibrium stress capable\nof inducing polar order. We observe a correlation between the experimentally\nmeasured lifetime of the transient inversion-symmetry-broken state and the\nduration of the out-of-equilibrium nuclear state. This work not only explains\nthe experimental results on $\\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ but also establishes a framework\nfor simulating the photoexcited quantum dynamics of nuclei from first\nprinciples without any empirical input. It lays the groundwork for systematic\nexplorations of complex materials sensitive to photoexcitation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cV5fdGJMbSLA0q6zZYXm2vg4FiIklWT_WkKtecno9FM","pdfSize":"1255644"}
