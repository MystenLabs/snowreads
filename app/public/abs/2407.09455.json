The connection\nbetween $Q$ and $TCF$ is demonstrated here with a phenomenological anharmonic\noscillator model. Specifically, it is shown that the same nonlinear terms\nresponsible for the $TCF$ set an upper limit on the resonator's $Q$. A concise\nformula is found to estimate this loss and is shown to be closely related to\nWoodruff's formula for Akhiezer damping. The use of this formula is illustrated\nby extending the model to an important class of MEMS; piezoelectric resonators.\nFinally, the model is applied to published data for an AlN-on-diamond\npiezoelectric resonator. The focus here is on MEMS resonators, but the method\nshould apply broadly to any resonance with non-zero $TCF$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ax5auPH_Y3jqp9Jq3f1zUrMH-NLi6OdEJVcea5o7Y1s","pdfSize":"419917"}
