The research aims to improve\nthe quality of data transmission methods and improve the efficiency and\nreliability of surveillance systems by exploiting the mobility and adaptability\nof UAVs does the proposed protocol intelligently distribute network traffic\nacross multiple channels, considering the load of each channel, While\naddressing challenges such as load balancing, this study investigates the\neffectiveness of the protocol by simulations or practical tests on The expected\nresults have improved UAV-based surveillance systems, more flexible and\nefficient networks for applications such as security, emergency response and\nthe environment alignment of monitoring -Offering infrastructures, which\ncontribute to efficient and reliable monitoring solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
