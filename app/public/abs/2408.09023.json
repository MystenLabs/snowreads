The topological nature of MTJJs\nmanifests as a modulation of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) in the\nnormal metal that may be probed by tunneling measurements. We show that one can\nreveal this modulation by measuring the resistance of diffusive MTJJs with\nnormal contacts, which shows rich structure as a function of the phase\ndifferences $\\{\\phi_i \\}$. Our approach demonstrates a simple yet powerful\ntechnique for exploring topological effects in MTJJs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u-cC32eHzjelH4KDfI3A0UMWaE5DgdMrwXmqeMxc6zY","pdfSize":"11359894"}
