Blind-Match introduces a HE-optimized cosine similarity computation\nmethod, where the key idea is to divide the feature vector into smaller parts\nfor processing rather than computing the entire vector at once. By optimizing\nthe number of these parts, Blind-Match minimizes execution time while ensuring\ndata privacy through HE. Blind-Match achieves superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods across various biometric datasets. On the LFW face\ndataset, Blind-Match attains a 99.63% Rank-1 accuracy with a 128-dimensional\nfeature vector, demonstrating its robustness in face recognition tasks. For\nfingerprint identification, Blind-Match achieves a remarkable 99.55% Rank-1\naccuracy on the PolyU dataset, even with a compact 16-dimensional feature\nvector, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art method, Blind-Touch,\nwhich achieves only 59.17%. Furthermore, Blind-Match showcases practical\nefficiency in large-scale biometric identification scenarios, such as Naver\nCloud's FaceSign, by processing 6,144 biometric samples in 0.74 seconds using a\n128-dimensional feature vector.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
