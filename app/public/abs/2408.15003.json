These networks consist of multiple layers that\nrecord different relationships between the same entities or incorporate data\nfrom different sources. Both methods are formulated as gradient flows of\nsuitable energy functionals: the first (MPBTV) builds on the minimization of a\nbalanced total variation functional, which we show to be equivalent to\nmultiplex modularity maximization, while the second (DGFM3) directly maximizes\nmultiplex modularity. The resulting non-linear matrix-valued ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) are solved efficiently by a graph\nMerriman--Bence--Osher (MBO) scheme. Key to the efficiency is the approximate\nintegration of the discrete linear differential operators by truncated\neigendecompositions in the matrix exponential function. Numerical experiments\non several real-world multiplex networks show that our methods are competitive\nwith the state of the art with respect to various metrics. Their major benefit\nis a significant reduction of computational complexity leading to runtimes that\nare orders of magnitude faster for large multiplex networks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
