The system outputs we submitted come from the following\nthree categories: 1) domain fine-tuned T5-like models including Biomedical-T5\nand Lay-SciFive; 2) fine-tuned BARTLarge model with controllable attributes\n(via tokens) BART-w-CTs; 3) ChatGPTprompting. We also present the work we\ncarried out for this task on BioGPT finetuning. In the official automatic\nevaluation using SARI scores, BeeManc ranks 2nd among all teams and our model\nLaySciFive ranks 3rd among all 13 evaluated systems. In the official human\nevaluation, our model BART-w-CTs ranks 2nd on Sentence-Simplicity (score\n92.84), 3rd on Term-Simplicity (score 82.33) among all 7 evaluated systems; It\nalso produced a high score 91.57 on Fluency in comparison to the highest score\n93.53. In the second round of submissions, our team using ChatGPT-prompting\nranks the 2nd in several categories including simplified term accuracy score\n92.26 and completeness score 96.58, and a very similar score on faithfulness\nscore 95.3 to re-evaluated PLABA-base-1 (95.73) via human evaluations. Our\ncodes, fine-tuned models, prompts, and data splits from the system development\nstage will be available at https://github.com/ HECTA-UoM/PLABA-MU\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
