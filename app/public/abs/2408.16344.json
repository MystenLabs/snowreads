A path in\n$G$ is non-null if the product of the labels along the path is not the neutral\nelement of $\\Gamma$. We prove that for every finite group $\\Gamma$, non-null\n$S$-$T$ paths in $\\Gamma$-labelled graphs exhibit the half-integral\nErd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa property. More precisely, there is a function $f$, depending\non $\\Gamma$, such that for every $\\Gamma$-labelled graph $G$, subsets of\nvertices $S$ and $T$, and integer $k$, one of the following objects exists: a\nfamily $\\cal F$ consisting of $k$ non-null $S$-$T$ paths in $G$ such that every\nvertex of $G$ participates in at most two paths of $\\cal F$; or a set $X$\nconsisting of at most $f(k)$ vertices that meets every non-null $S$-$T$ path in\n$G$. This in particular proves that in undirected graphs $S$-$T$ paths of odd\nlength have the half-integral Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
