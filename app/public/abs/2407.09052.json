We propose a system that\ncan generate, from simple MIDI melodies, tablatures enriched by fingerings,\narticulations, and expressive techniques. The basic fingering is derived by\nsolving a constrained and multi-attribute optimization problem, which derives\nthe best position of the fretting hand, not just the finger used at each\nmoment.Then, by analyzing statistical data from the mySongBook corpus, the most\ncommon clich{\\'e}s and biomechanical feasibility, articulations, and expressive\ntechniques are introduced. Finally, the obtained output is converted into\nMusicXML format, which allows for easy visualization and use. The quality of\nthe tablatures derived and the high configurability of the proposed approach\ncan have several impacts, in particular in the fields of instrumental teaching,\nassisted composition and arranging, and computational expressive music\nperformance models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
