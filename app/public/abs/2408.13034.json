However, as human biases\nperpetuate from pairwise comparisons to recovered rankings, they affect\nalgorithmic decision making. In this paper, we introduce the problem of\nfairness-aware ranking recovery from pairwise comparisons. We propose a\ngroup-conditioned accuracy measure which quantifies fairness of rankings\nrecovered from pairwise comparisons. We evaluate the impact of state-of-the-art\nranking recovery algorithms and sampling approaches on accuracy and fairness of\nthe recovered rankings, using synthetic and empirical data. Our results show\nthat Fairness-Aware PageRank and GNNRank with FA*IR post-processing effectively\nmitigate existing biases in pairwise comparisons and improve the overall\naccuracy of recovered rankings. We highlight limitations and strengths of\ndifferent approaches, and provide a Python package to facilitate replication\nand future work on fair ranking recovery from pairwise comparisons.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
