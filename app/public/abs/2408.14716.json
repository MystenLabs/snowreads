The equivalence is obtained by a\nSoergel-theoretic description of both sides which extends results for\nfinite-dimensional flag varieties by Taylor and the first author.\n  Universal Koszul duality bundles together a whole family of equivalences for\neach point of a maximal torus. At the identity, it recovers an ungraded version\nof Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel's and Bezrukavnikov-Yun's Koszul duality for\nequivariant and unipotently monodromic sheaves. It also generalizes\nSoergel-theoretic descriptions for monodromic categories on finite-dimensional\nflag varieties by Lusztig-Yun, Gouttard and the second author. For affine\nKac-Moody groups, our work sheds new light on the conjectured quantum Satake\nequivalences by Cautis-Kamnitzer and Gaitsgory.\n  On our way, we establish foundations on six functors for reduced K-motives\nand introduce a formalism of constructible monodromic sheaves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
