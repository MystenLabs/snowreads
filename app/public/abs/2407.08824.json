Each\ncryptic clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the\ncrossword grid (in common with regular crosswords), and `wordplay' that proves\nthat the answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer\nis correct without needing crossing words to confirm it). Using an existing\ncryptic wordplay proving framework (operating on Python proofs created by an\nLLM), we show that it is possible to distinguish between correct answers and\nalmost-correct ones based upon whether the wordplay `works'.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
