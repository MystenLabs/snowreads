Building on the spherically symmetric and\nstatic black hole solution from \\cite{Kelly:2020uwj}, we trace its origin to\nNon-Linear Electrodynamics (NED) with electric and magnetic charges and check\nthe energy conditions (NEC, WEC, SEC). By extending the geometry using the\nSimpson-Visser procedure, we construct a black hole-wormhole bounce structure,\ninfluenced by LQG parameters. We analyze the horizon structure to constrain\nparameters for black holes and wormholes, and examine curvature and new sources\nincluding a phantom-type scalar field to ensure spacetime regularity and\nadherence to energy conditions. Thermodynamic properties are also studied,\nrevealing the existence of remnants and phase transitions. Additionally, we\nderive a rotating black bounce solution, verifying its regularity, and putting\nforward that the spherical bouncing surface turns into an ellipsoid with no\nring singularity. Finally, we find that increasing the LQG parameter leads to\nsmaller ergospheres and reduced shadows, with potential implications for\nobservational astrophysics and quantum gravitational signatures.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
