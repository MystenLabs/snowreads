Numerical\nrelativity is a tool used to help understand the behaviours of metric and\nmatter fields in dynamical, strong gravity situations. It has been used to\nstudy a range of situations involving fundamental fields, including\nsuperradiance, modified gravity, dynamical friction, dark matter accretion and\nearly universe cosmology. The purpose of this course is to provide some\nbackground and hands-on experience in numerical relativity that will help\nstudents to better understand the possibilities provided by this tool, as well\nas its limitations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
