This mixed formulation is established by adding an auxiliary\nvariable to control the divergence of the field. The approximation space for\nthe original variables is constructed by patch reconstruction with exactly one\ndegree of freedom per element in each dimension and the auxiliary variable is\napproximated by the piecewise constant space. We prove the optimal convergence\nrate under the energy norm and also suboptimal $L^2$ convergence using a\nduality approach. Numerical results are provided to verify the theoretical\nanalysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
