Nevertheless, there is a significant gap in exploring the impact of food\nintake on physiological indicators (e.g., weight) over time. This paper\naddresses this gap by introducing the DietDiary dataset, which encompasses\ndaily dietary diaries and corresponding weight measurements of real users.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel task of weight prediction with a dietary diary\nthat aims to leverage historical food intake and weight to predict future\nweights. To tackle this task, we propose a model-agnostic time series\nforecasting framework. Specifically, we introduce a Unified Meal Representation\nLearning (UMRL) module to extract representations for each meal. Additionally,\nwe design a diet-aware loss function to associate food intake with weight\nvariations. By conducting experiments on the DietDiary dataset with two\nstate-of-the-art time series forecasting models, NLinear and iTransformer, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior performance compared\nto the original models. We make our dataset, code, and models publicly\navailable at: https://yxg1005.github.io/weight-prediction/.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"l2JPLDawpcGzNoSZUIyn_iLUKUFmKVbsfkWmGWNhcV0","pdfSize":"24035048"}
