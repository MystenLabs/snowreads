To fill this research gap, we provide a pioneering review\ncontrasting computational with human perception from the perspectives of\nmethods and tasks. Overall, computational approaches rely on computer-driven\nmodels to perceive historical sound changes on etymological datasets, while\nhuman approaches use listener-driven models to perceive ongoing sound changes\non recording corpora. Despite their differences, both approaches complement\neach other on phonetic and acoustic levels, showing the potential to achieve a\nmore comprehensive perception of sound change. Moreover, we call for a\ncomparative study on the datasets used by both approaches to investigate the\ninfluence of historical sound changes on ongoing changes. Lastly, we discuss\nthe applications of sound change in computational linguistics, and point out\nthat perceiving sound change alone is insufficient, as many processes of\nlanguage change are complex, with entangled changes at syntactic, semantic, and\nphonetic levels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
