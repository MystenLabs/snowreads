Motivated by real-world carpooling and\ncrowdshipping scenarios, we introduce an additional constraint imposing a\nmaximum number on the number of pickups per trip. This results in the\nDial-a-Ride Problem with Limited Pickups per Trip (DARP-LPT). We apply a\nfragment-based method for DARP-LPT, where a fragment is a partial path.\nSpecifically, we extend two formulations from Rist & Forbes (2021): the\nFragment Flow Formulation (FFF) and the Fragment Assignment Formulation (FAF).\nWe establish FFF's superiority over FAF, both from a theoretical as well as\nfrom a computational perspective. Furthermore, our results show that FFF and\nFAF significantly outperform traditional arc-based formulations in terms of\nsolution quality and time. Additionally, compared to the two existing fragment\nsets, one with longer partial paths and another with shorter ones, our newly\ngenerated fragment sets perform better in terms of solution quality and time\nwhen fed into FFF.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
