If the nucleus movement is\ncontinuous, a second order phase transition without latent heat results,\nwhereas an abrupt nucleus displacement indicates a first order phase transition\nwith accompanying latent heat. In this paper an Hamiltonian including\nelectron-phonon coupling (EPC) as proposed by Kristoffel and\nKonsel\\cite{Kristoffel1973} is taken. Contrary to their treatment, both the\nkinetic energy of the nucleus and its position are treated. The interaction of\nthe many electron system with the single nucleus is taken into account by the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation and perturbative expressions for the free\nenergies are derived. The nuclei corrections due to the entangled electrons are\nfound to be minor, but highlight the importance of the symmetry breaking at low\ntemperature. Furthermore the free energy for a canonical ensemble is computed,\nwhereas Kristoffel and Konsel used a grand canonical ensemble, which allows to\nderive more stringent bounds on the free energy. For the zero-order nucleus\ncorrection the shift of the phase transition temperature by evaluating the free\nenergy is deduced.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"012b_UNrUmxpu_cgpT_ijaw1ZXJEOr7wKoy46xm8UyY","pdfSize":"421656","objectId":"0x54dedd4084c69b8475a82f86fda64848278078f9bf7a397596c5943b0ff9cb39","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
