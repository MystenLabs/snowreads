Using the web spider or crawler can automatically search and collect a\nhuge amount of internet information. As one of the most popular web crawler\nframeworks, Scrapy is robust in abundant functions but weak in easy operation.\nIn this paper, we provide a framework Anywhere, for optimising the usage\nfeeling and improving the use efficiency of the web crawling management of\nScrapy. We analyse the whole workflow of a web crawling project of Scrapy and\ndesign two main functions in Anywhere, one is quickly generating a Scrapy\nproject with the preset temperatures, the other is repeatable configuration\nfunction for the Scrapy project setting. Beside, with Anywhere, users can\neasily directly manage multiple Scrapy projects with a file folders\narchitecture. Compared with normal Scrapy project interactive coding\ndevelopment, we test Anywhere with enough experiments that show Anywhere can\nimprove the development efficiency of Scrapy projects to about 200\\%. For the\nmultiple project management in code interaction level, the developing\nefficiency is improved to about 300\\%. We simplify the procedure to quickly\ngenerate a simple spider project with Scrapy. Anywhere can assist the\ndevelopment of Scrapy is useful for the design of large batch concurrent\nprojects at coding level.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
