Previous methods for outbreak forecasting have\nfaced limitations by not utilizing multiple sources of input and yielding\nsuboptimal performance due to the limited availability of data. In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach to address the challenges of infectious disease\nforecasting. We introduce a Multilateral Attention-enhanced GRU model that\nleverages information from multiple sources, thus enabling a comprehensive\nanalysis of factors influencing the spread of a pandemic. By incorporating\nattention mechanisms within a GRU framework, our model can effectively capture\ncomplex relationships and temporal dependencies in the data, leading to\nimproved forecasting performance. Further, we have curated a well-structured\nmulti-source dataset for the recent COVID-19 pandemic that the research\ncommunity can utilize as a great resource to conduct experiments and analysis\non time-series forecasting. We evaluated the proposed model on our COVID-19\ndataset and reported the output in terms of RMSE and MAE. The experimental\nresults provide evidence that our proposed model surpasses existing techniques\nin terms of performance. We also performed performance gain and qualitative\nanalysis on our dataset to evaluate the impact of the attention mechanism and\nshow that the proposed model closely follows the trajectory of the pandemic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
