Using\nthe Foster-Lyapunov stability theory, we develop a criterion on the parameters\nto ensure mean boundedness of the traffic state. Then, we develop a policy\niteration algorithm that learns the parameters from realized sample paths.\nImportantly, the piecewise-linear function is both integrated into the Lyapunov\nfunction for stability analysis and used as a proxy of the value function for\npolicy iteration; hence, stability is inherently ensured for the learned\npolicy. Finally, we demonstrate via a numerical example that the proposed\nalgorithm learns a near-optimal routing policy with an acceptable optimality\ngap but significantly higher computational efficiency compared with a standard\nneural network-based algorithm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
