This paper proposes a robust method to estimate both\nthe data mean and the PCA projection matrix by learning discriminant sample\nweights from data containing outliers. Each sample in the dataset is assigned a\nweight, and the proposed algorithm iteratively learns the weights, the mean,\nand the projection matrix, respectively. Specifically, when the mean and the\nprojection matrix are available, via fine-grained analysis of outliers, a\nweight for each sample is learned hierarchically so that outliers have small\nweights while normal samples have large weights. With the learned weights\navailable, a weighted optimization problem is solved to estimate both the data\nmean and the projection matrix. Because the learned weights discriminate\noutliers from normal samples, the adverse influence of outliers is mitigated\ndue to the corresponding small weights. Experiments on toy data, UCI dataset,\nand face dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in\nestimating the mean and the projection matrix from the data containing\noutliers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
