We review both visualization and psychophysics literature to understand\nwhere quantitative evidence exists on age differences in visual perception.\nUsing contrast sensitivity data from the literature we show how the differences\nbetween visualizations for different age groups can be predicted using a new\nmodel of visible frequency range with age. The model assumed that at threshold\nvalues some visual data will not be visible to older people (spatial frequency\n> 2 and contrast <=0.01). We apply this result to a practical visualization and\nshow an example that at higher levels of contrast, the visual signal should be\nperceivable by all viewers over 20. Universally usable visualization should use\na contrast of 0.02 or higher and be designed to avoid spatial frequencies\ngreater than eight cycles per degree to accommodate all ages. There remains\nmuch research to do on to translate psychophysics results to practical\nquantitative guidelines for visualization producers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
