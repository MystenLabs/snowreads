Here we study experimentally and theoretically the\nmaximum spreading diameter of graphene oxide suspension droplets impacting on a\nsmooth surface for a wide range of concentrations and impact velocities of up\nto 6 g/l and 3 m/s, respectively. As the particle concentration increases the\nrheological behaviour changes from a viscous fluid to a shear-thinning yield\nstress fluid and the maximum spreading diameter decreases. The rheology for all\nconcentrations is well described by a Herschel-Bulkley model that allows us to\ndetermine the characteristic viscosity during spreading. We use this viscosity\nto develop an energy balance model that takes into account the viscous\ndissipation and change in surface energies to find the maximum spread diameter\nfor a given impact velocity. The model contains one non-dimensional parameter\nthat encodes both the dynamic contact angle during spreading and the droplet\nshape at maximum spread. Our model is in good agreement with our data at all\nconcentrations and agrees well with literature data on Newtonian fluids.\nFurthermore, the model gives the correct limits in the viscous and capillary\nregime and can be solved analytically for Newtonian fluids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
