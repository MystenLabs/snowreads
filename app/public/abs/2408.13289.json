Initially, the strategy\nassesses electric energy interactions between microgrids and distribution\nnetworks to establish a foundation for collaborative scheduling. The two-stage\npricing mechanism initiates with a leader-follower game, wherein the microgrid\noperator acts as the leader and users as followers. Subsequently, it adjusts EV\ntariffs based on the game's equilibrium, taking into account factors such as\nbattery degradation and travel needs to optimize EVs' electricity consumption.\nFurthermore, a bi-level optimization model refines power interactions and\npricing strategies across the network, significantly enhancing demand response\ncapabilities and economic outcomes. Simulation results demonstrate that this\nstrategy not only increases renewable energy consumption but also reduces\nenergy costs, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of\nthe system.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
