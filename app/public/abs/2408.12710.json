Unlike existing solutions that\nrequire users to keep the eye-gaze center on the target actively, CasualGaze\nallows users to glance at the target object to complete the selection simply.\nTo understand casual gaze behavior, we studied the spatial distribution of\ncasual gaze for different layouts and user behavior in a simulated real-world\nenvironment. Results revealed the impacts of object parameters, the speed and\nrandomness features of casual gaze, and special gaze behavior patterns in\n\"blurred areas\". Based on the results, we devised CasualGaze algorithms,\nemploying a bivariate Gaussian distribution model along with temporal\ncompensation and voting algorithms for robust target prediction. Usability\nevaluation study showed significant improvements in recognition and selection\nspeed for CasualGaze compared with two baseline techniques. Subjective ratings\nand comments further supported the preference for CasualGaze regarding\nefficiency, accuracy, and stability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
