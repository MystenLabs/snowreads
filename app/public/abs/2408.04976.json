In this\ncontext logic locking was used to protect the RISC-V processor design during\nthe untrusted manufacturing process by using key-driven logic gates to\nobfuscate the original design. Although this method defends against malicious\nmodifications, such as hardware Trojans, logic locking's impact on the RISC-V\nprocessor's data confidentiality during runtime has not been thoroughly\nexamined. In this study, we evaluate the impact of logic locking on data\nconfidentiality. By altering the logic locking key of the MiG-V while running\nSSL cryptographic algorithms, we identify data leakages resulting from the\nexploitation of the logic locking hardware. We show that changing a single bit\nof the logic locking key can expose 100% of the cryptographic encryption key.\nThis research reveals a critical security flaw in logic locking, highlighting\nthe need for comprehensive security assessments beyond logic locking\nkey-recovery attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
