As it becomes quite technical in the details, a lengthy\nintroduction surveys the developments at a less detailed level.\n  The text, beginning from the second section, first deals with some model\ntheoretic algebra of fields, followed by an extended study of three associated\nfamilies of simple groups coming from the theory of Tits buildings, Moufang\npolygons, and Timmesfeld's theory of exotic analogs of SL_2.\n  The field theoretic part is fundamental ({\\S}2). The rest of the paper\nrelates this to group theoretic constructions, with two sections surveying the\nconsequences for the original Tits and Timmesfeld theory before concentrating\non the more exotic groups associated with Moufang polygons.\n  A good deal of the group theoretical material is expository, aimed to make\nthe relevant structural information meaningful to those coming from the\ndirection of model theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
