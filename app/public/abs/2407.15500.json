This makes Synthetic Image Detection (SID) an essential tool for\ndefending against AI-generated harmful content. Current SID methods typically\nresize input images to a fixed resolution or perform center-cropping due to\ncomputational concerns, leading to challenges in effectively detecting\nartifacts in high-resolution images. To this end, we propose TextureCrop, a\nnovel image pre-processing technique. By focusing on high-frequency image parts\nwhere generation artifacts are prevalent, TextureCrop effectively enhances SID\naccuracy while maintaining manageable memory requirements. Experimental results\ndemonstrate a consistent improvement in AUC across various detectors by 5.7%\ncompared to center cropping and by 14% compared to resizing, across\nhigh-resolution images from the Forensynths and Synthbuster datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C4hfCQg-ByY16sZUpsRa36PX6FBYEPq-UySp8gLChbo","pdfSize":"10140102"}
