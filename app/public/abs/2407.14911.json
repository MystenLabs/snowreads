The\nperformance of deep learning models is intricately linked to training data\ndiversity and quantity, posing issues for plant pest and disease datasets that\nremain underdeveloped. This study addresses these challenges by constructing a\ncomprehensive dataset and proposing an advanced network architecture that\ncombines Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM). The dataset\ncomprises diverse plant species and pest categories, making it one of the\nlargest and most varied in the field. The proposed network architecture\ndemonstrates effectiveness in addressing plant pest and disease recognition\ntasks, achieving notable detection accuracy. This approach offers a viable\nsolution for rapid, efficient, and cost-effective plant pest and disease\ndetection, thereby reducing agricultural production costs. Our code and dataset\nwill be publicly available to advance research in plant pest and disease\nrecognition the GitHub repository at https://github.com/WASSER2545/GPID-22\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
