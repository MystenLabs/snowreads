The basic motivation for\nthis work is that the reconstruction is performed from a holographic origin,\nwhich has its roots in the black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. Dark\nenergy models inspired by holographic prescription are used to reconstruct the\nf(Q) gravity models. Two such models, namely the Granda-Oliveros holographic\ndark energy model and its generalization, the Chen- Jing model are considered\nfor the study. Different scale factors are used and a thorough reconstruction\nscheme is set up using the dark energy models. The observationally constrained\nvalues of the free model parameters have been used to form the reconstructed\nmodels. Finally, a thorough investigation of the energy conditions has been\nperformed to check the cosmological viability of the reconstructed f(Q) models.\nAs an outcome, we get some very promising and cosmologically viable f(Q) models\nthat present some interesting properties and demand further investigation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"f2XJVlPHKvZWYSPOrXUzUagAp5tJ3pTVG_6uVg0sUT4","pdfSize":"6632123"}
