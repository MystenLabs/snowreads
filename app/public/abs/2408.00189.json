A key challenge has\nbeen developing versatile platforms for exploring cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) of quantum materials. Here, we demonstrate and probe\nultrastrong light-matter coupling in atomically-thin van der Waals materials.\nWe developed a broadband time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated,\ndual-gated, two-dimensional quantum materials with sub-wavelength photon\nconfinement at terahertz frequencies. Using bilayer graphene as a model system,\nwe perform spectroscopic studies across a wide range of frequencies and gate\nvoltages. For the first time, we measure the field-tunable band gap of bilayer\ngraphene at terahertz frequencies while simultaneously observing clear\nsignatures of ultrastrong coupling, with interaction strengths exceeding\n$\\Omega/\\omega\\approx 40\\%$. Our work bridges the gap between theoretical\npredictions and experimental implementation of cavity QED in van der Waals\nmaterials, paving the way for further studies of exotic phases and novel\nlight-matter states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
