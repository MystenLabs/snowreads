LoE framework categorizes medical publications into 7 distinct levels\nbased on the underlying empirical evidence. Despite LoE framework's relevance\nin medical research and evidence-based practice, only few medical publications\nexplicitly state their LoE. Therefore, we develop a classification model for\nautomatically assigning LoE to medical publications, which successfully\nclassifies over 26 million documents in MEDLINE database into LoE classes. The\nsubsequent retrieval experiments on TREC PM datasets show substantial\nimprovements in retrieval relevance, when LoE is used as a search filter.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"zem-oztYuErGMHFOgtPeI8DYutmU80xqJbfpbkuVXoI","pdfSize":"153553"}
