Many contexts have already addressed technology-enhanced\nlearning, but educators at different educational levels now need to develop AI\nliteracy and the ability to integrate appropriate AI usage into their teaching.\nWe take into account this objective, along with the creative learning design,\nto create a formative intervention that enables preservice teachers, in-service\nteachers, and EdTech specialists to effectively incorporate AI into their\nteaching practices. We developed the formative intervention with Terra Numerica\nand Maison de l'Intelligence Artificielle in two phases in order to enhance\ntheir understanding of AI and foster its creative application in learning\ndesign. Participants reflect on AI's potential in teaching and learning by\nexploring different activities that can integrate AI literacy in education,\nincluding its ethical considerations and potential for innovative pedagogy. The\napproach emphasises not only acculturating professionals to AI but also\nempowering them to collaboratively design AI-enhanced educational activities\nthat promote learner engagement and personalised learning experiences. Through\nthis process, participants in the workshops develop the skills and mindset\nnecessary to effectively leverage AI while maintaining a critical awareness of\nits implications in education.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
