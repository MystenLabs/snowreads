Complementary information from\nNIRCam imaging and NIRSpec (both low- and medium-resolution) spectroscopy\nreveal a compact system (Re ~110 pc) characterised by a steeply rising star\nformation history, which is reflected in the inferred young stellar age (t ~ 3\nMyr, light-weighted), high star-formation rate surface density ({\\Sigma}SFR ~\n72 M yr-1 kpc-2), high ionisation parameter (log(U) ~ -1.5), low metallicity\n(12+log(O/H) ~ 7.5), and low carbon-over-oxygen abundance ([C/O] = -0.64).\nLeveraging the detection of N iii]1750 we derive nitrogen-over-oxygen abundance\n([N/O] ~ 0) higher than the plateau followed by low-redshift galaxies of\nsimilar metallicity, possibly revealing the imprint from (very) massive stars\non the ISM enrichment and favouring a top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF)\nscenario. Massive stars powering a hard radiation field are also required to\nexplain the rest-frame UV line ratios, though the presence of the\nhigh-excitation [Ne v]{\\lambda}3426 emission line possibly hints at additional\nionization from an AGN. We also report the tentative detection of Ly{\\alpha}\nemission in the G140M spectrum, shifted by ~450 km/s redward of the systemic\nredshift. Combined with a modelling of the Ly{\\alpha} spectral break, we rule\nout the presence of very high column densities of neutral gas pertaining to\nlocal absorbers, as well as any extended surrounding ionised bubble, suggesting\nthat JADES-GS-z9-0 has not yet significantly contributed to cosmic\nReionization.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
