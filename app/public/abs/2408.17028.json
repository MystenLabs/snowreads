The objective is to guarantee that at least a certain block in\nmulti-links is fully delivered within their deadlines, which is referred to as\ndelivery ratio. Compared with existing models that focus on maximizing\nthroughput and ultra-low latency, which makes bandwidth resource allocation and\nuser satisfaction locally optimized, immersive video streaming needs to\nguarantee more high-priority block delivery within personalized deadlines. In\nthis paper, we propose a deadline and priority-constrained immersive video\nstreaming transmission scheduling scheme. It builds an accurate bandwidth\nprediction model that can sensitively assist scheduling decisions. It divides\nvideo streaming into various media elements and performs scheduling based on\nthe user's personalized latency sensitivity thresholds and the media element's\npriority. We evaluate our scheme via trace-driven simulations. Compared with\nexisting models, the results further demonstrate the superiority of our scheme\nwith 12{\\%}-31{\\%} gains in quality of experience (QoE).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
