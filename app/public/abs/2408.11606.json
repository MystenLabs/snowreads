A brute force method for finding\nsolutions would be to systematically substitute possible integer solutions and\ncheck for equality.\n  Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm which can find marked\nindices in a list very efficiently. By treating the indices as the integer\nvariables in the diophantine equation, Grover's algorithm can be used to find\nsolutions in brute force way more efficiently than classical methods. We\npresent an example for the simplest possible diophantine equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
