The proposed feeding\nmechanism facilitates azimuthal beam steering, spanning from negative 90 degree\nto positive 90 degree, thereby enabling the reconfiguration of beam patterns\nwithin the digital metamaterial. Utilizing the phase distribution concept and\ncomprehensive analysis of coupling and the e_field effect on individual unit\ncells, the metamaterial array spacing is meticulously designed. Operational at\n0.7 THz, the system offers versatile reconfigurability, supporting single,\ndual, and multibeam modes. Through meticulous optimization, the system\ndemonstrates an impressive negative 138 degree to positive 138 degree beam\nsteering capability. This dynamic beamforming ability, transitioning seamlessly\nfrom a singular beam to multibeam configurations, requires minimal\nsoftware-hardware integration for scanning and inter_satellite links, thus\npresenting significant potential for enhancing product quality within\nindustrial environments and satellite communication.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
