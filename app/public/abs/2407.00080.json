Solving this\nproblem optimally is complicated due to the unknown network information and\nrandom task sizes. The shared network resources also influence the users'\ndecisions and resource distribution. Our solution combines the mean field\nmulti-agent multi-armed bandit (MAB) game with a load-balancing technique that\nadjusts the servers' rewards to achieve a target population profile despite the\ndistributed user decision-making. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of\nour approach and the convergence to the target load distribution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
