It transforms multidimensional\ndata into two-dimensional representations that may be shown as scatter plots\nwhile preserving their similarity with the original data. Human visual\nperception is frequently used to evaluate the quality of MP. In this work, we\npropose to study and improve on a well-known map called Local Affine\nMultidimensional Projection (LAMP), which takes a multidimensional instance and\nembeds it in Cartesian space via moving least squares deformation. We propose a\nnew visual quality metric based on human perception. The new metric combines\nthree previously used metrics: silhouette coefficient, neighborhood\npreservation, and silhouette ratio. We show that the proposed metric produces\nmore precise results in analyzing the quality of MP than other previously used\nmetrics. Finally, we describe an algorithm that attempts to overcome a\nlimitation of the LAMP method which requires a similar scale for control points\nand their counterparts in the Cartesian space.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
