However, concrete theoretical model realizations of\nthe PDW order have remained elusive. Here, we study a one-dimensional model\nwith nearest-neighbor pairing attraction, i.e. a spinful Kitaev chain, under\ngeneric spin-orbit couplings such that the spin-rotation symmetry is fully\nbroken. The most general superconducting order parameter is described by a\nspatial dependent $\\mathbf{d}_i$-vector. We show that a spin-triplet pair\ndensity wave (t-PDW) emerges in the ground state and occupies a large part of\nthe phase diagram. The $\\mathbf{d_i}$-vector of the t-PDW rotates with a pitch\n$Q_{\\rm pdw}$ along the chain and spans an ellipsoid. The pure t-PDW is\nfully-gapped and a class-DIII topological superconductor with two Majorana zero\nmodes localized at each end of the chain and protected by time-reversal\nsymmetry. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into the exotic pure PDW\nsuperconductor and provide a possible explanation for the one-dimensional PDW\ndetected along domain walls in monolayer iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se)\nand potentially realizable using other quantum structures in unconventional\nsuperconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
