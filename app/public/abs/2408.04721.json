This framework encodes thus for a\nprivileged direction for the reaction to occur: the joint action of tail nodes\nis a driver for the reaction involving head nodes. It thus results a natural\ngeneralization of directed networks. Based on a linear stability analysis we\nhave shown the existence of two Laplace matrices, allowing to analytically\nprove that Turing patterns, stationary or wave-like, emerges for a much broader\nset of parameters in the m-directed setting. In particular directionality\npromotes Turing instability, otherwise absent in the symmetric case. Analytical\nresults are compared to simulations performed by using the Brusselator model\ndefined on a m-directed d-hyperring as well as on a m-directed random\nhypergraph.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
