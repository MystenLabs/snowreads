When the mass of a helium envelope on the\nWD reaches a critical value, unstable helium burning ignites to trigger a nova\noutburst. A bright soft X-ray phase appears in an early outbursting phase of a\nhelium nova before it optically rises toward maximum. Such an X-ray bright\nphase is called the X-ray flash. We present theoretical light curves of X-ray\nflashes for 1.0, 1.2, and 1.35 $M_\\odot$ helium novae with mass accretion rates\nof $(1.6-7.5) \\times 10^{-7}~M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Long durations of the X-ray\nflashes (100 days to 10 years) and high X-ray luminosities ($\\sim 10^{38}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$) indicate that X-ray flashes are detectable as a new type of X-ray\ntransients or persistent X-ray sources. An X-ray flash is a precursor of\noptical brightening, so that the detection of X-ray flashes on helium novae\nenables us to plan arranged observation for optical pre-maximum phases that\nhave been one of the frontiers of nova study. We found a candidate object of\nhelium-burning X-ray flash from literature on extra-galactic X-ray surveys.\nThis X-ray transient source is consistent with our X-ray flash model of a $1.35\n~M_\\odot$ WD.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
