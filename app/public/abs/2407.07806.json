We\nestablish a so-called reduction principle for these inequalities and\ncharacterize optimal rearrangement-invariant function spaces for these weighted\nSobolev inequalities. Both optimal target and optimal domain spaces are\ncharacterized. Abstract results are accompanied by general yet concrete\nexamples of optimal function spaces. For these examples, the class of so-called\nLorentz--Karamata spaces, which contains in particular Lebesgue spaces, Lorentz\nspaces, and some Orlicz spaces, is used.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
