However,\ncurrent approaches often suffer from limitations like high sensitivity to data\nquality and lack of interpretability. In this study, we propose GenFollower, a\nnovel zero-shot prompting approach that leverages large language models (LLMs)\nto address these challenges. We reframe car-following behavior as a language\nmodeling problem and integrate heterogeneous inputs into structured prompts for\nLLMs. This approach achieves improved prediction performance and\ninterpretability compared to traditional baseline models. Experiments on the\nWaymo Open datasets demonstrate GenFollower's superior performance and ability\nto provide interpretable insights into factors influencing car-following\nbehavior. This work contributes to advancing the understanding and prediction\nof car-following behaviors, paving the way for enhanced traffic management and\nautonomous driving systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
