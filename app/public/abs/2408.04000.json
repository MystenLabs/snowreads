Remarkably, we also find\nthat the Minkowskian path integral realises causality in the sense that a\nstring does not propagate between points at space-like separation, by giving\ncareful consideration to the measure of the world-sheet metric. We also discuss\nmatrix regularisation of the path integral for type IIB perturbative\nsuperstring theory. The obtained matrix models are the Euclidean IKKT matrix\nmodel and a modified Minkowskian IKKT model, depending on how the matrix\nregularisation is applied.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
