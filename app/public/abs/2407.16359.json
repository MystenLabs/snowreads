We prove\nglobal convergence of the algorithm under suitable assumptions, thus addressing\nan important open issue in the switching system identification literature. The\neffectiveness of both the proposed model and algorithm is validated through\nextensive numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
