Firstly notice that 2--Toda\nhierarchy can be viewed as the 2--component bosonizations of fermionic KP\nhierarchy, then two elementary Toda Darboux transformation operators\n$T_{+}(q)=\\Lambda(q)\\cdot\\Delta\\cdot q^{-1}$ and\n$T_{-}(r)=\\Lambda^{-1}(r)^{-1}\\cdot\\Delta^{-1}\\cdot r$ are constructed from the\nchanges of Toda (adjoint) wave functions by using 2--component boson--fermion\ncorrespondence. Based on this, the above vacuum expectation values now can be\nrealized as the successive applications of Toda Darboux transformations. So the\ncorresponding determinant formulas can be derived from the determinant\nrepresentations of Toda Darboux transformations. Finally by similar methods, we\nalso give the determinant formulas for $\\langle\nn-m|e^{\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{x})}\\beta_m^{*}\\cdots\\beta_1^{*}\\beta_n\\cdots\\beta_1g|k\\rangle\n$ related with KP tau functions.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
