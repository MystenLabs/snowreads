Recent\nadvances have leveraged morphable face models to generate animated head avatars\nfrom easily accessible data, representing varying identities and expressions\nwithin a low-dimensional parametric space. However, existing methods often\nstruggle with modeling complex appearance details, e.g., hairstyles and\naccessories, and suffer from low rendering quality and efficiency. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach, 3D Gaussian Parametric Head Model, which employs\n3D Gaussians to accurately represent the complexities of the human head,\nallowing precise control over both identity and expression. Additionally, it\nenables seamless face portrait interpolation and the reconstruction of detailed\nhead avatars from a single image. Unlike previous methods, the Gaussian model\ncan handle intricate details, enabling realistic representations of varying\nappearances and complex expressions. Furthermore, this paper presents a\nwell-designed training framework to ensure smooth convergence, providing a\nguarantee for learning the rich content. Our method achieves high-quality,\nphoto-realistic rendering with real-time efficiency, making it a valuable\ncontribution to the field of parametric head models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
