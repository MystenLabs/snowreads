The second star\n(TOI-5713) is located $40.946\\pm0.032$ pc away, with a radius of\n$0.2985^{+0.0073}_{-0.0072}$ \\rsun, a mass of $0.2653\\pm0.0061$ \\msun, and an\neffective temperature of $3225^{+41}_{-40}$ K. We validated the planets using\nTESS data, ground-based multi-wavelength photometry from many ground-based\nfacilities, as well as high-resolution AO observations from Keck/NIRC2.\nTOI-6002 b has a radius of $1.65^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$ \\re\\ and receives\n$1.77^{+0.16}_{-0.11} S_\\oplus$. TOI-5713 b has a radius of\n$1.77_{-0.11}^{+0.13} \\re$ and receives $2.42\\pm{0.11} S_\\oplus$. Both planets\nare located near the radius valley and near the inner edge of the habitable\nzone of their host stars, which makes them intriguing targets for future\nstudies to understand the formation and evolution of small planets around\nM-dwarf stars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
