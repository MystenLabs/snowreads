In this study, we\ninvestigate the colorability of graph states in qudit systems to simplify their\nrepresentation and enhance their practical applications. We present closed-form\nexpressions for all two-colorable graph states. Our findings show that the\nclosed-form expression of these states is tightly linked to the graph structure\nand the distribution of particles in red ($n_R$) and blue ($n_B$).\nAdditionally, we explore a broad family of three-colorable graph states\nconstructed from two two-colorable graph states. The closed-form expression for\nthese states is in the form of one two-colorable state tensor product with the\ngraph basis formed from another two-colorable state. Our approach\nsystematically reduces the number of terms required to represent these states.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that many well-known mathematical graphs, including\nfriendship graphs, fit within our formalism. Finally, we discuss the LU/SLOCC\n(Local Unitary/Stochastic Local Operation and Classical Communication)\nequivalence between two- and three-colorable graph states. Our findings have\nbroad implications for characterizing the LU/SLOCC equivalence of graph state\nclasses and pave the way for future research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
