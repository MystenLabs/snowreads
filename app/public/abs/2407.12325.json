However, RAG still faces hallucinations due\nto vague queries. This study aims to improve RAG by optimizing query generation\nwith a query-document alignment score, refining queries using LLMs for better\nprecision and efficiency of document retrieval. Experiments have shown that our\napproach improves document retrieval, resulting in an average accuracy gain of\n1.6%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nO42ho4He4Zx1wZ1yRycFyU1shGpSuMPVKq4kgV8Jrk","pdfSize":"445329"}
