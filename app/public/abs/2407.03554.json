This family is based\non an initial ansatz. We prove that for {\\lambda} small enough the family of\nsolutions exists on an interval uniform in {\\lambda} only function of the\ninitial ansatz. These solutions are close to an approximate solution\nconstructed by geometric optics. The initial ansatz needs to be regular enough,\nto satisfy a polarization condition and to satisfy the constraints for Maxwell\nnull-transport in Lorenz gauge, but there is no need for smallness of any kind.\nThe phases need to interact in a coherent way. We also observe that the limit\n(A0, {\\Phi}0) is not solution to Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations but to a\nKlein-Gordon-Maxwell null-transport type system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
