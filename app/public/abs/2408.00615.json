The main tool is on the proof of the fact that the degeneration\nlimit of the algebraic quantum difference equation is the same as that of the\nOkounkov-Smirnov geometric quantum difference equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
