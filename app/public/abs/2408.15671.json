To tackle FJSSPs, approximation methods are employed to ensure\nsolutions are within acceptable timeframes. Quantum Annealing, a metaheuristic\nleveraging quantum mechanical effects, demonstrates superior solution quality\nin a shorter time compared to classical algorithms. However, due to hardware\nlimitations of quantum annealers, hybrid algorithms become essential for\nsolving larger FJSSPs. This paper investigates the threshold problem sizes up\nto which quantum annealers are sufficient and when hybrid algorithms are\nrequired, highlighting the distribution of computing power in hybrid methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O94elpcpcYDeNvGLAfCGkxJByBXfOaMp8P-GPOHfGU8","pdfSize":"520388"}
