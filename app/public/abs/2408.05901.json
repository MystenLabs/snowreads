However, general guidance to model architecture design is still\nmissing. The design of many modern model architectures, such as residual\nstructures, multiplicative gating signal, and feed-forward networks, can be\ninterpreted in terms of the heat conduction equation. This finding inspired us\nto model images by the heat conduction equation, where the essential idea is to\nconceptualize image features as temperatures and model their information\ninteraction as the diffusion of thermal energy. We can take advantage of the\nrich knowledge in the heat conduction equation to guide us in designing new and\nmore interpretable models. As an example, we propose Heat Conduction Layer and\nRefine Approximation Layer inspired by solving the heat conduction equation\nusing Finite Difference Method and Fourier series, respectively. This paper\ndoes not aim to present a state-of-the-art model; instead, it seeks to\nintegrate the overall architectural design of the model into the heat\nconduction theory framework. Nevertheless, our Heat Conduction Network (HcNet)\nstill shows competitive performance.
