Photovoltaic arrays consist of multiple solar panels\nconstructed from solar cells. Solar cells in the field are vulnerable to\nvarious defects, and electroluminescence (EL) imaging provides effective and\nnon-destructive diagnostics to detect those defects. We use multiple\ntraditional machine learning and modern deep learning models to classify EL\nsolar cell images into different functional/defective categories. Because of\nthe asymmetry in the number of functional vs. defective cells, an imbalanced\nlabel problem arises in the EL image data. The current literature lacks\ninsights on which methods and metrics to use for model training and prediction.\nIn this paper, we comprehensively compare different machine learning and deep\nlearning methods under different performance metrics on the classification of\nsolar cell EL images from monocrystalline and polycrystalline modules. We\nprovide a comprehensive discussion on different metrics. Our results provide\ninsights and guidelines for practitioners in selecting prediction methods and\nperformance metrics.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
