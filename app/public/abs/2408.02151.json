This conjecture is known to hold in $\\mathbb R$, and\nrecently it was disproved in sufficiently high dimensions. In this paper, we\nstudy the periodic tiling conjecture for polygonal sets: bounded open sets in\n$\\mathbb R^2$ whose boundary is a finite union of line segments. We prove the\nperiodic tiling conjecture for any polygonal tile whose vertices are rational.\nAs a corollary of our argument, we also obtain the decidability of tilings by\nrational polygonal sets. Moreover, we prove that any translational tiling by a\nrational polygonal tile is weakly-periodic, i.e., can be partitioned into\nfinitely many singly-periodic pieces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
