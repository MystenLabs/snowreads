The conductor of $I$ is\nan ideal $C(I)\\subset R$ obtained from the defining ideals of the Rees algebra\nand the symmetric algebra of $I$ by a colon operation. Using this concept we\ninvestigate when adding an element to an ideal preserves the property of being\nof linear type. In this regard, a generalization of a result by Valla in terms\nof the conductor ideal is presented. When the conductor of a graded ideal in a\npolynomial ring is the graded maximal ideal, a criteria is given for when the\nRees algebra and the symmetric algebra have the same Krull dimension. Finally,\nnoting the fact that the conductor of a monomial ideal is a monomial ideal, the\nconductor of some families of monomial ideals, namely bounded Veronese ideals\nand edge ideals of graphs, are determined.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
