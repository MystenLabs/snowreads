Since the quasinormal modes and co-modes are explicitly known, we\nare able to give explicit formulae for the instantaneous rate of change of each\nfrequency in terms of the perturbing potential. We verify these exact\ncomputations numerically using a novel technique extending the spectral\nhyperboloidal approach of Jaramillo et al. (2021). We propose a definition for\na family of pseudospectra that we show capture the instability properties of\nthe quasinormal frequencies.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
