I thus demonstrate the following equivalence\n$$RH\\Longleftrightarrow\\alpha\\left(\\Phi\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}$$ where\n$\\alpha\\left(\\Phi\\right)$ represents the index of good variation of $\\Phi$, an\nessential characteristic of functions of good variation. This equivalence of\nthe Riemann hypothesis is a potential new contribution absent from recent\ncomprehensive catalogs of equivalent of the Riemann hypothesis in mathematical\nliterature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
