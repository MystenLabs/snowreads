In previous work, I computed transfer operators associated to\nspherical varieties of rank one, and gave an interpretation of them in terms of\ngeometric quantization. In this paper, I study how these operators vary in the\nhorospherical limits of these varieties, where they have a conceptual\ninterpretation related to scattering theory. I also revisit Jacquet's Hankel\ntransform for the Kuznetsov formula, which is related to the functional\nequation of the standard L-function of GL(n), and provide an interpretation of\nit in terms of quantization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6F5mGfzs8ls4xJMUIF4pmRHo7jEpypONYWWUL8tD6cA","pdfSize":"806608","objectId":"0x8726c88251a532e8b340da2ff4ebdc1849a2589c25a5b07a08ae7b1b886f0296","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
