As a corollary, this implies that\nany $2$-illuminable spiky ball in $\\mathbb{E}^n$ can be illuminated by\n$(\\sqrt{3/2}+o(1))^n$ directions. For the illumination number of convex spiky\nballs, i.e., cap bodies, we show an upper bound in terms of the sizes of\ncertain related spherical codes and coverings. For large dimensions, this\nresults in an upper bound of $1.19851^n$, which can be compared with the\nprevious $(\\sqrt{2}+o(1))^n$ established only for the centrally symmetric cap\nbodies. We also prove the lower bounds of $(\\tfrac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}-o(1))^n$ for\nthe three problems above.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
