While there is almost no possibility of non-trivial Khintchine\ninequality for central Fourier series on compact connected semisimple Lie\ngroups, we demonstrate a strong contrast within the framework of compact\nquantum groups. Specifically, we establish a Khintchine inequality with\noperator coefficients for arbitrary central Fourier series in a large class of\nnon-Kac compact quantum groups. The main examples include the Drinfeld-Jimbo\n$q$-deformations $G_q$, the free orthogonal quantum groups $O_F^+$, and the\nquantum automorphism group $G_{aut}(B,\\psi)$ with a $\\delta$-form $\\psi$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
