Frank's family of triangular norms is\nparticularly interesting from this perspective. The article concludes with a\ncomparative discussion with another very recent proposal for defining\nanalogical proportions between numerical values based on the family of\ngeneralized means.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
