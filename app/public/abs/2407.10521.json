Under a saturation hypothesis on the control\noperators, we show the small-time approximate controllability between states\nsharing the same sign. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case $d=1$, we combine\nthis property with a local exact controllability result, and prove the\nsmall-time exact controllability of any positive states towards the ground\nstate of the evolution operator.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UORMw7R1Nbrp0E8DxNHVZbpsHdKnqXuO4aUfArc3Fcw","pdfSize":"426584","objectId":"0xf1bfdb49a704089af38cc825e1ebc6587f901a5a7475a1bdb592d1b91cae7b02","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
