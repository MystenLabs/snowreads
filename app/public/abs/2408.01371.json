We confirmed these experimental results via hybrid\nDensity Functional Theory computations of the materials' electronic properties\nto evaluate their viability as photocatalysts for nitrogen reduction. This\nnitrogen ligand contamination, and subsequent interference in photocatalytic\nstudies, is avoidable through the careful design of synthetic pathways that\nexclude nitrogen-containing constituents. This result highlights the urgent\nneed for careful evaluation of catalyst synthesis protocols, as contamination\nby nitrogen-containing ligands may go unnoticed since the presence of nitrogen\nis often not detected or probed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
