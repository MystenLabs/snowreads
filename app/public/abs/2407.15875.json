In this\nwork, we propose to connect the existing pruning concepts such as leave-one-out\npruning and oracle pruning and develop them into a more general Shapley\nvalue-based framework that targets the compression of convolutional neural\nnetworks. To allow for practical applications in utilizing the Shapley value,\nthis work presents the Shapley value approximations, and performs the\ncomparative analysis in terms of cost-benefit utility for the neural network\ncompression. The proposed ranks are evaluated against a new benchmark, Oracle\nrank, constructed based on oracle sets. The broad experiments show that the\nproposed normative ranking and its approximations show practical results,\nobtaining state-of-the-art network compression.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
