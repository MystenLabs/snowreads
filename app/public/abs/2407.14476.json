Based on the\nInou-Shishikura theory, they obtained the control for the case of rotation\nnumbers of bounded high type. Later, Cheraghi developed several elaborate\nanalytic techniques based on Inou-Shishikura's results and obtained the control\nfor the case of rotation numbers of high type. In this paper, based on the\npseudo-Siegel disk theory of Dudko and Lyubich, we obtained the control for the\ngeneral case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
