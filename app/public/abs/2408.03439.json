We construct the one-loop 4-photon and 4-graviton helicity\namplitudes with matter in the loop carrying anomalous multipole moments, and we\nread off the Wilson coefficients in the effective theory below the matter\nparticle mass. Much as in the case of minimal coupling, the Wilson coefficients\nbeyond the leading order turn out to be confined to small islands in the much\nlarger theory space allowed by existing positivity constraints.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
