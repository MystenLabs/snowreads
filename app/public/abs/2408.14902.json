Here we\nreported on the realization of a MIR up-conversion interferometer based on\nsynthetic long base-line (SLBL) in the laboratory. The experimental system\nconsisted of an interferometer and subsequent up-conversion detection part of\nmid-infrared signal, which streamlined the structure and enhanced the\nreliability of the system. By using a tungsten filament lamp as an imitated\nstar, we not only achieved the single target angle resolution of 1.10 times\n10^(-4) rad, but also obtained the field angle resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-4)\nrad of double star targets. The angular resolution is in inverse proportion to\nthe length of baseline. The maximum length of simulated baseline in the\nlaboratory is about 3cm. In a Keck Interferometer (KI) liked program, the base\nline can reach up to 85m leading to a corresponding angular resolution of 3.0\ntimes 10^(-9) rad (about 1.8mas). The study will offer potential benefits in\nextending the usage of mid-infrared light in astronomical exploration.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
