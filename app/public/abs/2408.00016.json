This paper explores an alternative approach to determining whether\na signal is meaningful, one that analyzes only the signal itself and is\nindependent of what the conveyed meaning might be. We devise a method that\ntakes a waveform as input and outputs a score indicating its degree of\n`meaningfulness`. We cluster contiguous portions of the input to minimize the\ntotal description length, and then take the length of the code of the assigned\ncluster labels as meaningfulness score. We evaluate our method empirically,\nagainst several baselines, and show that it is the only one to give a high\nscore to human speech in various languages and with various speakers, a\nmoderate score to animal vocalizations from birds and orcas, and a low score to\nambient noise from various sources.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n1I4ldYWUZ_EImpr2KI3YZGzYTtCZaLiCWCJFyme2ts","pdfSize":"270304"}
