We begin by deriving the relative acceleration for an\narbitrary congruence of timelike curves. The resulting ``deviation equation''\noffers an alternative pathway to the well-known Raychaudhuri equation with\ntorsion. Conjugate points are then introduced and analyzed in relation to the\nbehavior of the scalar expansion. Together with the sensible requirement of\nhypersurface orthogonality, the Raychaudhuri equation is examined for several\nspecific cases of torsion that are prominent in the literature. Our findings\nindicate that a totally antisymmetric torsion tensor does not influence the\nbehavior of the congruence of timelike curves. Finally, we formulate a\nsingularity theorem for timelike curves and highlight the critical requirement\nof non-autoparallel curves.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
