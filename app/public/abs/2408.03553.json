The family was constructed by Borodin\nand Olshanski in 2007 and it closely resembles Ethier-Kurtz's\ninfinitely-many-neutral-allels diffusion model on Kingman simplex (1981) and\nPetrov's extension of Ethier-Kurtz's model (2007). The processes $X_{z,z'}$\nhave unique symmetrizing measures, namely, the boundary $z$-measures, which\nplay the role of Poisson-Dirichlet measures in our context.\n  We establish the following behavior of diffusions $X_{z,z'}$: immediately\nafter the initial moment they jump into a dense face of Thoma simplex and then\nalways stay there. In other words, the face acts as a natural state space for\nthe diffusions, while other points of the simplex act like an entrance boundary\nfor our process. As a key intermediate step we study the Dirichlet forms of the\ndiffusions $X_{z,z}$ and find a new description for them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
