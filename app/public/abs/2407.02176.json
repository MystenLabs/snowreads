As such, rapid recent progress on time-varying media gave\nrise to the notion of temporal and spatiotemporal crystals. Fundamentally\nrethinking the role of time, which, in contrast to space exhibits a unique\nunidirectionality often referred to as the arrow of time, promises a new\ndimension also for topological physics. Here, we enter the new realm of time\nand spacetime topology: Firstly, we implement a time-topological time interface\nstate. Secondly, we propose and observe a spacetime-topological event and\ndemonstrate unique features like its limited collapse under disorder and\ncausality-suppressed coupling. The new paradigms of time and spacetime topology\nunveil a distinctive role of causality and non-Hermiticity in topology and pave\nthe way towards topological spatiotemporal wave control with unique robustness.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
