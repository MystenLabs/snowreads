Interstellar clouds with high Alfv\\'en velocity act as concave\nlenses to diverge the MHD waves, while those with slow Alfv\\'en velocity act as\nconvex lenses to converge the waves to the focal points. By combination of\nvarious types of clouds and fluctuations with different Alfv\\'en velocities,\nsizes, or wavelengths, the MHD-wave shells attain various morphological\nstructures, exhibiting filaments, arcs, loops, holes, and focal strings,\nmimicking old and deformed SNRs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
