Memristor functions originate from ferrocenyl-modified gold\nnanoclusters (ncAu25-Fc) embedded in polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) and devices\noptimized for maximum 1/0 'flash' memory effect are found to contain 15 wt%\nncAu25-Fc. Integrated memristor and neuromorphic functions are obtained by\nreplacing PMMA with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in the active layer, from\nwhich transistor effects are derived. Based on the energy band diagrams of\nncAu25, PMMA and P3HT, percolation theory is used to explain the memristor 1/0\non/off ratio as a function of ncAu25-Fc concentration. The use of ncAu25-Fc\nwith charge-tunable, ferrocene-modified, ligands is critical toward better\ncluster-polymer interfaces. Our work shows that nanostructures of polymers and\nmetalorganic frameworks bear strong potential towards neuromorphic devices and\nthe circuital simplification of data storage technology.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
