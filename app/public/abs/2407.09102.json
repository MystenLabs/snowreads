This error rate consists of a\nlinear combination of the maximum mutation rate and the reciprocal of the\npopulation size. Our result improves the error bound in the seminal work\n[PNAS,1977], where only the special case $r=2$ was studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
