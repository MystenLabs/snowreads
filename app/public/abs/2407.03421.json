While measurement protocols for dynamical correlations\nbased on Hadamard tests for qubit quantum devices exist, they do not\nstraightforwardly extend to qudits. Here, we propose a modified protocol to\novercome this limitation by decomposing qudit observables into unitary\noperations that can be implemented and probed in a quantum circuit. We\nbenchmark our algorithm numerically at the example of quench dynamics in a\nspin-1 XXZ chain with finite shot noise and demonstrate advantages in terms of\nsignal-to-noise ratio over established protocols based on linear response. Our\nscheme can readily be implemented on various platforms and offers a wide range\nof applications like variational quantum optimization or probing thermalization\nin many-body systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
