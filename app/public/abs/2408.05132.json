To access curved spaces in laboratories, the conventional\nwisdom is that physical distortions need to be implemented into a system. In\ncontrast to this belief, here, we show that two hyperbolic surfaces readily\nexist in bosonic Kitaev model in the absence of any physical distortions and\ngive rise to a range of intriguing phenomena, such as chiral quantum transport\nor chiral reaction-diffusion. A finite chemical potential couples these two\nhyperbolic surfaces, delivering a quantum sensor whose sensitivity grows\nexponentially with the size of the system. Our results provide experimentalists\nwith an unprecedented opportunity to explore intriguing quantum phenomena in\ncurve spaces without distortion or access non-Hermitian phenomena without\ndissipation. Our work also suggests a new class of quantum sensors in which\ngeometry amplifies small signals.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XC2yJYTqRh8eufXcdEb3G-ONgviMRFa3fD_vgCb1Xbw","pdfSize":"1610337"}
