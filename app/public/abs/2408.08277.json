Well-posedness in terms of the existence and uniqueness of a\nsolution is established, and a stochastic averaging principle on strong\nconvergence of a time-explosion SVI to an averaged equation is obtained, both\nunder non-Lipschitz conditions. We illustrate our results on general but\nconcrete examples of finite dimension and infinite dimension respectively,\nwhich cover large classes of particle systems with electro-static repulsion,\nnonlinear stochastic partial differential equations with jumps, semilinear\nstochastic partial differential equations (especially stochastic\nreaction-diffusion equations) with delays, and others.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
