This framework does not require camera intrinsics,\nenabling large-scale pre-training on publicly available videos. Our\nstraightforward yet effective learning strategy significantly enhances the\nperformance of fast and lightweight models without introducing any overhead,\nallowing them to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art\nself-supervised monocular depth estimation models. This advancement is\nparticularly beneficial for virtual and augmented reality applications\nrequiring low latency inference.
