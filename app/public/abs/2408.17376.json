We\nemployed predictive models, including Random Forest (RF) and Logistic\nRegression (LR), with varying sets of input features to predict the occurrence\nof relapses based on clinical and pollutant data collected over a week. The RF\nyielded the best result, with an AUC-ROC score of 0.713. Environmental\nvariables, such as precipitation, NO2, PM2.5, humidity, and temperature, were\nfound to be relevant to the prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
