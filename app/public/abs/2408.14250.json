We will show that the problem has a unique and\nuniformly bounded classical solution for\n$\\gamma\\in\\bigl(\\frac{2n}{n+1},2\\bigr]$. Moreover, we have the same result for\n$\\gamma=\\frac{2n}{n+1}$ and a condition that involves the parameters\n$c,\\mu,n,\\chi$ and the initial data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
