We compute\ntheir classical Lyapunov exponents, and using out-of-time-order correlators\n(OTOCs) in the semi-classical regime, we also derive their quantum Lyapunov\nexponents. We observe that the classical and quantum Lyapunov exponents are in\nagreement, strengthening the role of OTOCs as a diagnostic for quantum chaos in\nbilliard systems. At very low temperatures, the OTOC of the Sinai billiard\nshows sharp growth, a phenomenon absent in the other two billiards. We identify\nthe source of this anomalous behaviour in the geometry of the ground state wave\nfunction of the Sinai billiard, which is more sensitive to the curvature of the\nbilliard compared to the other billiards. We also remark on the late-time\nbehaviour of the OTOCs and how the scrambling/Ehrenfest time is related to the\ntemperature of quantum billiards.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
