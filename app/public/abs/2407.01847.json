However, with gate-tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we show that\nthe range of potential applications of such JJs becomes much broader. The\ntime-dependent SOC offers unexplored mechanisms for switching JJs, accompanied\nby the $2\\pi$-phase jumps and the voltage pulses corresponding to the\nsingle-flux-quantum transitions, key to high-speed and low-power\nsuperconducting electronics. In a constant applied magnetic field, with Rashba\nand Dresselhaus SOC, anharmonic current-phase relations, calculated\nmicroscopically in these JJs, yield a nonreciprocal transport and\nsuperconducting diode effect. Together with the time-dependent SOC, this allows\nus to identify a switching mechanism at no applied current bias which supports\nfractional-flux-quantum superconducting circuits and neuromorphic computing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
