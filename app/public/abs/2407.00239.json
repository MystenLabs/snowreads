The tip is placed\non the top of a grounded silicon nitride membrane, acting as a movable top gate\nof the coupled resonator. We demonstrate its ability to map mechanical modes\nand investigate mechanical damping effects in a capacitive coupling scheme,\nbased on its spatial resolution. We also manipulate the energy transfer\ncoherently between the mode of the scanning tip and the underlying silicon\nnitride membrane, via parametric coupling. Typical features of optomechanics,\nsuch as anti-damping and electromechanically induced transparency, have been\nobserved. Since the microwave optomechanical technology is fully compatible\nwith quantum electronics and very low temperature conditions, it should provide\na powerful tool for studying phonon tunnelling between two spatially separated\nvibrating elements, which could potentially be applied to quantum sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
