It is assumed that the static, spherically\nsymmetric distribution of matter within neutron stars is supported by two\ndistinct components: ordinary matter and a vacuum fluid. For normal matter we\nuse a set of state-of-the-art nuclear matter equations of state, each grounded\nin nuclear physics experiments. The vacuum energy component is inhomogeneously\ndistributed within the star and obeys the standard equation of state ($p_v =\n-\\epsilon_v$). This is characterized by an energy density fraction $y =\n\\epsilon_m/ (\\epsilon_m + \\epsilon_v)$, which we model as either a constant or\nradius-dependent. Our findings reveal that the inclusion of vacuum energy\nsignificantly affects the mass-radius relationships in neutron stars,\ninfluencing both the maximum achievable masses and the qualitative form of\nthese relationships. Some constraints from current multimessenger observational\ndata limiting the amount of vacuum energy within neutron stars are also\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
