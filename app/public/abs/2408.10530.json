In this regime, using statistical field theory\nmethods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability\ndistribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of\nthe normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the\nnearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops\nare highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to\nc-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random\nc-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however,\nthe way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree\nof first return probabilities on random regular graphs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
