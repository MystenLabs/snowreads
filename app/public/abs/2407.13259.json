Understanding how it behaves, its motor\ncontrol and involvement in the execution of these different tasks is therefore\nan important issue for the management and therapeutic treatment of pathologies\nrelating to these essential functions so that quality of life can be preserved.\nThis chapter focuses on the biomechanical modeling of this organ, as one of the\nkey steps towards this understanding. Such a modeling will be an important tool\nto predict and control the functional impact of lingual surgery in the field of\ncomputer-assisted medical interventions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
