Specifically, we\nextend the pioneering Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model by incorporating covariate\ninformation and considering sparse individual intrinsic scores. Our work\nintroduces novel model identification conditions and examines the regularized\npenalized Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) statistical rates. We then\nconstruct a debiased estimator for the penalized MLE and analyze its\ndistributional properties. Additionally, we apply our method to the\ngoodness-of-fit test for models with no latent intrinsic scores, namely, the\ncovariates fully explaining the preference scores of individual items. We also\noffer confidence intervals for ranks. Our numerical studies lend further\nsupport to our theoretical findings, demonstrating validation for our proposed\nmethod\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
