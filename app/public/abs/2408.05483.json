A generating function of the poset\nis factorized when the minimum element of the poset is $312$-avoiding and\nsatisfies some extra condition. We define a cover relation on rational Dyck\ntilings by that of labeled trees, and show that increasing and decreasing\nlabelings are dual to each other. We consider two decompositions of a rational\n$(a,b)$-Dyck tiling: one is into $ab$ Dyck tilings and the other is into $a$\n$(1,b)$-Dyck tilings. In the first case, we show that the weight of the\n$(a,b)$-Dyck tiling is the sum of the weights of $ab$ Dyck tilings. In the\nsecond case, we introduce a cover relation on $(1,b)$-Dyck tilings and obtain a\nposet of $(a,b)$-Dyck tilings by this decomposition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
