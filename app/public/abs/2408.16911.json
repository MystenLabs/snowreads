The initial non-singular de Sitter state is characterised by a\nvery high energy scale which is equal or smaller than the reduced Planck mass.\nIt is structurally unstable and all the continuous created matter, energy and\nentropy of the material component comes from the irreversible flow powered by\nthe primeval vacuum energy density. The analytical expression describing the\nrunning vacuum is obtained from the thermal approach. It opens a new\nperspective to solve the old puzzles and current observational challenges\nplaguing the cosmic concordance model driven by a rigid vacuum. Such a scenario\nis also modelled through a non-canonical scalar field. It is demonstrated that\nthe resulting scalar field model is shown to be step by step a faithful\nanalytical representation of the thermal running vacuum cosmology.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
