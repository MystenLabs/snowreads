We present a short\nsummary on the recent knowledge on the magnetic fields and activity in giants\nsituated in the upper right part of the Hertzsprung-Russel (H-R) diagram and\ndiscuss on the possible mechanisms for magnetic field generation in the\nasymptotic giants branch (AGB) and post-AGB stars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
