Their ability to perform logic operations using RRAM\ndevices makes them a critical component in non-von Neumann processing-in-memory\narchitectures. Passive RRAM crossbar arrays (1-RRAM or 1R), however, suffer\nfrom a major issue of sneak path currents, leading to a lower readout margin\nand increasing write failures. To address this challenge, active RRAM arrays\nhave been proposed, which incorporate a selector device in each memory cell\n(termed 1-selector-1-RRAM or 1S1R). The selector eliminates currents from\nunselected cells and therefore effectively mitigates the sneak path phenomenon.\nYet, there is a need for a comprehensive analysis of 1S1R arrays, particularly\nconcerning in-memory computation. In this paper, we introduce a 1S1R model\ntailored to a VO2-based selector and TiN/TiOx/HfOx/Pt RRAM device. We also\npresent simulations of 1S1R arrays, incorporating all parasitic parameters,\nacross a range of array sizes from $4\\times4$ to $512\\times512$. We evaluate\nthe performance of Memristor-Aided Logic (MAGIC) gates in terms of switching\ndelay, power consumption, and readout margin, and provide a comparative\nevaluation with passive 1R arrays.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
