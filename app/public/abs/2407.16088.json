They are the\nnon-compact version of the author and collaborators' previous result on compact\nmanifolds, stated here for the sake for completeness. Additionally, by using\nBernard's Young measure based weak formulation of optimal transport, the\nresults are established for cases not covered by previous works. Particularly,\nno assumptions are made on the non-existence of singular minimizing controls or\nthe cost function being Lipschitz. Therefore, the existence of solutions to\nfluid formulation is established for general Sub-Riemmanian energy costs not\ncovered by literature previously. The results also provide controllability of\nthe continuity equation (using Borel measurable feedback laws) whenever the\ncorresponding Kantorovich problem has a feasible solution, due to the\nestablished equivalence between the Kantorovich and Benamou-Brenier\nformulation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
