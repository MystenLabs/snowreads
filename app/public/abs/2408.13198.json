We identify the boundary action as the geometric\naction on coadjoint orbits of the Warped Virasoro group. We use this reduced\naction to compute one-loop contributions to the torus partition function and\ncompare them to the Warped Virasoro characters.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
