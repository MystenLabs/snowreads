We explore the connection between\ndynamical properties, particularly the recently introduced concept of\n''softness'', and graph-based features such as centrality and clustering\ncoefficients. These topological features outperform conventional features based\non Euclidean metric in predicting particle mobility and allow to correctly\nidentify phase transitions as well. These results provide a new set of\ncomputational tools to investigate the dynamical properties of condensed matter\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
