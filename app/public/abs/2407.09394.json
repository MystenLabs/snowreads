Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmodels address this by enhancing LLMs with external knowledge, but often fail\nto personalize the retrieval process. This paper introduces PersonaRAG, a novel\nframework incorporating user-centric agents to adapt retrieval and generation\nbased on real-time user data and interactions. Evaluated across various\nquestion answering datasets, PersonaRAG demonstrates superiority over baseline\nmodels, providing tailored answers to user needs. The results suggest promising\ndirections for user-adapted information retrieval systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
