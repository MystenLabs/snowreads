It is shown how sensing accuracy, in terms of\nboth detection rate and localization accuracy, can be boosted by a\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which can be advantageously used to\nprovide signal diversity and aid in resolving the targets. Specifically,\nassuming prior information on the presence of a cluster of targets, a RIS beam\nsweep procedure is used to facilitate the high resolution sensing. We derive\nthe Cram\\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for channel parameter estimation and\nsensing and an upper bound on the detection probability. The concept of\ncoherence is defined and analyzed theoretically. Then, we propose an orthogonal\nmatching pursuit (OMP) channel estimation algorithm combined with data\nassociation to fuse the information of the non-RIS signal and the RIS signal\nand perform sensing. Finally, we provide numerical results to verify the\npotential of RIS for improving sensor resolution, and to demonstrate that the\nproposed methods can realize this potential for RIS-assisted high resolution\nsensing.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
