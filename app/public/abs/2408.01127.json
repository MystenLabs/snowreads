Conventional SOC\nand SOH estimation methods, especially model-based methods, often lack accurate\nmodeling of the open circuit voltage (OCV), have high computational complexity,\nand lack theoretical analysis. In this paper, a simple SOC and SOH estimation\nmethod that overcomes all these weaknesses is introduced. The method is based\non rigorous theoretical analysis, requires no parameter fine-tuning, and has a\nvery low computational complexity, which is hundreds of times faster than\nconventional methods. The method is validated on six batteries at different C\nrates and temperatures, demonstrating a stronger capability to realize fast and\naccurate estimation under various conditions than other methods, with a SOH\nroot mean square error (RMSE) of around 2.5% and a SOC RMSE of around 1.5%.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
