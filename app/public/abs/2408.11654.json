Our reconstruction\nalgorithm adapts to any kind of non-Poissonian emitters, outperforming the\ncorresponding classical SOFI method. It offers sub-diffraction resolution\nimprovement that scales with the $\\sqrt{j}$, where $j$ is the highest order\ncentral moments of the photocounts. More remarkably, in combination with\nstructured illumination a linear improvement with j can be reached. Through\nsimulations and experiments, we prove our method's clear superiority over\ntraditional SOFI, especially in low excitation light conditions, providing a\npromising avenue for non-invasive super-resolution microscopy of delicate\nsamples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P00nOMZn2m8ty51kjUTUn9wQsCmY38Y_EcfkLLzocLc","pdfSize":"14171680"}
