In this\npaper, we survey recent advancements in THz technology and its role in future\n6G wireless networks, with a particular emphasis on the 200-400 GHz frequency\nrange and the IEEE 802.15.3d standard. We provide a comprehensive overview of\nTHz systems, circuits, device technology, and antennas, while also highlighting\nrecent experimental demonstrations of THz technology. Throughout the paper, we\nreview the state-of-the-art and call attention to open problems, future\nprospects, and areas of further improvement to fully realize the potential of\nTHz communication in next-generation wireless connectivity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
