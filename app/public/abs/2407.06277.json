We find good agreement with the data in the\napplicability region of the TMD factorization theorem. The inclusion of KPCs\nallows us to describe all angular coefficients in a frame-independent manner\nusing only the leading-twist TMD distributions: the unpolarized and the\nBoer-Mulders functions. The value of the Boer-Mulders function is determined\nusing the ATLAS measurement of the $A_2$ angular coefficient. The analysis is\nperformed at N$^4$LL perturbative order. Additionally, we discuss the technical\nimplementation and impact of KPCs on the phenomenology of TMD distributions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
