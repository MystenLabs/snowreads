We provide\ninfinitely many $\\mathfrak{k}$-subrepresentations of the basic representation\nand we prove that these are all the finite dimensional\n$\\mathfrak{k}$-subrepresentations of the basic representation such that the\nquotient of the basic representation by the subrepresentation is a finite\ndimensional representation of a certain parabolic algebra and of the maximal\ncompact subalgebra. By this result we provide an infinite composition series\nwith a cosocle filtration of the basic representation. Finally, we present\nexamples of the results and applications to supergravity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
