However, this\nknowledge is already embedded in engineering models and can be reused.\nTherefore, this contribution presents a comprehensive workflow for the\nautomated generation of PDDL descriptions from integrated system and product\nmodels. The proposed workflow leverages Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)\nto organize and manage system and product information, translating it\nautomatically into PDDL syntax for planning purposes. By connecting system and\nproduct models with planning aspects, it ensures that changes in these models\nare quickly reflected in updated PDDL descriptions, facilitating efficient and\nadaptable planning processes. The workflow is validated within a use case from\naircraft assembly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
