Here we report the identification of four second-order Raman modes,\nnamed $D_1$, $D_1'$, $D_2$ and $D_2'$, in exfoliated black phosphorus\n(P(black)), an elemental direct-gap semiconductor exhibiting strong mechanical\nand electronic anisotropies. Located in close proximity to the $A^1_g$ and\n$A^2_g$ modes, these new modes dominate at an excitation wavelength of 633 nm.\nTheir evolutions as a function of sample thickness, excitation wavelength, and\ndefect density indicate that they are defect-activated and involve\nhigh-momentum phonons in a doubly-resonant Raman process. \\emph{Ab initio}\nsimulations of a monolayer reveal that the $D'$ and $D$ modes occur through\nintravalley scatterings with split contributions in the armchair and zigzag\ndirections, respectively. The high sensitivity of these $D$ modes to disorder\nhelps explaining several discrepancies found in the literature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
