We translated the dev and devtest sets from Portuguese\ninto Emakhuwa, and we detail the translation process and quality assurance\nmeasures used. Our methodology involved various quality checks, including\npost-editing and adequacy assessments. The resulting datasets consist of\nmultiple reference sentences for each source. We present baseline results from\ntraining a Neural Machine Translation system and fine-tuning existing\nmultilingual translation models. Our findings suggest that spelling\ninconsistencies remain a challenge in Emakhuwa. Additionally, the baseline\nmodels underperformed on this evaluation set, underscoring the necessity for\nfurther research to enhance machine translation quality for Emakhuwa.
