More precisely,\nby exploiting the intrinsic structure of the system and introducing several new\nunknown quantities, we overcome the difficulty stemming from the lack of\ndissipation for density and magnetic field, and prove the global well-posedness\nof strong solutions in the framework of Soboles spaces $H^3$. In addition, we\nalso get the exponential decay for this non-resistive system. Different from\nthe known results [23], [24], [42], we donot need the assumption that the\nbackground magnetic field is positive here.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
