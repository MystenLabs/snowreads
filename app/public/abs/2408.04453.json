Our\ncontributions are three-fold: (i) We determine the structure of quadratic\nrational curves on real classical groups. As a consequence, we completely\nclassify quadratic rational curves on $\\mathrm{U}_n$,\n$\\mathrm{O}_n(\\mathbb{R})$, $\\mathrm{O}_{n-1,1}(\\mathbb{R})$ and\n$\\mathrm{O}_{n-2,2}(\\mathbb{R})$. (ii) We prove a decomposition theorem for\nrational curves on real classical groups, which can be regarded as a\nnon-commutative generalization of the fundamental theorem of algebra and\npartial fraction decomposition. (iii) As an application of (i) and (ii), we\ngeneralize Kempe's Universality Theorem to rational curves on homogeneous\nspaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
