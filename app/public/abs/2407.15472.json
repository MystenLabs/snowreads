The fully-defined MS image\nis estimated from the raw one through $\\textit{demosaicing}$, which inevitably\nintroduces spatio-spectral artifacts. Moreover, training on fully-defined MS\nimages can be computationally intensive, particularly with deep neural networks\n(DNNs), and may result in features lacking discrimination power due to\nsuboptimal learning of spatio-spectral interactions. Furthermore, outdoor MS\nimage acquisition occurs under varying lighting conditions, leading to\nillumination-dependent features. This paper presents an original approach to\nlearn discriminant and illumination-robust features directly from raw images.\nIt involves: $\\textit{raw spectral constancy}$ to mitigate the impact of\nillumination, $\\textit{MSFA-preserving}$ transformations suited for raw image\naugmentation to train DNNs on diverse raw textures, and $\\textit{raw-mixing}$\nto capture discriminant spatio-spectral interactions in raw images. Experiments\non MS image classification show that our approach outperforms both handcrafted\nand recent deep learning-based methods, while also requiring significantly less\ncomputational effort.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_yU8CR-hQ8yVFTiO6KhTqkUQVHTorC1oednCmbFdIfk","pdfSize":"5463585"}
