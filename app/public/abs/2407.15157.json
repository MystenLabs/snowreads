Here,\nwe study the electronic properties of Nd2RhSi3 employing ac and dc\nmagnetization, heat-capacity, electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance\nmeasurements, as Nd 4f hybridization is expected to be slightly different due\nto the changes in the 4d element. The experimental results establish that, like\nthe Pd analogue, this compound also exhibits ferromagnetic ordering at a rather\nhigh temperature of 16.5 K, unlike many other rare-earth members of this family\nwhich are antiferromagnetic, with a complex magnetism at further lower\ntemperatures (less than 10 K). There are differences in the measured properties\nwith respect to the Pd analogue, the most important one being the observation\nof spin-glass features at a temperature significantly higher than the Curie\ntemperature. This is attributed to a gradual evolution of cluster magnetism\nwith decreasing temperature. We infer that the changes in Nd 4f hybridization\ndue to Rh 4d (instead of Pd 4d) plays a role in some fashion for such\ndifferences. These properties are attributed to the competing magnetic ground\nstates due to geometrical frustration arising out of triangular arrangement of\nNd ions with a bond disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
