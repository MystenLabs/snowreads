We introduce GPT-HyperAgent, an\naugmentation of GPT with HyperAgent for uncertainty-aware, scalable exploration\nin contextual bandits, a fundamental online decision problem involving natural\nlanguage input. We prove that HyperAgent achieves fast incremental uncertainty\nestimation with $\\tilde{O}(\\log T)$ per-step computational complexity over $T$\nperiods under the linear realizable assumption. Our analysis demonstrates that\nHyperAgent's regret order matches that of exact Thompson sampling in linear\ncontextual bandits, closing a significant theoretical gap in scalable\nexploration. Empirical results in real-world contextual bandit tasks, such as\nautomated content moderation with human feedback, validate the practical\neffectiveness of GPT-HyperAgent for safety-critical decisions.
