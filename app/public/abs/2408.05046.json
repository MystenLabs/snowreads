By defining the activity of a skew class with respect to\na basis in a multimatroid, we obtain an activities expansion for the weighted\ntransition polynomial. We also decompose the set of all transversals of a\nmultimatroid as a union of subsets of transversals. Each term in the\ndecomposition has the structure of a boolean lattice, and each transversal\nbelongs to a number of terms depending only on the sizes of some of its skew\nclasses. Further expressions for the transition polynomial of a multimatroid\nare obtained via an equivalence relation on its bases and by extending Kochol's\ntheory of compatible sets.\n  We apply our multimatroid results to obtain a result of Morse about the\ntransition polynomial of a delta-matroid and get a partition of the boolean\nlattice of subsets of elements of a delta-matroid determined by the feasible\nsets. Finally, we describe how multimatroids arise from graphs embedded in\nsurfaces and apply our results to obtain an activities expansion for the\ntopological transition polynomial. Our work extends results for the Tutte\npolynomial of a matroid.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pCJcAbd2aak-c0LBmxxmCJnxT7ssBSkp34guplFJSzQ","pdfSize":"1234416"}
