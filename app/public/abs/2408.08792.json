While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools\nutilizing deep learning have shown promise, their generalization to diverse\nclinical settings remains poorly assessed. This study evaluates the\ngeneralization capabilities of a CAD model for malaria diagnosis from thin\nblood smear images across four sites. We explore strategies to enhance\ngeneralization, including fine-tuning and incremental learning. Our results\ndemonstrate that incorporating site-specific data significantly improves model\nperformance, paving the way for broader clinical application.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FIr-ar305fQFKJ78I37CN14oeVby_BQb_qKC8eOtikc","pdfSize":"1849678"}
