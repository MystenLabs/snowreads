We find that the effect of\ntopological solitons on magnons is captured generally by the non-Abelian\nemergent electromagnetic fields, distinct from the previously established gauge\ntheory for magnons in collinear magnets where the gauge theory is often\nrestricted to be Abelian. As concrete examples, $4\\pi$-vortices in\ntwo-/three-dimensional magnets and Shankar skyrmions in three-dimensional\nmagnets are discussed in detail, which are shown to induce, respectively, the\nAbelian and the non-Abelian topological magnetic field on magnons, and thereby\nengender the topological Hall transport in textured frustrated magnets. Our\nwork is applicable to a broad class of magnetic materials whose low-energy\nmanifold is described by the SO(3) order parameter. We envision that the\ndiscovery of the non-Abelian magnonic gauge theory will enrich the field of\nmagnonics as well as prompt the study of magnon transport in textured\nfrustrated magnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
