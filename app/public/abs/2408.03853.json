In particular we cover the cases where\nthe matrices $A_n$ are similarities, invertible, rank 1 or with non negative\ncoefficients.\n  These results are a consequence of a criterion of recurrence for a large\nclass of affine recursions on $\\mathbb R^d$, based on some moment assumptions\nof the so-called ``reverse norm control random variable\".\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-FF0KaDzdHMBdRi19SW-P2VgdPJCx_YUnM-PPBIG73U","pdfSize":"304656"}
