However, the phase of this voltage-controlled parametric\noscillator was unable to be locked uniquely by microwave VCMA effect. The\noscillation phase is locked in one of two possible states, which originates\nfrom the fact that the frequency of the microwave voltage is twice that of the\nmagnetization oscillation. In this work, we investigate the phase locking by\nadditional microwave voltage through analytical and numerical studies of the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. An analytical study suggests that the\nadditional voltage makes one of two phases more stable than the other by having\nasymmetric potential for the phase. The simulation results indicate a\ntrigonometric-function-like dependence of the locked rate on the phase of the\nadditional voltage, which qualitatively agrees with the analytical theory and\nalso suggests a possibility to manipulate the phase by the additional voltage.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Myu17Xao06woMu483numMA3n5RbxmsuwjJTLmUxxR4k","pdfSize":"1181072"}
