For this reason it\nis not straightforward to identify the corresponding field theory to be used as\nstarting point of Renormalization Group computations. Indeed, it could be\nidentified with the field theory of $n+1$ states Potts model in the limit of $n\n\\to 0$ only by means of the mapping discovered by Kasteleyn and Fortuin for\nbond percolation. In this paper we show that it is possible to recover the\nepsilon expansion for critical exponents in finite dimension directly using the\n$M$-layer expansion, without the need to perform any analytical continuation.\nMoreover, we also show explicitly that the critical exponents for site and bond\npercolation are the same. This computation provides a reference for\napplications of the $M$-layer method to systems where the underlying field\ntheory is unknown or disputed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"28rkbKnPkPmm1y_d4l4RffVN-lyDJoOS0SFyMMd50VE","pdfSize":"738295"}
