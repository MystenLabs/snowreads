Here we present a model-based procedure for the fabrication of\nsmall mode-volume ultrahigh Q silica WGM microresonators of varying geometries,\nfrom toroidal to micro-spheres. We experimentally demonstrate WGM resonators\nwith ultra-high qualities as high as $1.7\\times 10^8$ at 780nm. We present a\ntheoretical model that allows tailoring the recipe to attain the desired\ngeometry of the fabricated WGM microresonators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"572oh7O-Yblf-QMOw1qH7WcSnCIh7vf2FAtNNEJZryA","pdfSize":"6429484"}
