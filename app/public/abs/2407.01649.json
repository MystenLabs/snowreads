(2021)), the accurate computational modeling of\nantibody-antigen complexes remains a challenging task. In this paper, we first\nanalyze AF2's primary loss function, known as the Frame Aligned Point Error\n(FAPE), and raise a previously overlooked issue that FAPE tends to face\ngradient vanishing problem on high-rotational-error targets. To address this\nfundamental limitation, we propose a novel geodesic loss called Frame Aligned\nFrame Error (FAFE, denoted as F2E to distinguish from FAPE), which enables the\nmodel to better optimize both the rotational and translational errors between\ntwo frames. We then prove that F2E can be reformulated as a group-aware\ngeodesic loss, which translates the optimization of the residue-to-residue\nerror to optimizing group-to-group geodesic frame distance. By fine-tuning AF2\nwith our proposed new loss function, we attain a correct rate of 52.3\\% (DockQ\n$>$ 0.23) on an evaluation set and 43.8\\% correct rate on a subset with low\nhomology, with substantial improvement over AF2 by 182\\% and 100\\%\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"87usDTR5ioVjm2qNF5T3h6-bk3fAEZYy3d2PXL6ADoc","pdfSize":"13719964"}
