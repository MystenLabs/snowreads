Our\nconstruction brings together the physics of entanglement edge modes,\nnoncommutative geometry and quantum internal reference frames, to define a\nsubsystem whose reduced state is (approximately) an incoherent sum of density\nmatrices, corresponding to distinct spatial subregions. We show that in states\nwhere geometry emerges from semiclassical matrices, this sum is dominated by\nthe subregion with minimal boundary area. As in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, it\nis the computation of the entanglement that determines the subregion. We find\nthat coarse-graining is essential in our microscopic derivation, in order to\ncontrol the proliferation of highly curved and disconnected non-geometric\nsubregions in the sum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
