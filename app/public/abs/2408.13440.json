Forecasting conversation derailment predicts\nsigns of derailment in advance enabling proactive moderation of conversations.\nState-of-the-art approaches to conversation derailment forecasting sequentially\nencode conversations and use graph neural networks to model dialogue user\ndynamics. However, existing graph models are not able to capture complex\nconversational characteristics such as context propagation and emotional\nshifts. The use of common sense knowledge enables a model to capture such\ncharacteristics, thus improving performance. Following this approach, here we\nderive commonsense statements from a knowledge base of dialogue contextual\ninformation to enrich a graph neural network classification architecture. We\nfuse the multi-source information on utterance into capsules, which are used by\na transformer-based forecaster to predict conversation derailment. Our model\ncaptures conversation dynamics and context propagation, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art models on the CGA and CMV benchmark datasets\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
