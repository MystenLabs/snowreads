Using this underlying path of distributions and a performance\nmodel based on the variance of the normalisation constant estimator, we\nsystematically study dense schedule and large particle limits. From our theory\nand adaptive methods emerges a notion of global barrier capturing the inherent\ncomplexity of normalisation constant approximation under our performance model.\nWe then turn the resulting approximations into surrogate objective functions of\nalgorithm performance, and use them for methodology development. We obtain\nnovel adaptive methodologies, Sequential SMC (SSMC) and Sequential AIS (SAIS)\nsamplers, which address practical difficulties inherent in previous adaptive\nSMC methods. First, our SSMC algorithms are predictable: they produce a\nsequence of increasingly precise estimates at deterministic and known times.\nSecond, SAIS, a special case of SSMC, enables schedule adaptation at a memory\ncost constant in the number of particles and require much less communication.\nFinally, these characteristics make SAIS highly efficient on GPUs. We develop\nan open-source, high-performance GPU implementation based on our methodology\nand demonstrate up to a hundred-fold speed improvement compared to\nstate-of-the-art adaptive AIS methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
