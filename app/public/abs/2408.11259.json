Kleiner and I. Reiten,\n$\\mathscr{A}_\\k$ is {\\it Hom-finite} if the hom-space between any two objects\nin $\\mathscr{A}_\\k$ is finite-dimensional over $\\k$. We further say that\n$\\mathscr{A}_\\k$ is {\\it Ext-finite} if $\\dim_\\k\\Ext^i_\\A(X,Y)<\\infty$ for all\nobjects $X$ and $Y$ in $\\mathscr{A}_\\k$. Let $V$ be an object in\n$\\mathscr{A}_\\k$. In this note we prove that if $\\End_\\A(V)$ is isomorphic to\n$\\k$, then $V$ has a universal deformation ring $R(\\A,V)$, which is a local\ncomplete Noetherian commutative $\\k$-algebra whose residue field is also\nisomorphic to $\\k$. We use this result to prove that if $\\A$ is a local\ntwo-point infinite dimensional gentle $\\k$-algebra (in the sense of V. Bekkert\net al), then $R(\\A,V)$ is isomorphic either to $\\k$, to $\\k[\\![t]\\!]/(t^2)$ or\nto $\\k[\\![t]\\!]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
