The purpose of this study is to identify\nthe research trend, collaboration pattern, most influential elements, etc. from\nscientific publications related to COVID-19 in 2020, by using bibliographic\nanalysis and network analysis. In Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, motivation behind\nthis paper is introduced. Some previous similar studies are discussed.\nComparisons are made in different aspects, such as data collection methods,\ndata analysis tools and methods, etc. Their advantages and limitations compared\nto this paper are also addressed. In Chapter 3, important concepts used in this\npaper related to bibliographic analysis such as h-index and g-index, and\nnetwork analysis such as centrality measures and assortativity are introduced.\nNetworks with small-world property and scale-free property will also be\nstudied. In Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, the way the data are obtained for the\nanalysis of this paper is introduced step by step. Full result is shown. In\nChapter 6, conclusions are arrived. A general growing trend of the number of\nthe publications is observed, due to the efforts made by scientific\nresearchers. Meanwhile, measures should also be taken to encourage future study\nin this field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KvRM_WrQfKHP419P-HD9WCy-dqNP9Fr5c9A-W8rbqsE","pdfSize":"4634296"}
