However,\ndetecting defects with varying textures and anomaly classes during the test\ntime is challenging. This arises due to the differences in data distributions\nbetween source and target domains. Collecting and annotating new data from the\ntarget domain and retraining the model is time-consuming and costly. In this\npaper, we propose a novel test-time adaptation surface-defect detection\napproach that adapts pre-trained models to new domains and classes during\ninference. Our approach involves two core ideas. Firstly, we introduce a\nsupervisor to filter samples and select only those with high confidence to\nupdate the model. This ensures that the model is not excessively biased by\nincorrect data. Secondly, we propose the augmented mean prediction to generate\nrobust pseudo labels and a dynamically-balancing loss to facilitate the model\nin effectively integrating classification and segmentation results to improve\nsurface-defect detection accuracy. Our approach is real-time and does not\nrequire additional offline retraining. Experiments demonstrate it outperforms\nstate-of-the-art techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
