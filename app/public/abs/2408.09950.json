We give conditions for the integrability of the\npaths of such processes with respect to a finite, absolutely continuous measure\nand derive the distributional characteristics of the path integral with respect\nto said measure. The convolution of the path of a stationary-increment\nharmonizable stable process with a suitable measure yields a real stationary\nharmonizable stable process with finite control measure. This allows us to\nconstruct consistent estimators for the index of stability as well as the\nkernel function in the integral representation of a stationary increment\nharmonizable stable process (up to a constant factor). For real harmonizable\nfractional stable motions consistent estimators for the index of stability and\nits Hurst parameter are given. These are computed directly from the periodogram\nfrequency estimates of the smoothed process.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xnkZhVEis3PKfqxSIe41PMu0Dwu3XRxFUlAU4Ci9UKk","pdfSize":"560102"}
