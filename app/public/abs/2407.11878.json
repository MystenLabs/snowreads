In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages\nlearning theory and concentration inequalities to overcome the shortcomings of\ntraditional solutions. We focus on understanding the uncertainty in a\nclass-dependent manner, as captured by confidence bounds that we directly embed\ninto the learning process. By incorporating class-dependent estimates, our\nmethod can effectively adapt to the varying degrees of imbalance across\ndifferent classes, resulting in more robust and reliable classification\noutcomes. We empirically show how our framework provides a promising direction\nfor handling imbalanced data in classification tasks, offering practitioners a\nvaluable tool for building more accurate and trustworthy models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-6nZqBzVax_0Hu4bZ_q3oAeCnF9OM-MwFTCicOjqnlU","pdfSize":"13944854"}
