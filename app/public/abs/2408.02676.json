In this study, we explore whether such\ndisparities are present in the UK Biobank fundus retinal images by training and\nevaluating a disease classification model on these images. We assess possible\ndisparities across various population groups and find substantial differences\ndespite strong overall performance of the model. In particular, we discover\nunfair performance for certain assessment centres, which is surprising given\nthe rigorous data standardisation protocol. We compare how these differences\nemerge and apply a range of existing bias mitigation methods to each one. A key\ninsight is that each disparity has unique properties and responds differently\nto the mitigation methods. We also find that these methods are largely unable\nto enhance fairness, highlighting the need for better bias mitigation methods\ntailored to the specific type of bias.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ighUL7o1IZ07RhqTsUQIi3yblECNFr_8KV5TbOfML-E","pdfSize":"4697539"}
