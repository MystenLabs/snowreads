We examine finite\ngroups $G$ with the property that $x^k \\in H$ for every subgroup $H$ of $G$,\nwhere $k$ is the index of $H$ in $G$. We prove that a finite group $G$\nsatisfies this property if and only if $G$ is nilpotent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
