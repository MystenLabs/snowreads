The proposed method identifies relevant stream observations to\noptimize the underlying client model, given a local labeling budget, and\nperforms instantaneous labeling decisions without relying on any memory\nbuffering strategies. Our experiments show enhanced training batch diversity\nand an improved numerical robustness of the proposal compared to existing\nstrategies over large-scale data streams, making our approach an effective and\nconvenient solution in FL environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
