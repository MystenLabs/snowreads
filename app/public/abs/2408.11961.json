Regulatory frameworks for crypto assets are actively being\ndeveloped and refined, increasing the likelihood of such actions. The lack of\nsystematic analysis of the factors driving litigation against blockchain\nentities leaves companies in need of clarity to navigate compliance risks. This\nabsence of insight also deprives investors of the information for informed\ndecision-making. This study focuses on U.S. litigation against blockchain\nentities, particularly by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\ngiven its influence on global crypto regulation. Utilizing frontier pretrained\nlanguage models and large language models, we systematically map all SEC\ncomplaints against blockchain companies from 2012 to 2024 to thematic factors\nconceptualized by our study to delineate the factors driving SEC actions. We\nquantify the thematic factors and assess their influence on specific legal Acts\ncited within the complaints on an annual basis, allowing us to discern the\nregulatory emphasis, patterns and conduct trend analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
