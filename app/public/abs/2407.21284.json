However, SAM's robustness is\ncompromised by the decline in box quality, limiting its practicality in\nclinical reality. In this study, we propose a novel Robust Box prompt based SAM\n(\\textbf{RoBox-SAM}) to ensure SAM's segmentation performance under prompts\nwith different qualities. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a\nprompt refinement module to implicitly perceive the potential targets, and\noutput the offsets to directly transform the low-quality box prompt into a\nhigh-quality one. We then provide an online iterative strategy for further\nprompt refinement. Second, we introduce a prompt enhancement module to\nautomatically generate point prompts to assist the box-promptable segmentation\neffectively. Last, we build a self-information extractor to encode the prior\ninformation from the input image. These features can optimize the image\nembeddings and attention calculation, thus, the robustness of SAM can be\nfurther enhanced. Extensive experiments on the large medical segmentation\ndataset including 99,299 images, 5 modalities, and 25 organs/targets validated\nthe efficacy of our proposed RoBox-SAM.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
