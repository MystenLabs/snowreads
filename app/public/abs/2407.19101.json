The one-leg, two-step methods designed by Dahlquist, Liniger, and\nNevanlinna (henceforth the DLN method) are non-linearly stable and second-order\naccurate under arbitrary time grids. We design the family of variable\ntime-stepping DLN-Ensemble algorithms for multiple systems of NSE and prove\nthat its numerical solutions are stable and second-order accurate in velocity\nunder moderate time-step restrictions. Meanwhile, the family of algorithms can\nbe equivalently implemented by a simple refactorization process: adding time\nfilters on the backward Euler ensemble algorithm. In practice, we raise one\ntime adaptive mechanism (based on the local truncation error criterion) for the\nfamily of DLN-Ensemble algorithms to balance accuracy and computational costs.\nSeveral numerical tests are to support the main conclusions of the report. The\nconstant step test confirms the second-order convergence and time efficiency.\nThe variable step test verifies the stability of the numerical solutions and\nthe time efficiency of the adaptive mechanism.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
