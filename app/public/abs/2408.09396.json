This\nHamiltonian incorporates a gravitational spin-orbit coupling term, resulting in\nthe gravitational spin Hall effect (SHE), which separates electrons by their\nspin. By solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation for these electrons, we investigate\nthe gravitational SHE as they orbit a non-rotating gravitational source. Our\nfindings reveal that the spin-dependent separation of electrons increases in\nproportion to their orbital periods, significantly improving the detectability\nof gravitational SHE. Specifically, for electrons in a low Earth orbit, the\nseparation is estimated to be $3.0\\times 10^{-12}\\, \\text{m}$ annually. These\nresults indicate the practicality of detecting the gravitational SHE in\nelectrons orbiting Earth, especially with prolonged orbital durations,\nunderscoring the potential for quantum test of the Weak Equivalence Principle.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
