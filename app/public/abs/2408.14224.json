These probabilities depend on\na specified goal g and initial state s0. Our method maps these probabilities\nand observed facts into a real vector space to compute heuristic values for\npotential goals. These values estimate the likelihood of a given goal being the\ntrue objective of the observed agent. As obtaining exact expected probabilities\nfor observed facts in an observation sequence is often practically infeasible,\nwe propose and empirically validate a method for approximating these\nprobabilities. Our empirical results show that the proposed approach offers\nimproved goal recognition precision compared to state-of-the-art techniques\nwhile reducing computational complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
