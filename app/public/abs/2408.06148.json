Test coverage is the ratio of requirements or other non-code\nartifacts covered by a test suite, while code-coverage is the ratio of source\ncode covered by tests. Almost all coverage tools show a few certain subset of\ncoverage values, and almost always either test-coverage or code-coverage\nmeasures. In a large-scale industrial web-application-testing setting, we were\nfaced with the need to \"integrate\" several types of coverage data (including\nfront-end and back-end code coverage with requirements coverage), and to see\nall of them \"live\" as large model-based test suites were running. By being\nunable to find any off-the-shelf toolset to address the above need, we have\ndeveloped an open-source test coverage tool, specific for MBT, named MBTCover.\nIn addition to code coverage, the tool measures and reports requirements and\nmodel coverage, \"live\" as a given MBT test suite is executing. In this paper,\nwe present the features of the MBTCover tool and our experience from using it\nin multiple large test-automation projects in practice. Other software test\nengineers, who conduct web application testing and MBT, may find the tool\nuseful in their projects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
