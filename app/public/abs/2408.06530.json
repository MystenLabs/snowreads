However,\nif $X$ is a smooth projective variety over a field of positive characteristic\nand $L$ is an ample divisor on $X$, it is an open question whether linear\nsystems of the form $\\lvert K_X+aK_X+bL \\rvert$ can be made basepoint-free or\nvery ample with $a$ and $b$ only depending on the dimension of $X$. We\nconjecture that such $a$ and $b$ exist and prove a strong version of this\nconjecture for basepoint-freeness, very ampleness, and jet ampleness on smooth\nprojective surfaces in arbitrary characteristic. We do not use the\nclassification of surfaces. In positive characteristic, we prove these\npositivity properties hold for Schwede's canonical linear system\n$S^0(X,\\omega_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_X(aK_X+bL))$. To prove these results, we\nprove new results on Seshadri constants, moving Seshadri constants, and\nFrobenius-Seshadri constants, which in the singular case are new even over the\ncomplex numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
