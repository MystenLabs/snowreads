This result is the nonlocal\ncounterpart of that obtained by Bellettini and Paolini, where they proposed a\nphase-field approximation of the Willmore functional based on the first\nvariation of the (local) Allen-Cahn energies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
