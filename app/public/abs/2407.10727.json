We quantitatively characterize their height distributions at\nsteady states by minimizing effective free energy based on a segregation\ntemperature that captures the competition between the mixing entropy and\ngravitational potential energy. We find this temperature coincides with\nEdwards' compactivity within error under various pressures and cyclic shear\namplitudes. Therefore, we find that granular segregation in quasi-static\nconditions can be fundamentally explained by an effective granular\nthermodynamic framework including real energy terms based on the Edwards\nstatistical ensemble.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
