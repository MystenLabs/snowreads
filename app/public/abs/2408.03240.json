This study involves a sample of individuals\nwho can be trained or not to assess a product using a hedonic scale or notes,\nwhere the experimental design is a balanced incomplete block design. In this\ncontext, integrating sensory analysis with effective statistical methods, which\nconsider the nature of the response variables, is essential to answer the aim\nof the experimental study. Some techniques are available to analyse sensory\ndata, such as response surface models or categorical models. This article\nproposes using beta regression as an alternative to the proportional odds\nmodel, addressing some convergence problems, especially regarding the number of\nparameters. Moreover, the beta distribution is flexible for heteroscedasticity\nand asymmetry data. To this end, we conducted simulation studies that showed\nagreement rates in product selection using both models. Also, we presented a\nmotivational study that was developed to select prebiotic drinks based on\ncashew nuts added to grape juice. In this application, the beta regression\nmixed model results corroborated with the selected formulations using the\nproportional mixed model.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
