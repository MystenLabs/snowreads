For a higher-spin ferromagnetic XXZ chain\nwith single-ion anisotropy, several features regarding the evolution of the\nlow-lying two-magnon bound states with varying wave number were observed in the\nliterature. However, most of these observations are only qualitatively\nunderstood due to the lack of analytical tools. By combining a set of exact\ntwo-magnon Bloch states and a plane-wave ansatz, we achieve a complete solution\nof the two-magnon problem in such a system. We identify parameter regions that\nsupport different types of two-magnon bound states, with the boundaries defined\nby algebraic equations. We discover for the first time a narrow region in which\ntwo single-ion bound states coexist. We show that the phase diagrams for\ndistinct wave numbers are similar to each other, which enables us to map the\nevolution of the bound states to the rectilinear movement of a representative\npoint for given parameters in a rescaled phase diagram. This dynamic picture\nprovides quantitative interpretations of the observed features.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
