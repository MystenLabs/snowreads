One of the fields, in\nwhich NCAs perform well is the generation of textures, modelling global\npatterns from local interactions governed by uniform and coherent rules. This\npaper aims to enhance the usability of NCAs in texture synthesis by addressing\na shortcoming of current NCA architectures for texture generation, which\nrequires separately trained NCA for each individual texture. In this work, we\ntrain a single NCA for the evolution of multiple textures, based on individual\nexamples. Our solution provides texture information in the state of each cell,\nin the form of an internally coded genomic signal, which enables the NCA to\ngenerate the expected texture. Such a neural cellular automaton not only\nmaintains its regenerative capability but also allows for interpolation between\nlearned textures and supports grafting techniques. This demonstrates the\nability to edit generated textures and the potential for them to merge and\ncoexist within the same automaton. We also address questions related to the\ninfluence of the genomic information and the cost function on the evolution of\nthe NCA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
