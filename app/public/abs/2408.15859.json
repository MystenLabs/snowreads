Typically, this manifests as polar order superimposed atop\nconventional phase structures and is thus far limited to orthogonal phase\ntypes. Here we report a family of materials which exhibit a previously unseen\nstate of matter which we conclude is a polar smectic C phase, and so we term it\nSmC${_\\textrm{P}}$. The spontaneous polarisation of the SmC${_\\textrm{P}}$\nphase is over two orders of magnitude larger than that found in conventional\nferroelectric SmC phase of chiral materials used in some LCD devices. Fully\natomistic molecular dynamics simulations faithfully and spontaneously reproduce\nthe proposed structure and associated bulk properties; comparison of\nexperimental and simulated X-ray scattering patterns shows excellent agreement.\nThe materials disclosed here have significantly smaller dipole moments than\ntypical polar liquid crystals such as RM734 which suggests the role of\nmolecular electrical polarity in generating polar order is perhaps overstated,\na view supported by consideration of other molecular systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
