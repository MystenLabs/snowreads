To show that, we present the concept of proper irradiance\nfor a partially polarized lightwave. The analogous effect of the twin paradox\nis that the proper irradiance of the incoherent addition of two partially\npolarized lightwaves exceeds the sum of the proper irradiances of each\nindividual lightwave. This effect does not pose a paradox in optics. The analog\nof time dilation is the increase in irradiance experienced by a lightwave as it\npropagates through a pure dichroic device.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
