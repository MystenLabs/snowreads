Two reduced expressions are said to\nbe braid equivalent if they are related via a sequence of braid moves. Braid\nequivalence is an equivalence relation and the corresponding equivalence\nclasses are called braid classes. Each braid class can be encoded in terms of a\nbraid graph in a natural way. In a recent paper, Awik et al.~proved that when a\nCoxeter system is simply laced and triangle free (i.e., the corresponding\nCoxeter graph has no three-cycles), the braid graph for a reduced expression is\na partial cube (i.e., isometric to a subgraph of a hypercube). In this paper,\nwe will provide an alternate proof of this fact, as well as determine the\nminimal dimension hypercube into which a braid graph can be isometrically\nembedded, which addresses an open question posed by Awik et al. For our main\nresult, we prove that braid graphs in simply-laced triangle-free Coxeter\nsystems are median, which is a strengthening of previous results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
