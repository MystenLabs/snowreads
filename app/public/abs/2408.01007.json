EVA models extreme\nevents using distributions such as Fr\\'echet, Weibull, or Gumbel, aiding in\nrisk prediction and management. This review explores EVA's application to\nnanoscale biosystems. Traditionally, biological research focuses on average\nvalues from repeated experiments. However, EVA offers insights into molecular\nmechanisms by examining extreme data points. We introduce EVA's concepts with\nsimulations and review its use in studying motor protein movements within\ncells, highlighting the importance of in vivo analysis due to the complex\nintracellular environment. We suggest EVA as a tool for extracting motor\nproteins' physical properties in vivo and discuss its potential in other\nbiological systems. While EVA's use in nanoscale biological systems is limited,\nit holds promise for uncovering hidden properties in extreme data, promoting\nits broader application in life sciences.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"T1yDjlncTXHx6du_Sa6_VMH5sTv6w4Gcx6e_tRENREg","pdfSize":"7021669"}
