We establish a criterion for the convergence of\nthe Poincar\\'e--Dulac normal form of the systems and examine the relationship\nbetween the normal form and integrability. Additionally, we introduce an\nefficient algorithm to determine the necessary conditions for the integrability\nof the systems. This algorithm is then applied to a quadratic subfamily of the\nsystems to analyze its integrability and linearizability. Our findings offer\ninsights into the integrability properties of three-dimensional polynomial\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
