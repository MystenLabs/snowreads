We give several geometric formulations\nof this flow, which yield a series of a priori estimates for the flow and also\nfor the Hull-Strominger system. The evolution equations are derived using the\ntheory of string algebroids, a class of Courant algebroids which occur\nnaturally in higher gauge theory. Using this, we interpret the flow as\ngeneralized Ricci flow and also as a higher/coupled version of\nHermitian-Yang-Mills flow, proving furthermore that it is compatible with\nsymmetry reduction. Regarding our main analytical results, we prove a priori\n$C^{\\infty}$ estimates for uniformly parabolic solutions. This in particular\nsettles the question of smooth regularity of uniformly elliptic solutions of\nthe Hull-Strominger system, generalizing Yau's $C^3$ estimate for the complex\nMonge-Amp\\`ere equation. We prove global existence and convergence results for\nthe flow on special backgrounds, and discuss a conjectural relationship of the\nflow to the geometrization of Reid's fantasy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
