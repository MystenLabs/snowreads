I\ntest the effect of risk on the present-bias factor given quasi-hyperbolic\ndiscounting. In my experiment workers allocate about thirty to fifty minutes of\nreal-effort tasks between two weeks. I study dynamic consistency by comparing\nchoices made two days in advance of the workday with choices made when work is\nimminent. My novel design permits estimation of present bias using a decision\nwith a consequence that is both immediate and certain. I find greater present\nbias when the consequence is certain. This finding has implications for any\neconomic decision involving a present-biased decision-maker, including labor\ncontracting and consumer good pricing. I offer a methodological remedy for\nexperimental economists.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
