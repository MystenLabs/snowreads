Specifically, we\nstudied these effects in magnetic-dominated regions in magnetic-arrested disk\n(MAD), focusing on the $3$-hour variability at $230$ GHz -- $M_{\\Delta T}$. In\nthis study, we investigate how variations in electron temperature prescription\nparameter, $R_{\\rm Low}$, influence $M_{\\Delta T}$ by analyzing a series of\ngeneral-relativistic raytracing (GRRT) snapshots. In certain black hole models\nwith a spin $a > 0$, we discover that increasing $R_{\\rm Low}$ renders the\nphoton ring more optically thick, obscuring the varying accretion flows that\ncontribute to the variability. However, as $R_{\\rm Low}$ increases further, MAD\nflux eruptions become more pronounced, compensating for the decrease in\n$M_{\\Delta T}$. For models with a spin $a < 0$, although a higher $R_{\\rm Low}$\nalso increases the optical thickness of the fluid, voids within the optically\nthick gas fail to cover the entire photon ring. Similarly, flux eruptions are\nmore prominent as $R_{\\rm Low}$ increases further, contributing to the observed\nrise in $M_{\\Delta T}$ against $R_{\\rm Low}$. For black holes with $a \\approx\n0$, although the effect of increasing optical depth is still present, their\n$230$ GHz light curves and hence $M_{\\Delta T}$ are insensitive to the changes\nin $R_{\\rm Low}$. Furthermore, we find that the variability of the $230$ GHz\nlight curves at $R_{\\rm Low} = 1$ correlates with fluctuations in the internal\nenergy of the gas near the black hole, indicating that unusual gas heating may\nbe the source of significant $M_{\\Delta T}$ seen in simulations. Our findings\nhighlight potential approaches for refining $M_{\\Delta T}$ to better align with\nobservations when modelling Sgr A* or other low-luminosity active galactic\nnuclei.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
