Here, we\nleverage the multilevel internal structure of the atoms to study the physics of\nCooper pair breaking in this system. In doing so, we observe and distinguish\nthe properties of two distinct many-body gaps, the BCS pairing gap and the\nspectral gap, using nondestructive readout techniques. The latter is found to\ndepend on the populations of the internal atomic states, reflecting the\nchemical potential dependence predicted in fermionic superfluids. This work\nopens the path for more fully exploiting the rich internal structure of atoms\nin cavity QED emulators to study both analogous systems and also more exotic\nstates yet to be realized.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
