Novel computing paradigms,\nsuch as neuromorphic computing, promise substantial gains in computational\npower efficiency. However, it is unknown whether it is feasible or efficient to\nrealize practical PHY algorithms on such platforms. In this work, we evaluate\nfor the first time the potential of neuromorphic computing principles for\nmulti-user (MU)-MIMO detection. In particular, we developed the first\nspiking-based MU-MIMO simulator that meets practical error-rate targets,\nsuggesting power gains of at least one order of magnitude when realized on\nactual neuromorphic hardware, compared to conventional processing platforms.\nFinally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions that could\nunlock practical neuromorphic-based MU-MIMO systems and revolutionize PHY power\nefficiency.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
