In addition to gravitational lensing, we\ninclude an absorbing dielectric medium given by a complex refractive index\nknown as the Drude model. When absorption is included the eikonal becomes\ncomplex, with the imaginary part related to the absorption along a ray between\nemission and observation points. We extend results from the literature to\ninclude dispersion in the index of refraction. The complex Hamiltonian splits\ninto a real part that describes the equations of motion and a constraint\nequation that governs the momentum loss in the system. We work in coordinates\nwhich are fully real, with a real metric in physical spacetime. We assume the\ndust and plasma distributions of the Drude matter to coincide and vary as a\npower-law $1/r^h$. We find that transmission requires $h>1$, otherwise\nexponential absorption occurs along ray paths. We use ray-tracing through\nstrongly absorbing matter near the surface of the compact star, as well as\nspecializing to a point-lens in the weak-field limit with weakly absorbing\nmatter to generate potentially observable light curves for distant observers.\nIn the appropriate limits, our theory reproduces results from the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
