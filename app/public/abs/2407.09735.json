Traditional\nmethods often fall short because they only apply to selected completely at\nrandom (SCAR) PU data, where the labeled positive and unlabeled positive data\nare assumed to be from the same distribution. In contrast, our DETM's dual\nstructure effectively accommodates the more complex and underexplored selected\nat random PU data, where the labeled and unlabeled positive data can be from\ndifferent distributions. We rigorously establish the theoretical foundations of\nDETM, including identifiability, parameter estimation, and asymptotic\nproperties. Additionally, we move forward to statistical inference by\ndeveloping a goodness-of-fit test for the SCAR condition and constructing\nconfidence intervals for the proportion of positive instances in the target\ndomain. We leverage an approximated Bayes classifier for classification tasks,\ndemonstrating DETM's robust performance in prediction. Through theoretical\ninsights and practical applications, this study highlights DETM as a\ncomprehensive framework for addressing the challenges of PU data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
