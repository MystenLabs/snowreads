In this paper, we aim to use biplanar X-rays to\nreconstruct a 3D CT image, because biplanar X-rays convey richer information\nthan single-view X-rays and are more commonly used by surgeons. Different from\nprevious studies in which the two X-ray views were treated indifferently when\nfusing the cross-view data, we propose a novel attention-informed\ncoarse-to-fine cross-view fusion method to combine the features extracted from\nthe orthogonal biplanar views. This method consists of a view attention\nalignment sub-module and a fine-distillation sub-module that are designed to\nwork together to highlight the unique or complementary information from each of\nthe views. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method\nover the SOTA methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
