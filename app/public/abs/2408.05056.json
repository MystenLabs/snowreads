In order to tackle this challenge, we\nexplore the multi-dimensional parameter space of tractography using\nstreamline-specific parameters (SSP). We 1) validate a state-of-the-art\nprobabilistic tracking method using per-streamline parameters on synthetic\ndata, and 2) show how we can gain insights into the parameter space by focusing\non streamline acceptance using real-world data. We demonstrate the potential\nadded value of SSP to the current state of tractography by showing how SSP can\nbe used to reveal patterns in the parameter space.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"c__HqES0WTKSFJFDJsupoPzl4lLKGddpPg5w0rXcZGw","pdfSize":"7918078"}
