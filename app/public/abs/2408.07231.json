We prove\nthat our method has a conservative (non-negative) bias in finite samples under\nstandard statistical assumptions, and provide a bootstrap method for assessing\nits standard error. For methods like the Lasso, forward-stepwise regression,\nand the graphical Lasso, our estimator serves as a valuable companion to\ncross-validation, illuminating the tradeoff between prediction error and\nvariable selection accuracy as a function of the model complexity parameter.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
