The type of seed considered has a boundary characterised by surface\nenergy terms. The theory applies to false vacuum decay at zero and finite\ntemperatures. Seeded nucleation may be important for enabling future false\nvacuum decay experiments on analogue systems using Bose Einstein Condensates\n(BEC). We show that our theory of seeded nucleation at finite temperature\napplied to a potassium BEC in two spatial dimensions agrees with numerical,\nreal-time, simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
