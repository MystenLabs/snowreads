The utilization of honeypots has\nbeen extensively studied in the past; however, selecting appropriate decoy\nconfigurations for a given cyber scenario (and subsequently\nretrieving/generating them) remain open challenges. Existing approaches often\nrely on maintaining lists of configurations or storing collections of\npre-configured images, lacking adaptability and efficiency. In this pioneering\nstudy, we present a novel approach that leverages GANs' learning capabilities\nto tackle these challenges. To the best of our knowledge, no prior attempts\nhave been made to utilize GANs specifically for generating decoy\nconfigurations. Our research aims to address this gap and provide cyber\ndefenders with a powerful tool to bolster their network defenses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
