We\nhave previously proposed a two-dimensional magnetic monopole gas (2DMG),\nconfined at the interface between spin-ice ($R_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho) and\nantiferromagnetic iridate ($R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho), which hosts\nmonopoles with a net charge. The mechanism behind the 2D confinement of the\nmonopole gas remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that entropy is a\nkey factor in the 2D confinement of this monopole gas. We reveal that the\ncompetition between the entropy of spin-ice, which favors the 2D confinement,\nand the entropy of the monopoles' random walks, which favors the deconfinement,\ndictates the distribution of the monopoles within a few layers close to the\ninterface. Our entropy-based model accurately reproduces the monopole\ndistribution obtained from the spin model, affirming that 2D confinement is\nentropy-driven. We further employ both models to show that the monopole\ndistribution can be manipulated by an external magnetic field and temperature,\nholding promise for next-generation devices based on magnetic monopoles. Our\nfindings reveal the entropic mechanisms in 2DMG, enabling the manipulation of\nemergent quasiparticles at material interfaces.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
