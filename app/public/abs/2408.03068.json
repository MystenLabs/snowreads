Utilizing the maximum entropy approach, we derive the valence\nquark distributions at elevated resolution scales via a modified DGLAP\nequation, which integrates GLR-MQ-ZRS corrections for the $Q^2$ evolution. Our\nfindings indicate that the resulting $Q^2$-dependent valence quark\ndistributions yield an optimal fit to experimental data, with an inferred\nparameter value of $q$ ($q = 0.91$), diverging from unity. This deviation\nhighlights the significant role that correlations among valence quarks play in\nshaping our understanding of pion internal structure. Additionally, our\ncomputations of the first three moments of pion quark distributions at $ Q^2 =\n4 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ display consistency with alternative theoretical models,\nthereby reinforcing the importance of incorporating valence quark correlations\nwithin this analytical framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
