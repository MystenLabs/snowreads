In short, for these variants the player has\nonly the two options of hit or stand, and they may only make either decision\nonce. Other minor variations including rule modifications, changes in number of\ndecks, alternate payout structures, and different given information about\ndealer's hand are also considered. An interesting theoretical result regarding\nthe asymptotic behavior of the basic strategy and overall expectation as the\nnumber of decks increase is also proved.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
