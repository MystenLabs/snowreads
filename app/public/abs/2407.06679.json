Studying these phenomena\nin space plasmas, like the solar wind, is facilitated by the intrinsic scale\nseparations and the availability of in situ spacecraft observations. However,\nthe single-point or single-scale configurations of current spacecraft limit our\nunderstanding of many properties of the turbulent solar wind. To overcome these\nlimitations, multipoint measurements spanning a range of characteristic scales\nare essential. This paper prepares for the enhanced measurement capabilities of\nupcoming multispacecraft missions by demonstrating that higher-order\nstatistics, specifically kurtosis, as a baseline for intermittency can be\naccurately measured. Using synthetic turbulent fields with adjustable\nintermittency levels, we achieve scale separations analogous to those in the\nsolar wind and apply these techniques to the planned trajectories of the\nHelioSwarm mission. This approach promises significant advancements in our\nunderstanding of plasma turbulence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
