In this article, our focus is the dimer\nface polynomial of $G$, which is the height generating function of all perfect\nmatchings of $G$. We connect the dimer face polynomial on the one hand to knot\ntheory, and on the other to cluster algebras. We show that certain dimer face\npolynomials are multivariate generalizations of Alexander polynomials of links,\nhighlighting another combinatorial view of the Alexander polynomial. We also\nshow that an arbitrary dimer face polynomial is an $F$-polynomial in the\ncluster algebra whose initial quiver is dual to the graph $G$. As a result, we\nrecover a recent representation theoretic result of Bazier-Matte and Schiffler\nthat connects $F$-polynomials and Alexander polynomials, albeit from a very\ndifferent, dimer-based perspective. As another application of our results, we\nalso show that all nonvanishing Pl\\\"ucker coordinates on open positroid\nvarieties are cluster monomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
