Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes\nand survival rates. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has shown\nremarkable progress in extracting and analyzing crucial information from\nmedical imaging data.EfficientNetB3, an advanced convolutional neural network\narchitecture, has emerged as a leading model for image classification tasks,\nincluding medical imaging. Its superior performance, characterized by high\naccuracy, precision, and recall, makes it particularly promising for OSCC\ndetection and diagnosis. EfficientNetB3 achieved an accuracy of 0.9833,\nprecision of 0.9782, and recall of 0.9782 in our analysis. By leveraging\nEfficientNetB3 and other deep learning technologies, clinicians can potentially\nimprove the accuracy and efficiency of OSCC diagnosis, leading to more timely\ninterventions and better patient outcomes. This article also discusses the role\nof deep learning in advancing precision medicine for OSCC and provides insights\ninto prospects and challenges in leveraging this technology for enhanced cancer\ncare.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"klan_ut427c661PjORCHUecTJIpGvQa9FmPrfRKPTQw","pdfSize":"2490045"}
