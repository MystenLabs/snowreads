Using data from a\nreal-world maternal health program, we demonstrate how a cognitive model based\non Instance-Based Learning (IBL) Theory can augment existing purely\ncomputational approaches. Our findings show that, compared to general\ntime-series forecasters (e.g., LSTMs), IBL models, which reflect human\ndecision-making processes, better predict the dynamics of individuals' states.\nAdditionally, IBL provides estimates of the volatility in individuals' states\nand their sensitivity to interventions, which can improve the efficiency of\ntraining of other time series models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
