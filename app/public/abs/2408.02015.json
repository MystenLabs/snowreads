Compared to other hadron multiplets, the flavor symmetry\nof baryon decuplet is more simple and attractive. In this work, we study the\ntopological amplitudes of charmed baryon decays into decuplet baryon in the\nflavor symmetry and the linear $SU(3)_F$ breaking. It is found most of\ntopological diagrams are suppressed by the Korner-Pati-Woo theorem in the\n$SU(3)_F$ limit. Only two independent amplitudes contributing to the\n$\\mathcal{B}_{c\\overline 3}\\to \\mathcal{B}_{10}M$ decays and one of them is\ndominated in the branching fractions. The Lee-Yang parameters of all\n$\\mathcal{B}_{c\\overline 3}\\to \\mathcal{B}_{10}M$ modes are the same in the\n$SU(3)_F$ limit, and there are only four possible values for the CP\nasymmetries. After including the first-order $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects, the\n$\\Xi^+_c\\to \\Sigma^{* +}\\overline K^0$ and $\\Xi^+_c\\to \\Xi^{* 0}\\pi^+$ decays\nhave non-zero branching fractions. The amount of free parameters contributing\nto the $\\mathcal{B}_{c\\overline 3}\\to \\mathcal{B}_{10}M$ decays in the linear\n$SU(3)_F$ breaking is smaller than the available data. The $SU(3)_F$ breaking\npart of quark loop diagram can be extracted by a global fitting of branching\nfractions, which could help us to understand the CP violation in charm sector.\nBesides, some new isospin equations are proposed to test the Korner-Pati-Woo\ntheorem and the isospin symmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AUbxG1QdpZKNiQ65dajei0YgQuXQoRWw06f7BgOwJvg","pdfSize":"735872","txDigest":"2uYEGR3UfyoL6rGAWnnUw7G5dWHorD1rKBRw1FV7si2Y","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
