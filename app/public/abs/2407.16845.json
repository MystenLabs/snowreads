We show that electron mass variations not only allow for significant\neasing of the Hubble tension but are also preferred at a decent level of\nsignificance using the latest DESI data (between $2\\sigma$ and $3.6\\sigma$\ndepending on the model and the data). This extreme success of the model is\nneither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big\nbang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and\natomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor\nof or against this model. Models of baryon mass variations, on the other hand,\nare shown to generally not be cosmologically interesting.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
