Reggeized amplitudes are constructed according to the effective\nfield theory formalism for multi-Regge kinematics processes suggested by L.N.\nLipatov. To avoid the double counting between tree-level corrections and\nunintegrated parton distribution functions, a subtraction scheme is introduced.\nThe results of calculations are compared with experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
