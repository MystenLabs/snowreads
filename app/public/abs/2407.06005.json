This\nresearch focuses on the extraction and combination of various features to\nenhance the accuracy of deception detection models. By systematically\nextracting features from visual, audio, and text data, and experimenting with\ndifferent combinations, we developed a robust model that achieved an impressive\n99% accuracy. Our methodology emphasizes the significance of feature\nengineering in deception detection, providing a clear and interpretable\nframework. We trained various machine learning models, including LSTM, BiLSTM,\nand pre-trained CNNs, using both single and multi-modal approaches. The results\ndemonstrated that combining multiple modalities significantly enhances\ndetection performance compared to single modality training. This study\nhighlights the potential of strategic feature extraction and combination in\ndeveloping reliable and transparent automated deception detection systems in\nvideo analysis, paving the way for more advanced and accurate detection\nmethodologies in future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8Izhqy3grHZ0_hcUVdtap4fZxhQtUPBZ90im2JbqgAo","pdfSize":"2643945"}
