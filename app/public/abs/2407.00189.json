When $n=1,2,3$ (and\nassuming technical conjectures for $n \\geq 4$), we prove that this refined\ninvariant categorifies the spin-colored $\\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}$ quantum link\npolynomial. Along the way, we partially develop the theory of quantum\n$\\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}$ webs and make contact with $\\iota$quantum groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
