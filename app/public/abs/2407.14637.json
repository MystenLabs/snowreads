The extensible\ndirectors yields a linear configuration space incorporating constant in-plane\ncross-sectional strains. Higher-order (incompatible) strains are introduced to\ncorrect stiffness, whose additional degrees-of-freedom are eliminated by an\nelement-wise condensation. Further, the present discretization of the initial\ndirector field leads to the objectivity of approximated strain measures,\nregardless of the degree of basis functions. For physical stress resultants and\nstrains, we employ a global patch-wise approxiation using B-spline basis\nfunctions, whose higher-order continuity enables to use much less\ndegrees-of-freedom, compared to element-wise approximation. For time-stepping,\nwe employ an implicit energy-momentum consistent scheme, which exhibits\nsuperior numerical stability in comparison to standard trapezoidal and\nmid-point rules. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the present\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
