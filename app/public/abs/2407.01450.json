The latter is crucially based on the construction of dual\nPBW-type bases of $U^{\\pm}_{r,s}(\\mathfrak{g})$ consisting of the ordered\nproducts of quantum root vectors defined via $(r,s)$-bracketings and\ncombinatorics of standard Lyndon words. We further derive explicit formulas for\naffine $R$-matrices, both through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [M.Ge,\nY.Wu, K.Xue, \"Explicit trigonometric Yang-Baxterization\", Internat. J. Modern\nPhys. A 6 (1991), no.21, 3735-3779] and as the unique intertwiner between the\ntensor product of $V(u)$ and $V(v)$, viewed as modules over two-parameter\nquantum affine algebras $U_{r,s}(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{g}})$ for classical\n$\\mathfrak{g}$. The latter generalizes the formulas of [M.Jimbo, \"Quantum R\nmatrix for the generalized Toda system\", Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), no. 4,\n537-547] for one-parametric quantum affine algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
