To alleviate\nthese problems, we propose {\\bf ELLA}, a tool for {\\bf E}mpowering {\\bf L}LMs\nfor interpretable, accurate, and informative {\\bf L}egal {\\bf A}dvice. ELLA\nvisually presents the correlation between legal articles and LLM's response by\ncalculating their similarities, providing users with an intuitive legal basis\nfor the responses. Besides, based on the users' queries, ELLA retrieves\nrelevant legal articles and displays them to users. Users can interactively\nselect legal articles for LLM to generate more accurate responses. ELLA also\nretrieves relevant legal cases for user reference. Our user study shows that\npresenting the legal basis for the response helps users understand better. The\naccuracy of LLM's responses also improves when users intervene in selecting\nlegal articles for LLM. Providing relevant legal cases also aids individuals in\nobtaining comprehensive information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
