In modern\nwater markets, the two widely used trading systems are an improved pair-wise\ntrading, and a 'smart market' or common pool method. In comparison with the\neconomic model, this paper constructs a conceptual mathematic model through the\nHARA utility functions. Mirroring the concepts such as Nash Equilibrium, Pareto\noptimal and stable matching in economy, three significant propositions are\nacquired which illustrate the advantages of the common pool method compared\nwith the improved pair-wise trading.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
