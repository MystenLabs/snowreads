Starting\nfrom the correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics, basic\nsemi-classical analysis tools and results are presented. The three topics are\ninvestigated in the light of the introduced techniques allowing one to\nemphasize different aspects of semi-classical analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
