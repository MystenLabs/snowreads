PPI strategies enable investors to mitigate downside\nrisk while still retaining the potential for upside gains. This is achieved by\nmaintaining an exposure to risky assets proportional to the difference between\nthe portfolio value and the present value of the guaranteed amount. While PPI\nstrategies are known to be free of downside risk in diffusion modeling\nframeworks with continuous trading, see e.g., Cont and Tankov (2009), real\nmarket applications exhibit a significant non-negligible risk, known as gap\nrisk, which increases with the multiplier value. The goal of this paper is to\ndetermine the optimal PPI strategy in a setting where gap risk may occur, due\nto downward jumps in the asset price dynamics. We consider a loss-averse agent\nwho aims at maximizing the expected utility of the terminal wealth exceeding a\nminimum guarantee. Technically, we model agent's preferences with an S-shaped\nutility functions to accommodate the possibility that gap risk occurs, and\naddress the optimization problem via a generalization of the martingale\napproach that turns to be valid under market incompleteness in a jump-diffusion\nframework.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
