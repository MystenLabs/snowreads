We explore the task of\nEASTE solving capabilities of language models based on transformers\narchitecture from our proposed unified-loss approach via token classification\ntask using BERT architecture to text generative models such as Flan-T5,\nFlan-Ul2 to Llama2, Llama3 and Mixtral employing different alignment techniques\nsuch as zero/few-shot learning, Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) such as\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The model performances are evaluated on the\nSamEval-2016 benchmark dataset representing the fair comparison to existing\nworks. Our research not only aims to achieve high performance on the EASTE task\nbut also investigates the impact of model size, type, and adaptation techniques\non task performance. Ultimately, we provide detailed insights and achieving\nstate-of-the-art results in complex sentiment analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
