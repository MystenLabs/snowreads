However, the powerful magnetic fields and limited space within\nan MRI scanner require the use of robotic devices to aid surgeons.\nPiezoelectric motors are commonly utilized to drive these robots, with\npiezoelectric ultrasonic motors being particularly notable. These motors\nconsist of a piezoelectric ring stator that is bonded to a rotor through\nfrictional coupling. When the stator is excited at specific frequencies, it\ngenerates distinctive mode shapes with surface waves that exhibit both in-plane\nand out-of-plane displacement, leading to the rotation of the rotor. In this\nstudy, we continue our previous work and refine the motor design and\nperformance, we combine finite element modeling (FEM) with stroboscopic and\ntime-averaged digital holography to validate a further plastic-based ultrasonic\nmotor with better rotary performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
