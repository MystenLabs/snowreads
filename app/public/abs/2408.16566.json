Random variables are independent across different vertices.\nThe goal is to compute a $\\rho$-rooted path of length at most $B$, in a\npossibly adaptive fashion, that maximizes the reward collected from jobs that\nprocessed by time $W$. To our knowledge, CSKO has not been considered before,\nthough prior work has considered the uncorrelated problem, {\\em stochastic\nknapsack orienteering}, and {\\em correlated orienteering}, which features only\none budget constraint on the {\\em sum} of travel-time and processing-times.\n  We show that the {\\em adaptivity gap of CSKO is not a constant, and is at\nleast $\\Omega\\bigl(\\max\\sqrt{\\log{B}},\\sqrt{\\log\\log{W}}\\}\\bigr)$}.\nComplementing this, we devise {\\em non-adaptive} algorithms that obtain: (a)\n$O(\\log\\log W)$-approximation in quasi-polytime; and (b) $O(\\log\nW)$-approximation in polytime. We obtain similar guarantees for CSKO with\ncancellations, wherein a job can be cancelled before its completion time,\nforegoing its reward. We also consider the special case of CSKO, wherein job\nsizes are weighted Bernoulli distributions, and more generally where the\ndistributions are supported on at most two points (2-CSKO). Although weighted\nBernoulli distributions suffice to yield an $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log\\log B})$\nadaptivity-gap lower bound for (uncorrelated) {\\em stochastic orienteering}, we\nshow that they are easy instances for CSKO. We develop non-adaptive algorithms\nthat achieve $O(1)$-approximation in polytime for weighted Bernoulli\ndistributions, and in $(n+\\log B)^{O(\\log W)}$-time for the more general case\nof 2-CSKO.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
