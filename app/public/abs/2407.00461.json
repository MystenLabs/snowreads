In particular, $1$-cooperative systems\nare just cooperative systems. Strongly $2$-cooperative systems satisfy a strong\n\\Poincare-Bendixson property: any bounded solution that evolves in a compact\nset containing no equilibria converges to a periodic orbit. For $3$-dimensional\nstrongly $2$-cooperative nonlinear systems, we provide a sufficient condition\nthat guarantees the existence of an invariant compact set in the state space\nthat includes an attracting periodic orbit. We show that our theoretical\nresults unify and generalize known results on the existence of a periodic\nsolution in two well-known models in biochemistry, a 3D Goodwin oscillator\nmodel and the 3D Field-Noyes ordinary-differential-equation (ODE) model for the\nBelousov-Zhabotinskii reaction, while simplifying the proofs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
