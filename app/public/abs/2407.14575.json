Firstly, through Spearman correlation analysis of CPU,\nusage, memory usage, network traffic, power consumption, number of instructions\nexecuted, execution time and energy efficiency, we found that power consumption\nhas the highest degree of positive correlation with energy efficiency, while\nCPU usage has the highest degree of negative correlation with energy\nefficiency. In our experiments, we introduced a random forest model and an\noptimisation model based on the horned lizard optimisation algorithm for\ntesting, and the results show that the optimisation algorithm has better\nprediction results compared to the random forest model. Specifically, the mean\nsquare error (MSE) of the optimisation algorithm is 0.01 smaller than that of\nthe random forest model, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.01 smaller than\nthat of the random forest.3 The results of the combined metrics show that the\noptimisation algorithm performs more accurately and reliably in predicting\nenergy efficiency. This research result provides new ideas and methods to\nimprove the energy efficiency of cloud computing systems. This research not\nonly expands the scope of application in the field of cloud computing, but also\nprovides a strong support for improving the energy use efficiency of the\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
