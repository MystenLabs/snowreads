The\nexquisite quality of these observations opens new possibilities towards\nmeasuring fundamental constants with good precision and at scales which are\ncomplementary to the laboratory ones. In particular, the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) temperature and polarization spectra contain a wealth quantity\nof information, well beyond the basic cosmological parameters. In this paper,\nwe update the precision on a cosmological determination of $G$ by using the\nlatest Planck data release (PR4) in combination with the latest baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data\nrelease 1. We demonstrate a precision of $2.1\\%$, corresponding to a $\\sim25\\%$\nimprovement compared to the literature. This measurement is compatible with\nlaboratory ones within one standard deviation. Finally, we show that this\ncosmological measurement of $G$ is robust against several assumptions made on\nthe cosmological model, in particular when considering a non-standard dark\nenergy fluid or non-flat models.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
