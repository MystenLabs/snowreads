In this\npaper, we empirically study the propagation delay of 298 naturally-aged FPGA\ndevices that are deployed in the European XFEL particle accelerator. Based on\nin-field measurements, we find that operational devices show significantly\nslower switching frequencies than unused chips, and that increased gamma and\nneutron radiation doses correlate with increased hardware degradation.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of developing machine learning\nmodels that estimate the switching frequencies of the devices based on\nhistorical and environmental data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
