The entries of\nthese matrices are rational functions of formal variables in a field. We prove\nthat these matrices satisfy the $n$-gon equation for any $n$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
