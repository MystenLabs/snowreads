Given a set $\\mathcal{P}$ of rooted binary phylogenetic trees,\nthis paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm that reconstructs the unique\nbinary normal network whose set of displayed binary trees is $\\mathcal{P}$, if\nsuch a network exists. Additionally, we show that any two rooted phylogenetic\ntrees can be displayed by a normal network and show that this result does not\nextend to more than two trees. This is in contrast to tree-child networks where\nit has been previously shown that any collection of rooted phylogenetic trees\ncan be displayed by a tree-child network. Lastly, we introduce a type of\ncherry-picking sequence that characterises when a collection $\\mathcal{P}$ of\nrooted phylogenetic trees can be displayed by a normal network and, further,\ncharacterise the minimum number of reticulations needed over all normal\nnetworks that display $\\mathcal{P}$. We then exploit these sequences to show\nthat, for all $n\\ge 3$, there exist two rooted binary phylogenetic trees on $n$\nleaves that can be displayed by a tree-child network with a single\nreticulation, but cannot be displayed by a normal network with less than $n-2$\nreticulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
