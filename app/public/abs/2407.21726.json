Climate change is a major\nconcern in our society; for this reason, a current global objective is to\nreduce energy waste. This work summarizes all main approaches towards energy\nefficiency using Artificial Intelligence with a particular focus on multi-agent\nsystems to create smart buildings. It mentions the tight relationship between\nAI, especially IoT, and Big Data. It explains the application of AI to anomaly\ndetection in smart buildings and a possible classification of Intelligent\nEnergy Management Systems: Direct and Indirect. Finally, some drawbacks of AI\napproaches and some possible future research focuses are proposed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S_6kwitvbQz8_4k4w_JKcYhnNAKG5zoKxJBybZU03gA","pdfSize":"162110"}
