This paper explores the\ntheoretical foundations and practical applications of JEL in the context of\nmultivariate sample-based U-statistics. In this study we develop the JEL method\nfor multivariate U-statistics with three (or more) samples. This study enhance\nthe JEL methods capability to handle complex data structures while preserving\nthe computation efficiency of the empirical likelihood method. To demonstrate\nthe applications of the JEL method, we compute confidence intervals for\ndifferences in VUS measurements which have potential applications in\nclassification problems. Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to\nevaluate the efficiency of the JEL, Normal approximation and Kernel based\nconfidence intervals. These studies validate the superior performance of the\nJEL approach in terms of coverage probability and computational efficiency\ncompared to other two methods. Additionally, a real data application\nillustrates the practical utility of the approach. The JEL method developed\nhere has potential applications in dealing with complex data structures.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ornjbjQETascle3h-tgbKnqaoQgeuesImztU-UMLd-M","pdfSize":"307224"}
