In such a case,\nthe whole range of possible realizations must be considered. Looking, for\nexample, at the respective information published by agencies like the EMA or\nthe FDA, one can see that commonly accepted tests together with the proper\nstatistical framework are not yet available. This work attempts to close this\ngap in the treatment of range-based comparisons. The question of when two\nproducts can be considered similar with respect to a certain property is\ndiscussed and a framework for such a statistical comparison is presented, which\nis based on the proposed concept of kappa-cover. Assuming normally distributed\nquality attributes a statistical test termed covering-test is proposed.\nSimulations show that this test possesses desirable statistical properties with\nrespect to small sample size and power. In order to demonstrate the usefulness\nof the suggested concept, the proposed test is applied to a data set from the\npharmaceutical industry\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OK6h__cQXUV37qdn5NTRVmppPO9SGqByqLRsk1ve2Gg","pdfSize":"2711313"}
