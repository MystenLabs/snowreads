The development of deep learning has enabled neural\nnetwork models to work as computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) tools to help\ndoctors and experts in diagnosis. Since the YOLOv8 models have obtained the\nsatisfactory success in object detection tasks, it has been applied to fracture\ndetection. The Global Context (GC) block effectively models the global context\nin a lightweight way, and incorporating it into YOLOv8 can greatly improve the\nmodel performance. This paper proposes the YOLOv8+GC model for fracture\ndetection, which is an improved version of the YOLOv8 model with the GC block.\nExperimental results demonstrate that compared to the original YOLOv8 model,\nthe proposed YOLOv8-GC model increases the mean average precision calculated at\nintersection over union threshold of 0.5 (mAP 50) from 63.58% to 66.32% on the\nGRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset, achieving the state-of-the-art (SOTA) level.
