We focus on the case of\neverywhere favorable environment with three different zones, a left half-line\nwith slow or intermediate growth, a central patch with fast growth and a right\nhalf-line with slow or intermediate growth. The central patch moves at various\nspeeds. The behavior of the front changes drastically depending on the speed of\nthe central patch. Among other things, intriguing phenomena such as nonlocal\npulling and locking may occur, which would make the behavior of the front\nfurther complicated. The problem we discuss here is closely related to\nquestions in biomathematical modelling. By considering several special cases,\nwe illustrate the remarkable diversity of possible behaviors. In particular,\nthe case of a central patch with constant size and constant speed is entirely\nsettled.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
