Observations suggested\nthe growth of these galaxies may be driven by mergers. Previous environmental\nstudies have statistically shown Hot DOGs may reside in dense regions. Here we\nuse the Very Large Telescope (VLT) narrowband and broadband imaging to search\nfor Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in the 6.8' * 6.8' field of the Hot DOG\nW2246$-$0526 at $z=4.6$. W2246$-$0526 is the most distant Hot DOG. We find that\nthere is an overdensity of LAEs in W2246$-$0526 field compared with the blank\nfields. This is the direct evidence that this most distant Hot DOG is in an\noverdense environment on the Mpc scale, and the result relates to the merger\norigin of Hot DOGs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p7LHC51qHLoBVXXZ73rsxwh0dTX-X9OABDKZhZ8Ba-M","pdfSize":"3539941"}
