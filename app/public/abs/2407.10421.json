In this work we investigate the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nconstraints on several Weyl type $f(Q,T)$ gravity models. In particular, we\nconsider the corrections that Weyl type $f(Q,T)$ terms induce on the freeze-out\ntemperature $\\mathcal{T}_f$, as compared to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM results.\nWe analyze in detail three distinct cosmological models, corresponding to\nspecific choices of the functional form of $f(Q,T)$. The first model has a\nsimple linear additive structure in $Q$ and $T$, the second model is\nmultiplicative in $Q$ and $T$, while the third is additive in $T$ and the\nexponential of $Q$. For each $f(Q,T)$ we consider first the cosmological\nevolution in the radiation dominated era, and then we impose the observational\nbound on $\\left|\\delta \\mathcal{T}_f/ \\mathcal{T}_f\\right|$ to obtain\nconstraints on the model parameters from the primordial abundances of the light\nelements such as helium-4, deuterium and lithium-7. The abundances of helium-4\nand deuterium agree with theoretical predictions, however, the lithium problem,\neven slightly alleviated, still persists for the considered Weyl type $f(Q,T)$\nmodels. Generally, these models satisfy the BBN constraints, and thus they\nrepresent viable cosmologies describing the entire dynamical time scale of the\nevolution of the Universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
