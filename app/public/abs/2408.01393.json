A\ntransversal controlled-NOT (tCNOT) gate on two surface codes introduces\ncorrelated errors across the code blocks and thus requires modified decoding\nstrategies compared to established methods of decoding surface code quantum\nmemory (SCQM) or lattice surgery operations. In this work, we examine and\nbenchmark the performance of three different decoding strategies for the tCNOT\nfor scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation. In particular, we present a\nlow-complexity decoder based on minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) that\nachieves the same threshold as the SCQM MWPM decoder. We extend our analysis\nwith a study of tailored decoding of a transversal teleportation circuit, along\nwith a comparison between the performance of lattice surgery and transversal\noperations under Pauli and erasure noise models. Our investigation works\ntowards systematic estimation of the cost of implementing large-scale quantum\nalgorithms based on transversal gates in the surface code.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
