We show that the quasi-static configuration of the\nstar that settles after the transition can avoid the observational constraints\nimposed on the amount of scalarization by several observations in binary\nsystems due to the presence of the mass term, which suppresses the range of the\nscalar field. We also study the impact of the scalar field mass on the total\nmass of the star relative to the massless scenario.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
