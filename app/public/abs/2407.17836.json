The spaces of infinitesimal motions of a\npoint-line configuration and dependencies amongst the point-line incidences can\nbe interpreted as the kernel and co-kernel of this projective rigidity matrix,\nrespectively. We also introduce a symmetry-adapted projective rigidity matrix\nfor analysing symmetric configurations and their symmetry-preserving motions.\nThe symmetry may be a point group or a more general symmetry, such as an\nautopolarity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
