In this paper, we propose\nnovel algorithms based on the greedy algorithm to accurately and efficiently\nidentify breakpoints in piecewise polynomial regression. The algorithm updates\nthe breakpoints to minimize the error by exploring the neighborhood of each\nbreakpoint. It has a fast convergence rate and stability to find optimal\nbreakpoints. Moreover, it can determine the optimal number of breakpoints. The\ncomputational results for real and synthetic data show that its accuracy is\nbetter than any existing methods. The real-world datasets demonstrate that\nbreakpoints through the proposed algorithm provide valuable data information.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
