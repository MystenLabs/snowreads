In any dimension $d$, we prove that the\nbranching set at the boundary has Hausdorff dimension at most $d-2$. As a\nconsequence, we also obtain an analogous estimate on the branching set for\nsolutions to the two-phase problem under an analytic separation condition.\nMoreover, as a byproduct of our analysis we obtain strong boundary unique\ncontinuation results for quasilinear operators and thin-obstacle variational\ninequalities. The approach we use is based on the (almost-)monotonicity of a\nboundary Almgren-type frequency function, obtained via regularity estimates and\na Calder\\'on-Zygmund decomposition in the spirit of Almgren-De Lellis-Spadaro.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
