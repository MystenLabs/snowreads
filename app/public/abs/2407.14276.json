The success of these endeavours has\nbeen hindered by the fact that such tests were performed within spatial scales\nthat were only \"local\" when compared to the spatial scales over which the\nnon-inertial motion was taking place. We propose a Sagnac-like interferometer\nthat, by challenging such bottlenecks, is able to achieve entangled states\nthrough a mechanism induced by the mechanical rotation of a photonic\ninterferometer. The resulting states violate the\nBell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality all the way up to the\nTsirelson bound, thus signaling strong quantum nonlocality. Our results\ndemonstrate that mechanical rotation can be thought of as resource for\ncontrolling quantum non-locality with implications also for recent proposals\nfor experiments that can probe the quantum nature of curved spacetimes and\nnon-inertial motion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fD0Wl2NFm0yGSkaA6hya2giEZg853t1-NRgSntXlhV8","pdfSize":"458387","objectId":"0x8b0c4d3e4d7a9b6947ed0a20009246c5e15e123fc6d12423379f36f4471c2b67","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
