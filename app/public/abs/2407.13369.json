The idea is to look at the network as connected nodes.\nEach node sends an information package to its neighbors. Basically, the\ninformation package contains a state change that a specific node experienced,\nand it might affect the traffic network state in the future. Different types of\ninformation can be counted in transportation network. Each information type has\ndifferent characteristics. It propagates through the network and interacts with\nother IPs and nodes. As a result, the model enables implementing and analyzing\ndynamic and inconvenient control strategies. This paper focus on flow dynamics\nand demand routing information under complex environment. The flow dynamics\nflows the LWR theory along the links. The demand routing follows a node\nequilibrium model. The node model takes into account the users preferences and\nchoices under dynamic control agents such as dynamic tolling and sends the\nneeded information for other facilities to operate. A DNL model is developed\nbased on the IPM. Several case studies demonstrate the use IPM and its\npotential to provide a reliable and results for real world complicated\ntransportation applications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"WutfipDeQSify7bo1PJkRB6DEoTDnObDr1IReiYvpvA","pdfSize":"798807"}
