Given the diverse nature of generic boundaries, spanning\ndifferent video appearances, objects, and actions, this task remains\nchallenging. Existing methods usually detect various boundaries by the same\nprotocol, regardless of their distinctive characteristics and detection\ndifficulties, resulting in suboptimal performance. Intuitively, a more\nintelligent and reasonable way is to adaptively detect boundaries by\nconsidering their special properties. In light of this, we propose a novel\ndynamic pipeline for generic event boundaries named DyBDet. By introducing a\nmulti-exit network architecture, DyBDet automatically learns the subnet\nallocation to different video snippets, enabling fine-grained detection for\nvarious boundaries. Besides, a multi-order difference detector is also proposed\nto ensure generic boundaries can be effectively identified and adaptively\nprocessed. Extensive experiments on the challenging Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS\ndatasets demonstrate that adopting the dynamic strategy significantly benefits\nGEBD tasks, leading to obvious improvements in both performance and efficiency\ncompared to the current state-of-the-art.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
