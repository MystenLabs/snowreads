Addressing D&I in AI is\nessential to reduce biases and discrimination, enhance fairness, and prevent\nadverse societal impacts. Despite its importance, D&I considerations are often\noverlooked, resulting in incidents marked by built-in biases and ethical\ndilemmas. Analyzing AI incidents through a D&I lens is crucial for identifying\ncauses of biases and developing strategies to mitigate them, ensuring fairer\nand more equitable AI technologies. However, systematic investigations of\nD&I-related AI incidents are scarce. This study addresses these challenges by\nidentifying and understanding D&I issues within AI systems through a manual\nanalysis of AI incident databases (AIID and AIAAIC). The research develops a\ndecision tree to investigate D&I issues tied to AI incidents and populate a\npublic repository of D&I-related AI incidents. The decision tree was validated\nthrough a card sorting exercise and focus group discussions. The research\ndemonstrates that almost half of the analyzed AI incidents are related to D&I,\nwith a notable predominance of racial, gender, and age discrimination. The\ndecision tree and resulting public repository aim to foster further research\nand responsible AI practices, promoting the development of inclusive and\nequitable AI systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
