We determine the equation of state\nparameter, the generalized holographic Ricci dark energy density, the matter\ndensity, and the deceleration parameter. By analyzing the behavior of these\ncosmological parameters, we demonstrate that our model aligns with recent\nobservations and reproduces the late-time accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse. To compare our model with the $\\Lambda$CDM model, we use various\ndiagnostic tools including statefinder, $Om(z)$-diagnostic, statefinder\nhierarchy, growth rate analysis, and $\\omega_H$-$\\omega'_H$ plane. We also\nanalyze the stability of the model by examining the speed of sound. These\nmethods show that the dynamics of the Universe remain very close to that of the\nstandard cosmological model.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
