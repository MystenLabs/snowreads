The\naccuracy of the interpolation depends on a parameter called the shape\nparameter. There are many approaches in literature on how to appropriately\nchoose it as to increase the accuracy of interpolation while avoiding\ninstability issues. However, finding the optimal shape parameter value in\ngeneral remains a challenge. We present a novel approach to determine the shape\nparameter in RBFs: we introduce a data-driven method that controls the\ncondition of the interpolation matrix to avoid numerically unstable\ninterpolations, while keeping a very good accuracy. In addition, we formulate a\nfall-back procedure that enforces a strict upper bound on the condition number\nof the generated interpolation matrix. We present numerical test cases to\nassess the performance of the proposed methods in interpolation tasks and in a\nRBF based finite difference (RBF-FD) method, in one and two-space dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
