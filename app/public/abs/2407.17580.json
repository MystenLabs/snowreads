In order to obtain the main\nresult we make a Pekeris-Markushevich transformation of the Rayleigh system\nwith free surface boundary condition such that we get a matrix\nSchr\\\"odinger-type form of it. We obtain parity and analytical properties of\nits fundamental solutions, which are needed to prove the main theorem. We\nconstruct a function made up by Rayleigh determinants factors, which is proven\nto be entire, of exponential type and in the Cartwright class and leads to the\nconstraint on the location of resonances.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
