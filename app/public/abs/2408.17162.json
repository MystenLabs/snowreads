This\npaper proposes a novel deep embedding framework with leverages lightweight deep\nneural networks to generate effective feature embeddings for tabular data in\nmachine learning research. For numerical features, a two-step feature expansion\nand deep transformation technique is used to capture copious semantic\ninformation. For categorical features, a unique identification vector for each\nentity is referred by a compact lookup table with a parameterized deep\nembedding function to uniform the embedding size dimensions, and transformed\ninto a embedding vector using deep neural network. Experiments are conducted on\nreal-world datasets for performance evaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
