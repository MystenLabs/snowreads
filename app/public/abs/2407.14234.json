I offer a\nrigorous categorical strategy that formulate symmetries as isomorphisms between\nmodels and apply it to classical electromagnetism, and evaluate its\nphilosophical significance in relation to the recent debate between\n`sophistication' and `reduction'. In addition to traditional spacetime models,\nI also consider algebraic models, in which case we can use the method of\nnatural operators to address the problem of ontological nonperspicuity faced by\nthe categorical strategy. Finally, I briefly expound on the significance of\nsymmetries as isomorphisms in the framework of Univalent Foundations, in which\nisomorphic structures are formally identified.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
