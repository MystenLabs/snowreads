Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a crucial role in cancer initiation,\nprogression, and metastasis. By employing hypergraphs, we model the\nrelationships between CSCM locations and cancerous organs, providing a\ncomprehensive representation of these interactions. Initially, we utilised an\nunweighted incidence matrix and its Markov transition matrices to gain a\ndynamic perspective on CSCM distributions. This method allows us to observe how\nthese markers spread and influence cancer progression in a dynamical context.\nBy calculating mutual information for each node and hyperedge, our analysis\nuncovers complex interaction patterns between CSCMs and organs, highlighting\nthe critical roles of certain markers in cancer progression and metastasis. Our\napproach offers a detailed representation of cancer stem cell networks,\nenhancing our understanding of the mechanisms driving cancer heterogeneity and\nmetastasis. By integrating hypergraph theory with cancer biology, this study\nprovides valuable insights for developing targeted cancer therapies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
