In this paper, we\npropose a concrete construction of a topological operator in their formulation.\nWe focus on a shift symmetry of a one-dimensional massless scalar theory. And\nwe give some discussions of $\\mathbb{Z}$-gauging of it, i.e., compact scalar\ntheory and its $\\theta$-vacuum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
