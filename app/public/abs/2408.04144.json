A primary contributor to this challenge is the intra-class\ndynamic changes due to phenological characteristics in natural areas. To\novercome this, we introduce the InPhea model, which integrates phenological\nfeatures into a remote sensing image CD framework. The model features a\ndetector with a differential attention module for improved feature\nrepresentation of change information, coupled with high-resolution feature\nextraction and spatial pyramid blocks to enhance performance. Additionally, a\nconstrainer with four constraint modules and a multi-stage contrastive learning\napproach is employed to aid in the model's understanding of phenological\ncharacteristics. Experiments on the HRSCD, SECD, and PSCD-Wuhan datasets reveal\nthat InPhea outperforms other models, confirming its effectiveness in\naddressing phenological pseudo-changes and its overall model superiority.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
