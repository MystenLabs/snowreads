However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has\nbeen restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information\nabout the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of\nblack box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information\non the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black\nbox setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite\nhypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory.We employ\nthis general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the\nquantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide\ntheir exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also\nshow a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a\ncomposite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the\nimportance of information about the initial state and gives a new\ninterpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing,\nencouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
