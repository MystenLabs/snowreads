Kiraly and\nBerczi et. al. conjectured that this equality holds for any two matroids. We\nprove this conjecture and a conjecture by Aharoni--Berger for any two\ngeneralized partition matroids.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
