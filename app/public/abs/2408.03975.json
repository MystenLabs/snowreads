In\nPart I, we demonstrated that this current-voltage response depends on the\ngeometry, the layout of the surface charge, and the effects of advection. We\ndemonstrated that each configuration has a unique steady-state signature. Here,\nwe will elucidate the behavior of the time-transient response. Similar to the\nsteady-state response, we will show that each configuration has its own unique\ntime-transient signature when subjected to electroosmotic instability. We show\nthat bipolar systems behave differently than unipolar systems. In unipolar\nsystems, the instability appears only at one end of the system. In contrast, in\nbipolar systems the instability will either appear on both sides of the\nnanochannel or not at all. If it does appear on both sides, the instability\nwill eventually vanish on one or both sides of the system. In Part I, these\nphenomena were explained using steady-state considerations of the behavior of\nthe fluxes. Here, we will examine the time-transient behavior to reveal the\ngoverning principles that are, on the one hand, not so different from unipolar\nsystems and, on the other hand, remarkably different.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YRdigjA5QtLWkFhwbRxxcRti2knKl8fBHH_AuoVc6L4","pdfSize":"1820328"}
