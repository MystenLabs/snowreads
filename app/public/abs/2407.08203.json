In this paper, we discuss a\ncombinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this\nstructure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn\nmatrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2,\n\\mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show\nthat these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive\ninteger solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric\ninterpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov\nnumbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical\nMarkov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint. Moreover, we clarify\na relation between $k$-generalized Markov numbers and toric surface\nsingularities via continued fractions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
