Since music tracks are typically much\nlonger than short videos, meaning the returned music has to be cut to a shorter\nmoment, there is a clear gap between the practical need and VMR. In order to\nbridge the gap, we propose in this paper video to music moment retrieval (VMMR)\nas a new task. To tackle the new task, we build a comprehensive dataset\nAd-Moment which contains 50K short videos annotated with music moments and\ndevelop a two-stage approach. In particular, given a test video, the most\nsimilar music is retrieved from a given collection. Then, a Transformer based\nmusic moment localization is performed. We term this approach Retrieval and\nLocalization (ReaL). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method for VMMR.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
