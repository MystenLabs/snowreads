However, it remains unclear why the tip-sample\ninteraction force estimated from an experimental amplitude value is\nsubstantially greater than the actual molecular binding force, despite the\nsuccessful visualization of molecular dynamics. Here, we performed a\ntheoretical analysis to tackle this question. We show that in general AM-AFM\nmeasurements, the cantilever is excited at the resonance slope whereas the\nconventional equation is only valid for excitation exactly at the resonance\nfrequency. We then derive a force conversion equation for an arbitrary\nexcitation frequency and found that the conventional equation overestimates the\nactual force by about five times. The theory derived here can be used for\ndiverse AM-AFM applications, and is useful in many fields of material research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
