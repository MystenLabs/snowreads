While existing datasets for\ngeneral sound event detection are plentiful, they often fall short in providing\nsufficient, strongly labeled data specific to infant cries and snoring. To\nprovide a benchmark dataset and thus foster the research of infant cry and\nsnoring detection, this paper introduces the Infant Cry and Snoring Detection\n(ICSD) dataset, a novel, publicly available dataset specially designed for ICSD\ntasks. The ICSD comprises three types of subsets: a real strongly labeled\nsubset with event-based labels annotated manually, a weakly labeled subset with\nonly clip-level event annotations, and a synthetic subset generated and labeled\nwith strong annotations. This paper provides a detailed description of the ICSD\ncreation process, including the challenges encountered and the solutions\nadopted. We offer a comprehensive characterization of the dataset, discussing\nits limitations and key factors for ICSD usage. Additionally, we conduct\nextensive experiments on the ICSD dataset to establish baseline systems and\noffer insights into the main factors when using this dataset for ICSD research.\nOur goal is to develop a dataset that will be widely adopted by the community\nas a new open benchmark for future ICSD research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
