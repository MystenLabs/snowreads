We calculate\nthe scattered electromagnetic field observed in an arbitrary point at a large\ndistance from the laser focal spot, by adding coherently the contributions of\neach electron in the electron sheet. Due to the interference effects, the\nradiation is emitted only into the forward direction, within a narrow cone, and\nit has a spatial structure that we analyze theoretically and numerically. For\ncircularly polarized incident fields, the structure is also helical, with a\nhelical index which depends on the helical index of the incident radiation and\nthe harmonic order. These structures can be observed experimentally, as each\nharmonic order is emitted with a different frequency, and within cones of\ndifferent opening angles. Our findings are in agreement with experimental\nresults in the literature which demonstrate the generation of OAM carrying\nphotons by radiation scattering on electrons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
