Hence, understanding the microscopic\nmechanistic factors for inadvertent, spontaneous blood clotting, in absence of\na vessel breach, can help in predicting and adverting such conditions. Here, we\npresent a minimal model -- reminiscent of the SIR model -- for the initiating\nstage of spontaneous blood clotting, the collective activation of blood\nplatelets. This model predicts that in the presence of very small initial\nactivation signals, macroscopic activation of the platelet population requires\na sufficient degree of heterogeneity of platelet sensitivity. To propagate the\nactivation signal and achieve collective activation of the bulk platelet\npopulation, it requires the presence of, possibly only few, hyper-sensitive\nplatelets, but also a sufficient proportion of platelets with intermediate, yet\nhigher-than-average sensitivity. A comparison with experimental results\ndemonstrates a qualitative agreement for high platelet signalling activity.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r9KC39iRiFzjjNlN_EEDSxH5q9UF5LWUPMBDa-Hqr2A","pdfSize":"1845709","txDigest":"6pujaAkowgQVUUycxo66Zo659MyDXhuGkhDTWc4A7zV5","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
