Highly coherent state,\ncharacterized by macro-coherence of scalar field coupled to produced massless\nparticle in pairs, is created by parametric resonance effects associated with\nfield oscillation around its potential minimum, within a Hubble volume. The\nstate is described effectively by the simple Dicke-type of super-radiance\nmodel, and super-radiant pulse is emitted within a Hubble time, justifying\nneglect of cosmic expansion. Produced particles are shown to interact to change\ntheir energy and momentum distribution to realize thermal hot big bang\nuniverse. A long standing problem of heating after inflation may thus be\nsolved. A new dark matter candidate produced at the emergence of thermalized\nuniverse is suggested as well.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
