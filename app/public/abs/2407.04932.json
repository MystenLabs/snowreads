First, we carry out a complete calculation of neutrino\ndecay rates in the general case where the individual helicities of parent and\ndaughter neutrinos are specified. Then, the invisible decays of cosmological\nrelic neutrinos are studied and their impact on the capture rates on the\nbeta-decaying nuclei (e.g., $\\nu^{}_e + {^3{\\rm H}} \\to {^3{\\rm He}} + e^-$) is\nanalyzed. The invisible decays of massive neutrinos could substantially change\nthe capture rates in the PTOLEMY-like experiments when compared to the case of\nstable neutrinos. In particular, we find that the helicity-changing decays of\nDirac neutrinos play an important role whereas those of Majorana neutrinos have\nno practical effects. However, if a substantial fraction of heavier neutrinos\ndecay into the lightest one, the detection of relic neutrinos will require a\nmuch higher energy resolution and thus be even more challenging.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
