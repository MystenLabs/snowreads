For finite clusters,\nphysical quantities such as heat capacities, magnetic susceptibilities or\nneutron-scattering spectra, can be calculated based on energies and eigenstates\nobtained by exact diagonalization (ED). Utilizing spinrotational symmetry SU(2)\nto factor the Hamiltonian with respect to total spin S facilitates ED, but the\nconventional approach to spin-adapting the basis is more intricate than\nselecting states with a given magnetic quantum number M (the spin z-component),\nas it relies on irreducible tensor-operator techniques and spin-coupling\ncoefficients. Here, we present a simpler technique based on applying a spin\nprojector to uncoupled basis states. As an alternative to L\\\"owdin's projection\noperator, we consider a group-theoretical formulation of the projector, which\ncan be evaluated either exactly or approximately using an integration grid. An\nimportant aspect is the choice of uncoupled basis states. We present an\nextension of L\\\"owdin's theorem for s = 1/2 to arbitrary local spin quantum\nnumbers s, which allows for the direct selection of configurations that span a\ncomplete, linearly independent basis in an S sector upon spin projection. We\nillustrate the procedure with a few examples.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
