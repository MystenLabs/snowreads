Traditional sequence-based and structure-based methods often\nrequire extensive datasets, which limits their effectiveness. In this study, we\nproposed a novel method that utilized autoencoder shaped models to explore the\nprotein embedding space, and generate novel peptide analogs by leveraging\nprotein language models. The proposed method requires only a single sequence of\ninterest, avoiding the need for large datasets. Our results show significant\nimprovements over baseline models in similarity indicators of peptide\nstructures, descriptors and bioactivities. The proposed method validated\nthrough Molecular Dynamics simulations on TIGIT inhibitors, demonstrates that\nour method produces peptide analogs with similar yet distinct properties,\nhighlighting its potential to enhance peptide screening processes.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
