A set $D$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is\n$\\mathcal{F}$-isolating if the graph obtained by removing from $G$ all the\nvertices in $D$ and their neighbors does not have a copy of a graph in\n$\\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. The $\\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of $G$, denoted\nby $\\iota(G, \\mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest $\\mathcal{F}$-isolating\nset of $G$. We establish sharp upper bounds on the $\\mathcal{F}$-isolation\nnumber of a tree in terms of the order and the number of leaves for the case\nwhere $\\mathcal{F}$ consists of the star $K_{1,k}$ for some $k\\geq 1$.\nMoreover, we characterize all trees attaining the bounds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
