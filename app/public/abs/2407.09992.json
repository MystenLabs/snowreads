However, in comparison to static recommendation methods, a\nrecommendation logic that dynamically adjusts based on user interest\npreferences may potentially attract a larger user base. Thus, we consider\nparaphrasing existing content based on the interests of the users to modify the\ncontent to better align with the preferences of users. In this paper, we\npropose a new task named Target-Audience Oriented Content Paraphrase aims to\ngenerate more customized contents for the target audience. We introduce the\ntask definition and the corresponding framework for the proposed task and the\ncreation of the corresponding datasets. We utilize the Large Language Models\n(LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs) to accomplish the base implementation of\nthe TOP framework and provide the referential baseline results for the proposed\ntask.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
