In this paper, we first show that \\mu_{M,D} is a spectral\nmeasure with a model spectrum \\Lambda. Then we completely settle two types of\nspectral eigenvalue problems for \\mu_{M,D}. On the first case, for a real t, we\ngive a necessary and sufficient condition under which t\\Lambda is also a\nspectrum of \\mu_{M,D}. On the second case, we characterize all possible real\nnumbers t such that there exists a countable set \\Lambda'\\subset \\mathbb{R}\nsuch that \\Lambda' and t\\Lambda' are both spectra of \\mu_{M,D}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
