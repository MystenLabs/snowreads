Norine\nconjectured that in such a coloring there must exist a pair of antipodal\nvertices connected by a monochromatic path. Previous work has proven this\nconjecture for $n\\le 6$. Using SAT solvers we verify that the conjecture holds\nfor $n = 7$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
