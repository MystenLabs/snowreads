The main ingredient of our method depends on the\nsatisfaction of a Lyapunov condition followed by a uniform moments' estimate,\ncombined with the irreducibility and the strong Feller property for full\ndiscretization. We transform the original stochastic equation into an\nequivalent random equation where the discrete stochastic convolutions are\nuniformly controlled to derive the desired uniform moments' estimate. Applying\nthe main result to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation driven by multiplicative\nwhite noise indicates that this full discretization is uniquely ergodic for any\ninterface thickness. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
