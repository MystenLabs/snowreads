This provides a broad framework that includes, but goes\nbeyond, H\\\"olderian error bounds and H\\\"older regular operators. By concrete,\nwe mean that the rates we obtain are explicitly expressed in terms of a\nfunction of the iteration number $k$ instead, of say, a function of the iterate\n$x^k$. While it is well-known that under H\\\"olderian-like assumptions many\nalgorithms converge linearly/sublinearly (depending on the exponent), little it\nis known when the underlying problem data does not satisfy H\\\"olderian\nassumptions, which may happen if a problem involves exponentials and\nlogarithms. Our main innovation is the usage of the theory of regularly varying\nfunctions which we showcase by obtaining concrete convergence rates for\nquasi-cylic algorithms in non-H\\\"olderian settings. This includes certain rates\nthat are neither sublinear nor linear but sit somewhere in-between, including a\ncase where the rate is expressed via the Lambert W function. Finally, we\nconnect our discussion to o-minimal geometry and show that definable operators\nin any o-minimal structure are always Karamata regular.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
