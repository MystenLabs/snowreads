Consequently, recent years have seen various set\nvisualization approaches that visually connect points of the same category to\nsupport users in understanding the spatial distribution of categories. Existing\nmethods use complex and often highly irregular shapes to connect points of the\nsame category, leading to high cognitive load for the user. In this paper we\nintroduce SimpleSets, which uses simple shapes to enclose categorical point\npatterns, thereby providing a clean overview of the data distribution.\nSimpleSets is designed to visualize sets of points with a single categorical\nattribute; as a result, the point patterns enclosed by SimpleSets form a\npartition of the data. We give formal definitions of point patterns that\ncorrespond to simple shapes and describe an algorithm that partitions\ncategorical points into few such patterns. Our second contribution is a\nrendering algorithm that transforms a given partition into a clean set of\nshapes resulting in an aesthetically pleasing set visualization. Our algorithm\npays particular attention to resolving intersections between nearby shapes in a\nconsistent manner. We compare SimpleSets to the state-of-the-art set\nvisualizations using standard datasets from the literature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
