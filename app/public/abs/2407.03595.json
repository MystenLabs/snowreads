Specifically, it employs various machine\nlearning models to predict the quarterly real GDP growth of China, and analyzes\nthe factors contributing to the performance differences among these models. Our\nfindings indicate that the average forecast errors of machine learning models\nare generally lower than those of traditional econometric models or expert\nforecasts, particularly in periods of economic stability. However, during\ncertain inflection points, although machine learning models still outperform\ntraditional econometric models, expert forecasts may exhibit greater accuracy\nin some instances due to experts' more comprehensive understanding of the\nmacroeconomic environment and real-time economic variables. In addition to\nmacroeconomic forecasting, this paper employs interpretable machine learning\nmethods to identify the key attributive variables from different machine\nlearning models, aiming to enhance the understanding and evaluation of their\ncontributions to macroeconomic fluctuations.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
