A possible way to achieve such asymmetry in wave\npropagation is through the violation of reciprocity. We explore asymmetric\npropagation in an acoustic diode (AD) made of two segments of equal sphere\nsizes but different elastic properties, in which both chains obey Hertzian's\ncontact law. In the forward configuration, the first chain acts as the\nnonlinear medium, ensuring the suitable generation of a self-demodulated\nsignal, while the second chain, made of soft spheres, provides the low-pass\nfilter. It is shown that both large nonlinearity and low dispersion cause the\nsmallest distortion of the wave envelope, therefore optimizing the transmission\nof information through the system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"UMdoRbZYaN7mdb17-46xpPd5Ghk-HoYfi0seq5rmQF0","pdfSize":"3088971"}
