Whilst\nthe proposed CNN architecture is demonstrated to achieve more than 99% accuracy\nfor the test dataset, the computational procedure of CNN remains a black box.\nThe visualisation based on Grad-CAM is attempted to explain such very high\naccuracy and may provide useful information for physicians. Future motivation\nbased on this work is discussed.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
