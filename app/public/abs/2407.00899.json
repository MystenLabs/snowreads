To fully realize the capabilities of such clocks,\nhigh-precision clock synchronization across the networks will be necessary.\nCurrent experiments have shown the potential for classical frequency combs to\nsynchronize remote optical clocks over free-space. However, these classical\ncombs are restricted in precision to the standard quantum limit. Quantum\nfrequency combs, however, which exhibit quantum properties such as squeezing\nand entanglement, provide pathways for going beyond the standard quantum limit.\nHere, we present our perspective on the prospects for practical clock\nsynchronization in space using both classical and quantum frequency combs. We\ndetail the current outcomes achievable with a classical frequency comb approach\nto synchronization, before quantifying the potential outcomes offered by\nquantum frequency combs. Challenges to be overcome in deploying frequency combs\nin space are presented, and the implications of almost-perfect synchronization\nfor future space-based applications and experiments discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
