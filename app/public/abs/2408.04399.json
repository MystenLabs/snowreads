By coupling the stress tensor\nmultiplet to a vierbein multiplet we identify a spin current with the Hodge\ndual of the bottom component of the stress tensor multiplet in a wide range of\ntheories. This implies that in holographic theories the Hodge dual of the $R$\ncurrent may serve as a spin current, paving the way for holographic studies of\ntheories with background torsion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
