This study is\nmade possible by the newly developed subspace-projected (SP)-CDFT, where the\nwave functions of nuclear low-lying states for target EDF parameter sets are\nexpanded in a subspace spanned by the wave functions of low-lying states from\ntraining parameter sets. We analyze the global sensitivity of excitation\nenergies, electric quadrupole transition strengths, and the nuclear matrix\nelement of neutrinoless double-beta decay in $^{136}$Xe and $^{150}$Nd to EDF\nparameters, and explore the correlations between these quantities and nuclear\nmatter properties. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical uncertainty of\nlow-lying states through their posterior distributions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
