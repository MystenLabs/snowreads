We take advantage of\nprior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW\nsetting, and specialize it to the case of nearly planar defects. In particular,\nwe prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal, with respect to a\nperfect crystal, is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization\nproblem. We also establish convergence of the electronic fields to the\nperturbation caused by the nearly planar defect. Our main finding is that\nperturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the\npresence of the nearly planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect,\nin agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these\nresults to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular\nthe finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical\ncalculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the\n(non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the\nDirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for\nfuture work.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
