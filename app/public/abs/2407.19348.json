The algorithm is based on von\nNeumann's measurement prescription, which serves as a conceptual building block\nfor quantum phase estimation. We describe the implementation and simulation of\nthe algorithm, including the estimation of resources required and the use of\nmatrix product operators (MPOs) to represent the Hamiltonian. We highlight the\npotential applications of the algorithm in simulating quantum spin systems and\nelectronic structure problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
