Leveraging a seven DoF\nrobotic manipulator and unique custom-designed and additively-manufactured\nrealistic AGC tumor phantoms, we demonstrated the advantages of automated data\ncollection using the VTS addressing the problem of data scarcity and biases\nencountered in traditional ML-based approaches. Our synthetic-data-trained ML\nmodel was successfully evaluated and compared with traditional ML models\nutilizing various statistical metrics even under mixed morphological\ncharacteristics and partial sensor contact.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_Sb1xDZiekhsXoPO5vv4KvR27gQ4m2F6FnElibndpPk","pdfSize":"4669350"}
