This study introduces an end-to-end learned dynamic\nlossy attribute coding approach, utilizing an efficient high-dimensional\nconvolution to capture extensive inter-point dependencies. This enables the\nefficient projection of attribute features into latent variables. Subsequently,\nwe employ a context model that leverage previous latent space in conjunction\nwith an auto-regressive context model for encoding the latent tensor into a\nbitstream. Evaluation of our method on widely utilized point cloud datasets\nfrom the MPEG and Microsoft demonstrates its superior performance compared to\nthe core attribute compression module Region-Adaptive Hierarchical Transform\nmethod from MPEG Geometry Point Cloud Compression with 38.1% Bjontegaard\nDelta-rate saving in average while ensuring a low-complexity encoding/decoding.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
