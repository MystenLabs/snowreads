The whole sample was divided into\nfour categories according to the spectral line characteristics: He-normal,\nHe-weak, He-strong C and He-strong. Each selected spectrum was assigned a\nspectral class, a luminosity class and an helium class by comparing the line\ndepth and width with standard spectra selected in LAMOST. Relationships between\natmospheric parameters and spectral classification were also presented.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
