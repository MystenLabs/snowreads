The Hamiltonian term is treated as an integrating\nfactor by forward and backward Fourier transformations, which are here carried\nout classically. This split allows us to avoid higher-order time integration\nschemes, to apply a first-order explicit time stepping for the remaining\nnonlinear NLSE term in a variational algorithm block, and thus to avoid\nnumerical instabilities. We demonstrate that the analytical solution is\nreproduced with a small root mean square error for a long time interval over\nwhich a nonlinear soliton propagates significantly forward in space while\nkeeping its shape. We analyze the accuracy of the quantum algorithm and compare\nit with classical approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of\nalgorithm parameters on the accuracy of the results, including the temporal\nstep width and the depth of the quantum circuit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
