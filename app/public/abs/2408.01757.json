In this paper, we investigate a weak force sensing scheme\nthat combines a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and an auxiliary\nmechanical oscillator into a cavity optomechanical system to reduce quantum\nnoise. We demonstrate that the noise reduction of two coupled oscillators\ndepends on their norm mode splitting. and provide a classic analogy and quantum\nperspective for further clarification. Besides, the noise reduction mechanism\nof OPA is to reduce the fluctuation of photon number and enhance the squeezing\nof the cavity field. We propose a specific design aimed at enhancing the joint\neffect of both, beyond what can be achieved using OPA alone or two series\ncoupled oscillators. This scheme provides a new perspective for deeper\nunderstanding of cavity field squeezing and auxiliary oscillator in force\nsensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
