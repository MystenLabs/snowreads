As the demand for ride-hailing\nservices continues to surge and governments advocate for stricter environmental\nregulations, integrating electric vehicles into these markets becomes\ninevitable. The proposed framework addresses the challenges posed by dynamic\ndemand patterns, fluctuating energy costs, and competitive dynamics inherent in\nsuch markets. Leveraging the concept of receding-horizon games, we propose a\nmethod to optimize proactive dispatching of vehicles for recharging over a\npredefined time horizon. We integrate a modified Tullock contest that accounts\nfor customer abandonment due to long waiting times to model the expected market\nshare, and by factoring in the demand-based electricity charging, we construct\na game capturing interactions between two companies over the time horizon. For\nthis game, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash\nequilibrium and then present a semi-decentralized, iterative method to compute\nit. Finally, the method is evaluated in an open-loop and a closed-loop manner\nin a simulated numerical case study.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
