Here we\npropose a shape-induced Bose-Einstein condensation at fixed size, temperature,\nand density. We investigate the impact of quantum shape effects on a\nnon-interacting Bose gas confined within nested square domains, where the shape\nparameter is defined and controlled by the rotation angle between the inner and\nouter squares. The size-invariant shape transformation significantly affects\nthe condensate fraction and specific heat of the system. Our work opens new\navenues for controlling quantum systems through geometric manipulation,\nproviding insights into the thermodynamic properties of Bose gases under\nshape-induced quantum effects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
