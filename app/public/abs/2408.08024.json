Our RL framework is tested through a\nseries of experiments with product recommendations tailored to each pharmacy\nbased on real-time information on their purchasing history and in-app\nengagement, showing a significant increase in basket size. By integrating\nadaptive interventions into existing mobile health solutions and enriching user\njourneys, our platform offers a scalable solution to improve pharmaceutical\nsupply chain management, health worker capacity building, and clinical decision\nand patient care, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
