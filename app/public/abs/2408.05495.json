We study approximate agreement, where the parties\nobtain approximately equal outputs in the convex hull of their inputs. The\nseminal protocol of Abraham, Amit and Dolev [OPODIS '04] achieves approximate\nagreement in $\\mathbb{R}$ with the optimal resilience $t < \\frac{n}{3}$ by\nmaking each party reliably broadcast its input. This takes $\\Omega(n^2)$\nmessages per reliable broadcast, or $\\Omega(n^3)$ messages in total.\n  In this work, we present optimally resilient asynchronous approximate\nagreement protocols which forgo reliable broadcast and thus require\ncommunication proportional to $n^2$ instead of $n^3$. First, we achieve\n$\\omega$-dimensional barycentric agreement with $\\mathcal{O}(\\omega n^2)$ small\nmessages. Then, we achieve edge agreement in a tree of diameter $D$ with\n$\\lceil \\log_2 D \\rceil$ iterations of a multivalued graded consensus variant\nfor which we design an efficient protocol. This results in a\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$-round protocol for\n$\\varepsilon$-agreement in $[0, 1]$ with\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ messages and\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\log\\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ bits\nof communication, improving over the state of the art which matches this\ncomplexity only when the inputs are all either $0$ or $1$. Finally, we extend\nour edge agreement protocol to achieve edge agreement in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and thus\n$\\varepsilon$-agreement in $\\mathbb{R}$ with quadratic communication, in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\frac{M}{\\varepsilon})$ rounds where $M$ is the maximum honest\ninput magnitude.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
