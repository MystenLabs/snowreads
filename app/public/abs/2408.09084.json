This paper presents two user studies involving 100 and 72\nparticipants respectively, to investigate the impact of reflection time on the\nquality of deliberation in minute-scale deliberations. In the first study, we\nidentified an optimal reflection time for composing short opinion comments. In\nthe second study, we introduced four distinct interface-based time nudges aimed\nat encouraging reflection near the optimal time. While these nudges may not\nimprove the quality of deliberation, they effectively prolonged reflection\nperiods. Additionally, we observed mixed effects on users' experience,\ninfluenced by the nature of the time nudges. Our findings suggest that\nreflection time is crucial, particularly for users who typically deliberate\nbelow the optimal reflection threshold.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"amdi0mg7fuZ17sC8fJEOQMtwtFfsjSW2tOCp3eLo9lM","pdfSize":"7695576"}
