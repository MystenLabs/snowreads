AuToMATo combines the existing ToMATo clustering algorithm\nwith a bootstrapping procedure in order to separate significant peaks of an\nestimated density function from non-significant ones. We perform a thorough\ncomparison of AuToMATo against many other state-of-the-art clustering\nalgorithms. We find that not only that AuToMATo compares favorably against\nother parameter-free clustering algorithms, but in many instances also\nsignificantly outperforms even the best selection of parameters for other\nalgorithms. AuToMATo is motivated by applications in topological data analysis,\nin particular the Mapper algorithm, where it is desirable to work with a\nparameter-free clustering algorithm. Indeed, we provide evidence that AuToMATo\nperforms well when used with Mapper. Finally, we provide an open-source\nimplementation of AuToMATo in Python that is fully compatible with the\nstandardscikit-learn architecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
