This simplified model\nnaturally leads to photon-mediated dark matter interactions with nuclei, making\nit suitable for direct dark matter detection experiments. Matching to the\nframework of non-relativistic effective field theory for dark matter, we report\nthe first sensitive search for this model using data from the PandaX-4T\ncommissioning run. Our results yield strong constraints on Dirac fermion dark\nmatter but relatively weaker constraints on Majorana dark matter due to the\nsuppression of effective photon interactions. These constraints complement\nthose obtained from the collider and indirect detection experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
