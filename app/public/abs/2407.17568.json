Our\napproach explicitly starts with the cosmological Killing vectors and constructs\nthe coincident gauge coordinates adapted to these Killing vectors. We then\nobtain three distinct spatially flat branches and a single spatially curved\nbranch. Contrary to some previous claims, we show that all branches of\nconnection in the covariant approach can be studied in this gauge-fixed\nformalism, which offers certain conceptual advantages. Interestingly, we find\nthat the flat and negative spatially curved solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity can be\nseen as equivalent to the metric teleparallel $f(T)$ theories, demonstrating a\ndeeper connection between these theories. This is accomplished by studying the\nconnection equation of motion, which can be interpreted as a consistency\ncondition in the gauge-fixed approach. Finally, we discuss the role of\ndiffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance in these geometric\nmodifications of gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
