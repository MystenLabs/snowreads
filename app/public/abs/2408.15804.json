Suppose that the pullback\n$f^*|_{\\mathsf{N}^1(X)_\\mathbf{R}}$ of $f$ on the real N\\'eron--Severi space\n$\\mathsf{N}^1(X)_\\mathbf{R}$ is unipotent and denote the index of the\neigenvalue $1$ by $k+1$. We prove an upper bound for the polynomial volume\ngrowth $\\mathrm{plov}(f)$ of $f$ as follows: \\[ \\mathrm{plov}(f) \\le (k/2 +\n1)d. \\] This inequality is optimal in certain cases. Furthermore, we show that\n$k\\le 2(d-1)$, extending a result of Dinh--Lin--Oguiso--Zhang for compact\nK\\\"ahler manifolds to arbitrary characteristic. Combining these two\ninequalities together, we obtain an optimal inequality that \\[ \\mathrm{plov}(f)\n\\le d^2, \\] which affirmatively answers questions of Cantat--Paris-Romaskevich\nand Lin--Oguiso--Zhang.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
