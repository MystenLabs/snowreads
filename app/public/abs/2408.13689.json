A key innovation is the decentralised construction of a locally\nmaximised evidence lower bound, which greatly reduces the information required\nfor communication. Our decentralised natural gradient descent variational\nmulti-object tracker, enhanced with the gradient tracking strategy and natural\ngradients that adjusts the direction of traditional gradients to the steepest,\nshows rapid convergence. Our results verify that the proposed method is\nempirically equivalent to the centralised fusion in tracking accuracy,\nsurpasses suboptimal fusion techniques with comparable costs, and achieves much\nlower communication overhead than the consensus-based variational multi-object\ntracker.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
