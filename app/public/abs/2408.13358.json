Recent advancements in Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) have revealed new possibilities for dietary assessment,\nparticularly through analysis of food images. Recognizing foods and estimating\nfood volumes from images are known as the key procedures for automatic dietary\nassessment. However, both procedures required large amounts of training images\nlabeled with food names and volumes, which are currently unavailable.\nAlternatively, recent studies have indicated that training images can be\nartificially generated using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).\nNonetheless, convenient generation of large amounts of food images with known\nvolumes remain a challenge with the existing techniques. In this work, we\npresent a simple GAN-based neural network architecture for conditional food\nimage generation. The shapes of the food and container in the generated images\nclosely resemble those in the reference input image. Our experiments\ndemonstrate the realism of the generated images and shape-preserving\ncapabilities of the proposed framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
