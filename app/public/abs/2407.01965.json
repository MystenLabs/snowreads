Recent works\naimed to boost the performance of CRQ through alignment. However, they are\ndesigned for one specific retrieval system, which potentially results in poor\ngeneralization. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework\nAdaCQR. By aligning reformulation models with both term-based and\nsemantic-based retrieval systems, AdaCQR enhances the generalizability of\ninformation-seeking queries across diverse retrieval environments through a\ndual-phase training strategy. We also developed two effective approaches for\nacquiring superior labels and diverse input candidates, boosting the efficiency\nand robustness of the framework. Experimental evaluations on the TopiOCQA and\nQReCC datasets demonstrate that AdaCQR significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, offering both quantitative and qualitative improvements in\nconversational query reformulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
