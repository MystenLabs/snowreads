This rich dataset offers valuable insights into\nconsumer experiences with financial products and services. The platform itself\nutilizes machine learning models to predict two key aspects of complaint\nresolution: the timeliness of company responses and the nature of those\nresponses (e.g., closed, closed with relief etc.). Furthermore, the platform\nemploys Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to delve deeper, uncovering common\nthemes within complaints and revealing underlying trends and consumer issues.\nThis comprehensive approach empowers both consumers and regulators. Consumers\ngain valuable insights into potential response wait times, while regulators can\nutilize the platform's findings to identify areas where companies may require\nfurther scrutiny regarding their complaint resolution practices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MMmRVt1gU-kzLTe5FjQvcDtvxLe-61bemdRj5tysytw","pdfSize":"790239"}
