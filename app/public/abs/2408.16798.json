Traditional methods\nrely on human-driven iterative processes based on naval architecture principles\nand engineering analysis. In contrast, generative AI presents a novel approach,\nutilizing computational algorithms rooted in machine learning and artificial\nintelligence to optimize ship hull design. This report outlines the systematic\ncreation of a generative AI for this purpose, involving steps such as dataset\ncollection, model architecture selection, training, and validation. Utilizing\nthe \"SHIP-D\" dataset, consisting of 30,000 hull forms, the report adopts the\nGaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the generative model architecture. GMMs offer a\nstatistical framework to analyze data distribution, crucial for generating\ninnovative ship designs efficiently. Overall, this approach holds promise in\nrevolutionizing ship design by exploring a broader design space and integrating\nmultidisciplinary optimization objectives effectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
