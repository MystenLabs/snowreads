It covers both classical and more modern\naspects of configuration spaces of points on a \"ground space\" $M$. Most results\npertain to $M$ a manifold. Configuration spaces of points have become so\nomnipresent in so many areas of mathematics, physics, and even the applied\nsciences, that a survey can only cover a selection of topics. We review key\nideas, constructions, and results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
