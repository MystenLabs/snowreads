Known exact solutions exist for such theories at the\nbackground level, where the metric takes on a standard GR form (e.g.\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter), but these solutions are generically plagued by\ninstabilities. Recently, a new such solution was identified in\narXiv:2310.11919, in which the time-dependent scalar background profile is\nqualitatively different from previous known exact solutions - specifically, the\ncanonical kinetic term for the background scalar $X$ is not constant in this\nsolution. We investigate the stability of this new solution by analysing odd\nparity perturbations, identifying a bound placed by stability and the resulting\nsurviving parameter space. We extract the quasinormal mode spectrum predicted\nby the theory, finding a generic positive shift of quasinormal mode frequencies\nand damping times compared to GR. We forecast constraints on these shifts (and\nthe single effective parameter $\\hat\\beta$ controlling them) from current and\nfuture gravitational wave experiments, finding constraints at up to the ${\\cal\nO}(10^{-2})$ and ${\\cal O}(10^{-6})$ level for LVK and LISA/TianQin,\nrespectively. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via a\ncompanion Mathematica notebook.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
