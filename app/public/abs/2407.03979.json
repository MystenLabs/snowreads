The principal characteristic of the proposed\napproach is the asymmetric treatment of the two types of error. In particular,\nwe construct a test set consisting of positive and negative samples, set the\noperating point of the binary classifier at the lowest value that will result\nto correct classifications of all positive samples, and use the algorithm's\nsuccess rate on the negative samples as a performance measure. A property of\nthe proposed approach, setting it apart from other commonly used testing\nmethods, is that it allows the construction of a series of tests of increasing\ndifficulty, corresponding to a nested sequence of positive sample test sets. We\nillustrate the proposed method on the problem of age estimation for determining\nwhether a subject is above a legal age threshold, a problem that exemplifies\nthe asymmetry of the two types of error. Indeed, misclassifying an under-aged\nsubject is a legal and regulatory issue, while misclassifications of people\nabove the legal age is an efficiency issue primarily concerning the commercial\nuser of the age estimation system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
