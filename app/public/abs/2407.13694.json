Lacking advance knowledge of future\ntasks, existing (myopic) planning strategies unwittingly introduce side effects\nthat impede completion of subsequent tasks: e.g., by blocking future access or\nmanipulation. We present anticipatory task and motion planning, in which\nestimates of expected future cost from a learned model inform selection of\nplans generated by a model-based tamp planner so as to avoid such side effects,\nchoosing configurations of the environment that both complete the task and\nminimize overall cost. Simulated multi-task deployments in\nnavigation-among-movable-obstacles and cabinet-loading domains yield\nimprovements of 32.7% and 16.7% average per-task cost respectively. When given\ntime in advance to prepare the environment, our learning-augmented planning\napproach yields improvements of 83.1% and 22.3%. Both showcase the value of our\napproach. Finally, we also demonstrate anticipatory tamp on a real-world Fetch\nmobile manipulator.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DPRCNNHxogwDdbEZtVrrhAAjrtERw31CIrqp7zoQyGA","pdfSize":"11456298","objectId":"0x3f0521eeba92c378dd8342e151510be88890812da3684187269184378e453d91","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
