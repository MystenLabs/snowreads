To strike a balance between\ninitial feasible region, control performance, and online computation burden, a\nset of mode-dependent state feedback fuzzy controllers within the frame of\ndynamic prediction optimizing (DPO)-MPC is delicately designed with the\nperturbation variables produced by the predictive dynamics. The DPO-MPC\ncontrollers are implemented via two stages: at the first stage, terminal\nconstraints sets companied with feedback gain are obtained by solving a\n``min-max'' problem; at the second stage, and a set of perturbations is\ndesigned felicitously to enlarge the feasible region. Here, dynamic feedback\ngains are designed for off-line using matrix factorization technique, while the\ndynamic controller state is determined for online over a moving horizon to\ngradually guide the system state from the initial feasible region to the\nterminal constraint set. Sufficient conditions are provided to rigorously\nensure the recursive feasibility of the proposed DPO-MPC scheme and the\nmean-square stability of the underlying FMJS. Finally, the efficacy of the\nproposed methods is demonstrated through a robot arm system example.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
