In this method, the\noscillatory boundary conditions of the wave function are transformed into\nexponentially decaying ones, accommodating the long-range Coulomb interaction.\nThe program implements the Woods-Saxon form of a realistic optical potential,\nwith all potential parameters included in a well-designed input format for ease\nof use. This design offers users straightforward access to compute\n\\(S\\)-matrices and cross-sections of the scattering process. We provide\nthorough discussions on the precision of Lagrange functions and their benefits\nin evaluating matrix elements. Additionally, COLOSS incorporates two distinct\nrotation methods, making it adaptable to potentials without analytical\nexpressions. Comparative results demonstrate that COLOSS achieves high accuracy\nwhen compared with the direct integration method, Numerov, underscoring its\nutility and effectiveness in scattering calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fl2G0UyzLFSq5ecNPuR0a_2CjbH5SzEJ7NPf7oo-tX4","pdfSize":"1047786"}
