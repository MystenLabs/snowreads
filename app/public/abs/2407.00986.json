Our main technique involves\nexploring higher moment formulas for the primitive Siegel transform. We first\ndemonstrate that if the volume of $S_d$ remains fixed for all $d\\in \\mathbb N$,\nthen the distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in\n$S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Poisson distribution of mean $\\frac 1\n2$. Furthermore, if the volume of $S_d$ goes to infinity subexponentially as\n$d$ approaches infinity, the normalized distribution of the half the number of\nprimitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the normal\ndistribution $\\mathcal N(0,1)$. We also extend these results to the setting of\nstochastic processes. This work is motivated by the contributions of Rogers\n(1955), S\\\"odergren (2011) and Str\\\"ombergsson and S\\\"odergren (2019).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
