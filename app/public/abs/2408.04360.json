The\ntendency to over speeding is usually tried to be controlled using check points\nat various parts of the road but not all traffic police have the device to\ncheck speed with existing speed estimating devices such as LIDAR based, or\nRadar based guns. The current project tries to address the issue of vehicle\nspeed estimation with handheld devices such as mobile phones or wearable\ncameras with network connection to estimate the speed using deep learning\nframeworks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
