One of the species lives in the entire habitat, competing with the\nother two species, while the other two inhabit two disjoint regions of the\nhabitat. These two populations just interact on a region/interface which acts\nas a geographical barrier. This barrier condition causes a drastic change in\nspecies behaviour compared to the classical Lotka-Volterra competitive model,\nshowing very rich and new different situations depending on the several\nparameters involved in the system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
