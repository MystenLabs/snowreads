Central to our approach is a quantum oscillator weighted five vertex\nmodel which features a strange weight conservation distinct from the\nconventional one. Our results clarify the interrelations among several known\nresults and refine their derivations. For instance, the stationary probability\nderived from the multiline queue construction by Martin (2020) and\nCorteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022) is identified with the partition function\nof a three-dimensional system. The matrix product operators by\nProlhac--Evans--Mallick (2009) acquire a natural diagrammatic interpretation as\ncorner transfer matrices (CTM). The origin of their recursive tensor structure,\nas questioned by Aggarwal--Nicoletti--Petrov (2023), is revealed through the\nCTM diagrams. Finally, the derivation of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra by\nCantini--de Gier--Wheeler (2015) is made intrinsic by elucidating its precise\nconnection to a solution to the Yang--Baxter equation originating from quantum\ngroup representations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
