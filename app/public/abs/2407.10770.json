Motivated by this, we study a class of\ndecentralized optimization problems with a variable coupling structure that is\nnew to the literature. Specifically, we consider a network of nodes\ncollaborating to minimize a global objective subject to a collection of global\ninequality and equality constraints, which are formed by the local objective\nand constraint functions of the nodes. On top of that, we allow such local\nfunctions of each node to depend on not only its own decision variable but the\ndecisions of its neighbors as well. To address this problem, we propose a\ndecentralized projected primal-dual algorithm. It first incorporates a\nvirtual-queue technique with a primal-dual-primal scheme, and then linearizes\nthe non-separable objective and constraint functions to enable decentralized\nimplementation. Under mild conditions, we derive $O(1/k)$ convergence rates for\nboth objective error and constraint violations. Finally, two numerical\nexperiments corroborate our theoretical results and illustrate the competitive\nperformance of the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
