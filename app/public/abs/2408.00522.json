The tilings have two\ninvariants, flux and twist, often integer-valued, which are given in purely\ncombinatorial terms. These invariants allow one to classify the tilings with\nrespect to certain elementary moves, flips and trits. In this paper we present\na construction associating a divergence-free vector field $\\xi_t$ to any domino\ntiling $t$, such that the flux of the tiling $t$ can be interpreted as the\n(relative) rotation class of the field $\\xi_t$, while the twist of $t$ is\nproved to be the relative helicity of the field $\\xi_t$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
