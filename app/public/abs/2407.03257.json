In this\npaper, we revisit Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA), a classic tabular\nprediction method introduced in 2004, designed to learn a linear projection\nthat captures semantic similarities between instances. We find that minor\nmodifications, such as adjustments to the learning objectives and the\nintegration of deep learning architectures, significantly enhance NCA's\nperformance, enabling it to surpass most modern deep tabular models.\nAdditionally, we introduce a stochastic neighbor sampling strategy that\nimproves both the efficiency and predictive accuracy of our proposed ModernNCA\n-- sampling only a subset of neighbors during training, while utilizing the\nentire neighborhood during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour ModernNCA achieves state-of-the-art results in both classification and\nregression tasks across various tabular datasets, outperforming both tree-based\nand other deep tabular models, while also reducing training time and model\nsize.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"muNzHUs19qna_c9T793_dEbUgGvpqM2Mzhfx6sCvKSw","pdfSize":"1169282"}
