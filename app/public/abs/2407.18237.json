We studied the\nexperimental trajectories of dynein-driven directed movement of DCVs in the ALA\nneuron C. elegans over a duration of up to 6 seconds. We analysed the DCV\nmovement in three strains of C. elegans: 1) with normal kinesin-1 function, 2)\nwith reduced function in kinesin light chain 2 (KLC-2), and 3) a null mutation\nin kinesin light chain 1 (KLC-1). We find that DCVs move superdiffusively with\ndisplacement variance $var(x) \\sim t^2$ in all three strains with low reversal\nrates and frequent immobilization of DCVs. The distribution of DCV\ndisplacements fits a beta-binomial distribution with the mean and the variance\nfollowing linear and quadratic growth patterns, respectively. We propose a\nsimple heterogeneous random walk model to explain the observed superdiffusive\nretrograde transport behaviour of DCV movement. This model involves a random\nprobability with the beta density for a DCV to resume its movement or remain in\nthe same position.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Subcellular Processes"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
