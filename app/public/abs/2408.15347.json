The coincident detection of GW170817 and GRB170817A marked a\nmilestone for the connection between binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and\nshort gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). These mergers can lead to the formation of a\nblack hole surrounded by a disk and the generation of a powerful jet. It spends\nenergy to break free from the merger ejecta, and then a portion of it, is\ndissipated to produce observable emissions. Aims. Our primary goal is to\nenhance our comprehension of BNS mergers by constraining the disk mass for a\nselection of sGRBs, utilizing isotropic gamma-ray luminosity and corresponding\nemission times as key indicators. Methods. In this study, we leverage data from\nGW170817 to estimate the disk mass surrounding the BNS merger remnant and\nsubsequently infer the accretion-to-jet efficiency. Then statistically examine\nother sGRBs observations to estimate the possibility of being induced by BNS\nmergers Results. Our findings suggest that, when employing similar physical\nparameters as in the sole observed BNS-powered GRB event, GRB170817A, a\nsubstantial fraction of sGRBs necessitate an unrealistically massive disk\nremnant. Conclusions. This observation raises the possibility that either a\ndifferent mechanis\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
