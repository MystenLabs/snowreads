In the\npaper~\\cite{Manohar:2016nzj}, we demonstrated how the photon PDF could be\ndetermined using the proton structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$ measured in\nelectron--proton scattering experiments. We provided an explicit formula for\nthe PDF, which can be systematically improved order by order in perturbation\ntheory. We obtained a photon PDF with errors $\\lesssim 2$\\% for $10^{-4} < x <\n0.1$. Here, we recall the underlying idea and method used to obtain this\nresult, as well as the progress made since then.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sQ9CJOpgNkAco5-q3Imyq0YspsRFIRW_71qW42PeuIs","pdfSize":"1159364"}
