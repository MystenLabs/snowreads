The edge-fog-cloud continuum thus provides significant\nedge analytics capabilities for realizing interesting IoT applications. While\nedge analytics tasks are usually performed on a single node, distributed edge\nanalytics proposes utilizing multiple nodes from the continuum, concurrently.\nThis paper discusses and demonstrates distributed edge analytics from three\ndifferent perspectives; serverless data pipelines (SDP), distributed computing\nand edge analytics, and federated learning, with our frameworks, MQTT based\nSDP, CANTO and FIDEL, respectively. The results produced in the paper, through\ndifferent case studies, show the feasibility of performing distributed edge\nanalytics following the three approaches, across the continuum.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
