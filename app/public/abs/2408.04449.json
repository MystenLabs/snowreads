However, the unmitigated deployment of\nLLM-based embodied systems in real-world environments may pose potential\nphysical risks, such as property damage and personal injury. Existing security\nbenchmarks for LLMs overlook risk awareness for LLM-based embodied agents. To\naddress this gap, we propose RiskAwareBench, an automated framework designed to\nassess physical risks awareness in LLM-based embodied agents. RiskAwareBench\nconsists of four modules: safety tips generation, risky scene generation, plan\ngeneration, and evaluation, enabling comprehensive risk assessment with minimal\nmanual intervention. Utilizing this framework, we compile the PhysicalRisk\ndataset, encompassing diverse scenarios with associated safety tips,\nobservations, and instructions. Extensive experiments reveal that most LLMs\nexhibit insufficient physical risk awareness, and baseline risk mitigation\nstrategies yield limited enhancement, which emphasizes the urgency and\ncruciality of improving risk awareness in LLM-based embodied agents in the\nfuture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
