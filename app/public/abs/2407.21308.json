This paper presents a novel\nself-checkout system for retail based on an improved YOLOv10 network, aimed at\nenhancing checkout efficiency and reducing labor costs. We propose targeted\noptimizations to the YOLOv10 model, by incorporating the detection head\nstructure from YOLOv8, which significantly improves product recognition\naccuracy. Additionally, we develop a post-processing algorithm tailored for\nself-checkout scenarios, to further enhance the application of system.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms existing methods\nin both product recognition accuracy and checkout speed. This research not only\nprovides a new technical solution for retail automation but offers valuable\ninsights into optimizing deep learning models for real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
