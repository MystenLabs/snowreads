For most kinds\nof parametric forcing, stable regions in its two-dimensional parameter space\nneed to be identified numerically, typically by applying a matrix trace\ncriterion. By integrating ODEs derived from the stability criterion, we present\nan alternative, more accurate and computationally efficient numerical method\nfor determining the stability boundaries of Hill's equation in parameter space.\nThis method works similarly to determine stability boundaries for the closely\nrelated problem of vibrational stabilization of the linearized Katpiza\npendulum. Additionally, we derive a stability criterion for the damped Hill's\nequation in terms of a matrix trace criterion on an equivalent undamped system.\nIn doing so we generalize the method of this paper to compute stability\nboundaries for parametric resonance in the presence of damping.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
