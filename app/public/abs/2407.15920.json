We assume classical scale\ninvariance as well as an extension of the SM scalar sector custodial symmetry\nto $\\mathrm{SO}(6)$. This requires a single new complex scalar field charged\nunder a new $\\mathrm{U}(1)_\\mathrm{X}$ gauge symmetry which partially overlaps\nwith $B-L$. Classical scale invariance and the high-scale scalar sector\n$\\mathrm{SO}(6)$ custodial symmetry are radiatively broken by quantum effects\nthat generate a new intermediate scale by dimensional transmutation. The little\nhierarchy problem is solved because the Higgs boson arises as an elementary\n(i.e. non-composite) pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) of the spontaneously\nbroken $\\mathrm{SO}(6)$ custodial symmetry. The minimal setting has the same\nnumber of parameters as the SM and predicts new physics in the form of a heavy\n$Z'$ with fixed couplings to the SM and a mass of\n$m_{Z'}\\approx4-100\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$, as well as a light but close-to invisible\ndilaton with a mass $m_{h_\\Phi}\\approx75\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
