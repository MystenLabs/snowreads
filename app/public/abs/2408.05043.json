Nanohertz GWs generated by supermassive binary black\nholes (SMBBHs) are one of the most important GW sources in the PTA band.\nUtilizing data from numerical cosmology simulation, we generate mock SMBBHs\nwithin the observable universe and treat them as PTA band GW sources. We\npresent their statistical properties, and analyze the isotropic and anisotropic\ncharacteristics of the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal they produce.\nSpecifically, we derive the characteristic amplitude and spectrum of the GWB\nsignal, and calculate the angular power spectrum for both GW strains/energy\ndensity and the position distribution of GW sources. We predict that the\nangular power spectrum of GWB energy density has $C_1/C_0\\approx0.40\\pm0.32$,\nand $C_l/C_0\\simeq \\frac{1}{2(2l+1)}$ (for $l>1$). Furthermore, for the\nupcoming Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA)\nPTA, we predict the spatial distribution, numbers and signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) distribution of individual GW sources that may be detected with SNR>8,\nand study the anisotropy property in the spatial distribution of these\nindividual GW sources.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
