{"id":"2407.01703","title":"Characterizing positive-rate key-cast (and multicast network coding)\n  with eavesdropping nodes","authors":"Michael Langberg and Michelle Effros","authorsParsed":[["Langberg","Michael",""],["Effros","Michelle",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2024 18:27:52 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-03","timestamp":1719858472000,"abstract":"  In multi-source multi-terminal key-dissemination, here called ``key-cast,''\nintroduced by the authors in [ITW2022], network nodes hold independent random\nbits, and one seeks a communication scheme that allows all terminal nodes to\nshare a secret key K. The work at hand addresses positive (albeit, arbitrarily\nsmall) rate key-cast under the security requirement that no single non-terminal\nnetwork node can gain information about the shared key K; this scenario is\nuseful in cryptographic settings. Specifically, key-dissemination protocols\nbased on secure multicast network coding are designed. The analysis presented\nyields two combinatorial characterizations. In each, we assume a network in\nwhich an eavesdropper may access any individual network node. The first\ncharacterization captures all networks that support positive-rate secure\nmulticast; computing the secure-multicast capacity in the setting studied is a\nknown open problem. The second characterizes all networks that support\npositive-rate secure key-cast.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
