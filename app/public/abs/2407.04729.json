We equipped 16\nrabbits with these devices and filmed them for two weeks. By watching the\nvideos and using a special software we figure out what the rabbits were doing\n-- things like lying down, eating, moving around, and more. These activitties\nwere grouped into two states: active or inactive. Then, this information along\nacceleration data was used to teach a computer program to recognize when the\nrabbits were active or not. This technology offers a reliable way to understand\nrabbit behavior, which could lead to better management practices in animal\nproduction.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
