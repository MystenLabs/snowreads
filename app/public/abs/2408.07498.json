In one dimension, the\nWasserstein-2 space can be isometrically embedded into the cone $\\mathcal\nC(0,1) \\subset L_2(0,1)$ of quantile functions leading to a characterization of\nWasserstein gradient flows via the solution of an associated Cauchy problem on\n$L_2(0,1)$. Based on the construction of an appropriate counterpart of\n$\\mathcal F_\\nu$ on $L_2(0,1)$ and its subdifferential, we provide a solution\nof the Cauchy problem. For discrete target measures $\\nu$, this results in a\npiecewise linear solution formula. We prove invariance and smoothing properties\nof the flow on subsets of $\\mathcal C(0,1)$. For certain $\\mathcal F_\\nu$-flows\nthis implies that initial point measures instantly become absolutely\ncontinuous, and stay so over time. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the\nflow by various numerical examples using an implicit Euler scheme and\ndemonstrate differences to the explicit Euler scheme, which is easier to\ncompute, but comes with limited convergence guarantees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
