However, applying the CWT to each\nindividual audio sample is computationally intensive. This paper proposes an\napproach that applies the CWT to a subset of samples, spaced according to a\nspecified hop size. Experimental results demonstrate that this method\nsignificantly reduces computational costs while maintaining the robust\nperformance of the trained models.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
