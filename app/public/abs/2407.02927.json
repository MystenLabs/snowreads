This demonstrates that the Liu Entropy Condition alone is\ninsufficient to guarantee uniqueness, even within the mono-dimensional setting.\nWe provide examples of systems where this pathology holds, even if they verify\nstability and uniqueness for small BV solutions. Our proof is based on the\nconvex integration process. Notably, this result represents the first\napplication of convex integration to construct non-unique continuous solutions\nin one dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
