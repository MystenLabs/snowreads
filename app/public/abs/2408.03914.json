This\nhypothesis leads us to conclude that such a foliation is defined by a closed\nmeromorphic 1-form, also allowing the classification of the simple models in\nits reduction of singularities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
