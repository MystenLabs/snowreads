They are universal and process-independent. As a matter of\nfact, nucleon PDFs are inevitably affected by nuclear matter during nuclear\nscattering process. In order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), in this paper,\nwe introduce the nucleon pair PDFs (dPDFs) to describe parton distributions in\nthe nucleon pair which is confined to a nucleus. We first of all construct the\nnuclear state in terms of nucleonic Fock states and calculate the operator\ndefinition of nPDFs. Neglecting the higher order corrections or nucleon\ncorrelations, we find that nPDFs can be written as a sum of two terms which\nrespectively correspond to PDFs and dPDFs. Nucleon pair PDFs which stem from\nnucleon-nucleon correlation are proportional to common nucleon PDFs but\nsuppressed by a factor. It is naturally to obtain the slope of the EMC effect\n$dR_{EMC}/dx$ as long as the factor is independent of momentum fraction $x$. We\nfurther calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratio to study the nuclear matter\neffect on the extraction of weak mixing angle or $\\sin^2\\theta_W$ by using\ndPDFs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
