In this paper, for divisors in a certain class\n(larger than normal crossings), we construct smoothing families of contact\nhypersurfaces with controlled Reeb dynamics. We use these to adapt arguments of\nBorman, Sheridan and Varolgunes to obtain analogous results about symplectic\ncohomology with supports in the divisor complement. In particular, we will show\nthat several examples of Lagrangian skeleta of such divisor complements are\nSH-full, in cases where applying Lagrangian Floer theory may be intractable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
