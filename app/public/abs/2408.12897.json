The\ndemand for high-quality dMRI data is growing, driven by the need for better\nresolution and improved tissue contrast. However, acquiring high-quality dMRI\ndata is expensive and time-consuming. In this context, deep generative modeling\nemerges as a promising solution to enhance image quality while minimizing\nacquisition costs and scanning time. In this study, we propose a novel\ngenerative approach to perform dMRI generation using deep diffusion models. It\ncan generate high dimension (4D) and high resolution data preserving the\ngradients information and brain structure. We demonstrated our method through\nan image mapping task aimed at enhancing the quality of dMRI images from 3T to\n7T. Our approach demonstrates highly enhanced performance in generating dMRI\nimages when compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This\nachievement underscores a substantial progression in enhancing dMRI quality,\nhighlighting the potential of our novel generative approach to revolutionize\ndMRI imaging standards.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
