Our\nmethod achieves sparsity inducing in the identification of switched linear\nsystems by the constrained switching mechanism, in contrast to previous\noptimization-based identification techniques that rely on the rigid data\ndistribution assumption in the parameter space. The proposed mechanism assumes\nthe existence of a minimal interval between adjacent switching instants. First,\nan efficient iterative dynamic programming approach is used to determine the\nswitching instants and segments using the constrained switching mechanism.\nThen, each submodel is identified as a combinatorial $\\ell_0$ optimization\nproblem, and the true parameter for each submodel is determined by solving the\nproblem. The problem of combinatorial $\\ell_0$ optimization is solved by\nrelaxing it into a convex $\\ell_1$-norm optimization problem. Furthermore, the\nunbiasedness of the switched linear system identification is discussed\nthoroughly with the constrained switching mechanism and a new persistent\nexcitation condition is proposed. Simulation experiments are conducted to\nindicate that our algorithms exhibit strong robustness against noise.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
