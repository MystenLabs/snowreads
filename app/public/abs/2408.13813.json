Using the large and diverse GMTKN55 dataset, we find\nthat MOS-double hybrids provide significantly better accuracy compared to\nSOS-MP2-based double hybrids when empirical dispersion correction is not\nemployed. The non-covalent interaction subsets account for the majority of this\nimprovement. Adding the DFT-D4 dispersion correction to MOS-type double hybrids\ndoes not provide any superior performance over conventional\ndispersion-corrected SOS-MP2-based double hybrids. Nevertheless, for nine\ntested transition metal sets, dispersion-corrected spin-component-scaled (SCS)\ndouble hybrids are still significantly better than any MOS-double hybrid\nfunctional.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
