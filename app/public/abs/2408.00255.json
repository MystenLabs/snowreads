Meanwhile, previous studies have shown that deep\nmodels are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, in which compromised models return\nattacker-desired results when a trigger appears. Backdoor attacks severely\nbreak the trust-worthiness of deep models. In this paper, we turn this weakness\nof deep models into a strength, and propose a novel revocable backdoor and deep\nmodel trading scenario. Specifically, we aim to compromise deep models without\ndegrading their performance, meanwhile, we can easily detoxify poisoned models\nwithout re-training the models. We design specific mask matrices to manage the\ninternal feature maps of the models. These mask matrices can be used to\ndeactivate the backdoors. The revocable backdoor can be adopted in the deep\nmodel trading scenario. Sellers train models with revocable backdoors as a\ntrial version. Buyers pay a deposit to sellers and obtain a trial version of\nthe deep model. If buyers are satisfied with the trial version, they pay a\nfinal payment to sellers and sellers send mask matrices to buyers to withdraw\nrevocable backdoors. We demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our\nrevocable backdoor by various datasets and network architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
