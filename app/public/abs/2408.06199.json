This is the problem of determining the number of\nmodels ||\\exists X.{\\Sigma}|| of a propositional formula {\\Sigma} after\neliminating a given set X of variables existentially. Although blocked clause\nelimination is a well-known technique for SAT solving, its direct application\nto model counting is challenging as in general it changes the number of models.\nHowever, we demonstrate, by focusing on projected variables during the blocked\nclause search, that blocked clause elimination can be leveraged while\npreserving the correct model count. To take advantage of blocked clause\nelimination in an efficient way during model counting, a novel data structure\nand associated algorithms are introduced. Our proposed approach is implemented\nin the model counter d4. Our experiments demonstrate the computational benefits\nof our new method of blocked clause elimination for projected model counting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lD4ZkH4SFAymGpTS2MiBauEpjEX0ZIKwIfhnVCqktNg","pdfSize":"904579"}
