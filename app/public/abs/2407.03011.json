Our approach employs TDAs based on the overlap of light front wave\nfunctions, using a previously developed pion light-front wave function and\nderiving a consistent model for the light front wave functions of the photon.\nThis work is expected to lead us to an estimate of the cross-sections that\ncould be measured in the future U.S. and China's electron-ion colliders. It\nwill also provide a comparison with the forward Sullivan DVCS case, which gives\naccess to pion GPDs and for which a strong signal is expected.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
