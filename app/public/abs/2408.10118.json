While this approach has\nprimarily focused on exploring relationships between Euclidean predictors and\nnon-Euclidean responses, our work introduces a novel statistical method for\nhandling random objects with circular predictors. We concentrate on local\nconstant and local linear Fr\\'echet regression, providing rigorous proofs for\nthe upper bounds of both bias and stochastic deviation of the estimators under\nmild conditions. This research lays the groundwork for broadening the\napplication of Fr\\'echet regression to scenarios involving non-Euclidean\ncovariates, thereby expanding its utility in complex data analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
