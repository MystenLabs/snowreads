These CZMs are responsible for intriguing\nphenomena like the chiral anomaly in quantum systems. The propagation direction\nof each CZM is determined by both the applied magnetic field and the\ntopological charge of the singularity point. While counter-propagating CZMs\nhave been observed in 2D and 3D systems, the realization of co-propagating CZMs\nhas remained elusive. Here we present the first experimental observation of\nco-propagating CZMs in magnetic photonic crystals hosting a single pair of\nideal Weyl points WPs. By manipulating the crystal's structural configuration,\nwe spatially alter the locations of the WPs, creating pseudo-magnetic fields in\nopposite directions between them. This arrangement results in a pair of CZMs\nthat possess the same group velocity and co-propagate. Our work opens up new\npossibilities for topological manipulation of wave propagation and may lead to\nadvancements in optical waveguides, switches, and various other applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
