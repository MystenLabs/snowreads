This paper contains a description of the\nphenomenon of phase kickback and its use in RFS, and how and why this is the\nenabling quantum computational property for the quantum advantage in RFS. Most\nimportantly, describing the computational process of quantum computation in the\nterminology of phase kickback gives a much better understanding of why\nuncomputation is necessary when solving RFS, pointing to the underlying reason\nfor the limitations of the quantum advantage.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
