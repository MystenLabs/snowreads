Kovetz","authorsParsed":[["Lazare","Hovav",""],["Flitter","Jordan",""],["Kovetz","Ely D.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 18:01:22 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-30","timestamp":1722189682000,"abstract":"  We use a combination of high-redshift observables to extract the strongest\nconstraints to date on the fraction of axion fuzzy dark matter (FDM) in the\nmass window $10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\!\\lesssim\\!\nm_\\mathrm{FDM}\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. These observables include\nultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) at redshifts $4-10$ measured by the\nHubble Space Telescope, a constraint on the neutral hydrogen fraction from\nhigh-redshift quasar spectroscopy, the cosmic microwave background optical\ndepth to reionization measurement from Planck and upper bounds on the 21cm\npower spectrum from HERA. In order to calculate these signals for FDM\ncosmology, we use the 21cmFirstCLASS code to interface between AxiCLASS and\n21cmFAST and consistently account for the full cosmic history from\nrecombination to reionization. To facilitate a full Bayesian likelihood\nanalysis, we developed a machine-learning based pipeline, which is both\naccurate, and enables a swift statistical inference, orders of magnitude faster\nthan a brute force approach. We find that FDM of mass $m_\\mathrm{FDM} \\!=\n\\!10^{-23} \\, \\mathrm{eV}$ is bound to less than $16\\%$ of the total dark\nmatter, where the constrains strengthen towards smaller masses, reaching down\nto $1\\%$ for $m_\\mathrm{FDM}\\! =\\! 10^{-26} \\, \\mathrm{eV}$, both at $95\\%$\nconfidence level. In addition, we forecast that a future detection of the 21cm\npower spectrum with HERA will lower the upper bound at $m_\\mathrm{FDM}\\! =\\!\n10^{-23} \\, \\mathrm{eV}$ to $\\lesssim\\!1\\%$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E3f5UPpZs4ewCdBQgZd7Urcps30FE_dJh3zvXVFy5LU","pdfSize":"3976480","objectId":"0xcbc95938d3b7d69e20eda7de384e18e7858137a83ab4537bd07a60c3711455a2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
