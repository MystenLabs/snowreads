The\nparticle size is unbounded, leading to infinite-range interactions, and the\npotential cannot be written as a $k$-body interaction for fixed $k$. As a\nbyproduct, we also prove the existence of infinite-volume Gibbs point processes\nsatisfying the DLR equations. The essential control over the influence of\nboundary conditions can be established using the geometry of the model and the\nhard-core constraint.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"PsAriFC_pRd_qs1zO4OXNWcEduaWvQgr7rCV6tJpit0","pdfSize":"676424"}
