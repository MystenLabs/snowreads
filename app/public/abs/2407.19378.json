We also show the asymptotic properties of our proposed PPCA estimates.\nWith the PPCA estimates as an initialization, we identify the unknown group\nstructure by a combination of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering\nalgorithm and an information criterion. Then the factor loadings and factor\nscores are re-estimated conditional on the identified latent groups. Under some\nregularity conditions, we establish the consistency of the membership\nestimators as well as that of the group number estimator derived from the\ninformation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the post-clustering\nestimators for the factor loadings and factor scores with group pursuit achieve\nefficiency gains compared to the estimators by conventional PCA method.\nThorough numerical studies validate the established theory and a real financial\nexample illustrates the practical usefulness of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
