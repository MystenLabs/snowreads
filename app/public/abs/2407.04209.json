This\npicture is now being challenged by the observations from the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST), which have revealed a large number of disk-like galaxies that\ncould be at z>3, with some being candidates at z>7. As an early formation of\nstellar disks will greatly impact our theory of galaxy formation and evolution,\nit is important to determine when such systems first emerged. To date, there is\nonly one confirmed case at z>5 (\"Twister-z5\") reported in the literature. Here\nwe present D-CEERS-z5289, a stellar disk at $z=5.289\\pm0.001$ discovered using\nthe archival JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopic data. This galaxy\nhas a highly regular edge-on disk morphology, extends to ~6.2 kpc along its\nmajor axis, and has an effective radius of ~1.3--1.4 kpc. By analyzing its\n10-band spectral energy distribution using four different tools, we find that\nit has a high stellar mass of 10^{9.5-10.0} Msun. Its age is in the range of\n330--510 Myr, and it has a mild star formation rate of 10--30 Msun/yr. It is\nconceivable that this galaxy assembled its stellar mass by secular growth.\nUnfortunately, the current spectroscopic data do not allow the derivation of\nits rotation curve. Nevertheless, the width of its H$\\alpha$ line (~345 km/s)\nfrom the partial slit coverage on one side of the disk suggests that it could\nbe a fast-rotating system.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
