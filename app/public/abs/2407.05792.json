We establish the\nfollowing selection principle: as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ the stationary\nempirical measure of the $N$-particle system converges to the minimal\ntravelling wave of the associated free boundary PDE. This resolves an open\nquestion going back at least to \\cite[p.19]{Maillard2012} and\n\\cite{GroismanJonckheer}, and follows a recent related result by the second\nauthor establishing a similar selection principle for the so-called\nFleming-Viot particle system \\cite{Tough23}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
