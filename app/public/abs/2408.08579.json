It is known that\nEP is accompanied by an abnormally small critical exponent of the order\nparameter. In this paper, we report that a novel type of EP occurs on a Bethe\nlattice, where the critical exponent of the order parameter is the same as in\nordinary bond percolation based on numerical analysis. This is likely due to\nthe property of a finite Bethe lattice that the number of sites on the surface\nwith only one neighbor is extensive to the system size. To overcome this finite\nsize effect, we consider an approximate size of the cluster that each site on\nthe surface along its branch belongs to, and accordingly approximate the sizes\nof an extensive number of clusters during simulation. As a result, the\nAchlioptas process becomes ineffective and the order parameter behaves like\nthat of ordinary percolation at the threshold. We support this result by\nmeasuring other critical exponents as well.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
