This\nholds for pure moduli, which appear ubiquitously in string compactifications.\nCrucially, the cosmological solutions approach a Milne universe. Hence, the\nmechanism we describe in fact corresponds to late-time moduli stabilization in\nMinkowski spacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
