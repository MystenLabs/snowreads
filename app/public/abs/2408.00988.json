Furthermore, introducing a weak static magnetic field enables the\nutilization of the Zeeman effect and exploitation of polarization asymmetry.\nThis distinction allows for determining the polarization direction of the\nmicrowave field is{\\theta}or180{\\deg}-{\\theta}within the 0 to 180 degree range.\nThis is the first real-time measurement of microwave polarization within 0 to\n180 degrees, crucial for microwave sensing and information transmission.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
