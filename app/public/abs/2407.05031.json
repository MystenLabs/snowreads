Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past\ndifficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli\naggregates against dynamic changes in the growth condition. We discovered that\nnutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into\nbundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid\ncrystal. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep\nlearning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction\nby extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for\nthe bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the\nsingle-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might\nalso be common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
