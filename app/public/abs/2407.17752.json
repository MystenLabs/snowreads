In particular, we study the interactions\nbetween these two concepts and various operations with convergences. We prove\nassociativity of the composition and show that the adherence of an ideal with\nrespect to an idempotent convergence is equal to its closure. Some results from\n[KT18] about unbounded modification of locally solid topologies are generalized\nto the level of locally solid idempotent convergences. A simple application of\nthe composition allows us to answer a question from [BCTvdW24] about minimal\nHausdorff locally solid convergences. We also show that the weakest Hausdorff\nlocally solid convergence exists on an Archimedean vector lattice if and only\nif it is atomic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
