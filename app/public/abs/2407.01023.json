Not only does DistML.js facilitate\nmodel training on local devices, but it also supports distributed learning\nthrough communication with servers. Its design and define-by-run API for deep\nlearning model construction resemble PyTorch, thereby reducing the learning\ncurve for prototyping. Matrix computations involved in model training and\ninference are executed on the backend utilizing WebGL, enabling high-speed\ncalculations. We provide a comprehensive explanation of DistML.js's design,\nAPI, and implementation, alongside practical applications including data\nparallelism in learning.
