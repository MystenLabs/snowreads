For the case of the\nlinear-confining potential, the associated Cauchy-principal-value singularity\nis removed by subtraction. Derivatives of the wave function that appear as a\nresult of the subtraction technique are approximated by means of interpolating\nfunctions. The resulting non-singular integral equation is solved using the\nNystr\\\"om method. The results show excellent agreement with exactly known\nenergy eigenvalues. By further increasing the number of integration points and\nthe order of the Lagrange interpolation, results with extremely high accuracy\ncan be achieved.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
