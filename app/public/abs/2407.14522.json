Different kinds of the seismic data bulk are always mixed and hard\nto be classified manually. This paper presents a classification model for four\nmain types of seismic data, and proposed a classification method based on\nMel-spectrum. An accuracy of 98.32% was achieved using pre-trained ResNet34\nwith transfer learning method. The accuracy is further improved compared with\nthe pure fourier transformation method widely used in previous studies.\nMeanwhile, the transfer learning method and fine-tune strategy to train the\nneural network by training the first N-1 layers of the network separately and\nthen train the fully connected layers further improves the training efficiency.\nOur model can also be seen as an efficient data quality control scheme for oil\nexploration and development. Meanwhile, our method is future-proofed, for\nfurther improvement of the seismic data processing quality control system,\naccording to the spectrum characteristics, this model can be further extended\ninto a error data classification model, reduces the workload of the bulk data\nmanagement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
