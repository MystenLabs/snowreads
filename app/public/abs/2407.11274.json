We consider the\nproblems of empirical mean estimation for univariate data and frequency\nestimation for categorical data, two pillars of data analysis in the industry,\nsubject to heterogeneous privacy constraints. Each user, contributing a sample\nto the dataset, is allowed to have a different privacy demand. The dataset\nitself is assumed to be worst-case and we study both the problems in two\ndifferent formulations -- the correlated and the uncorrelated setting. In the\nformer setting, the privacy demand and the user data can be arbitrarily\ncorrelated while in the latter setting, there is no correlation between the\ndataset and the privacy demand. We prove some optimality results, under both\nPAC error and mean-squared error, for our proposed algorithms and demonstrate\nsuperior performance over other baseline techniques experimentally.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
