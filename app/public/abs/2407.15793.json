This has led to the development of numerous\nprompting strategies to adapt transformer-based models without incurring\ncatastrophic forgetting. However, these strategies often compromise the\noriginal zero-shot capabilities of the pre-trained CLIP model and struggle to\nadapt to domains that significantly deviate from the pre-training data. In this\nwork, we propose Continual Generative training for Incremental prompt-Learning,\na simple and novel approach to mitigate forgetting while adapting CLIP.\nBriefly, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn class-conditioned\ndistributions within the embedding space of the visual encoder. We then exploit\nthese distributions to sample new synthetic visual embeddings and train the\ncorresponding class-specific textual prompts during subsequent tasks. Through\nextensive experiments on different domains, we show that such a generative\nreplay approach can adapt to new tasks while improving zero-shot capabilities,\nevaluated using a novel metric tailored for CL scenarios. Notably, further\nanalysis reveals that our approach can bridge the gap with joint prompt tuning.\nThe codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
