In rotating turbulence, the $K^{-2}$ energy spectrum was\nproposed under the assumption of isotropy, however, the direction selectivity\nof rotation breaks isotropy, making this $K^{-2}$ spectrum not easily\nobservable. To fill the gap between theoretical assumptions and realizability,\nwe study the turbulence of inertial waves in an artificial two-dimensional\nisotropic rotating turbulence system. In the limit of a small Rossby number, we\nasymptotically derive a nonlinear amplitude equation for inertial waves, which\ngives the $K^{-2}$ spectrum using a strong turbulence argument. This scaling is\njustified by numerical simulations of both the amplitude equation and the\noriginal system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
