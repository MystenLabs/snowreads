The exploration of integrating\ntonal cognition into sonic interaction design, particularly for practitioners\nlacking extensive musical knowledge, and developing an accessible software\ntool, remains limited. We report on a study of designers to understand the\nsound creation practices of industry experts and explore how infusing tonal\nmusic principles into a sound design tool can better support their craft and\nenhance the sonic experiences they create. Our study collected qualitative data\nthrough semi-structured individual and focus group interviews with six\nparticipants. We developed a low-fidelity prototype sound design tool that\ninvolves practical methods of functional harmony and interaction design\ndiscussed in focus groups. We identified four themes through reflexive thematic\nanalysis: decision-making, domain knowledge and terminology, collaboration, and\ncontexts in sound creation. Finally, we discussed design considerations for an\naccessible sonic interaction design tool that aligns auditory experience more\nclosely with tonal cognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
