For\nBH companions of about 150 million later (fainter) main-sequence stars, the\nthreshold of detection is $a>0.2$ au $\\times 10^{(H_{\\rm Vega}-18.5)/5}$. The\npresent $Roman$ scheduling creates a \"blind spot\" near periods of $P=3.5$ yr\ndue to a 2.3-year gap in the data. It also compromises the characterization of\nBHs in eccentric orbits with periods $P>3$ yr and peribothra within a year of\nthe mission midpoint. I show that one can greatly ameliorate these issues by\nmaking a small adjustment to the $Roman$ observing schedule. The present\nschedule aims to optimize proper-motion measurements, but the adjustment\nproposed here would degrade these by only 4%-9%. For many cases of $P>90$ d\nBHs, there will be discrete and/or continuous degeneracies. For G-dwarf and\nevolved sources, it will be straightforward to resolve these by radial-velocity\n(RV) follow-up observations, but such observations will be more taxing for\nfainter sources. Many BH-binaries in orbits of 5 yr $<P<10$ yr will be reliably\nidentified as such from the $Roman$ data, but will lack precise orbits.\nNevertheless, the full orbital solutions can be recovered by combining $Roman$\nastrometry with RV followup observations. BH binaries with periods 10 yr $<P<$\n95 yr $(M/10 M_\\odot)^{1/4}$ can be detected from their astrometric\nacceleration, but massive multi-fiber RV monitoring would be needed to\ndistinguish them from the astrophysical background due to stellar binaries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
