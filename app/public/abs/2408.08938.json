We did such an\nexperiment using a realistic elevator, and analyzed the data. The acceleration\nof an elevator is much smaller than the gravitational acceleration, and is\ntime-dependent only when the elevator starts and stops. However, we have\nmanaged to establish the effect on the oscillation of the pendulum. The effect\nbecomes pronounced if the simple pendulum is put in a container vertically\naccelerating, and the acceleration is time-dependent, while its magnitude is\ncomparable with that of the gravitational acceleration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FfU_F4LZdUrjDk8baUuVAGbhIpl_kYu7WXEFienL7EM","pdfSize":"786288"}
