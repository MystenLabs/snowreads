To solve this problem, we propose Poetry2Image, an iterative\ncorrection framework for images generated from Chinese classical poetry.\nUtilizing an external poetry dataset, Poetry2Image establishes an automated\nfeedback and correction loop, which enhances the alignment between poetry and\nimage through image generation models and subsequent re-diffusion modifications\nsuggested by large language models (LLM). Using a test set of 200 sentences of\nChinese classical poetry, the proposed method--when integrated with five\npopular image generation models--achieves an average element completeness of\n70.63%, representing an improvement of 25.56% over direct image generation. In\ntests of semantic correctness, our method attains an average semantic\nconsistency of 80.09%. The study not only promotes the dissemination of ancient\npoetry culture but also offers a reference for similar non-fine-tuning methods\nto enhance LLM generation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
