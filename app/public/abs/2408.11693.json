In this work, we use coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian direct numerical\nsimulations of a turbulent channel flow to demonstrate that under conditions of\nturbulent mixed convection, interactions between motions associated with\nejections and low-speed streaks near the solid boundary, and coherent\nsuperstructures in the interior of the flow interact and lead to significant\nvertical transport of strongly settling Lagrangian particles. We show that the\nprimary suspension mechanism is associated with strong ejection events\n(canonical low-speed streaks and hairpin vortices characterized by $u'<0$ and\n$w'>0$), whereas secondary suspension is strongly associated with large scale\nplume structures aligned with the mean shear (characterized by $w'>0$ and\n$\\theta'>0$). This coupling, which is absent in the limiting cases (pure\nchannel flow or free convection) is shown to lead to a sudden increase in the\ninterior concentration profiles as $\\mathrm{Ri}_\\tau$ increases, resulting in\nconcentrations that are larger by roughly an order of magnitude at the channel\nmidplane.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qioxo8YSVdgq4z5ZGW4KSFWO0J5VVQhSuzpcLjQ3DFg","pdfSize":"6743383"}
