We study the effects of\nrelic neutrinos with refractive masses on structure formation in the Universe.\nIn the model with a light fermionic mediator, above the resonance energy,\n$E_R$, associated with the mass of the mediator, refractive masses have all the\nproperties identical to the usual vacuum masses. Below the resonance,\nrefractive masses decrease with neutrino energy, however, they cannot be used\nin the same way as usual masses. We study the dispersion relations and group\nvelocities of such neutrinos and their dependence on redshift. We show that in\nthe epoch of structure formation, relic neutrinos were ultrarelativistic and\nessentially massless particles for $E_R = (10 - 10^5)\\,$eV. This allows to\nreconcile the values of masses extracted from oscillation experiments with the\nstringent bounds on sum of neutrino masses from cosmological surveys.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xDzFqfZaJxyXggRZzgcAPW91DBFw7TvlKGQxLc7HhaY","pdfSize":"595054","objectId":"0xd819af7bd08ed33c40ce0d9b7e9e2496bb16498b79c2c78771924fc4e9e95035","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
