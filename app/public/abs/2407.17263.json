It features two\nindependently controlled gates and operates in four distinct modes, offering\nflexibility in managing current and voltage in the first and third quadrants.\nThis versatility makes it ideal for various power conversion system\napplications. The device operates at a low negative threshold voltage (~-2.4 V\nfor both gates) with a zero turn-on drain voltage and an on-resistance of\napproximately 500 ohm-mm. It exhibits a high on/off current ratio of 1e7 in all\nthree conducting modes. In the blocking mode, the device breakdown was measured\nto be more than +-350 V with a current compliance of 0.5 mA/mm. The estimated\nbreakdown field and power figure of merit for the device are 0.35 MV/cm and 1.6\nMW/cm2 respectively.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DYfhgpai3easQHA1oDw2M6fdfIcCKIuCztuTzfvLkqY","pdfSize":"2850125","objectId":"0xfe7a035513d2265fea0237673d8092f588892821bcc0a71021cc185a59e88ad8","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
