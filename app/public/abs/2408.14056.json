This study is a\ncontinuation of our previous work (arXiv:2307.12350v3), in which we numerically\nidentified the presence of chaos for a classical string hovering near generic\np-branes ($p < 7$). Here, for a particle probe, we have found evidence of chaos\nin the vicinity of the horizon. Furthermore, we observed a violation of the\nwell-known MSS bound in specific extremal p-branes; however, no such violation\nis seen in the non-extremal cases. Similar observations were made for the\nclassical string, where the violation of the bound is significant near the\nhorizon. Thus, our semi-analytical arguments demonstrate that chaotic dynamics\nin black p-branes exhibit the (generalized) universal bound with notable\nviolations, regardless of whether a particle or classical string is used as a\nprobe.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
