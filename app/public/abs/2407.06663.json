In this work we\ncompare the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with multi-stage\nquantum walks (MSQW). Both can be used as variational quantum algorithms, where\nthe control parameters are optimized classically. A fair comparison requires\nboth quantum and classical resources to be assessed. Alternatively, parameters\ncan be chosen heuristically, as we do in this work, providing a simpler setting\nfor comparisons. Using both numerical and analytical methods, we obtain\nevidence that MSQW outperforms QAOA, using equivalent resources. We also show\nnumerically for random spin glass ground state problems that MSQW performs well\neven for few stages and heuristic parameters, with no classical optimization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
