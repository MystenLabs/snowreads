Our approach does not rely on explicitly\nrepresenting the equation of state in the density range $\\sim 2-40 n_0$, and\ndoes not require probabilistic interpretations. The upper limit decreases\nrapidly when the maximum mass of neutron stars is greater than about\n$2.5M_\\odot$. Discovery of $\\sim 3 M_\\odot$ neutron stars would strongly\nsupport first-order phase transitions at high baryon densities\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
