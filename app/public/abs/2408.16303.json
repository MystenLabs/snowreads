Typically, we use\nconvolutional neural networks to directly learn the mapping from low-quality\nimages to high-quality images achieving image restoration. Recently, a special\ntype of diffusion bridge model has achieved more advanced results in image\nrestoration. It can transform the direct mapping from low-quality to\nhigh-quality images into a diffusion process, restoring low-quality images\nthrough a reverse process. However, the current diffusion bridge restoration\nmodels do not emphasize the idea of conditional control, which may affect\nperformance. This paper introduces the ECDB model enhancing the control of the\ndiffusion bridge with low-quality images as conditions. Moreover, in response\nto the characteristic of diffusion models having low denoising level at larger\nvalues of \\(\\bm t \\), we also propose a Conditional Fusion Schedule, which more\neffectively handles the conditional feature information of various modules.\nExperimental results prove that the ECDB model has achieved state-of-the-art\nresults in many image restoration tasks, including deraining, inpainting and\nsuper-resolution.
