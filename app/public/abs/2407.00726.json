Let G be a semisimple simply connected linear algebraic group over F\nof type An. We give a description of the obstruction to local global principle\nfor principal homogeneous spaces under G over F with respect to discrete\nvaluations of F in terms of R-equivalence classes of G over some suitable over\nfields. Using this description we prove that this obstruction vanishes under\nsome conditions on the residue field K.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kPPWaOq8-9tTRLRtIEM2CojcUcKDBtrREm6kqunNXPI","pdfSize":"415429"}
