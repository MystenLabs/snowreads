The key advantage\nof this method stems from the nonlinear nature of the dynamical equation that\ngenerates massless poles in the longitudinal sector of the three-gluon vertex.\nAn exceptional feature of this approach is an extensive cancellation involving\nthe components of the integral expression that determines the gluon mass; it is\ntriggered once the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the pole-free part of the\nthree-gluon vertex has been appropriately exploited. It turns out that this\ncancellation is driven by the so-called Fredholm alternatives theorem, which\noperates among the set of integral equations describing this system. Quite\nremarkably, in the linearized approximation this theorem enforces the exact\nmasslessness of the gluon. Instead, the nonlinearity induced by the full\ntreatment of the relevant kernel evades this theorem, allowing for the\nemergence of a nonvanishing mass. The numerical results obtained from the\nresulting equations are compatible with the lattice findings, and may be\nfurther refined through the inclusion of the remaining fundamental vertices of\nthe theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qS2QlVe5uLXb3WqXfHrQFuBeEpeUt5vzsgqCVww_hfI","pdfSize":"2881404"}
