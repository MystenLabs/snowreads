However, a significant computational\nbottleneck arises from the necessity of calculating the fractional derivatives\nof the residual function within the coefficient determination process. The\nLaplace Residual Power Series Method (LRPSM) partially addresses this by\nemploying the Laplace transform. However, it introduces additional complexities\nand requires the computation of the residual error function at each iteration.\nThis work presents a novel approach that directly derives explicit formulas for\nthe coefficients, Bypassing the need for iterative residual error function\ncalculations. This advancement significantly enhances the computational\nefficiency of the method compared to both RPS method and LRPS method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
