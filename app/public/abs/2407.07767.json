In the discrete case\nwe find it necessary and sufficient that perturbing functions are $p$-summable\nin order to ensure paths of the discrete equation are $p$-summable almost\nsurely, while in the continuous case it transpires one can have almost surely\n$p$-integrable sample paths even with non-integrable perturbation functions.\nFor the continuous equation the main converse is clinched by considering an\nappropriate discretisation and applying results from the discrete case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
