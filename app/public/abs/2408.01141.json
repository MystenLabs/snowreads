However, there is still a lack of relevant research on\nnon-Bloch energy braiding in non-Hermitian systems. In this work, we study\nnon-Bloch energy braiding in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems using\nunsupervised and supervised methods. In unsupervised learning, we use diffusion\nmaps to successfully identify non-Bloch energy braiding without any prior\nknowledge and combine it with k-means to cluster different topological elements\ninto clusters, such as Unlink and Hopf link. In supervised learning, we train a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Bloch energy data to predict not\nonly Bloch energy braiding but also non-Bloch energy braiding with an accuracy\napproaching 100%. By analysing the CNN, we can ascertain that the network has\nsuccessfully acquired the ability to recognise the braiding topology of the\nenergy bands. The present study demonstrates the considerable potential of\nmachine learning in the identification of non-Hermitian topological phases and\nenergy braiding.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
