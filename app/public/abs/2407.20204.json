We exhibit the first examples of\nconstant-cost problems which cannot be reduced to $k$-Hamming Distance.\n  To prove this separation, we relate it to a natural coding-theoretic\nquestion. For $f : \\{2, 4, 6\\} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, we say an encoding function $E\n: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\to \\{0, 1\\}^m$ is an $f$-code if it transforms Hamming distances\naccording to $\\mathrm{dist}(E(x), E(y)) = f(\\mathrm{dist}(x, y))$ whenever $f$\nis defined. We prove that, if there exist $f$-codes for infinitely many $n$,\nthen $f$ must be affine: $f(4) = (f(2) + f(6))/2$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
