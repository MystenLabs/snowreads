However, causal relationships are\ndifficult to be fully observed in real-world complex settings, such as\nspatial-temporal data from deployed sensor networks. Therefore, to capture\nfine-grained causal relations among spatial-temporal variables for further a\nmore accurate and reliable time series analysis, we first design a conceptual\nfine-grained causal model named TBN Granger Causality, which adds\ntime-respecting Bayesian Networks to the previous time-lagged Neural Granger\nCausality to offset the instantaneous effects. Second, we propose an end-to-end\ndeep generative model called TacSas, which discovers TBN Granger Causality in a\ngenerative manner to help forecast time series data and detect possible\nanomalies during the forecast. For evaluations, besides the causality discovery\nbenchmark Lorenz-96, we also test TacSas on climate benchmark ERA5 for climate\nforecasting and the extreme weather benchmark of NOAA for extreme weather\nalerts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
