The approach incorporates\ninhomogeneous velocity without unphysical approximations, resulting in a\nLagrangian where the order of fractional derivatives measures time intervals.\nThe fractional term in the Lagrangian provides correct Euler-Lagrange, and\nultimately, the Hamilton equations, and vanishes during energy change\nmeasurements, like a ghost.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
