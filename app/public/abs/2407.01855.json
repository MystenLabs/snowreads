For the case of\ncoupling to a single quantum dipole, we identify the form of the spectral\ndensity, revealing a $\\sim \\omega^{-1}$ prefactor scaling, as well as a\nspatially-dependent contribution. We thus establish the correct quantum form\nfor the cavity-reservoir interaction and show its significant impact on\nbroadband strong coupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
