Furthermore, the\ncombination of FL and anomaly detection is particularly compelling because it\nallows for detecting rare and critical anomalies (usually also rare in locally\ngathered data) in sensitive data from multiple sources, such as cybersecurity\nand healthcare. However, benchmarking the performance of anomaly detection\nmethods in FL environments remains an underexplored area. This paper introduces\nFedAD-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating unsupervised anomaly detection\nalgorithms within the context of FL. We systematically analyze and compare the\nperformance of recent deep learning anomaly detection models under federated\nsettings, which were typically assessed solely in centralized settings.\nFedAD-Bench encompasses diverse datasets and metrics to provide a holistic\nevaluation. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges such as\nmodel aggregation inefficiencies and metric unreliability. We present insights\ninto FL's regularization effects, revealing scenarios in which it outperforms\ncentralized approaches due to its inherent ability to mitigate overfitting. Our\nwork aims to establish a standardized benchmark to guide future research and\ndevelopment in federated anomaly detection, promoting reproducibility and fair\ncomparison across studies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qZLlfxZS87pRgZaFF5LZJTfiWYH1SFF0bSsH42-1KxU","pdfSize":"684306"}
