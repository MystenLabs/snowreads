We have shown that the correspondence between grey-body factors and\nquasinormal modes, previously established for spherically symmetric and\nasymptotically flat black holes, also extends to general parametrized axially\nsymmetric black holes. This correspondence is limited to non-superradiant\nwaves.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
