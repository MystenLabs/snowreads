This\nrequires decomposing the E2E SLA into partial SLAs for each domain. In a\ntwo-level network slicing management system with an E2E orchestrator and local\ncontrollers, we propose an online learning-decomposition framework that\ndynamically updates risk models using recent feedback. This approach utilizes\nonline gradient descent and FIFO memory buffers to enhance stability and\nrobustness. Our empirical study shows the proposed framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art static methods, offering more accurate and resilient SLA\ndecomposition under varying conditions and sparse data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
