Across\n$a_{dS}$, $J$ parametrizes short-period galaxy rotation curves and fast\ngravitational collapse beyond the predictions of $\\Lambda$CDM. The sensitivity\nof weak gravitation to $J=\\frac{1}{6}R$ is derived in infrared gravitation from\na consistent limit of quantum gravity, reducing to general relativity in the\nlimit of a small Planck constant, where $R$ is Ricci scalar tensor. For the\nfirst time, it identifies the exact relation $a_0=c^2\\sqrt{J}/2\\pi$ of the\nMilgrom parameter across all redshifts, accounting for the bTFR and early\ngalaxy formation accelerated by a factor $\\sim J^{1/8}$. It predicts\n$a_0^\\prime(0)<0$ at the present epoch.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
