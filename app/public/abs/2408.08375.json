Thus, two orthogonally polarized pumps can produce\npolarization-entangled photon pairs through a mm-long homogeneous plasma. The\nnoise from Raman scattering can be avoided if the pump detuning differs from\ntwice the plasma frequency. On the other hand, pump detuning exactly equal to\ntwice the plasma frequency can significantly enhance the interaction rate,\nwhich allows for the production of two-mode squeezed states. Remarkably, the\namplified noise from Raman scattering are correlated and hence can be\nsuppressed in one of the output quadratures, thereby maintaining the squeezing\nmagnitude.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
