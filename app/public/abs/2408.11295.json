The channel model is essential for an ISAC\nsystem to evaluate the communication and sensing performance. Most existing\nchannel modeling studies focus on the monostatic ISAC channel. In this paper,\nthe channel modeling framework for bistatic ISAC is considered. The proposed\nchannel modeling framework extends the current 3GPP channel modeling framework\nand ensures the compatibility with the communication channel model. To support\nthe bistatic sensing function, several key features for sensing are added.\nFirst, more clusters with weaker power are generated and retained to\ncharacterize the potential sensing targets. Second, the target model can be\neither deterministic or statistical, based on different sensing scenarios.\nFurthermore, for the statistical case, different reflection models are employed\nin the generation of rays, taking into account spatial coherence. The\neffectiveness of the proposed bistatic ISAC channel model framework is\nvalidated by both ray tracing simulations and experiment studies. The\ncompatibility with the 3GPP communication channel model and how to use this\nframework for sensing evaluation are also demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
