The fusion of artificial intelligence technology with robot hardware\nis seeing broad application possibilities for MRS. This article surveys the\nstate-of-the-art of robot learning in the context of Multi-Robot Cooperation\n(MRC) of recent. Commonly adopted robot learning methods (or frameworks) that\nare inspired by humans and animals are reviewed and their advantages and\ndisadvantages are discussed along with the associated technical challenges. The\npotential trends of robot learning and MRS integration exploiting the merging\nof these methods with real-world applications is also discussed at length.\nSpecifically statistical methods are used to quantitatively corroborate the\nideas elaborated in the article.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2-hI_-0fo3CW0eSOaRQ7z-tkKs_8naTPXGI892aSZFA","pdfSize":"3487065"}
