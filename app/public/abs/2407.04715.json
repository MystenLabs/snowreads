This is done by\nconsidering a specific form of opto-electronic oscillator-based coherent Ising\nmachines with clipped transfer functions, and proposing appropriate\nmodifications to facilitate trust-region optimisation. The enhancements include\nthe inclusion of non-symmetric coupling and linear terms, modulation of noise,\nand compatibility with convex-projections to improve its convergence. The\nconvergence of the modified Ising machine has been shown under the reasonable\nassumptions of convexity or invexity. The mathematical structures of the\nmodified Ising machine and trust-region methods have been exploited to design a\nnew trust-region method to effectively solve unconstrained optimisation\nproblems in many scenarios, such as machine learning and optimisation of\nparameters in variational quantum algorithms. Hence, the proposition is useful\nfor both classical and quantum-classical hybrid scenarios. Finally, the\nconvergence of the Ising machine-based trust-region method, has also been\nproven analytically, establishing the feasibility of the technique.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"77EXoU-xcn7_WTp9mkwkfN9E_f40aZTu1oj28Bbi96g","pdfSize":"711520"}
