This phenomenon is\ncharacterized by a power-law scaling of $\\eta$ with the shear rate\n$\\dot{\\gamma}$, $\\eta \\propto \\dot{\\gamma}^{-\\nu}$, where the exponent $\\nu$ is\ntypically around $0.7$ to $0.8$ across different materials. Two decades ago,\nthe mode coupling theory (MCT) suggested that shear thinning occurs due to the\nadvection. However, it predicts too large $\\nu = 1$ (> $0.7$ to $0.8$) and\noverestimates the onset shear rate by orders of magnitude. Recently, it was\nclaimed that a minute distortion of the particle configuration is responsible\nfor shear thinning. Here we extend the MCT to include the distortion, and find\nthat both advection and distortion contribute to shear thinning, but the latter\nis dominant. Our formulation works quantitatively for several different glass\nformers. We explain why shear thinning is universal for many glassy materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
