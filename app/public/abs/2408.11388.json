Despite the\nexcessive applications of DFrFT, implementation of corresponding fractional\norders in the baseband signal often leads to bulky, power-hungry, and\nhigh-latency systems. In this paper, we present a passive metamaterial coupled\nlines network (MCLN) that performs the analog DFrFT in real-time at microwave\nfrequencies. The proposed MCLN consists of M parallel microstrip transmission\nlines (TLs) in which adjacent TLs are loaded with interdigital capacitors to\nenhance the coupling level. We show that with proper design of the coupling\ncoefficients between adjacent channels, the MCLN can perform an M-point DFrFT\nof an arbitrary fractional order that can be designed through the length of the\nnetwork. In the context of real-time signal processing for realization of\nDFrFT, we design, model, simulate and implement a 16x16 MCLN and experimentally\ndemonstrate the performance of the proposed structure. The proposed innovative\napproach is versatile and is capable to be used in various applications where\nDFrFT is an essential tool. The proposed design scheme based on MCLN is\nscalable across the frequency spectrum and can be applied to millimeter and\nsubmillimeter wave systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
