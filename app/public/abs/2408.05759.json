Proximity effects, where a neighbouring material is used to alter\nthe properties of a material in adjacent (or proximitized) regions, can also be\nused in graphene to generate and detect spins by acquiring spin-orbit coupling\nor magnetic exchange coupling. However, the development of seamless spintronic\ndevices that are based uniquely on proximity effects remains challenging. Here,\nwe report a two-dimensional graphene spin valve that is enabled by proximity to\nthe van der Waals magnet Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. Spin precession measurements show\nthat graphene acquires both spin-orbit coupling and magnetic exchange coupling\nwhen interfaced with the Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. This leads to spin generation by\nboth electrical spin injection and the spin Hall effect, while retaining\nlong-distance spin transport. The simultaneous presence of spin-orbit coupling\nand magnetic exchange coupling also leads to a sizeable anomalous Hall effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
