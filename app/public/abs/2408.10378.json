More\nspecifically, we first prove an FTISS Lyapunov theorem for a class of\ninfinite-dimensional systems, namely, the existence of an FTISS Lyapunov\nfunctional (FTISS-LF) implies the FTISS of the system, and then, provide a\nsufficient condition for ensuring the existence of an FTISS-LF for a class of\nabstract infinite-dimensional systems under the framework of compact semigroup\ntheory and Hilbert spaces. As an application of the FTISS Lyapunov theorem, we\nverify the FTISS for a class of parabolic PDEs involving sublinear terms and\ndistributed in-domain disturbances. Since the nonlinear terms of the\ncorresponding abstract system are not Lipschitz continuous, the well-posedness\nis proved based on the application of compact semigroup theory and the FTISS is\nassessed by using the Lyapunov method with the aid of an interpolation\ninequality. Numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the theoretical\nresults.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ugzd__y-1_CA3ntNzIpSTO6oquP_HuLldttsMdcB_ak","pdfSize":"601849"}
