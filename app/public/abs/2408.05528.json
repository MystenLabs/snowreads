Here, we use machine learning methods to accelerate\nmolecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy for the\nglass-former toluene. We show that the increase in viscosity is intimately\nlinked to the increasing number of dynamically correlated molecules $N^*$.\nWhile certain hallmark features of glassy dynamics, like physical aging, are\nlinked to $N^*$ as well, others, like relaxation stretching, are not.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
