This repeated evaluation of frequency data\nrequires repeated full model computations and may not be feasible. The\ndata-informativity framework for moment matching provides a method for\nobtaining such frequency data from a single time-domain simulation. However,\nthis framework usually requires solving linear systems with prohibitively\nill-conditioned matrices, especially when recovering frequency data from off\nthe unit circle as required for optimality. In this paper, building upon our\nprevious work with the data informativity framework for moment matching, we\nprovide a formula for the nonzero extreme eigenvalues of a symmetric rank-$1$\nperturbation to an orthogonal projection, which then leads to an optimal\nscaling of the aforementioned linear systems. We also establish connections\nbetween the underlying dynamical system and conditioning of these linear\nsystems. This analysis then leads to our algorithmic development, time-domain\nIRKA, which allows us to implement a time-domain variant of TF-IRKA,\nconstructing $\\mathcal H_2$ optimal DDROMs from a single time-domain simulation\nwithout requiring repeated frequency data evaluations. The numerical examples\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
