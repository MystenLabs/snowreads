We introduce SQL-GEN, a framework for generating high-quality\ndialect-specific synthetic data guided by dialect-specific tutorials, and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in creating training datasets for multiple\ndialects. Our approach significantly improves performance, by up to 20\\%, over\nprevious methods and reduces the gap with large-scale human-annotated datasets.\nMoreover, combining our synthetic data with human-annotated data provides\nadditional performance boosts of 3.3\\% to 5.6\\%. We also introduce a novel\nMixture of Experts (MoE) initialization method that integrates dialect-specific\nmodels into a unified system by merging self-attention layers and initializing\nthe gates with dialect-specific keywords, further enhancing performance across\ndifferent SQL dialects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
