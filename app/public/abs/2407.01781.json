Furthermore, fVDB can process datasets with much larger footprint and\nspatial resolution than prior works, while providing a competitive memory\nfootprint on small inputs. To achieve this combination of versatility and\nperformance, fVDB relies on a single novel VDB index grid acceleration\nstructure paired with several key innovations including GPU accelerated sparse\ngrid construction, convolution using tensorcores, fast ray tracing kernels\nusing a Hierarchical Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm (HDDA), and jagged\ntensors.\n  Our framework is fully integrated with PyTorch enabling interoperability with\nexisting pipelines, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of\nrepresentative tasks such as large-scale point-cloud segmentation, high\nresolution 3D generative modeling, unbounded scale Neural Radiance Fields, and\nlarge-scale point cloud reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
