We focus on adapting Mistral-7B\nto German or Arabic and evaluate several techniques to improve efficiency and\neffectiveness in this setting. Our German models adapted on this tight compute\nbudget underperform compared to the base Mistral-7B, while our Arabic models\noutperform several baselines, showing that for sufficiently well-represented\nlanguages, continued pretraining for specialization is not always helpful. Our\nmain findings focus on training precision and tokenizer swapping. Our results\nshow that pure bfloat16 training is a viable alternative to mixed-precision\ntraining, while being much faster when only using a few GPUs. Swapping the\ntokenizer for a specialized one yields more efficient tokenization and is\ncompetitive with the original tokenizer, which already contains some German\ntokens, but did not significantly increase performance for German. Code and\nmodel weights are available at on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
