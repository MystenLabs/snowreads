Specifically, we address loop\ncorrections to the primordial power spectrum, relative to tree-level, that are\nindependent of the ratio between the two scales. We review all the necessary\ncomponents, adapted to our context, to express one-loop diagrams as three-point\nfunctions, emphasizing the crucial role played by quartic interactions.\nNotably, we include the quartic Hamiltonian induced by the cubic Lagrangian and\nquartic interactions that are ensured by diffeomorphism invariance. We then\nexplicitly prove consistency relations for an arbitrary transient non-slow-roll\nphase involving operators with (time) derivatives. Finally, we calculate\none-loop corrections by including contributions from the relevant cubic and\nquartic interactions, and express the final result as a total derivative term\nover comoving momenta, utilizing the consistency relations we established. This\nleads us to conclude that one-loop corrections to long-wavelength modes are\nunaffected by the physics of short and enhanced modes in non-slow-roll\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
