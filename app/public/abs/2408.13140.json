The proposed method computes provably sound piecewise linear\nconstraints for the pixel values by using sampling and linear approximations in\ncombination with branch-and-bound Lipschitz optimisation. The method obtains\nprovably tighter over-approximations of the perturbation region than the\npresent state-of-the-art. We report results from experiments on a comprehensive\nset of verification benchmarks on MNIST and CIFAR10. We show that our proposed\nimplementation resolves up to 32% more verification cases than present\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
