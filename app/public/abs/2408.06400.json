While much of the optimization effort is\nfocused on training curriculum to extend forecast range in the global context,\ntwo aspects remains less explored: limited area modeling and better backbones\nfor weather forecasting. We show in this paper that MetMamba, a DLWP model\nbuilt on a state-of-the-art state-space model, Mamba, offers notable\nperformance gains and unique advantages over other popular backbones using\ntraditional attention mechanisms and neural operators. We also demonstrate the\nfeasibility of deep learning based limited area modeling via coupled training\nwith a global host model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
