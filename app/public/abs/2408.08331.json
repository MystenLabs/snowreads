This is not\nonly due to the popularity of the sport and the joy of private \"betting\nrounds\", but also due to the large sports betting market. Where previously\nexpert knowledge and intuition were used, today there are models that analyze\nlarge amounts of data and make predictions based on them. In addition to\nPoisson models, approaches that belong to the machine learning (ML) category\nare increasingly being used. These include, for example, neural network or\nrandom forest models, which are compared in this article with each other as\nwell as with Poisson models with regard to single-match prediction. In each\ncase, the match results of a season are used as the data basis. The analysis is\ncarried out for 5 European top leagues. A statistical analysis shows that the\nperformance levels of the teams do not change systematically during a season.\nIn order to characterize performance levels as accurately as possible, all\nmatch results, except from the match to be predicted, can be used as features\nwith equal weighting. It can be seen that both, the exact choice of features\nand the choice of model, have only a minor influence on the prediction quality.\nPossible improvements in match prediction are discussed.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
