This work is a building block for the National Data Platform,\nwhich leverages multiple use-cases including the WIFIRE Data and Model Commons\nfor wildfire behavior modeling and the EarthScope Consortium for collaborative\ngeophysical research. This paper presents an artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning (AI/ML) approach to performance assessment and optimization of\nscientific workflows. An associated early AI/ML framework spanning performance\ndata collection, prediction and optimization is applied to wildfire science\napplications within the WIFIRE BurnPro3D (BP3D) platform for proactive fire\nmanagement and mitigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
