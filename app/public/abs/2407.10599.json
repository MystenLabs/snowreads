Due to distinct data structures, the fusion process\ntends to encounter technical difficulties in terms of preservation of the\nintactness of each source data. Furthermore, a lack of generalized methods is a\nproblem when the method is expected to be applicable in multiple resolutions,\nsizes, or scales of raster and vector data, to what is being processed. In this\nstudy, we propose a general algorithm of assigning features from raster data\n(concentrations of air pollutants) to vector components (roads represented by\nedges) in city maps through the iterative construction of virtual layers to\nexpand geolocation from a city centre to boundaries in a 2D projected map. The\nconstruction follows the rule of perfect squares with a slight difference\ndepending on the oddness or evenness of the ratio of city size to raster\nresolution. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to assign accurate\nPM$_{2.5}$ and NO$_{2}$ concentrations to roads in 1692 cities globally for a\npotential graph-based pollution analysis. This method could pave the way for\nagile studies on urgent climate issues by providing a generic and efficient\nmethod to accurately fuse multiple datasets of varying scales and compositions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
