In this work, we revisit the derivation of\nhydrostatic mass of GCs within modified emergent Newtonian gravity (MENG) with\ngeneralized uncertainty principle (GUP) correction. We also derive the\nhydrostatic mass of GCs within Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory,\nand beyond Horndeski gravity (BHG). We apply the formulations on the masses of\n10 GCs. We compare our results with the Newtonian mass of GCs. For a regime, we\nget an insight that all formulations could match the Newtonian mass. Thus, the\nimpact of the modified theories of gravity used in this work can be neglected\nin this regime. The noteworthy impact starts if we set\n$\\beta_0=-1.656\\times10^{110}$ for MENG, $\\kappa=5\\times10^{40}$ for EiBI\ntheory, and $\\Upsilon=-0,1655\\times10^{69}$ for BHG. We also compare our\nresults with the GCs' baryonic masses $M_{bar}$. In this comparison, only the\nMENG formulation with $\\beta_{0}=2.70\\times 10^{115}$ produces the best linear\nfit with the slope $\\frac{M_{MENG}}{M_{bar}}=0.755\\pm0.061$. This means that in\nthis work, MENG is the best theory of gravity that alleviates the mass\ndiscrepancy of hydrostatic mass and baryonic mass of GCs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
