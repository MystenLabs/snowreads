Blockchain technology is currently considered a valuable aid in the\ntransition to a circular economy. Its decentralized and tamper-resistant nature\nenables the construction of transparent and secure supply chain management\nsystems, thereby improving product accountability and traceability. However,\nthe full potential of blockchain technology in circular economy models will not\nbe realized until a number of concerns, including scalability,\ninteroperability, data protection, and regulatory and legal issues, are\naddressed. More research and stakeholder participation are required to overcome\nthese limitations and achieve the benefits of blockchain technology in\npromoting a circular economy. This article presents a systematic literature\nreview (SLR) that identified industry use cases for blockchain-driven circular\neconomy models and offered architectures to minimize resource consumption,\nprices, and inefficiencies while encouraging the reuse, recycling, and recovery\nof end-of-life products. Three main outcomes emerged from our review of 41\ndocuments, which included scholarly publications, Twitter-linked information,\nand Google results. The relationship between blockchain and the 4R framework\nfor circular economy; discussion the terminology and various forms of\nblockchain and circular economy; and identification of the challenges and\nobstacles that blockchain technology may face in enabling a circular economy.\nThis research shows how blockchain technology can help with the transition to a\ncircular economy. Yet, it emphasizes the importance of additional study and\nstakeholder participation to overcome potential hurdles and obstacles in\nimplementing blockchain-driven circular economy models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
