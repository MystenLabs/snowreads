In transportation, we are seeing a surge in spatiotemporal data\ncollection. At the same time, concerns over user privacy have led to research\non differential privacy in applied settings. In this paper, we look at some\nrecent developments in differential privacy in the context of spatiotemporal\ndata. Spatiotemporal data contain not only features about users but also the\ngeographical locations of their frequent visits. Hence, the public release of\nsuch data carries extreme risks. To address the need for such data in research\nand inference without exposing private information, significant work has been\nproposed. This survey paper aims to summarize these efforts and provide a\nreview of differential privacy mechanisms and related software. We also discuss\nrelated work in transportation where such mechanisms have been applied.\nFurthermore, we address the challenges in the deployment and mass adoption of\ndifferential privacy in transportation spatiotemporal data for downstream\nanalyses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
