We find there is a curious discontinuity\nbetween the neutral and charged scalar. The Love numbers vanish for the neutral\nscalar, but are inversely proportional to the electric charge of the scalar in\nthe small charge limit. We study the near-zone of the dynamical equation with\nnon-vanishing frequency $\\omega$, and show that the system have an\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ Love-like symmetry. The symmetry selects a special frequency\n$\\omega_{\\rm cr}$, which vanishes in the neutral case, so that the real part of\nthe response coefficient vanishes identically. We also generalize the results\ninto higher dimensions to some extend.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
