This approach\nallows us to understand the limiting behaviour of the coefficients\n$\\widetilde{\\mathsf{e}}_k(p_d)$ of $p_d$ when the degree $d$ tends to infinity\nand the empirical root distribution of $p_d$ has a limiting distribution $\\mu$\non $[0,\\infty)$. Specifically, we relate the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio\nof consecutive coefficients to Voiculescu's $S$-transform of $\\mu$. This\nprompts us to define a new notion of finite $S$-transform, which converges to\nVoiculescu's $S$-transform in the large $d$ limit. It also satisfies several\nanalogous properties to those of the $S$-transform in free probability,\nincluding multiplicativity and monotonicity. This new insight has several\napplications that strengthen the connection between free and finite free\nprobability. Most notably, we generalize the approximation of $\\boxtimes_d$ to\n$\\boxtimes$ and prove a finite approximation of the Tucci--Haagerup--M\\\"oller\nlimit theorem in free probability, conjectured by two of the authors. We also\nprovide finite analogues of the free multiplicative Poisson law, the free\nmax-convolution powers and some free stable laws.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
