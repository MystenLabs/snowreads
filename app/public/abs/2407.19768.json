Previous methods typically employ an encoder-decoder\nstructure to extract facial structural features, where the direct downsampling\ninevitably introduces distortions, especially to high-frequency features such\nas edges. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet-based feature enhancement\nnetwork, which mitigates feature distortion by losslessly decomposing the input\nfeature into high and low-frequency components using the wavelet transform and\nprocessing them separately. To improve the efficiency of facial feature\nextraction, a full domain Transformer is further proposed to enhance local,\nregional, and global facial features. Such designs allow our method to perform\nbetter without stacking many modules as previous methods did. Experiments show\nthat our method effectively balances performance, model size, and speed.
