The healthcare supply chain involves various stakeholders who\nmust share information securely and actively. Regulatory and compliance\nreporting is also another crucial requirement for perishable products (e.g.,\npharmaceuticals) within a medical supply chain management system. Here, we\npropose Multi-MedChain as a three-layer multi-party, multi-blockchain (MPMB)\nframework utilizing smart contracts as a practical solution to address\nchallenges in existing medical supply chain management systems. Multi-MedChain\nis a scalable supply chain management system for the healthcare domain that\naddresses end-to-end traceability, transparency, and collaborative access\ncontrol to restrict access to private data. We have implemented our proposed\nsystem and report on our evaluation to highlight the practicality of the\nsolution. The proposed solution is made publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZYS9KhNswAtgqT0xI3AfBd2UVi_VyB7bhq7WMpGLA3s","pdfSize":"1142558"}
