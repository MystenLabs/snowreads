The max-atom-problem (MAP) deals with system of\nscalar inequalities (called atoms or max-atom) of the form: $x \\leq a +\n\\max(y,z)$. Where $a$ is a real number and $x,y$ and $z$ belong to the set of\nthe variables of the whole MAP. A max-atom is said to be positive if its scalar\n$a$ is $\\geq 0$ and stricly negative if its scalar $a <0$. A MAP will be said\nto be positive if all atoms are positive. In the case of non positive MAP we\npresent a saturation principle for system of vectorial inequalities of the form\n$x \\leq A x + b$ in the so-called $(\\max,+)$-algebra assuming some properties\non the matrix $A$. Then, we apply such principle to explore all non-trivial\nsolutions (ie $\\neq -\\infty$). We deduce a strongly polynomial method to\nexpress all solutions of a non positive MAP. In the case a positive MAP which\nhas always the vector $x^{1}=(0)$ as trivial solution we show that looking for\nall solutions requires the enumeration of all elementary circuits in a graph\nassociated with the MAP. However, we propose a strongly polynomial method wich\nprovides some non trivial solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
