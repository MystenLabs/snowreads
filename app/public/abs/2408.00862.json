We study the dependence of the\nanalog Unruh effect on the precise form of the velocity profile, finding that\nwhile the ideal Unruh effect occurs for $v(x) \\propto |x|$, a modified Unruh\neffect still occurs for more realistic velocity profiles that are linear for\n$|x|$ smaller than a length scale $\\lambda$ and constant for $|x|\\gg \\lambda$\n(such as $v(x)\\propto \\tanh \\big(|x|/\\lambda \\big)$). We show that the\nassociated particle creation is localized to $|x|\\ll \\lambda$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
