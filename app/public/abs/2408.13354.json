While the VO$_2$ transition has been extensively studied for\nseveral decades, the hysteresis dynamics of individual single-crystal VO$_2$\nnanoparticles (NPs) remains largely unexplored. Here, employing transmission\nelectron microscopy techniques, we investigate phase transitions of single\nVO$_2$ NPs in real time. Our analysis reveals the statistical distribution of\nthe transition temperature and steepness and how they differ during forward\n(heating) and backward (cooling) transitions. We assess the stability of\ncoexisting phases in individual NPs and prove the persistent multilevel memory\nat near-room temperatures using only a few VO$_2$ NPs. Our findings shed new\nlight on the underlying physical mechanisms governing the hysteresis of VO$_2$\nand establish VO$_2$ NPs as a promising component of optoelectronic and memory\ndevices with enhanced functionalities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
