We\ncalculate the two-loop QCD corrections to $H\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi(\\Upsilon)+\\gamma$ using an optimized nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD)\napproach. We compute the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ correction in the direct\nchannel, where Higgs directly couples to $c\\bar{c}$, as well as the ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha_s)$ correction in the indirect channel, {\\it viz.},\n$H\\to\\gamma^*\\gamma$ followed by the virtual photon fragmentation into\n$J/\\psi$. Incorporating the destructive interference between the direct and\nindirect channels, we present to date the most accurate predictions for Higgs\nboson radiative decay into vector quarkonium, $\\mathcal{B}(H\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi+\\gamma) = 3.27_{-0.07}^{+0.30}{}^{+0.06}_{-0.06}{}_{-0.13}^{+0.13}\\times\n10^{-6}$, and $\\mathcal{B}(H\\rightarrow \\Upsilon+\\gamma)=\n1.34_{-0.31}^{+0.75}{}^{+0.25}_{-0.20}{}^{+0.05}_{-0.05}\\times 10^{-8}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
