Our approach leverages a neural\nSigned Distance Field (SDF) to model intricate environment details and\nincorporates this representation as inequality constraints within a Quadratic\nProgram (QP) to coordinate robot joint and base motion. A key contribution is\nthe introduction of an active collision avoidance cost term that maximises the\ntotal robot distance to obstacles during the motion. We first evaluate our\napproach in a simulated reaching task, outperforming previous methods that rely\non representing both the robot and the scene as a set of primitive geometries.\nCompared with the baseline, we improved the task success rate by 25% in total,\nwhich includes increases of 10% by using the active collision cost. We also\ndemonstrate our approach on a real-world platform, showing its effectiveness in\nreaching target poses in cluttered and confined spaces using environment models\nbuilt directly from sensor data.
