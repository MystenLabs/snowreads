The adaptive setup allows us to better\nexploit the power of the stereographic projection, even when the target\ndistribution is neither centered nor homogeneous. We present a simulation study\nshowing each algorithm's robustness to starting far from the mean in heavy\ntailed, high dimensional settings, as opposed to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).\nWe establish a novel framework for proving convergence of adaptive MCMC\nalgorithms over collections of simultaneously uniformly ergodic Markov\noperators, including continuous time processes. This framework allows us to\nprove LLNs and a CLT for our adaptive Stereographic algorithms.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
