One of these algorithms,\ntransition path sampling, has become a standard technique to study such rare\nprocesses since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most\nTPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a\npoint along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then\n``shooting'' a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In\nsome procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial\nmove, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so\nthat successive shooting points are related to each other. We provide an\nextended detailed balance criterion for shooting methods. We affirm detailed\nbalance for most TPS methods, but the new criteria reveals the need for amended\nacceptance criteria in the flexible length aimless shooting and spring shooting\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
