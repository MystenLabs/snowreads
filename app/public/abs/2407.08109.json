Recent advances employ surveillance camera imagery and\ndeep learning for detection, yet these struggle amidst scarce data and adverse\nenvironmental conditions. In this paper, we establish a challenging Urban\nWaterlogging Benchmark (UW-Bench) under diverse adverse conditions to advance\nreal-world applications. We propose a Large-Small Model co-adapter paradigm\n(LSM-adapter), which harnesses the substantial generic segmentation potential\nof large model and the specific task-directed guidance of small model.\nSpecifically, a Triple-S Prompt Adapter module alongside a Dynamic Prompt\nCombiner are proposed to generate then merge multiple prompts for mask decoder\nadaptation. Meanwhile, a Histogram Equalization Adap-ter module is designed to\ninfuse the image specific information for image encoder adaptation. Results and\nanalysis show the challenge and superiority of our developed benchmark and\nalgorithm.
