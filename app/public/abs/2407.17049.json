Due to the\nalternating current(AC) stark shifts effect, intensity difference of traps will\ncause different light shift. So, the optimization of intensity equalization is\nvery important in many-body system consist of single atoms. Here we report a\nwork on studying of intensity equalization algorithm. Through this algorithm,\nthe uniformity of tweezer can exceed 96% when the number of tweezer size is\nbigger than 1000. Our analysis shows that further uniformity requires further\noptimization of optical system. The realization of the intensity equalization\nalgorithm is of great significance to the many-body experiments based on single\natom array.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"s7Wud9KgX15F4j6pcFeDqLLG6TyHfZKdx-CcHUHZJR8","pdfSize":"11948638"}
