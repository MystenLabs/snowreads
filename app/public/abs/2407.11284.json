However, most existing approaches require\nhistogram binning while many theoretical predictions are at the level of\nstatistical moments. We develop a new approach to directly unfold distribution\nmoments as a function of another observable without having to first discretize\nthe data. Our Moment Unfolding technique uses machine learning and is inspired\nby Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We demonstrate the performance of\nthis approach using jet substructure measurements in collider physics. With\nthis illustrative example, we find that our Moment Unfolding protocol is more\nprecise than bin-based approaches and is as or more precise than completely\nunbinned methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
