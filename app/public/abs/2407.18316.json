Despite their potential, no reinforcement learning framework\nincorporates human affect models as part of their observation space or reward\nmechanism. To address this, we present the \\emph{Affectively Framework}, a set\nof Open-AI Gym environments that integrate affect as part of the observation\nspace. This paper introduces the framework and its three game environments and\nprovides baseline experiments to validate its effectiveness and potential.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
