VoiceTailor identifies pivotal modules that benefit from\nthe adapter based on a weight change ratio analysis. We utilize Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient adaptation method and incorporate\nthe adapter into pivotal modules of the pre-trained diffusion decoder. To\nachieve powerful adaptation performance with few parameters, we explore various\nguidance techniques for speaker adaptation and investigate the best strategies\nto strengthen speaker information. VoiceTailor demonstrates comparable speaker\nadaptation performance to existing adaptive TTS models by fine-tuning only\n0.25\\% of the total parameters. VoiceTailor shows strong robustness when\nadapting to a wide range of real-world speakers, as shown in the demo.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
