Typically, a large number of projections are\nrequired to achieve a high-quality reconstruction, a process that can span\nseveral hours or days depending on the part size, material composition, and\ndesired resolution. This paper introduces a novel real-time system designed to\noptimize the scanning process by intelligently selecting the best next angle\nbased on the object's geometry and computer-aided design (CAD) model. This\nselection process strategically balances the need for measurements aligned with\nthe part's long edges against the need for maintaining a diverse set of overall\nmeasurements. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our algorithm\nsignificantly reduces the number of projections needed to achieve high-quality\nreconstructions compared to traditional methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mzwiVwtyUj8YLrlMYBRypxIEM587C0TD8lH0S_glVsg","pdfSize":"437780"}
