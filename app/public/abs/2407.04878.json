The proof uses the fact that\nthe space of Markovian randomized stopping times can be topologized as a\ncompact absolute retract, which in turn enables us to use a powerful\nfixed-point theorem by Eilenberg and Montgomery. We illustrate our results with\nan example of a war of attrition that admits a mixed-strategy Markov-perfect\nequilibrium but no pure-strategy Markov-perfect equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
