However, pseudo-labeling-based semi-supervised\napproaches suffer from two problems in image classification: (1) Existing\nmethods might fail to adopt suitable thresholds since they either use a\npre-defined/fixed threshold or an ad-hoc threshold adjusting scheme, resulting\nin inferior performance and slow convergence. (2) Discarding unlabeled data\nwith confidence below the thresholds results in the loss of discriminating\ninformation. To solve these issues, we develop an effective method to make\nsufficient use of unlabeled data. Specifically, we design a self adaptive\nthreshold pseudo-labeling strategy, which thresholds for each class can be\ndynamically adjusted to increase the number of reliable samples. Meanwhile, in\norder to effectively utilise unlabeled data with confidence below the\nthresholds, we propose an unreliable sample contrastive loss to mine the\ndiscriminative information in low-confidence samples by learning the\nsimilarities and differences between sample features. We evaluate our method on\nseveral classification benchmarks under partially labeled settings and\ndemonstrate its superiority over the other approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
