However, if and how neural population dynamics are amenable\nto different control strategies is poorly understood, in large part because\nmachine learning methods to directly assess controllability in neural\npopulation dynamics are lacking. To address this gap, we developed a novel\ndimensionality reduction method, Feedback Controllability Components Analysis\n(FCCA), that identifies subspaces of linear dynamical systems that are most\nfeedback controllable based on a new measure of feedback controllability. We\nfurther show that PCA identifies subspaces of linear dynamical systems that\nmaximize a measure of feedforward controllability. As such, FCCA and PCA are\ndata-driven methods to identify subspaces of neural population data\n(approximated as linear dynamical systems) that are most feedback and\nfeedforward controllable respectively, and are thus natural contrasts for\nhypothesis testing. We developed new theory that proves that non-normality of\nunderlying dynamics determines the divergence between FCCA and PCA solutions,\nand confirmed this in numerical simulations. Applying FCCA to diverse neural\npopulation recordings, we find that feedback controllable dynamics are\ngeometrically distinct from PCA subspaces and are better predictors of animal\nbehavior. Our methods provide a novel approach towards analyzing neural\npopulation dynamics from a control theoretic perspective, and indicate that\nfeedback controllable subspaces are important for behavior.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
