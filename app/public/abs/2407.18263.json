This is in\nclear contradiction with the LCDM numerical simulations. We show that the\nadditional cosmic force originating from the geometry of the Universe beyond\nthe Friedmann model increases the circular velocities of the test galactic\nbodies and avoids a decline of the standard LCDM velocity curves.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
