Recently, it has\nbeen proposed that second-order coherence can be utilized as an indicator of\nquantum entanglement. In this study, we evaluated the second-order coherence in\nthe context of the moving-mirror model, which serves as an analog model for\nHawking radiation from a black hole. We discuss the relation between\nentanglement and the second-order coherence of Hawking radiation paying\nattention to the noise effect due to the thermality of Hawking radiation, which\nreduces the quantum correlation in the entanglement-harvesting protocol with\ntwo-qubit detectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
