The central limit theorem (CLT)\nprovides a theoretical foundation for statistical inference. In this paper,\nassuming that the data dimension increases proportionally with the sample size,\nwe derive the limiting spectral distribution of the matrix\n$\\widehat{\\mathbf{R}}_n\\mathbf{M}$ and establish the CLTs for the linear\nspectral statistics (LSS) of $\\widehat{\\mathbf{R}}_n\\mathbf{M}$ in two\nstructures: linear independent component structure and elliptical structure. In\ncontrast to existing literature, our proposed spectral properties do not\nrequire $\\mathbf{M}$ to be an identity matrix. Moreover, we also derive the\njoint limiting distribution of LSSs of $\\widehat{\\mathbf{R}}_n\n\\mathbf{M}_1,\\ldots,\\widehat{\\mathbf{R}}_n \\mathbf{M}_K$. As an illustration,\nan application is given for the CLT.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
