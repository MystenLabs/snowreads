In the present work we calculate the electric conductivity of hot and\ndense hadronic matter by extracting it from the electromagnetic spectral\nfunction, through its zero energy limit at vanishing 3-momentum. We utilise the\nvector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents\npredominantly through the $\\rho$ meson. Therefore, we use hadronic many-body\ntheory to calculate the $\\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic\nmatter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\\pi$-$\\rho$, $\\pi$-$\\sigma$,\n$\\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\\Delta$-hole loops. We then introduce vertex\ncorrections to maintain gauge invariance. Finally, we analyze the low-energy\ntransport peak as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential, and\nextract the conductivity along a proposed phase transition line.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
