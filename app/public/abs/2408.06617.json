Roughly speaking, it asserts that the family of independent sets of\nevery uniform hypergraph can be covered by a small number of almost-independent\nsets, called containers. In this article, we formulate and prove two new\nversions of the lemma that display the following three attractive features.\nFirst, they both admit short and simple proofs that have surprising connections\nto other well-studied topics in probabilistic combinatorics. Second, they use\nalternative notions of almost-independence in order to describe the containers.\nThird, they yield improved dependence of the number of containers on the\nuniformity of the hypergraph, hitting a natural barrier for second-moment-type\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
