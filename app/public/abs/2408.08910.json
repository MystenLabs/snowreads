The answers to some questions will be\nobvious to expert practitioners but not to non-experts. One such question is\nWhy solar and wind generation are expected to supply the bulk of future energy\nwhen they are intermittent. We learn here that once the baseline hurdles of\nscalability to utility scale and the underlying resources being widely\navailable globally are satisfied, the forecasted cost of solar and wind is 2-4X\nlower than competing technologies, even those that are not as scalable and\navailable. The market views intermittency as surmountable.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gTYjaoMqkoeEIxWxW_r2loT1c-xdRwNlpnWP3laMXFs","pdfSize":"1137706"}
