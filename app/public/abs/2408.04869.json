Adaptive\nallocations based on upper confidence bounds (UCBs), such as UCBE, are known to\nwork well in BAI. However, it is well-known that its optimal regret is\ntheoretically dependent on instances, which we show to be an artifact in many\nfixed-budget BAI problems. In this paper we propose an UCB exploration\nalgorithm that is both theoretically and empirically efficient for the fixed\nbudget BAI problem under a Bayesian setting. The key idea is to learn prior\ninformation, which can enhance the performance of UCB-based BAI algorithm as it\nhas done in the cumulative regret minimization problem. We establish bounds on\nthe failure probability and the simple regret for the Bayesian BAI problem,\nproviding upper bounds of order $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{K/n})$, up to logarithmic\nfactors, where $n$ represents the budget and $K$ denotes the number of arms.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate through empirical results that our approach\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
