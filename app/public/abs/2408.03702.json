To define a pattern for\nthe catalyst, lift-off processes are commonly used. The lift-off step however\nis often a process bottle neck due to low yield, especially for smaller\nstructures. To bypass the lift-off process, other methods such as\nelectroplating can be utilized. In this paper, we suggest an electroplated\nbi-layer catalyst for vapour phase metal-assisted chemical etching as an\nalternative to the commonly utilised lift-off process. Samples were\nsuccessfully etched in vapour, and resulting structures had feature sizes down\nto 10 nm.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
