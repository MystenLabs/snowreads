Asymptotic expansions for the zeros are derived, involving the zeros\nof Airy functions, and these are valid for $a$ positive or negative and large\nin absolute value, uniformly for unbounded $z$ (real or complex). The accuracy\nof the approximations of the complex zeros is then demonstrated with some\ncomparative tests using a highly precise numerical algorithm for finding the\ncomplex zeros of the function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
