The\nparticles are strongly correlated and feel the alternating site potentials,\nexhibiting uniform ionic (I) Mott insulating and neutral band insulating (N)\nphases when the Coulomb interaction and site potentials are large,\nrespectively. We focus on the neutral-ionic domain walls (NIDW) activated by\ntheir competition, which is typically regarded as fractionalized particles. The\nfinite temperature phase diagram reveals a thermodynamically stable NIDW phase\nnot found in previous literature that emerges at the triple point, where the\ntransition line splits into two first-order lines toward the critical\nendpoints. We analyze the long-time behavior of dynamics of the NIDWs and find\nthat it captures the incoherent transport of the system. The conductivity\nderived from the diffusion constant and the number population of NIDWs shows a\nstrong enhancement inside the NIDW phase, which can explain the large\nconductivity at the NI crossover recently found in TTF-CA.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
