We condition these\npolicies on embeddings from pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs), and train\nthem via offline reinforcement learning with as little as 20 minutes of\nrandomly-collected data. Experiments on a team of five real robots show that\nthese policies generalize well to unseen commands, indicating an understanding\nof the LLM latent space. Our method requires no simulators or environment\nmodels, and produces low-latency control policies that can be deployed directly\nto real robots without finetuning.
