Repeated measures, commonly\nperformed in clinical research, facilitate computational acceleration for\nnonlinear Bayesian nonparametric models and enable exact sampling for\nnon-conjugate inference, when combinations of continuous and discrete endpoints\nare observed. Model inference is performed in Stan, and comparisons are made\nwith brms on simulated data and two real clinical data sets, following a\nradiological image quality theme. Scalable Gaussian Process models compare\nfavourably with parametric models on real data sets with 17,460 observations.\nDifferent GP model specifications are explored, with components analogous to\nrandom effects, and their theoretical properties are described.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
