Several high-order temporal discretizations are proposed based on\nthis new formulation. To ensure that the numerical methods preserve geometric\nstructures of curve diffusion (i.e., the perimeter-decreasing and\narea-preserving properties), our formulation incorporates two scalar Lagrange\nmultipliers and two evolution equations involving the perimeter and area,\nrespectively. By discretizing the spatial variable using piecewise linear\nfinite elements and the temporal variable using either the Crank-Nicolson\nmethod or the backward differentiation formulae method, we develop high-order\ntemporal schemes that effectively preserve the structure at a fully discrete\nlevel. These new schemes are implicit and can be efficiently solved using\nNewton's method. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods\nachieve the desired temporal accuracy, as measured by the manifold distance,\nwhile simultaneously preserving the geometric structure of the curve diffusion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
