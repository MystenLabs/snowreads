The naked singularities in AdS\nspace-times correspond to states rotating faster than light in the Ads/CFT\ncorrespondence. Therefore, overspinning turns out to be a drastic problem in a\n(2+1) dimensional AdS space-time, where one cannot invoke backreaction effects.\nHere, we consider the induced increase in the angular velocity of the event\nhorizon which modifies the condition to allow the absorption of the\nperturbations satisfying the null energy condition. We show that its magnitude\nis sufficiently large to prevent the absorption of the challenging modes both\nfor test bodies and scalar fields. We bring a solution to the notorious\noverspinning problem which does not involve any reference to self-energy or\ngravitational radiation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
