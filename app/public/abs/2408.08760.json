The pseudo-stress variable is introduced due to the growing\ninterest in non-Newtonian flows and coupled interface problems, where stress\nassumes a fundamental role. The space-time discretization of the problem is\nachieved by combining the PolydG approach with the implicit theta-method time\nintegration scheme. For both the semi- and fully-discrete problems we present a\ndetailed stability analysis. Moreover, we derive convergence estimates for the\nfully discrete space-time discretization. A set of verification tests is\npresented to verify the theoretical estimates and the application of the method\nto cases of engineering interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
