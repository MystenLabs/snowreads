Traditional approaches have focused on the limit of\nlarge number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead the\nregime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality\n$d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\\alpha=(\\log n)/d$. Our study reveals three\ndistinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\\hat\n\\rho_h^{\\mathcal {D}}(x)=\\frac{1}{n h^d}\\sum_{i=1}^n\nK\\left(\\frac{x-y_i}{h}\\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classical\nregime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, which\nis akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value of\nthe bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. The\nstatistics of $\\hat \\rho_h^{\\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from\n$\\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stable\ndistribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\\alpha)$, we find that $\\hat\n\\rho_h^{\\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only a few\npoints in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to the density\nestimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold based on\nKullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified in\nthis paper. Our findings reveal limitations of classical approaches, show the\nrelevance of these new statistical regimes, and offer new insights for Kernel\ndensity estimation in high-dimensional settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
