The main point of the current\narticle is, comparing to previous work \\cite{Deng2023}, that we obtain\nestimates beyond the semiclassical time regime. Our estimate is sharp in the\nsense that one can construct examples which saturate this estimate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
