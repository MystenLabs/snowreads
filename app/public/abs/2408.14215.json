We arrive at the same conclusion that\n$V$ is essentially addition in a commutative algebraic group, but we weaken the\nassumptions. Firstly, we allow arbitrarily unbalanced cardinalities\n$|A|^\\epsilon= O(|B|)$. Secondly, we remove the assumption that $V$ projects\ndominantly onto $W_1\\times W_3$. Thirdly, we weaken the general position\nassumption on $B$. As a corollary, we generalise the Elekes-R\\'onyai Theorem to\nan arbitrarily unbalanced version, and more generally to the case of finite\nfamilies $F$ of univariate polynomials exhibiting non-expansion $|\\bigcup_{f\\in\nF}f(A)|= O(|A|^{1+\\eta})$ of their action on a finite set $A\\subseteq\n\\mathbb{C}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0Ms8nJEM58GggbJg5DjfEHpJDG7SBaoTjEw9qNnyak4","pdfSize":"482593"}
