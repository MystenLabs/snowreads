Our setting is general enough to\ninclude simplicial epidemic processes, processes on multilayered networks or\neven the dynamics of the edges of a graph.\n  Our results are twofold. Firstly, we prove concentration bounds for the\nnumber of vertices in a certain state under mild assumptions. Our results imply\nthat even the empirical averages of subpopulations of diverging but possibly\nsublinear size are well concentrated around their mean. In the case of\nundirected weighted graphs, we completely characterize when said averages\nconcentrate around their expected value.\n  Secondly, we prove (under assumptions which are tight in some significant\ncases) upper bounds for the error of the N-Intertwined Mean Field Approximation\n(NIMFA). In particular, for symmetric unweighted graphs, the error has the same\norder of magnitude as the reciprocal of the average degree, improving the\npreviously known state of the art bound of the inverse square root of the\naverage degree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
