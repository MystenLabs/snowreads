Co-design refers to the\nsimultaneous involvement of the end-users (surgeons), stakeholders (designers,\nergonomic experts, manufacturers), and experts from the fields of optimization\nand mechanisms. The role of each member is discussed in detail and the\ninteractions between the stakeholders are presented. Co-design facilitates a\nreduction in the parameter space considered during mechanism optimization,\nleading to a more efficient design process. Additionally, the co-design\nprinciples help avoid unforeseen errors and help in quicker adaptation of the\nproposed solution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
