It has been hypothesised that SMGs are progenitors of local\nearly-type galaxies, requiring that SMGs generally reside in galaxy cluster\nprogenitors at high redshift. We test this hypothesis and explore SMG\nenvironments using a narrowband VLT/HAWK-I+GRAAL study of H$\\alpha$ and [OIII]\nemitters around an unbiased sample of three ALMA-identified and\nspectroscopically-confirmed SMGs at $z \\sim 2.3$ and $z \\sim 3.3$, where these\nSMGs were selected solely on spectroscopic redshift. Comparing with blank-field\nobservations at similar epochs, we find that one of the three SMGs lies in an\noverdensity of emission-line sources on the $\\sim4$ Mpc scale of the HAWK-I\nfield of view, with overdensity parameter $\\delta_{g} = 2.6^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$. A\nsecond SMG is significantly overdense only on $\\lesssim 1.6$ Mpc scales and the\nfinal SMG is consistent with residing in a blank field environment. The total\nmasses of the two overdensities are estimated to be $\\log(M_{h}/{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}) =$12.1--14.4, leading to present-day masses of $\\log(M_{h,z=0}/{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}) =$12.9--15.9. These results imply that SMGs occupy a range of\nenvironments, from overdense protoclusters or protogroups to the blank field,\nsuggesting that while some SMGs are strong candidates for the progenitors of\nmassive elliptical galaxies in clusters, this may not be their only possible\nevolutionary pathway.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kfjDtYl_zOyhSTcwIA1rIgsfQFqTzV8zrWTooJc0tmo","pdfSize":"15833539","txDigest":"vgHpcpf77mYMp1N9u45xUsbyKezHoY4aokVo9E52eqg","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
