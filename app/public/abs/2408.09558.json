One of the\nmain scenarios is printing morphed images and submitting the respective print\nin a passport application process. Today, small datasets are available to train\nthe MAD algorithm because of privacy concerns and the limitations resulting\nfrom the effort associated with the printing and scanning of images at large\nnumbers. In order to improve the detection capabilities and spot such morphing\nattacks, it will be necessary to have a larger and more realistic dataset\nrepresenting the passport application scenario with the diversity of devices\nand the resulting printed scanned or compressed images. Creating training data\nrepresenting the diversity of attacks is a very demanding task because the\ntraining material is developed manually. This paper proposes two different\nmethods based on transfer-transfer for automatically creating digital\nprint/scan face images and using such images in the training of a Morphing\nAttack Detection algorithm. Our proposed method can reach an Equal Error Rate\n(EER) of 3.84% and 1.92% on the FRGC/FERET database when including our\nsynthetic and texture-transfer print/scan with 600 dpi to handcrafted images,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ff6Zog781RPQ68kghip_mZ2GudWtBh_c6uieUQe5_1k","pdfSize":"8732078"}
