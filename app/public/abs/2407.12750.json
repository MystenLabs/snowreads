We focus on a model with\na coherent boundary drive, showing that it exhibits a unique continuous\ndissipative phase transition as a function of the boundary drive amplitude.\nThis transition has no analogue in the bulk closed system, or in incoherently\ndriven models. We also show the steady state magnetization exhibits a\nsurprising fractal dependence on interaction strength, something previously\nassociated with less easily measured infinite-temperature transport quantities\n(the Drude weight). Our exact solution also directly yields driven-dissipative\ndouble-chain models that have pure, entangled steady states that are also\ncurrent carrying.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
