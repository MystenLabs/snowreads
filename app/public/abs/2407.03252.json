By analysing the simpler wave and the heat\nnetworks separately, and then applying recent results for abstract coupled\nsystems, we establish energy decay at the rate $t^{-4}$ as $t\\to\\infty$ for all\nclassical solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
