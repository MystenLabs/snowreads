In this paper, we present a collection of\nsymmetrical results on the existence of $\\textsf{EFX}$ notion and its\napproximate variations. These results pertain to two seemingly distinct\nvaluation settings: the restricted additive valuations and $(p,q)$-bounded\nvaluations recently introduced by Christodoulou \\textit{et al.}\n\\cite{christodoulou2023fair}. In a $(p,q)$-bonuded instance, each good holds\nrelevance (i.e., has a non-zero marginal value) for at most $p$ agents, and any\npair of agents share at most $q$ common relevant goods. The only known\nguarantees on $(p,q)$-bounded valuations is that $(2,1)$-bounded instances\nalways admit $\\textsf{EFX}$ allocations (EC'22) \\cite{christodoulou2023fair}.\nHere we show that instances with $(\\infty,1)$-bounded valuations always admit\n$\\textsf{EF2X}$ allocations, and $\\textsf{EFX}$ allocations with at most\n$\\lfloor {n}/{2} \\rfloor - 1$ discarded goods. These results mirror the\nexisting results for the restricted additive setting \\cite{akrami2023efx}.\nMoreover, we present $({\\sqrt{2}}/{2})-\\textsf{EFX}$ allocation algorithms for\nboth the restricted additive and $(\\infty,1)$-bounded settings.\n  The symmetry of these results suggests that these valuations exhibit\nsymmetric structures. Building on this observation, we conjectured that the\n$(2,\\infty)$-bounded and restricted additive setting might admit $\\textsf{EFX}$\nguarantee. Intriguingly, our investigation confirms this conjecture. We propose\na rather complex $\\textsf{EFX}$ allocation algorithm for restricted additive\nvaluations when $p=2$ and $q=\\infty$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
