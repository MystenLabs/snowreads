The optimal-resolution\npositivity-preserving kernels and the corresponding damping factors are\nobtained. The results provide a generalization of the Jackson damping factors\nfor arbitrary Jacobi polynomials. For $\\alpha =\\pm 1/2$, $\\beta =\\pm 1/2$\n(Chebyshev polynomials of the first to fourth kinds), explicit trigonometric\nexpressions for the damping factors are obtained. The resulting algorithm can\nbe easily introduced into existing implementations of the kernel polynomial\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
