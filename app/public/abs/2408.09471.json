Apart from a trimmed proof of the general framework,\nthe structural details of many concrete f.c. semigroups $S$ are unraveled. They\ncome in two types. First, the subtle multiplicative semigroups $(Z_n,\\bullet)$\n(as opposed to their bland siblings $(Z_n,+)$). Second, semigroups defined by\ngenerators and relations. Altogether six open questions stimulate further\nresearch.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
