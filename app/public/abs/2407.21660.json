A representation by\n$R$-modules of $Q$ is called strongly fp-injective if it admits a pure acyclic\ninjective resolution in the category of representations. It is shown that such\nrepresentations possess many nice properties. We characterize strongly\nfp-injective representations under some mild assumptions, which is closely\nrelated to strongly fp-injective $R$-modules. Subsequently, we use such\nrepresentations to define relative Gorenstein injective representations, called\nGorenstein strongly fp-injective representations, and give an explicit\ncharacterization of the Gorenstein strongly fp-injective representations of\nright rooted quivers. As an application, a model structure in the category of\nrepresentations is given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"I5VhQiLyL0u_umsuj1DgHjjTn_h6HqloB92bRs9CwQo","pdfSize":"304299"}
