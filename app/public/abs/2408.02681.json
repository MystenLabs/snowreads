Using a covariant one-time\ntwo-body Dirac equation, we examine their relative motion in a\nthree-dimensional flat background. Our approach leads to coupled equations\ngoverning their behavior, resulting in a general second-order wave equation.\nThrough this, we derive analytical solutions by establishing quantization\nconditions for pair formation, providing insights into their dynamics. Notably,\nwe find that such interacting $f\\overline{f}$ systems are unstable and decay\nover time, with the decay time depending on the Compton wavelength of the\nfermions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xeWTQoKVVP4tWLts7vGSSKYi9sGm5v5h6VTSKAzERGo","pdfSize":"180282"}
