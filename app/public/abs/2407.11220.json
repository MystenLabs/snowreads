The digital four-arm bridge mimics the\nclassical quad bridge in the digital domain with three balances: the source\nbalance, the detector balance, as well as the main balance. Due to correlation,\nthe required precision of the source voltages is only of the order of the\nsquare root of the ultimate bridge precision. For the comparison of a\n$100\\,$k$\\Omega$ resistor with a $1\\,$nF capacitor near 1592 Hz, the combined\nstandard uncertainty $(k = 1)$ is $5\\times 10^{-9}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
