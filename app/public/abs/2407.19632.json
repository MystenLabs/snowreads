Although sophisticated control of rotational charge motion has been\nachieved using spatially structured light, its extension to simultaneous\nexcitation of the same charge motion in multiple nanostructures is not\nstraightforward. In this study, we perform model calculations to show that\nspatially homogeneous circularly polarized (CP) light can excite rotational\ncharge motions with a high degrees of freedom by exploiting the rotational\nsymmetry of the plasmonic structure and that of the plasmon mode.\nFinite-difference time-domain simulations demonstrate selective excitation of\nrotational charge motion for both isolated nanoplates and periodic array\nstructures, showing that complex charge rotations can be manipulated by plane\nCP waves in a wide range of plasmonic structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
