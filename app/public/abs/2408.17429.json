This anomaly can be traced to a dataset shift in the learning\nproblem, arising from inconsistent filtering in the training and testing\nstages. We propose a resolution to this issue that uses explicit filtering of\nthe nonlinear advection term in the large-eddy simulation momentum equations to\ncontrol aliasing errors. Within the context of explicitly-filtered large-eddy\nsimulations, we develop neural network-based models for which a priori accuracy\nis a good predictor of a posteriori performance. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod in a large-eddy simulation of a turbulent flow in a plane channel at\n$Re_{\\tau} = 180$. Our findings show that an explicitly-filtered large-eddy\nsimulation with a filter-to-grid ratio of 2 sufficiently controls the numerical\nerrors so as to allow for accurate and stable simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
