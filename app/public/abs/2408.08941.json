In\nthis survey paper, recent advancements in quantum circuit optimization are\nexplored. Both hardware independent as well as hardware dependent optimization\nare presented. State-of-the-art methods for optimizing quantum circuits,\nincluding analytical algorithms, heuristic algorithms, machine learning-based\nalgorithms, and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are discussed.\nAdditionally, the advantages and disadvantages of each method and the\nchallenges associated with them are highlighted. Moreover, the potential\nresearch opportunities in this field are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
