This yields the\n`primitive' subcategory $ k \\mathbf{FS}^0 \\subset k \\mathbf{FS}$ that is of\nindependent interest.\n  Working over a field of characteristic zero, the subquotients of this\nfiltration are identified as bimodules over $k \\mathbf{FB}$, where\n$\\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections, also exhibiting\nand exploiting additional structure. In particular, this describes the\nunderlying $k \\mathbf{FB}$-bimodule of $k \\mathbf{FS}^0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
