Recent research\ndemonstrated that hybrid SHNOs consisting of a ferromagnetic metal (permalloy)\nand lithium aluminum ferrite (LAFO), a ferrimagnetic insulator, thin films have\nadvantages in having lower auto-oscillation threshold currents\n($I_{\\text{th}}$) and generating larger microwave output power, making this\nhybrid structure an attractive candidate for spintronic applications. It is\nessential to understand how the tunable material properties of LAFO, e.g., its\nthickness, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ($K_u$), and saturation\nmagnetization ($M_s$), affect magnetic dynamics in hybrid SHNOs. We investigate\nthe change in $I_{\\text{th}}$ and the output power of the device as the LAFO\nparameters vary. We find the $I_{\\text{th}}$ does not depend strongly on these\nparameters, but the output power has a highly nonlinear dependence on $M_s$ and\n$K_u$. We further investigate the nature of the excited spin-wave modes as a\nfunction of $K_u$ and determine a critical value of $K_u$ above which\npropagating spin-waves are excited. Our simulation results provide a roadmap\nfor designing hybrid SHNOs to achieve targeted spin excitation characteristics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
