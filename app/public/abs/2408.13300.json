However, significant uncertainties and\ndisagreements exist concerning a variety of overlapping topics: the share of\njobs in which human labour is displaced and/or reinstated through automation;\nthe effects on income inequality; the effects on job satisfaction; and,\nfinally, what policy changes ought to be pursued to reduce potential negative\nimpacts. This literature review seeks to clarify this landscape by mapping out\nkey disagreements between positions, and to identify the critical elements upon\nwhich such disagreements rest. By surveying the current literature, the effects\nof AI on the future of work will be clarified.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"F0NzhzNaIMVHRkDIPH2TCl-9AItJueoxtHlPaBWauhU","pdfSize":"218502"}
