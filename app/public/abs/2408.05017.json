In this work, we employ a tensorial kernel support vector machine\n(TK-SVM) to analyze experimental data produced by trapped-ion quantum\ncomputers. This unsupervised method benefits from directly interpretable\ntraining parameters, allowing it to identify the non-trivial string-order\ncharacterizing symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We apply our\ntechnique to two examples: a spin-1/2 model and a spin-1 model, featuring the\ncluster state and the AKLT state as paradigmatic instances of SPT order,\nrespectively. Using matrix product states, we generate a family of quantum\ncircuits that host a trivial phase and an SPT phase, with a sharp phase\ntransition between them. For the spin-1 case, we implement these circuits on\ntwo distinct trapped-ion machines based on qubits and qutrits. Our results\ndemonstrate that the TK-SVM method successfully distinguishes the two phases\nacross all noisy experimental datasets, highlighting its robustness and\neffectiveness in quantum data interpretation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
