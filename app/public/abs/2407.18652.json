In this paper, we examine a recent proposal for a direct-sum QFTCS,\nwhich maintains unitarity through a novel quantization method that employs\nsuperselection rules based on discrete spacetime transformations. This approach\ndescribes a quantum state as components that evolve within superselection\nsectors of the complete Hilbert space, adhering to the discrete symmetries of a\nSchwarzschild black hole. Consequently, it represents a maximally entangled\npure state as a direct-sum of two components in the interior and exterior\nregions of the black hole, thereby preserving the unitarity of Hawking\nradiation by keeping it in the form of pure states.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
