The latter are\ntaken within the three Wigner-Dyson universality classes. In these systems, the\nresponse functions are shown to be exactly given by statistical averages over\nthe random-matrix ensemble. Analytical results are obtained for the time\ndependence of the mean response and correlation functions at zero and positive\ntemperatures. At long times, the mean correlation functions are shown to have a\npower-law decay for GOE at positive temperatures, but for GUE and GSE at zero\ntemperature. Otherwise, the decay is much faster in time. In relation to these\npower-law decays, the associated spectral densities have a dip around zero\nfrequency. The diagrammatic method is developed to obtain higher-order response\nfunctions and the third-order response function is explicitly calculated. The\nresponse to impulsive perturbations is also considered. In addition, the\nquantum fluctuations of the correlation function in individual members of the\nensemble are characterised in terms of their probability distribution, which is\nshown to change with the temperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
