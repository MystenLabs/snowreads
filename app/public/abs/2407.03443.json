We present the first measurements of the Pockels coefficients\nand permittivity in lithium niobate (LN) and barium titanate (BTO) over a\ncontinuous frequency range from 100 MHz to 330 GHz. These properties are\nconstant across this frequency range in LN but have a significant frequency\ndependence in BTO. Still, our measurements show that BTO ($\\varepsilon$ = 1136,\n$r_{42}$ = 481 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 125 pm/V at 100 MHz, $\\varepsilon$ = 453,\n$r_{42}$ = 191 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 60 pm/V at 330 GHz) has remarkably large\nelectro-optic properties compared to LN ($\\varepsilon$ = 27, $r_{42}$ = 15\npm/V, $r_{33}$ = 27 pm/V). Furthermore, we show how BTO devices can be designed\nwith a flat electro-optic frequency response despite the Pockels coefficient\ndispersion. Finally, we expound our method for broadband characterization of\nthese vital electro-optic properties, utilizing specialized integrated\nelectro-optic phase shifters. Altogether, this work is foundational to\ndesigning high-speed BTO devices and to developing new electro-optic materials.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
