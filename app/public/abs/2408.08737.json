A system of four independent\nnonmagnetic contact probes was used to supply both rf and dc currents to the\nwire and to measure dc voltages at different locations in the wire. The rf\ncurrent drives the ferromagnet's magnetization into resonance and produces a dc\nphotovoltage which results from the rectification of rf current in the\nferromagnet with oscillating magnetization. Our 4-probe system provided a means\nto detect the photovoltage and separate contributions from the\nferromagnet/nonmagnet contacts and the bulk of the ferromagnet. The contact\nphotovoltage was found to increase approximately linearly with the dc bias\napplied to the wire. In contrast, the bulk contribution was found to be almost\nindependent of the dc bias. By tuning properties of individual contact probes\nwe were able to change the magnitude of the contact photovoltage and even\nreverse its sign. Our results highlight the different contributions to\nphotovoltage and the importance of contact properties/nonlinearities for\nrectification effects in spintronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
