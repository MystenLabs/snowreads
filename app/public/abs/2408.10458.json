These current models often struggle with generalization\nacross different tasks and datasets, limiting their applicability in diverse\nscientific and engineering disciplines. This work presents a novel framework\nthat enhances the transfer learning capabilities of operator learning models\nfor solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) through the integration of\nfusion frame theory with the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-enhanced\nDeep Operator Network (DeepONet). We introduce an innovative architecture that\ncombines fusion frames with POD-DeepONet, demonstrating superior performance\nacross various PDEs in our experimental analysis. Our framework addresses the\ncritical challenge of transfer learning in operator learning models, paving the\nway for adaptable and efficient solutions across a wide range of scientific and\nengineering applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
