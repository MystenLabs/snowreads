While current computer vision models can generalize to unseen samples\nfrom the same distribution, they are susceptible to minor perturbations such as\nblurring, which limits their effectiveness in real-world applications. We\nsuggest integrating MHN into the baseline models to enhance their robustness.\nThis integration can be implemented during the test time for any model and\ncombined with any adversarial defense method. Our research shows that the\nproposed integration consistently improves model performance on the MNIST-C\ndataset, achieving a state-of-the-art increase of 13.84% in average corruption\naccuracy, a 57.49% decrease in mean Corruption Error (mCE), and a 60.61%\ndecrease in relative mCE compared to the baseline model. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the capability of MHN to converge to the original non-corrupted\ndata. Notably, our method does not require test-time adaptation or augmentation\nwith corruptions, underscoring its practical viability for real-world\ndeployment.
