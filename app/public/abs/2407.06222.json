Non-principal ultrafilters find widespread\napplications in logic, set theory, topology, model theory, and especially\nnon-standard extensions of algebraic structures. Since non-principal\nultrafilters are challenging to construct directly, the Filter Extension\nPrinciple, stemming from the Axiom of Choice, holds significant value in\nobtaining them. This paper presents the formal verification of the Filter\nExtension Principle, implemented using the Coq proof assistant and grounded in\naxiomatic set theory. It offers formal descriptions for the concepts related to\nfilter base, filter, ultrafilter and more. All relevant theorems, propositions,\nand the Filter Extension Principle itself are rigorously and formally verified.\nThis work sets the stage for the formalization of non-standard analysis and a\nspecific real number theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
