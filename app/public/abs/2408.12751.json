However,\nextracting features from DNA sequences of varying lengths can lead to the\nproblem of dimensionality, which needs to be addressed. Techniques such as PCA,\nUMAP, and t-SNE are commonly used to project high-dimensional data into a\nlower-dimensional space, but their effectiveness varies across different\ndatasets. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a model based on a\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP) that classifies DNA sequence features and\nintelligently selects the optimal dimensionality reduction method, thereby\nenhancing subsequent clustering performance. Experimental results, tested on\nopen-source datasets and compared with multiple benchmark methods, demonstrate\nthat our model not only excels in classification performance but also\nsignificantly improves clustering accuracy, indicating that this approach\neffectively mitigates the challenges posed by high-dimensional features in\nclustering models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rJGMfslQ537MS57ACaOHYT6pDTifRRRg_iIdiLzLjNM","pdfSize":"285843"}
