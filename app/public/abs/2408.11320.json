We employ coarse-grained molecular simulations to investigate\nconcentrated oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by partially hydrolyzed\npoly(vinyl alcohol)-grafted polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles. Two\ngrafting architectures were examined: hydrophilic-hydrophobic (AB-type) diblock\nPGNPs and reverse BA-type diblock PGNPs. Our findings reveal that AB-type\ndiblock PGNPs tend to aggregate, leading to droplet-droplet coalescence. In\ncontrast, BA-type diblock PGNPs disperse effectively in the water phase,\nstabilizing robust emulsion through a space-filling mechanism. The study\nfurther demonstrates that the stability and morphology of the emulsions can be\ntuned by varying the number of PGNPs. Our results suggest that BA-type diblock\nPGNPs are more effective in stabilizing concentrated emulsions, offering\ninsights for the design of novel emulsifiers in industrial applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
