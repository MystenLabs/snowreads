For control\nsynthesis, linear matrix inequalities are employed using an augmented wind\nturbine state model with uncertain parameters. The resulting controller ensures\nrobust stability in different operating regions. In a case study, the novel\napproach is compared to existing controllers from literature. Simulations\nindicate that the controller improves power tracking accuracy while leading to\nsimilar mechanical wear as existing approaches.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
