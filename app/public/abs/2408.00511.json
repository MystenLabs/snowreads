To assess the suitability of existing area\ninertia estimation techniques for real-world power systems, this paper presents\na rigorous comparative analysis of system identification, measurement\nreconstruction, and electromechanical oscillation-based area inertia estimation\nmethodologies, specifically applied to the large-scale and multi-area WECC\n240-bus power system. Comprehensive results show that the system\nidentification-based approach exhibits superior robustness and accuracy\nrelative to its counterparts.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ByHxd_43B0RNS5I8jgD7S_SrpwookV0hWu-CNOPmkq4","pdfSize":"1189636","txDigest":"933VeZpxjFx6MNNFvL5g1rqEnvkQ8a2sHYt4fJFQ81PW","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
