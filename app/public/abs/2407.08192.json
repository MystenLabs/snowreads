The framework incorporates\nthree specialized actor-critic agents within MARL, each dedicated to a distinct\naspect of compilation/optimization at an abstract level: one agent focuses on\nhardware, while two agents focus on software optimizations. This integration\nresults in a collaborative hardware/software co-optimization strategy that\nimproves the precision and speed of DNN deployments. Concentrating on\nhigh-confidence configurations simplifies the search space and delivers\nsuperior performance compared to current optimization methods. The ARCO\nframework surpasses existing leading frameworks, achieving a throughput\nincrease of up to 37.95% while reducing the optimization time by up to 42.2%\nacross various DNNs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vak_4PNbqpHIh3xB66UKpdFJ9gjelgoTgQU0LXqAMn4","pdfSize":"1062835"}
