This is a paradigmatic\nmodel in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, an overdamped Brownian particle\ntrapped in a two-dimensional elliptical potential, with the two degrees of\nfreedom $(x,y)$ coupled to two, in principle different, thermal baths with\ntemperatures $T_x$ and $T_y$, respectively. Application of Pontryagin's Maximum\nPrinciple reveals that shortest protocols belong to the boundaries of the\ncontrol set defined by the limiting values of the parameters $(k,u)$\ncharacterising the elliptical potential. We identify two classes of optimal\nminimum time protocols, i.e. brachistochrones: (i) regular bang-bang protocols,\nfor which $(k,u)$ alternatively take their minimum and maximum values allowed,\nand (ii) infinitely degenerate singular protocols. We thoroughly investigate\nthe minimum connection time over the brachistochrones in the limit of having\ninfinite capacity for compression. A plethora of striking phenomena emerge:\nsets of states attained at null connection times, discontinuities in the\nconnection time along adjacent target states, and the fact that, starting from\na state in which the oscillators are coupled, uncoupled states are impossible\nto reach in a finite time.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lYmyQdy3BpYezIu2NKGKW7ZPgSVDM2T0Bns5SJMemm0","pdfSize":"8202584"}
