The\nhydrodynamic description of quark-gluon plasma has also been widely used to\nstudy sound phenomena, such as shock waves. It has recently been shown that\ninitial fluctuations in energy density and supersonic partons can generate\nfairly strong shock waves. However, significant anisotropic properties of the\nsystem due to the rapid longitudinal expansion of matter have not been taken\ninto account in such studies. Moreover, the process of isotropization and its\ncharacteristic time-scales were not considered along with the question of the\nshock waves formation. Previous studies on shock discontinuous solutions in\nanisotropic hydrodynamics assumed constant anisotropy, leading to flow\nrefraction towards the anisotropy axis and flow acceleration, characteristics\nof rarefaction waves, indicating limitations in this approach. This paper\ninvestigates discontinuous solutions for normal shock waves without flow\nrefraction, introducing two compression parameters for longitudinal and\ntransverse pressures. The resulting analytical solutions, as well as numerical\ncomputations, provide an isotropization mechanism of the system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aa3njLgse2xZDGtb5_iXIZ2ky1nk2fi7z6T93aK2M00","pdfSize":"728710"}
