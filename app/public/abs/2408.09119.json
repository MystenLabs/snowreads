Unlike conventional Shannon transmission codes, the\nsize of randomized identification (ID) codes experiences a doubly exponential\ngrowth in the code length. Improvements in the ID approach can be attained\nthrough additional resources such as quantum entanglement, common randomness\n(CR), and feedback. It has been demonstrated that an infinite capacity can be\nattained for a single-user Gaussian channel with noiseless feedback,\nirrespective of the chosen rate scaling. We establish the capacity region of\nboth the K-sender Gaussian multiple access channel (K-GMAC) and the K-sender\nstate-dependent Gaussian multiple access channel (K-SD-GMAC) when strictly\ncausal noiseless feedback is available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
