An unexpected finding\nby Santos and co-workers reported enantiospecific NMR responses in solid-state\ncross-polarization (CP) experiments, suggesting a possible additional\ncontribution to the indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling in chiral molecules\ninduced by bond polarization in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Herein we\nprovide a theoretical treatment for this phenomenon, presenting an effective\nspin-Hamiltonian for helical molecules like DNA and density functional theory\n(DFT) results on amino acids that confirm the dependence of J-couplings on the\nchoice of enantiomer. The connection between nuclear spin dynamics and\nchirality could offer insights for molecular sensing and quantum information\nsciences. These results establish NMR as a potential tool for chiral\ndiscrimination without external agents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uCbQ1tM0hxCCcNKtlDDz3rKlxynu3-5gCOsl1jVSIxM","pdfSize":"22411985"}
