Understanding patterns of these complex interactions and how\nthey are coordinated to support collective neural activity and function is\ncritical for parsing human and animal behavior, treating mental illness, and\ndeveloping artificial intelligence. Rapid experimental advances in imaging,\nrecording, and perturbing neural systems across various species now provide\nopportunities and challenges to distill underlying principles of brain\norganization and function. Here, we take stock of recent progresses and review\nmethods used in the statistical analysis of brain networks, drawing from fields\nof statistical physics, network theory and information theory. Our discussion\nis organized by scale, starting with models of individual neurons and extending\nto large-scale networks mapped across brain regions. We then examine the\norganizing principles and constraints that shape the biological structure and\nfunction of neural circuits. Finally, we describe current opportunities aimed\nat improving models in light of recent developments and at bridging across\nscales to contribute to a better understanding of brain networks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
