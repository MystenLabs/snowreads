However, consistency\nproblems emerge when we attempt to put DRAM, NVM, and disk together as an\nefficient whole. In this paper, we discuss the challenging consistency problems\nfaced by heterogeneous storage systems, and propose our solution to the\nproblems. The discussion is based on NVPC as a case study, but can be inspiring\nand adaptive to all similar heterogeneous storage systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Operating Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
