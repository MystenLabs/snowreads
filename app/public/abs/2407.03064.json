Here, we develop a new method for analyzing band connectivity, which\ncompletely solves the outstanding questions of the reducibility and\ndecomposition of band complexes. By translating the symmetry conditions into a\nset of band balance equations, we show that all possible band structure\nsolutions can be described by a positive affine monoid structure, which has a\nunique minimal set of generators, called Hilbert basis. We show that Hilbert\nbasis completely determine whether a band complex is reducible and how it can\nbe decomposed. The band complexes corresponding to Hilbert basis vectors,\ntermed as Hilbert band complexes (HBCs), can be regarded as elementary building\nblocks of band structures. We develop algorithms to construct HBCs, analyze\ntheir graph features, and merge them into large complexes. We find some\ninteresting examples, such as HBCs corresponding to complete bipartite graphs,\nand complexes which can grow without bound by successively merging a HBC.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
