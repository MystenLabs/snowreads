The term resilience refers to the ability to cope with\nunexpected inputs while delivering correct service. Examples of resilient\ncomputing systems are Google's PageRank and the Bubblesort algorithm.\nEngineering for resilient cyber-physical systems requires a paradigm shift,\nprioritizing adaptability to dynamic environments. Software as a tool for\nself-management is a key instrument for dealing with uncertainty and embedding\nresilience in these systems. Yet, software engineers encounter the ongoing\nchallenge of ensuring resilience despite environmental dynamic change. My\nthesis aims to pioneer an engineering discipline for resilient cyber-physical\nsystems. Over four years, we conducted studies, built methods and tools,\ndelivered software packages, and a website offering guidance to practitioners.\nThis paper provides a condensed overview of the problems tackled, our\nmethodology, key contributions, and results highlights. Seeking feedback from\nthe community, this paper serves both as preparation for the thesis defense and\nas insight into future research prospects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
