The safety\nrisk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are\nevaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of\npre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to\neliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the\nsafe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle\nspeed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining\ncollision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle\nconflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with\non-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is\ndetermined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the\nselected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking\nhighway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal\ncooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation. Using\nSUMO and Python co-simulation, mainline traffic volumes of 800 veh*h-1*lane-1\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
