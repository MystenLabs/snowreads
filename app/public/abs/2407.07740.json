The perception of surrounding objects is the main\ncomponent for further tasks such as trajectory planning. However, safe\ntrajectory planning requires not only object detection, but also the detection\nof drivable areas and lane corridors. While first approaches consider an\nadvanced safety evaluation of object detection, the evaluation of lane\ndetection still lacks sufficient safety metrics. Similar to the safety metrics\nfor object detection, additional factors such as the semantics of the scene\nwith road type and road width, the detection range as well as the potential\ncauses of missing detections, incorporated by vehicle speed, should be\nconsidered for the evaluation of lane detection. Therefore, we propose the Lane\nSafety Metric (LSM), which takes these factors into account and allows to\nevaluate the safety of lane detection systems by determining an easily\ninterpretable safety score. We evaluate our offline safety metric on various\nvirtual scenarios using different lane detection approaches and compare it with\nstate-of-the-art performance metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
