For those systems\nwithout a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often\nlack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many\nreal-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling\nframework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via\nconditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier\nneural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which\nserves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems\ngoverned by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how\naccelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven\nstochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology\nprovides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to\nconstruct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical\nsystems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
