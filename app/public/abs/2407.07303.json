Here, the authors report the\nin-plane current-induced proliferation and aggregation of bimerons in a bulk\nchiral magnet. It is found that the spin-transfer torques can induce the\nproliferation and aggregation of bimerons only in the presence of an\nappropriate out-of-plane magnetic field. It is also found that a relatively\nsmall damping and a relatively large non-adiabatic spin-transfer torque could\nlead to more pronounced bimeron proliferation and aggregation. Particularly,\nthe current density should be larger than a certain threshold in order to\ntrigger the proliferation; namely, the bimerons may only be driven into\ntranslational motion under weak current injection. Besides, the authors find\nthat the aggregate bimerons could relax into a deformed honeycomb bimeron\nlattice with a few lattice structure defects after the current injection. The\nresults are promising for the development of bio-inspired spintronic devices\nthat use a large number of aggregate bimerons. The findings also provide a\nplatform for studying aggregation-induced effects in spintronic systems, such\nas the aggregation-induced lattice phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
