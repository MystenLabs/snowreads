We clarify this issue by employing large deviation theory.\nWe distinguish two distinct classes of discontinuous phase transitions that\nhave different dynamical properties. The first class is associated with phase\ncoexistence, i.e., the presence of multiple stable attractors of the system\ndynamics (e.g., local minima of the free energy functional) in a finite phase\ndiagram region around the phase transition point. In that case, one observes\nasymptotic exponential scaling related to stochastic switching between\nattractors (though the onset of exponential scaling may sometimes occur for\nvery large system sizes). In the second class, there is no phase coexistence\naway from the phase transition point, while at the phase transition point\nitself there are infinitely many attractors. In that case, one observes\npower-law scaling related to the diffusive nature of the system relaxation to\nthe stationary state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
