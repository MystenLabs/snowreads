The\nleast-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method has become popular for solving optimal\nstochastic control problems in quantitative finance. In this paper, we extend\nthe application of the LSMC method to stochastic climate-economy models. We\nexemplify this approach using a stochastic version of the DICE model with all\nfive main uncertainties discussed in the literature. To address the complexity\nand high dimensionality of these models, we incorporate deep neural network\napproximations in place of standard regression techniques within the LSMC\nframework. Our results demonstrate that the deep LSMC method can be used to\nefficiently derive optimal policies for climate-economy models in the presence\nof uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
