Mott-IMT is\noften associated with structural modification, which is very important for\noptoelectronic and actuator applications. Here, we report a giant resistive\nswitching of about 900 % at room temperature in disordered polycrystalline\nV2O3-Si thin film stabilized at the IMT phase boundary and associated\nstructural transformation under a small electric field. The increase of\nelectron population in the a1g band under the field is responsible for the Mott\ngap collapse that drives the structural transition. Furthermore, we also\nfabricated a room temperature Mott-FET with a channel ON/OFF resistive ratio of\nabout 15. This study provides a fundamental mechanism of the Mott-IMT in V2O3\nas well as its device applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"15e0rjbHwHQNccu-IugrsWdbBTLQXKU5OFPhv5tWfj4","pdfSize":"1631186"}
