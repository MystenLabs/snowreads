D. Efros [Phys. Rev. C 99,\n034620 (2019)] for calculating various observables in the continuum and\ndiscrete spectrum using two-body interactions in single- and coupled-channel\nsystems. This method is promising for many-body applications and ab initio\ndescription of nuclear reactions. We explore the convergence of phase shifts\nand wave functions as well as the location of S-matrix poles which enables\nobtaining both resonance and bound state parameters. We find that adopting wave\nfunctions from approximate bound-state solutions for the short-range components\nof basis wave functions leads to good convergence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
