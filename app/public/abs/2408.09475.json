We prove that any\nholomorphic or anti-holomorphic map between almost Hermitian manifolds is\nHermitian pluriharmonic. We also establish some monotonicity formulae for the\npartial energies of Hermitian pluriharmonic maps into K\\\"ahler manifolds. As an\napplication, under appropriate assumptions on the growth of the partial\nenergies, some holomorphicity results are proven.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
