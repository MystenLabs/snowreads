In\nthis paper, we study estimation of the maximum mean using an upper confidence\nbound (UCB) approach where the sampling budget is adaptively allocated to one\nof the systems. We study in depth the existing grand average (GA) estimator,\nand propose a new largest-size average (LSA) estimator. Specifically, we\nestablish statistical guarantees, including strong consistency, asymptotic mean\nsquared errors, and central limit theorems (CLTs) for both estimators, which\nare new to the literature. We show that LSA is preferable over GA, as the bias\nof the former decays at a rate much faster than that of the latter when sample\nsize increases. By using the CLTs, we further construct asymptotically valid\nconfidence intervals for the maximum mean, and propose a single hypothesis test\nfor a multiple comparison problem with application to clinical trials.\nStatistical efficiency of the resulting point and interval estimates and the\nproposed single hypothesis test is demonstrated via numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Rs0IeaXYSDf6_L7OEjfVydeoQeRPPpgozrjv0k7lVxc","pdfSize":"828551"}
