A popular\nway to approximate a sparse solution is by using Greedy Pursuit algorithms, and\nOrthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is one of the most widely used such\nsolutions. For this paper, we implemented an efficient implementation of OMP\nthat leverages Cholesky inverse properties as well as the power of Graphics\nProcessing Units (GPUs) to deliver up to 200x speedup over the OMP\nimplementation found in Scikit-Learn.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
