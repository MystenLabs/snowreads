The strong\ntemperature dependence of the rheology of mantle rocks causes viscosity\nvariations of several orders of magnitude, leading to a slow-evolving stagnant\nlid where heat conduction dominates, overlying a rapidly-evolving and strongly\nconvecting region. Time-stepping methods, while effective for fluids with\nconstant viscosity, are hindered by the Courant criterion, which restricts the\ntime step based on the system's maximum velocity and grid size. Consequently,\nachieving steady-state requires a large number of time steps due to the\ndisparate time scales governing the stagnant and convecting regions.\n  We present a concept for accelerating mantle convection simulations using\nmachine learning. We generate a dataset of 128 two-dimensional simulations with\nmixed basal and internal heating, and pressure- and temperature-dependent\nviscosity. We train a feedforward neural network on 97 simulations to predict\nsteady-state temperature profiles. These can then be used to initialize\nnumerical time stepping methods for different simulation parameters. Compared\nto typical initializations, the number of time steps required to reach\nsteady-state is reduced by a median factor of 3.75. The benefit of this method\nlies in requiring very few simulations to train on, providing a solution with\nno prediction error as we initialize a numerical method, and posing minimal\ncomputational overhead at inference time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach and discuss the potential implications for accelerated simulations\nfor advancing mantle convection research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
