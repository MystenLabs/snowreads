However, as previously observed [26],\nvisual ambiguities can also happen depending on the viewpoint or the presence\nof occluding objects, when disambiguating parts become hidden. The visual\nambiguities are therefore actually different across images. We thus first\npropose an automatic method to re-annotate those datasets with a 6D pose\ndistribution specific to each image, taking into account the visibility of the\nobject surface in the image to correctly determine the visual ambiguities.\nGiven this improved ground truth, we re-evaluate the state-of-the-art methods\nand show this greatly modify the ranking of these methods. Our annotations also\nallow us to benchmark recent methods able to estimate a pose distribution on\nreal images for the first time. We will make our annotations for the T-LESS\ndataset and our code publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"C-vLcwaD9GasQxstuCJRXtYSC8-ep0Dr-eXFowalMVo","pdfSize":"11941816"}
