Although the\nanapole moment of neutrinos induces a scattering rate with the same spectral\nshape as the neutral and charged current contributions, exposures of $\\sim$ 10\ntonne $\\times$ year at XENONnT or XLZD may be enough to accumulate sufficient\nstatistics. We also discuss a simple model where the anapole moment of\nneutrinos is shifted with respect to the SM expectation, further demonstrating\nhow a potential measurement of the anapole moment of neutrinos would allow to\nconstrain new physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
