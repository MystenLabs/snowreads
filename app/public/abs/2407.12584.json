The linear optical response from chiral Bogoliubov edge modes in\nclean superconductors has in-gap resonances, which is originated from the\ntransitions within the edge particle-hole pair bands. Interestingly, the number\nof resonance peaks is determined by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern number of\ntopological superconductors. Such features in optical absorption offer a way to\ndistinguish topological superconductors with different Chern number. We further\ndemonstrate that linear optical effect could probe different topological phases\nin quantum anomalous Hall insulator-superconductor junction devices. This\nfinding provides an applicable method to detect chiral Bogoliubov edge states\nand is distinguishable from collective modes in superconductors and possible\ntrivial explanations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
