This study aims to improve the cyber resilience amongst SMEs by\ndeveloping a national risk assessment tool. This research is guided by three\nkey questions: 1. What current international SME risk assessment tools are\navailable and supported or endorsed by national cybersecurity centres? 2. How\ncan a risk assessment tool be created that is accessible to SME owners with\nlittle to no cybersecurity knowledge? 3. What are the key areas of\ncybersecurity risks for SMEs? To answer these questions, a comprehensive review\nof existing risk assessment tools was carried out. Through iterative\ncollaboration with SMEs, the development of a user-friendly tool that\nsimplifies risk for non-expert users was made possible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
