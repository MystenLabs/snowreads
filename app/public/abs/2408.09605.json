A lively debate on\nthis topic runs throughout the history of philosophy and now animates\ndiscussions of artificial intelligence. I argue that in principle, there can be\npure thinkers: thinkers that lack the capacity to sense altogether. I also\nargue for significant limitations in just what sort of thought is possible in\nthe absence of the capacity to sense. Regarding AI, I do not argue directly\nthat large language models can think or understand, but I rebut one important\nargument (the argument from sensory grounding) that they cannot. I also use\nrecent results regarding language models to address the question of whether or\nhow sensory grounding enhances cognitive capacities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
