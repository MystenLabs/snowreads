We construct templates for the infinitely many\nAnosov flows on the trefoil complement, which are lifts of the geodesic flow on\nthe modular surface, by lifting Ghys' modular template using self-covering of\nthe trefoil complement of order $6k+1$, for $k\\in \\mathbb{N}_{>0}$. This allows\nto study the knot properties of closed geodesics in these flows, and an\nexplicit construction of an infinite family of links of two components with one\nof them being the trefoil, all commensurable to one another.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
