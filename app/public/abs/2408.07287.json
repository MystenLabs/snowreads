We consider two\nexpansions of the well-known Belnap--Dunn paraconsistent four-valued logic\n$\\mathsf{BD}$: $\\mathsf{BD}_\\circ$ introduces formulas of the form $\\circ\\phi$\n(the information on $\\phi$ is reliable), while $\\mathsf{BD}_\\triangle$ augments\nthe language with $\\triangle\\phi$'s (there is information that $\\phi$ is true).\nWe define and motivate the notions of abduction problems and explanations in\n$\\mathsf{BD}_\\circ$ and $\\mathsf{BD}_\\triangle$ and show that they are not\nreducible to one another. We analyse the complexity of standard abductive\nreasoning tasks (solution recognition, solution existence, and relevance /\nnecessity of hypotheses) in both logics. Finally, we show how to reduce\nabduction in $\\mathsf{BD}_\\circ$ and $\\mathsf{BD}_\\triangle$ to abduction in\nclassical propositional logic, thereby enabling the reuse of existing abductive\nreasoning procedures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"938ALnKywVssZEmKOSkU9h-JuS0FqIF_l7SjnepTkUY","pdfSize":"310928"}
