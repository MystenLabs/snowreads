At the same time,\nnon-computed entries are set to zeros. We assume that both the number of\ncomputed entries and their associated row index set are random variables, with\nthe row index set sampled uniformly given the number of computed entries. This\nmodel of computations is prevalent to that realized in hybrid cloud computing\narchitectures following the controller-worker distributed model under the\ninfluence of straggling workers. We propose a randomized Richardson iterative\nscheme and a randomized Chebyshev semi-iterative method within this model and\nprove the sufficient conditions for their convergence in expectation. Numerical\nexperiments verify the presented theoretical results as well as the\neffectiveness of the proposed schemes on a few sparse matrix problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JDCFMXIJlvCQjjyCZ38Npz-AXAjr1yIE63PbY1iadbM","pdfSize":"1309405","objectId":"0xd3ef5f27334d49d3e48f0113ddeabb7cd17cfee56ccded77ff779821fa46f314","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
