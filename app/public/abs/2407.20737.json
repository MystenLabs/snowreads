By utilizing\ndata from the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020) and incorporating features such\nas atomic number, neutron number, and shell effects, KANs demonstrated\nsignificant predictive accuracy, surpassing traditional models. The symbolic\nregression analysis yielded simplified analytical expressions for binding\nenergies, aligning with classical models like the liquid drop model and the\nBethe-Weizs\\\"acker formula. These results highlight KANs' potential in\nenhancing the interpretability and understanding of nuclear phenomena, paving\nthe way for future applications in nuclear physics and beyond.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
