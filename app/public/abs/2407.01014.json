However, their reliance on large, clean\ndatasets for training limits their practical use where clean data is scarce. In\nthis paper, we propose EMDiffusion, an expectation-maximization (EM) approach\nto train diffusion models from corrupted observations. Our method alternates\nbetween reconstructing clean images from corrupted data using a known diffusion\nmodel (E-step) and refining diffusion model weights based on these\nreconstructions (M-step). This iterative process leads the learned diffusion\nmodel to gradually converge to the true clean data distribution. We validate\nour method through extensive experiments on diverse computational imaging\ntasks, including random inpainting, denoising, and deblurring, achieving new\nstate-of-the-art performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
