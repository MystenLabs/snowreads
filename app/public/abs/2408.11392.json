Since the sample quality strongly affects the recognition performance\nof a biometric system, it is essential to only process samples of sufficient\nquality and discard samples of low-quality. Even though quality assessment\nalgorithms are not intended to yield very different quality scores across\ndemographic groups, quality score discrepancies are possible, resulting in\ndifferent discard ratios. To ensure that quality assessment algorithms do not\ntake demographic characteristics into account when assessing sample quality and\nconsequently to ensure that the quality algorithms perform equally for all\nindividuals, it is crucial to develop a fairness measure. In this work we\npropose and compare multiple fairness measures for evaluating quality\ncomponents across demographic groups. Proposed measures, could be used as\npotential candidates for an upcoming standard in this important field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
