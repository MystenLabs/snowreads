This\ndata offers valuable insights that enhance our understanding of how physical\nactivities contribute to improved physical health and overall quality of life.\nConsequently, there is a growing need for efficient methods to extract\nsignificant insights from these rapidly expanding real-time datasets. This\npaper presents a methodology to efficiently extract substantial insights from\nthese expanding datasets, focusing on professional sports but applicable to\nvarious human activities. By utilizing data from Inertial Measurement Units\n(IMU) and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers, athletic\nperformance can be analyzed using directed graphs to encode knowledge of\ncomplex movements. Our approach is demonstrated on biathlon data and detects\nspecific points of interest and complex movement sequences, facilitating the\ncomparison and analysis of human physical performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
