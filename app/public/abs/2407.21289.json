Because of this, the majority of categories and large\nobjects are favored in the existing evaluation metrics. This paper suggests\nfine-grained mIoU and mAcc for a more thorough assessment of point cloud\nsegmentation algorithms in order to address these issues. Richer statistical\ninformation is provided for models and datasets by these fine-grained metrics,\nwhich also lessen the bias of current semantic segmentation metrics towards\nlarge objects. The proposed metrics are used to train and assess various\nsemantic segmentation algorithms on three distinct indoor and outdoor semantic\nsegmentation datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
