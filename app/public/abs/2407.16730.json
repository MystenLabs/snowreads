Since the field-theoretic action of non-relativistic bosons is a\ncomplex quantity, the corresponding path integral features a complex weight and\nis not accessible to standard Monte Carlo techniques. The complex Langevin\nalgorithm represents an approach to overcome this obstacle, thereby providing\nthe intriguing possibility of numerically exact simulations of interacting\nBose-Einstein condensates within the field-theoretic framework. After reviewing\nthe coherent-state path integral description of ultracold Bose gases as well as\nthe complex Langevin method, we present the results of simulations in several\nphysical scenarios. While parts of the thesis are based on arXiv:2204.10661 and\narXiv:2304.05699 that treat the 3D and 2D homogeneous gas with contact\ninteractions, it contains additional material covering external trapping\npotentials as well as Bose gases with long-range dipolar interactions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
