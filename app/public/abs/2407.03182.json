We assume the accretion\nprocess is via an accretion disk that launches powerful jets from its inner\nzones. These jets remove the outer high-entropy layers of the mass-accreting\nstar. This process operates in a negative feedback cycle, as the jets remove\nmore envelope mass when the star expands. With the one-dimensional model, we\nmimic the mass removal by jets by alternative mass addition and mass removal\nphases. For the simulated models of 30Mo and 60Mo, the star does not expand\nmuch if we remove more than about half of the added mass in not-too-short\nepisodes. This holds even if we deposit the energy the jets do not carry into\nthe envelope. As the star does not expand much, its gravitational potential\nwell stays deep, and the jets are energetic. These results are relevant to\nbright transient events of binary systems powered by accretion and the\nlaunching of jets, e.g., intermediate luminosity optical transients, including\nsome luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856\nGreat Eruption of Eta Carinae.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QLO3ztIsjQ8umvMP_NrdZ_1A5XluFhOyhbBAaUPh8sk","pdfSize":"1631221"}
