Comprised of numerous individual units, this device, which acts as a\nlinear Fresnel reflector (LFR), facilitates the reflection of incoming signals\nto a desired location. Leveraging geometric principles, we present a systematic\napproach for redirecting beams from an Access Point (AP) toward User Equipment\n(UE) positions. This methodology is geared towards optimizing beam allocation,\nthereby maximizing the number of beams directed towards the UE. Ray tracing\nsimulations conducted for two 3D wireless communication scenarios demonstrate\nsignificant increases in path gains and received signal strengths (RSS) by at\nleast 50dB with strategically positioned devices.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
