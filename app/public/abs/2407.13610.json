We mostly consider $\\gamma\\gamma$ processes in\nultraperipheral collisions of hadrons at the LHC, but the\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ process in $\\mathrm{e}^+\\mathrm{e}^-$\ncollisions at LEP is also discussed. The NLO terms are found to modify the\ntotal cross sections by up to 5%, increasing the tails of the dilepton\nacoplanarity and transverse momentum distributions, and depleting by up to 15%\nthe yields at high masses, with respect to the leading-order predictions\nincluding the very small virtuality of the colliding photons. At the LHC, the\ncalculations obtained with the charge form factor for protons and lead ions\nincluding the NLO QED corrections improve the data--theory agreement for all\nmeasured differential distributions, and prove an indispensable ingredient for\nthe extraction of precision quantities in photon-photon processes, such as the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S3rHFo4lsckYNe2tbdQYz6oYIPRLJlS4nZADWTv0aiw","pdfSize":"1524010"}
