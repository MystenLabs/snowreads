We determine the location in the frequency domain and\nthe intensity of the aliases of the harmonic coefficients in the Fourier\ndecomposition of the spin random field and evaluate the consequences of\naliasing errors in the angular power spectrum when the samples of the random\nfield are obtained by using some very popular sampling procedures on the\nsphere, the equiangular and the Gauss-Jacobi sampling schemes. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that band-limited spin random fields are free from aliases,\nprovided that a sufficiently large number of nodes is used in the selected\nquadrature rule.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
