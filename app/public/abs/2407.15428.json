Conventional monitoring\ntools and techniques often struggle to provide a clear understanding of the\nnature and intent of ICS-specific communications. To enhance comprehension, we\npropose a software solution powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). This\nsolution currently focused on BACnet protocol, processes a packet file data and\nextracts context by using a mapping database, and contemporary context\nretrieval methods for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The processed\npacket information, combined with the extracted context, serves as input to the\nLLM, which generates a concise packet file summary for the user. The software\ndelivers a clear, coherent, and easily understandable summary of network\nactivities, enabling SOC analysts to better assess the current state of the\ncontrol system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
