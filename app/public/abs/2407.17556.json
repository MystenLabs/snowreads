As a first\nexample, we focus on the Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1\ndimensions. We demonstrate that QOC can significantly speed up the ground state\npreparation compared to gate-based methods, even for models with long-range\ninteractions. Using classical simulations, we explore the dependence on the\ninter-qubit coupling strength and the device connectivity, and we study the\noptimization in the presence of noise. While our simulations indicate potential\nspeedups, the results strongly depend on the device specifications. In\naddition, we perform exploratory studies on the preparation of thermal states.\nOur results motivate further studies of QOC techniques in the context of\nquantum simulations for fundamental physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
