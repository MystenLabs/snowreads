Previous works mostly focus on shape composition, making them very\nhard to use for realistic composition of 3D objects captured from real-world\nscenes. This leads to combining multiple NeRFs into a single 3D scene to\nachieve seamless appearance blending. However, the current SeamlessNeRF method\nstruggles to achieve interactive editing and harmonious stitching for\nreal-world scenes due to its gradient-based strategy and grid-based\nrepresentation. To this end, we present an example-based modeling method that\ncombines multiple Gaussian fields in a point-based representation using\nsample-guided synthesis. Specifically, as for composition, we create a GUI to\nsegment and transform multiple fields in real time, easily obtaining a\nsemantically meaningful composition of models represented by 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS). For texture blending, due to the discrete and irregular\nnature of 3DGS, straightforwardly applying gradient propagation as SeamlssNeRF\nis not supported. Thus, a novel sampling-based cloning method is proposed to\nharmonize the blending while preserving the original rich texture and content.\nOur workflow consists of three steps: 1) real-time segmentation and\ntransformation of a Gaussian model using a well-tailored GUI, 2) KNN analysis\nto identify boundary points in the intersecting area between the source and\ntarget models, and 3) two-phase optimization of the target model using\nsampling-based cloning and gradient constraints. Extensive experimental results\nvalidate that our approach significantly outperforms previous works in terms of\nrealistic synthesis, demonstrating its practicality.
