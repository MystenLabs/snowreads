We introduce CytoDiffusion, a diffusion-based classifier that\neffectively models blood cell morphology, combining accurate classification\nwith robust anomaly detection, resistance to distributional shifts,\ninterpretability, data efficiency, and superhuman uncertainty quantification.\nOur approach outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative models in anomaly\ndetection (AUC 0.976 vs. 0.919), resistance to domain shifts (85.85% vs. 74.38%\nbalanced accuracy), and performance in low-data regimes (95.88% vs. 94.95%\nbalanced accuracy). Notably, our model generates synthetic blood cell images\nthat are nearly indistinguishable from real images, as demonstrated by a Turing\ntest in which expert haematologists achieved only 52.3% accuracy (95% CI:\n[50.5%, 54.2%]). Furthermore, we enhance model explainability through the\ngeneration of directly interpretable counterfactual heatmaps. Our comprehensive\nevaluation framework, encompassing these multiple performance dimensions,\nestablishes a new benchmark for medical image analysis in haematology,\nultimately enabling improved diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.
