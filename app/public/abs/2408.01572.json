Color centers in diamond are\npromising candidates as they are photostable emitters at room and elevated\ntemperatures. The possibility of their electrical excitation has already been\ndemonstrated within p-i-n diodes. However, this requires the growth of complex\ndiamond structures. In contrast to these conventional approaches, we\ndemonstrate the emission of color centers under electrical pumping in a novel\nSchottky diode configuration based on hydrogen passivated n-type diamond, which\nholds promise for integrated single-photon emitting devices based on color\ncenters in diamond.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
