The toolkit provides an intuitive framework and\noffers a comprehensive suite of features, including standardized implementation\nof well-established model architectures, loss functions, and easy-to-use\nvisualization tools. As such, it helps promote reproducibility for research on\nneural audio effect modeling, and enable in-depth performance comparison of\ndifferent models, offering insight into the behavior and operational\ncharacteristics of models through DSP methodology.
