Notably, it\nincorporates post-fault UAV capabilities into job assignment techniques,\nassuring operational dependability in the event of sensor and actuator\nfailures. A significant innovation is the utilization of UAV battery charge to\nassess range relative to search objectives, hence improving job distribution\nwhile conserving battery life. This model integrates repair, recharge, and\nstochastic goal recurrence, hence increasing its real-world applicability.\nUsing stochastic dynamic programming, this method makes it simpler to determine\noptimal assignment policies offline so they may be implemented rapidly online.\nThis paper emphasizes the holistic aspect of the proposed model, which connects\nhigh-level task rules to low-level control capabilities. A simulation-based\ncase study proves its usefulness, highlighting its robustness in fault-prone\nand battery-variable settings. Overall, this paper proposes and demonstrates a\ncomprehensive method for assigning UAV tasks that integrates defect awareness,\nbattery management, and multilayer control through the use of stochastic\ndynamic programming.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lOhyRfjVyoENDHEgByEwGsbFQEWrxuvv5FvZOSVCvRk","pdfSize":"785157"}
