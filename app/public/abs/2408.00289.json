Here in the regression model, the response and the independent\nvariables are certain operator valued observables, and they are linearly\nassociated with unknown scalar coefficient (denoted by $\\beta$), and the error\nis a random operator. In the course of this study, we propose a quantum version\nof a class of estimators (denoted by $M$ estimator) of $\\beta$, and the large\nsample behaviour of those quantum version of the estimators are derived, given\nthe fact that the true model is also linear and the samples are observed\neigenvalue pairs of the operator valued observables.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
