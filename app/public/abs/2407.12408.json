However,\ntracking loss can lead to the creation of disjoint submaps in multimap SLAM\nsystems like ORB-SLAM3. Because of that, these systems employ submap merging\nstrategies. As we show, these strategies are not always successful. In this\npaper, we investigate the impact of using modern VPR approaches for submap\nmerging in visual SLAM. We argue that classical evaluation metrics are not\nsufficient to estimate the impact of a modern VPR component on the overall\nsystem. We show that naively replacing the VPR component does not leverage its\nfull potential without requiring substantial interference in the original\nsystem. Because of that, we present a post-processing pipeline along with a set\nof metrics that allow us to estimate the impact of modern VPR components. We\nevaluate our approach on the NCLT and Newer College datasets using ORB-SLAM3\nwith NetVLAD and HDC-DELF as VPR components. Additionally, we present a simple\napproach for combining VPR with temporal consistency for map merging. We show\nthat the map merging performance of ORB-SLAM3 can be improved. Building on\nthese results, researchers in VPR can assess the potential of their approaches\nfor SLAM systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qPRok-MjiI4JMHr1gfYh1WWicDzmBbXO34fd8N_mMow","pdfSize":"12494195"}
