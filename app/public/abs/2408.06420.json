As an example, we introduce a\nnew circuit element, the Y-splitter, a superconducting loop with three leads\nand three Josephson junctions, smaller or comparable in size to the\nsuperconducting coherence length of the material. By tuning magnetic flux\nthrough an array of Y-splitters, Cooper-pair transport can be made to interfere\ndestructively, while spatially separated split Cooper pairs propagate\ncoherently. We consider an array of Y-splitters connected in a two-dimensional\nstar [Archimedean (3,$12^2$)] geometry, deformable into the kagome lattice, and\nfind a rich phase diagram that includes topological superconducting phases with\nChern numbers $\\pm 2$. Experimental realization appears feasible.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
