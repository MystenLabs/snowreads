Implementing aerial networks in disaster management scenarios and\ncrowded areas can effectively enhance Quality of Service (QoS). In such\nenvironments, maintaining Line-of-Sight (LoS), especially at higher\nfrequencies, is crucial for ensuring reliable communication networks with high\ncapacity, particularly in environments with obstacles. The main contribution of\nthis paper is a traffic- and obstacle-aware UAV positioning algorithm named\nReinforcement Learning-based Traffic and Obstacle-aware Positioning Algorithm\n(RLTOPA), for such environments. RLTOPA determines the optimal position of the\nUAV by considering the positions of ground users, the coordinates of obstacles,\nand the traffic demands of users. This positioning aims to maximize QoS in\nterms of throughput by ensuring optimal LoS between ground users and the UAV.\nThe network performance of the proposed solution, characterized in terms of\nmean delay and throughput, was evaluated using the ns- 3 simulator. The results\nshow up to 95% improvement in aggregate throughput and 71% in delay without\ncompromising fairness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
