Given a possible break-up\nevent, this work analyses the threat posed by the generated debris in the orbit\nof an asset spacecraft. Using the Koopman Operator solution of the $J_2$\nperturbed two-body dynamics, the family of all possible orbits that cross the\nasset's pathway is identified and parameterized according to their velocity.\nThe threat level assessment of a collision onto the asset is estimated\nconsidering the intersection between the velocities of the break-up model and\nthe Koopman transfer solutions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
