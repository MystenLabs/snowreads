This is a\nfundamental problem in probabilistic inference, which is crucial for scientific\napplications such as learning the 3D coordinate distribution of a molecule. To\nsolve this problem, we propose iterated energy-based flow matching (iEFM), the\nfirst off-policy approach to train continuous normalizing flow (CNF) models\nfrom unnormalized densities. We introduce the simulation-free energy-based flow\nmatching objective, which trains the model to predict the Monte Carlo\nestimation of the marginal vector field constructed from known energy\nfunctions. Our framework is general and can be extended to variance-exploding\n(VE) and optimal transport (OT) conditional probability paths. We evaluate iEFM\non a two-dimensional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and an eight-dimensional\nfour-particle double-well potential (DW-4) energy function. Our results\ndemonstrate that iEFM outperforms existing methods, showcasing its potential\nfor efficient and scalable probabilistic modeling in complex high-dimensional\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vcni7oXl8kyYJWB8-uqtrMOWPhGjHqvHdE_i7-o6UWI","pdfSize":"21462372"}
