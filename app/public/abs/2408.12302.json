The\nintegrating out is performed using a contour integral in complexified Schwinger\nproper time. For the resolved conifold, this contour can be extended to include\nthe zero pole, which we argue captures the ultraviolet completion of the\nintegrating out and yields the tree-level polynomial terms in the free energy.\nThis is a manifestation of the Emergence Proposal, and provides further\nevidence for it. Unlike the case of closed strings, where the emergent terms\nare kinetic terms in the action, for these open strings it is tree-level\npotential terms which are emergent. This provides a first quantitative example\nof the proposal that classical tree-level potentials in string theory emerge\nfrom integrating out co-dimension one states.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PcfxbkoyiQehshiykx49QJtVkthLUi5Y4hrwwiDKsaU","pdfSize":"186189"}
