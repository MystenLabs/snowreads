The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI),\nincluding diffusion models and large language models (LLMs), has potentially\nintensified these threats by enabling more personalized and convincing attacks.\nThis survey paper categorizes SE attack mechanisms, analyzes their evolution,\nand explores methods for measuring these threats. It highlights the challenges\nin raising awareness about the risks of AI-enhanced SE attacks and offers\ninsights into developing proactive and adaptable defense strategies.\nAdditionally, we introduce a categorization of the evolving nature of\nAI-powered social engineering attacks into \"3E phases\": Enlarging, wherein the\nmagnitude of attacks expands through the leverage of digital media; Enriching,\nintroducing novel attack vectors and techniques; and Emerging, signifying the\nadvent of novel threats and methods. Moreover, we emphasize the necessity for a\nrobust framework to assess the risk of AI-powered SE attacks. By identifying\nand addressing gaps in existing research, we aim to guide future studies and\nencourage the development of more effective defenses against the growing threat\nof AI-powered social engineering.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
