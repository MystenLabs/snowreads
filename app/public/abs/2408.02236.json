However, little is known\nabout the construction and variation of QT narratives across societal domains.\nThis study examines how QT is presented in business, media, and government\ntexts using thematic narrative analysis. Our research design utilizes an\nextensive dataset of 36 government documents, 165 business reports, and 2,331\nmedia articles published over 20 years. We employ a computational social\nscience approach, combining BERTopic modeling with qualitative assessment to\nextract themes and narratives. The findings show that public discourse on QT\nreflects prevailing social and political agendas, focusing on technical and\ncommercial potential, global conflicts, national strategies, and social issues.\nMedia articles provide the most balanced coverage, while business and\ngovernment discourses often overlook societal implications. We discuss the\nramifications for integrating QT into society and the need for wellinformed\npublic discourse.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"q2wfmSHlg2RufTNQkqWh1Hsc18HrKERHMKqsKy3EPYQ","pdfSize":"2697046","txDigest":"FQjED7SEHhAZMeo96zHG3y9w33WxPRGQYk7dLWPXAf9b","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
