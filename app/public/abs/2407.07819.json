In order to focus on the contribution to friction of interfacial\ndissipation, a dedicated rotational setup is designed which allows to suppress\nporoelastic flows while ensuring an uniform velocity field at the sliding\ninterface. The physical-chemistry of the interface is varied from the grafting\nof various silanes on the silica probes. Remarkably, we identify a velocity\nrange in which the average frictional stress systematically varies with the\nlogarithm of the sliding velocity. This dependency is found to be sensitive to\nthe physical-chemistry of the silica surfaces. Experimental observations are\ndiscussed in the light of a molecular model where friction arises from\nthermally activated adsorption of polymer chains at the sliding interface,\ntheir elastic stretching and subsequent desorption. From this theoretical\ndescription, our experimental data provide us with adhesion energies and\ncharacteristic times for molecular adsorption that are found consistent with\nthe physico-chemistry of the chemically-modified silica surfaces.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
