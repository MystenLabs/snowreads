This novel architecture propagates the\nnode features through the graph network according to the discrete wave equation\nand then employs a sequence learning architecture to learn the target node\nfunction from the audio wave signal. This leads to a new paradigm of learning\non graph-structured data, in which information propagation and information\nprocessing are separated into two distinct steps. We theoretically characterize\nthe expressivity of our model, introducing the notion of the receptive field of\na vertex, and investigate our model's susceptibility to over-smoothing and\nover-squashing both theoretically as well as experimentally on various graph\ndatasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
