Metaphors are mainly identified and generated by\npre-trained models in existing research, but situations, where tenors or\nvehicles are not included in the metaphor, cannot be handled. The problem can\nbe effectively solved by using Large Language Models (LLMs), but significant\nroom for exploration remains in this early-stage research area. A multi-stage\ngenerative heuristic-enhanced prompt framework is proposed in this study to\nenhance the ability of LLMs to recognize tenors, vehicles, and grounds in\nChinese metaphors. In the first stage, a small model is trained to obtain the\nrequired confidence score for answer candidate generation. In the second stage,\nquestions are clustered and sampled according to specific rules. Finally, the\nheuristic-enhanced prompt needed is formed by combining the generated answer\ncandidates and demonstrations. The proposed model achieved 3rd place in Track 1\nof Subtask 1, 1st place in Track 2 of Subtask 1, and 1st place in both tracks\nof Subtask 2 at the NLPCC-2024 Shared Task 9.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
