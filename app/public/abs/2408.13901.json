Specifically, we characterize the minimum strength of\nassociation required for these variables--both with the dependent and\nindependent variables, or with the dependent variable alone--to elevate the\nobserved t-statistic above a specified significance threshold. Interestingly,\nwe show that it is considerably difficult to overturn a statistically\ninsignificant result solely by reducing the standard error. Instead, included\nvariables must also alter the point estimate to achieve such reversals in\npractice. Our results can be used for sensitivity analysis and for bounding the\nextent of p-hacking, and may also offer algebraic explanations for patterns of\nreversals seen in empirical research, such as those documented by Lenz and Sahn\n(2021).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CJOTLkcHCqi_wTE51-QRWbeZsTePYohrGbBnMQcxEoo","pdfSize":"225472"}
