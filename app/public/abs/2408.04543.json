The advent of quantum computing introduces\nnew challenges for security and privacy. This poster explores the performance\nand security implications of quantum computing through a case study of machine\nlearning in a real-world application. We compare the performance of quantum\nmachine learning (QML) algorithms to their classical counterparts using the\nAlzheimer's disease dataset. Our results indicate that QML algorithms show\npromising potential while they still have not surpassed classical algorithms in\nterms of learning capability and convergence difficulty, and running quantum\nalgorithms through simulations on classical computers requires significantly\nlarge memory space and CPU time. Our study also indicates that QMLs have\ninherited vulnerabilities from classical machine learning algorithms while also\nintroduce new attack vectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
