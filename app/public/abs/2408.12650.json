Historically, the problem has been solved by Wilson's numerical\nrenormalization group and later by Bethe ansatz. In this paper, we present an\nalternate analytic solution of the Kondo problem that combines an expansion in\n$1/s$ with the renormalization group. We study both the case of an impurity\ninteracting with a single channel $K=1$ of fermions in the $s \\rightarrow\n\\infty$ limit and the case with $K$ channels in the double-scaling limit $K\n\\rightarrow \\infty$, $s \\to \\infty$, $K/s$ fixed. Our approach allows us to\ndescribe analytically intermediate scales of the Kondo problem at large $s$ and\ncompute thermodynamic observables such as the impurity entropy and\nsusceptibility. We find these observables to agree with the Bethe ansatz\nresults. We also compute the impurity spectral function, finite temperature\nresistivity and the Kondo screening cloud profile, properties that are not\neasily accessible from Bethe ansatz. Notably, in the regime $K > 2s$ we access\nthe \"non-Fermi-liquid\" overscreened fixed point of the multichannel Kondo\nproblem.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
