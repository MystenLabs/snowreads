We present\nclosed-form expressions for unitary transformations generated by a single\nfermionic operator for Hermitian and anti-Hermitian generators. We demonstrate\nthe usefulness of these expressions in formal analyses of unitary\ntransformations and numerical applications involving block-diagonalization and\nHeisenberg dynamics. This work paves the way for new analytical treatments of\nunitary transformations and numerical many-body methods for fermions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
