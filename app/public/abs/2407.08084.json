We present a novel decentralized\nadaptive controller design for multiple robots that can be implemented in\ndifferent kinds of aerospace robots. Our controller adapts to unknown objects\nin different gravity environments. We validate our method in an aerial scenario\nusing multiple fully actuated hexarotors with grasping capabilities, and a\nspace scenario using a group of space tugs. In both scenarios, the robots\ntransport a payload cooperatively through desired three-dimensional\ntrajectories. We show that our method can adapt to unexpected changes that\ninclude the loss of robots during the transportation mission.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZqKnOP-rYv9fMzTJCZ4rzEdODE1Qb6eGRn2WteuWTRg","pdfSize":"13061854"}
