Polymodel theory can solve this issue and demonstrate superiority in\nportfolio construction from various aspects. To implement the PolyModel theory\nfor constructing a hedge fund portfolio, we begin by identifying an asset pool,\nutilizing over 10,000 hedge funds for the past 29 years' data. PolyModel theory\nalso involves choosing a wide-ranging set of risk factors, which includes\nvarious financial indices, currencies, and commodity prices. This comprehensive\nselection mirrors the complexities of the real-world environment. Leveraging on\nthe PolyModel theory, we create quantitative measures such as Long-term Alpha,\nLong-term Ratio, and SVaR. We also use more classical measures like the Sharpe\nratio or Morningstar's MRAR. To enhance the performance of the constructed\nportfolio, we also employ the latest deep learning techniques (iTransformer) to\ncapture the upward trend, while efficiently controlling the downside, using all\nthe features. The iTransformer model is specifically designed to address the\nchallenges in high-dimensional time series forecasting and could largely\nimprove our strategies. More precisely, our strategies achieve better Sharpe\nratio and annualized return. The above process enables us to create multiple\nportfolio strategies aiming for high returns and low risks when compared to\nvarious benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
