In this Letter, we use the weakly self-avoiding\nwalk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW)\nto investigate its emergence in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we\nshow that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity,\nwhich is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer\nsegments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal\nenergy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently\nacross both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and\nself-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest\nthat negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of\npolymer networks and chains.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
