Directly probing\nanionic redox mechanisms is not possible, rather the computational analysis by\ndensity functional theory poses the main approach towards gleaning insights\ninto anionic redox activity and harnessing these effects to maximize capacity\nin future electrode materials. Here we showcase material systems exhibiting\nthis mechanism of ion insertion and removal, and present the key computational\nconsiderations in studying anionic redox activities in battery materials. Aided\nby new computationally derived understandings of the role of anionic redox in\nemerging battery materials, increasingly greater levels of useable capacities\ncan be extracted through informed materials design.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
