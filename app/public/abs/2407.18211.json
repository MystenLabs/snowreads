In addition to the gauge boson resulting from the extra\n$U_\\text{d}(1)$ gauge symmetry, the particle content is extended by a further\nHiggs boson, one Dirac fermion as well as right-handed neutrinos. Employing the\n$U_Y(1)$ field-strength tensor as well as the SM Higgs mass operator (the only\ntwo singlet operators of the SM with dimension less than four) and the\nright-handed neutrino fields, we open three portals to the dark sector.\n  After an introduction of the model, we discuss a renormalization scheme for\nthe complete model with a special focus on the renormalization of the mixing\nangles. Finally, as an example of application, we present the prediction for\nthe W-boson mass derived from muon decay in the DASM.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
