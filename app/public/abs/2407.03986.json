We develop a general theoretical tool for establishing boundedness\nof notoriously difficult operators (such as potentials) on certain specific\ntypes of rearrangement-invariant function spaces from analogous properties of\noperators that are easier to handle (such as fractional maximal operators). The\nkey ingredient for the development of the theory is the initial pair of\nendpoint estimates for the easier operator whose pivotal example is based on a\ntwo-weight inequality of Sawyer. Among various applications we obtain a\ngeneralization of the celebrated trace inequality involving the Riesz potential\nand the Hausdorff content by Korobkov and Kristensen.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
