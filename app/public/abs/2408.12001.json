Specifically, the auction\nis rank-guaranteed, meaning that for any menu M and any valuation profile, the\nex-post revenue is guaranteed to be at least as high as the highest revenue\nachievable from feasible allocations, taking the (|M|+ 1)th-highest valuation\nfor each bundle as the price. Our analysis highlights a crucial aspect of\ncombinatorial auction design, namely, the design of menus. We provide simple\nand approximately optimal menus in various settings.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
