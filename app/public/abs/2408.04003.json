Perturbations on the time scale of the outer orbit can\naccumulate over long timescales and be comparable to the effect of the octupole\nterm. These perturbations are described by Brown's Hamiltonian - having\ndifferent forms in the literature. We show that at the high eccentricity regime\n- the effect of Brown's Hamiltonian is an azimuthal precesssion of the\neccentricity vector and can be solved analytically. In fact, the dynamics are\nequivalent to a simple pendulum model allowing an explicit flip criterion.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j5_nLv_5ybUnXOQ3h_rS7Od3iQjqLf1W9dLT7dBk4VQ","pdfSize":"2629929"}
