Typically, human DNA analysts 'read' DNA\nprofiles using their experience to distinguish instrument noise, artefactual\nsignal, and signal corresponding to DNA fragments of interest. Recent work has\ndeveloped an artificial neural network, ANN, to carry out the task of\nclassifying fluorescence types into categories in DNA profile electrophoretic\nsignal. But the creation of the necessarily large amount of labelled training\ndata for the ANN is time consuming and expensive, and a limiting factor in the\nability to robustly train the ANN. If realistic, prelabelled, training data\ncould be simulated then this would remove the barrier to training an ANN with\nhigh efficacy. Here we develop a generative adversarial network, GAN, modified\nfrom the pix2pix GAN to achieve this task. With 1078 DNA profiles we train the\nGAN and achieve the ability to simulate DNA profile information, and then use\nthe generator from the GAN as a 'realism filter' that applies the noise and\nartefact elements exhibited in typical electrophoretic signal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oLTyuPWVP-lgbyrwaTuX4715bGR4r2AJB6Uu-rqcWYY","pdfSize":"1332400"}
