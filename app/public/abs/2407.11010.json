This proved to be\nmore complex than initially anticipated, due to four key challenges: (1)\nreal-time processing of intermediate and final transcriptions with incomplete\nwords from ASR, (2) emitting intermediate and final translations with minimal\nuser perceived latency, (3) handling beam search hypotheses that have unequal\nlength and different model state, and (4) handling sentence boundaries.\nPrevious work in the field of simultaneous machine translation only implemented\ngreedy decoding. We present a beam-search realization that handles all of the\nabove, providing guidance through the minefield of challenges. Our approach\nincreases the BLEU score by 1 point compared to greedy search, reduces the CPU\ntime by up to 40% and character flicker rate by 20+% compared to a baseline\nheuristic that just retranslates input repeatedly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
