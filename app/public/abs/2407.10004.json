The motivation for\nconsidering these two fields of investigation is related to the emission of\ninformation from the black hole encoded by quantum complexity; even at zero\ntemperature, information is still emitted. In this case, the death of the black\nhole only occurs classically. In this sense, the entropy of the black hole at\nzero temperature must still be a minimum of information that is not entirely\nzero. In recent investigations regarding Horndeski gravity in the AdS/BCFT\ncorrespondence, we showed a minimum entropy (residual/remaining entropy) for\nzero temperature. In this sense, complexity and entropy, as we will show\nthroughout this work, provide information about the emission from a black hole\neven after its classical death.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dw0_XyzNfGNO36SS4Irs2FHaoOHJ8eL8Ulg4MAvWqKY","pdfSize":"1215731"}
