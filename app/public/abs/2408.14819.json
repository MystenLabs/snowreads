Layout control has been widely studied to\nalleviate the shortcomings of T2I diffusion models in understanding objects'\nplacement and relationships from text descriptions. Nevertheless, existing\napproaches for layout control are limited to 2D layouts, require the user to\nprovide a static layout beforehand, and fail to preserve generated images under\nlayout changes. This makes these approaches unsuitable for applications that\nrequire 3D object-wise control and iterative refinements, e.g., interior design\nand complex scene generation. To this end, we leverage the recent advancements\nin depth-conditioned T2I models and propose a novel approach for interactive 3D\nlayout control. We replace the traditional 2D boxes used in layout control with\n3D boxes. Furthermore, we revamp the T2I task as a multi-stage generation\nprocess, where at each stage, the user can insert, change, and move an object\nin 3D while preserving objects from earlier stages. We achieve this through our\nproposed Dynamic Self-Attention (DSA) module and the consistent 3D object\ntranslation strategy. Experiments show that our approach can generate\ncomplicated scenes based on 3D layouts, boosting the object generation success\nrate over the standard depth-conditioned T2I methods by 2x. Moreover, it\noutperforms other methods in comparison in preserving objects under layout\nchanges.
