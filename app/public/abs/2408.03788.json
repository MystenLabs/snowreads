Through the use of\nsmooth variational methods, penalization techniques, and the application of the\nLusternik-Schnirelmann category theory, we establish a connection between the\nnumber of positive solutions and the topological properties of the set in which\nthe potential function achieves its minimum values.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
