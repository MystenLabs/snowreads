Satellite\npropagation is of high priority in such a vast world where distances could very\nwell be measured in astronomical units. We analyze the ring's parameters and\nstability and propose a stable helical orbit around the Dyson ring influenced\nby the gravity of the Dyson ring and the Sun. Taking theoretically explainable\nvalues for all parameters, we describe our approach to finding this orbit and\npresent the successful simulation of a satellite's flight in this path.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
