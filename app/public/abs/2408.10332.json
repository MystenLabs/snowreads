This is easier if the spectral ratio $R = \\lambda_1 / \\lambda_2$ is\nlarge. We ask: how large does $R$ need to be to solve streaming PCA in\n$\\widetilde{O}(d)$ space? Existing algorithms require $R =\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}(d)$. We show: (1) For all mergeable summaries, $R =\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{d})$ is necessary. (2) In the insertion-only model, a\nvariant of Oja's algorithm gets $o(1)$ error for $R = O(\\log n \\log d)$. (3) No\nalgorithm with $o(d^2)$ space gets $o(1)$ error for $R = O(1)$.\n  Our analysis is the first application of Oja's algorithm to adversarial\nstreams. It is also the first algorithm for adversarial streaming PCA that is\ndesigned for a spectral, rather than Frobenius, bound on the tail; and the\nbound it needs is exponentially better than is possible by adapting a Frobenius\nguarantee.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
