Concretely, we first identify a unified\nperformance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links.\nNext, we comprehensively develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem\npacket queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and\nqueuing latency. Combined with several practical constraints, we then formulate\na joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message\nthroughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management\nstrategy by employing a Lagrange primal-dual method and devising a preference\nlist-based heuristic algorithm. Finally, numerical results validate the\nperformance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different\nbenchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
