The approximations are typically an\norder of magnitude more accurate than anything available in the literature,\nwhich from an observational perspective makes numerical calculations\nsuperfluous. For example, our tracking quintessence approximation, with one\nless parameter than CPL and a comparably simple expression, yields a $0.1\\%$\nmaximum relative error of $H(z)/H_0$ for the inverse power law scalar field\npotential. We situate the new results in a broader dark energy context, where\nthe present parametrized deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM offer simple alternatives\nto the CPL parametrization, useful for observations at increasingly large\nredshifts.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
