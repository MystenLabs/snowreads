This paper proposes a feature fusion method based\non Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and CNN, named TDA-CNN. This method combines\nnumerical distribution features captured by CNN with topological structure\nfeatures captured by TDA to improve the feature learning and representation\nability of CNN. TDA-CNN divides feature extraction into a CNN channel and a TDA\nchannel. CNN channel extracts numerical distribution features, and the TDA\nchannel extracts topological structure features. The two types of features are\nfused to form a combined feature representation, with the importance weights of\neach feature adaptively learned through an attention mechanism. Experimental\nvalidation on datasets such as Intel Image, Gender Images, and Chinese\nCalligraphy Styles by Calligraphers demonstrates that TDA-CNN improves the\nperformance of VGG16, DenseNet121, and GoogleNet networks by 17.5%, 7.11%, and\n4.45%, respectively. TDA-CNN demonstrates improved feature clustering and the\nability to recognize important features. This effectively enhances the model's\ndecision-making ability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
