We study two variants of\nDP-SGD with: (1) example-level sampling (ELS) and per-example gradient\nclipping, and (2) user-level sampling (ULS) and per-user gradient clipping. We\nderive a novel user-level DP accountant that allows us to compute provably\ntight privacy guarantees for ELS. Using this, we show that while ELS can\noutperform ULS in specific settings, ULS generally yields better results when\neach user has a diverse collection of examples. We validate our findings\nthrough experiments in synthetic mean estimation and LLM fine-tuning tasks\nunder fixed compute budgets. We find that ULS is significantly better in\nsettings where either (1) strong privacy guarantees are required, or (2) the\ncompute budget is large. Notably, our focus on LLM-compatible training\nalgorithms allows us to scale to models with hundreds of millions of parameters\nand datasets with hundreds of thousands of users.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tsDtTliWxfKl_JUqlchmdnCNHpRh_LAtdgSNPmbwaoo","pdfSize":"1247982","objectId":"0x48bf2ab9d0497297e9aa663269d9ddc15ea2bd93a3cb97ea5a205925c479a103","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
