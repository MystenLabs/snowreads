We analyze the correlated\nchannel model and derive the outage probability of the system. Then, we design\na deep reinforce learning (DRL) method to optimize the phase shift of IRS, in\norder to maximize the received signal power. Moreover, this paper presents\nresults of the simulations conducted to evaluate the performance of the\nDRL-based method. The simulation results indicate that the outage probability\nof the considered system increases significantly with more correlated channel\ncoefficients. Moreover, the performance gap between DRL and theoretical limit\nincreases with higher transmit power and/or larger distortion requirement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
