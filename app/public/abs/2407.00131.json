By employing a multi-branch\nstructure with learnable adaptive weights, RepAct enriches feature processing\nand enhances cross-layer interpretability. When evaluated on tasks such as\nimage classification and object detection, RepAct notably surpassed\nconventional activation functions in lightweight networks, delivering up to a\n7.92% accuracy boost on MobileNetV3-Small for the ImageNet100 dataset, while\nmaintaining computational complexity on par with HardSwish. This innovative\napproach not only maximizes model parameter efficiency but also significantly\nimproves the performance and understanding capabilities of lightweight neural\nnetworks, demonstrating its potential for real-time edge computing\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
