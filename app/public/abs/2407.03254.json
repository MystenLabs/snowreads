Specifically, these\nDOF now refer to open regions of null infinity, and of black hole (and\ncosmological) horizons representing equilibrium situations. At null infinity\nthe new Hamiltonian framework yields the well-known BMS fluxes and charges. By\ncontrast, all fluxes vanish identically at black hole (and cosmological)\nhorizons just as one would physically expect. In a companion paper we showed\nthat, somewhat surprisingly, the geometry and symmetries of these two physical\nconfigurations descend from a common framework. This paper reinforces that\ntheme: Very different physics emerges in the two cases from a common\nHamiltonian framework because of the difference in the nature of degrees of\nfreedom. Finally, we compare and contrast this Hamiltonian approach with those\navailable in the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
