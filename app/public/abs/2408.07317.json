In this paper, we aim to\ndevelop a straightforward framework that uses other modalities, such as natural\nlanguage, to translate the original dreamland. We present DreamConnect,\nemploying a dual-stream diffusion framework to manipulate visually stimulated\nbrain signals. By integrating an asynchronous diffusion strategy, our framework\nestablishes an effective interface with human dreams, progressively refining\ntheir final imagery synthesis. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate\nthe method ability to accurately instruct human brain signals with high\nfidelity.
