These membrane-mediated interactions arise from the membrane\ncurvature induced by the particles and can lead to assemblies of particles that\ngenerate highly curved spherical or tubular membranes shapes, but have mainly\nbeen quantified for planar or weakly curved membranes. In this article, we\nsystematically investigate the membrane-mediated interactions of arc-shaped\nparticles adsorbed to a variety of tubular and spherical membrane shapes with\ncoarse-grained modelling and simulations. We determine both the pairwise\ninteraction free energy, with includes entropic contributions due to rotational\nentropy loss at close particle distances, and the pairwise interaction energy\nwithout entropic components from particle distributions observed in the\nsimulations. For membrane shapes with small curvature, the membrane-mediated\ninteraction free energies of particle pairs exceed the thermal energy kT and\ncan lead to particle ordering and aggregation. The interactions strongly\ndecrease with increasing curvature of the membrane shape and are minimal for\ntubular shapes with membrane curvatures close to the particle curvature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Quantitative Biology/Subcellular Processes"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
