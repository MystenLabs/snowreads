This variance brings\nsome complexity to the analysis. Through this investigation, we derive the\nOnsager-Machlup functional, which acts as the Lagrangian for mapping the most\nprobable transition path between metastable states in stochastic processes\naffected by time-varying noise. This is done by introducing new measurable\nnorms and applying an appropriate version of the Girsanov transformation. To\nillustrate our theoretical advancements, we provide numerical simulations,\nincluding cases of a one-dimensional SDE and a fast-slow SDE system, which\ndemonstrate the application to multiscale stochastic volatility models, thereby\nhighlighting the significant impact of time-varying diffusion coefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
