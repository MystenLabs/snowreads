Unlike the more commonly discussed\nthermal phase noise, the crystalline coating can generate thermal birefringent\nnoise due to its anisotropic nature. In this study, we propose that the\nnon-diagonal anisotropic photoelastic effect induced by the Brownian motion of\nmirror coating layers may contribute to this noise. Employing a standard model\nfor the coating surface, we calculate the spectrum of the non-diagonal\nanisotropic Brownian photoelastic(NABP) noise to be $1.2 \\times 10^{-11} p_{63}\nf^{-1/2}/\\rm{Hz}^{1/2}$. Further experiments are warranted to validate the\ninfluence of this effect and reduce its uncertainty. Our findings highlight\nthat for high-precision experiments involving optical resonant cavities\ntargeting signals imprinted in optical polarizations, this noise could emerge\nas a limiting factor for experimental sensitivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
