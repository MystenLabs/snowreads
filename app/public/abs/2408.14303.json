The investigated\nmultiplexing techniques are code-division multiplexing in phase-coded\nfrequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and phase-modulated continuous wave\n(PMCW) radar. Additionally, random fast/slow time multiplexing in time and\nfrequency is considered for frequency-modulated continuous wave and orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radars. The comparative analysis is\nconducted through simulations, evaluating the scalability with the number of\ntransmitters and addressing other pertinent implementation concerns. The\nfindings provide insights into the trade-offs associated with each approach,\naiding in selecting suitable MIMO radar multiplexing strategies for practical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ZDtbnLWbCrXLihdU5T4E5xAw9xaUjYUxov8nV1M4TrE","pdfSize":"588502"}
