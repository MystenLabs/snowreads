To unify\nthese different regimes, a new TMD factorization based on the background field\nmethod is proposed. This factorization not only reduces to CSS and DGLAP in the\nlarge-x limit and BFKL in the small-x limit, but also defines a general\nevolution away from these regimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_j_CSpOz7a_lUzMvXY-jfId-QudxmBDG00DKNYL1JlI","pdfSize":"601053"}
