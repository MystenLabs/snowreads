The unweighted adjacency\nmatrix of a graph is commonly used to characterize the relationships between\nlocations, resulting in the implicit assumption that all pairs of neighboring\nregions interact similarly, an assumption which may not be true in practice. It\nhas been shown that more complex spatial relationships between graph nodes may\nbe represented when edge weights are allowed to vary. Christensen and Hoff\n(2023) introduced a covariance model for data observed on graphs which is more\nflexible than traditional alternatives, parameterizing covariance as a function\nof an unknown edge weights matrix. A potential issue with their approach is\nthat each edge weight is treated as a unique parameter, resulting in\nincreasingly challenging parameter estimation as graph size increases. Within\nthis article we propose a framework for estimating edge weight matrices that\nreduces their effective dimension via a basis function representation of of the\nedge weights. We show that this method may be used to enhance the performance\nand flexibility of covariance models parameterized by such matrices in a series\nof illustrations, simulations and data examples.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
