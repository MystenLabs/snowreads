This determination impacts\nvarious factors, including the acceleration induced by solar radiation\npressure, the spacecraft power input, and its thermal state all of which must\nbe accounted for in various phases of the mission design. This study leverages\nrecent advances in neural image processing to develop fully differentiable\nmodels of eclipse regions for highly irregular celestial bodies. By utilizing\ntest cases involving Solar System bodies previously visited by spacecraft, such\nas 433 Eros, 25143 Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, and 101955 Bennu, we\npropose and study an implicit neural architecture defining the shape of the\neclipse cone based on the Sun's direction. Employing periodic activation\nfunctions, we achieve high precision in modeling eclipse conditions.\nFurthermore, we discuss the potential applications of these differentiable\nmodels in spaceflight mechanics computations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
