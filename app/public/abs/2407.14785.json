In this problem, $m$\nservers and $n$ requests are located in a metric space, where all servers are\navailable upfront and requests arrive one at a time. In particular, servers are\nadversarially chosen, and requests are independently drawn from a known\ndistribution. Upon the arrival of a new request, it needs to be immediately and\nirrevocably matched to a free server, resulting in a cost of their distance.\nThe objective is to minimize the total matching cost.\n  In this paper, we show that the problem can be reduced to a more accessible\nsetting where both servers and requests are drawn from the same distribution by\nincurring a moderate cost. Combining our reduction with previous techniques,\nfor $[0, 1]^d$ with various choices of distributions, we achieve improved\ncompetitive ratios and nearly optimal regrets in both balanced and unbalanced\nmarkets. In particular, we give $O(1)$-competitive algorithms for $d \\geq 3$ in\nboth balanced and unbalanced markets with smooth distributions. Our algorithms\nimprove on the $O((\\log \\log \\log n)^2)$ competitive ratio of\n\\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/GuptaGPW19} for balanced markets in various regimes, and\nprovide the first positive results for unbalanced markets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
