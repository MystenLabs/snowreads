The dark matter interaction is\ndescribed by a generalized $\\phi^n$ power-law potential. We perform a stability\nanalysis of these two-fluid objects by studying the onset of the unstable\nradial modes. We find ultra-compact neutron star-dark matter configurations\nwhere the neutron star matter is confined to a core radius of values below $7$\nkm which is unreachable for pure neutron stars. The total gravitational maximum\nmass of these ultra-compact configurations can have values of $3.4 \\, M_\\odot$.\nWith our general ansatz of the power-law potential we show that the compactness\nof these solutions can be extreme, i.e. the compactness is $C = 1/3$ or even\nlarger, making them compact enough to have a light-ring mimicking black holes.\nThese ultra-compact objects are stable and possess a dark matter halo while\nhaving a hadronic matter core. With the addition of dark matter to neutron\nstars recent unusual mass-radius measurements of compact stars can be\nexplained. We conclude that apparently contradictory measurements of neutron\nstar masses and radii could be not only an indication of the presence of dark\nmatter around a the hadronic matter core which is stabilized by the\ngravitational potential of dark matter but could also serve to disentangle the\nselfinteraction strength of dark matter. Our work points to a stiff equation of\nstate for the dark matter fluid, rather than a soft one.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
