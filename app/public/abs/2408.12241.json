Let\n$S$ be an $n$-ary multiplicative set of a commutative Krasner $(m,n)$-hyperring\n$K$ and, $\\phi$ and $\\delta$ be reduction and expansion functions of\nhyperideals of $K$, respectively. The purpose of this paper is to introduce\n$n$-ary $\\phi$-$\\delta$-$S$-primary hyperideals which serve as an extension of\n$S$-primary hyperideals with the help of $\\phi$ and $\\delta$. We present some\nmain results and examples explaining the sructure of this concept. We examine\nthe relations of $n$-ary $S$-primary hyperideals with other classes of\nhyperideals and give some ways to connect them. Moreover, we give some\ncharacterizations of this notion on direct product of commutative Krasner $(m,\nn)$-hyperrings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
