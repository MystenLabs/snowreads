However, yaw control\nusing flapping wings is fundamentally more difficult than using rotating wings.\nIn this study, an insect-scale, tailless robot with four paired tilted flapping\nwings (weighing 1.52 g) to enable yaw control was fabricated. It benefits from\nthe simplicity of a directly driven wing actuator with no transmission and a\nlift control signal; however, it still has an offset in the lift force.\nTherefore, an adaptive controller was designed to alleviate the offset.\nNumerical experiments confirm that the proposed controller outperforms the\nlinear quadratic integral controller. Finally, in a tethered and controlled\ndemonstration flight, the yaw drift was suppressed by the wing-tilting\narrangement and the proposed controller. The simple structure drive system\ndemonstrates the potential for future controlled flights of battery-powered,\ntailless, flapping-wing robots weighing less than 10 grams.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
