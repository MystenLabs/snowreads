Complex social tasks\noften require collaboration among volunteers with diverse skill sets, and their\nwillingness to engage is crucial. Matching tasks with the most suitable\nvolunteers remains a significant challenge. VCS platforms face unpredictable\ndemands in terms of tasks and volunteer requests, complicating the prediction\nof resource requirements for the volunteer-to-task assignment process. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Skill and Willingness-Aware\nVolunteer Matching (SWAM) algorithm, which allocates volunteers to tasks based\non skills, willingness, and task requirements. We also developed a serverless\nframework to deploy SWAM. Our method outperforms conventional solutions,\nachieving a 71% improvement in end-to-end latency efficiency. We achieved a 92%\ntask completion ratio and reduced task waiting time by 56%, with an overall\nutility gain 30% higher than state-of-the-art baseline methods. This framework\ncontributes to generating effective volunteer and task matches, supporting\ngrassroots community coordination and fostering citizen involvement, ultimately\ncontributing to social good.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
