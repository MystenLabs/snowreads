While EVs offer\nenvironmental advantages, barriers like high costs and limited range hinder\ntheir widespread use. Similarly, AGVs, despite their autonomous capabilities,\nface challenges in technology integration and reliability. To address these\nissues, the paper develops a fleet management tool tailored for coordinating\nelectric AGVs in industrial environments. The study focuses on simulating\nelectric AGV performance in a primary aluminum plant to provide insights into\ntheir effectiveness and offer recommendations for optimizing fleet performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
