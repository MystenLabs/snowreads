Using the peak of the Krylov complexity as\na probe, we find change in behavior as we vary $k$ for various $q$. We argue\nthat this captures the change from holographic to non-holographic behavior in\nthe sparse SYK-type models such that model is holographic for all $k \\ge\nk_{\\text{min}}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tSdhQOgLtDPsHhB-T1VRl2OPZP_WUQlEbIvO2XH-NRA","pdfSize":"6516811"}
