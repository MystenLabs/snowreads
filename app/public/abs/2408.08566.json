In this task edition, we\naim to build on the first edition's success by further increasing research\ninterest in this important task and encouraging participants to explore novel\napproaches that will help advance the state-of-the-art. Encouragingly, we found\nresearch interest in the task to be high, with this edition of the task\nattracting a total of 53 participating teams, a significant increase in\nengagement from the previous edition. Overall, our results show that a broad\nrange of innovative approaches were adopted by task participants, with a\npredictable shift towards the use of Large Language Models (LLMs).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
