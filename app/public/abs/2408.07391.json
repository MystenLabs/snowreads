We focus on the large R-charge sector where the number of\noperators insertions becomes very large. In this regime, we demonstrate that\nthe correlators are described by a combination of Wishart and Jacobi matrix\nmodels, coupled in a non-trivial way. The size of the matrices in each model\ncorresponds to the maximal number of insertions for each of the two single\ntrace generators. This dual matrix model representation allows us to extract\nthe behavior of the correlators at weak and strong coupling in a 't Hooft-like\ndouble scaling limit, including nonperturbative corrections. Although this work\nfocuses on $SU(3)$, we expect that our techniques can be extended to $SU(N)$\nfor $N>3$ as well.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
