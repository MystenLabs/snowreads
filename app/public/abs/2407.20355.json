Relying on a recent work of Burness and Guralnick, we obtain further\nresults in the area. For a prime $p$ and a finite group $G$, we use fixed point\nratios to study the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ and the minimal size\nof a covering by proper subgroups of the set of $p$-elements of $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
