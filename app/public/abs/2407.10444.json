The model studied here is the bond\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model with phonon-modulated electron hopping. Previously,\nin the absence of long-range Coulomb interaction, this model demonstrated the\nemergence of small-size, light-mass bipolarons that undergo a superfluid\ntransition at high values of the transition temperature $T_c$ [Physical Review\nX 13, 011010, (2023)]. Our findings indicate that even with the inclusion of\nlong-range Coulomb interaction, $T_c$ remains substantially high, even in the\ndeep adiabatic regime where the phonon frequency is $\\omega/t = 0.5$ and the\nCoulomb interaction $V = U/10$. This result suggests a physical mechanism for\nsuperconductivity in the low-density regime, which could hold relevance for\nongoing experiments on dilute superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
