Moreover, the maximal point cannot be supported by any\nstrictly positive functional, showing that the Arrow-Barankin-Blackwell theorem\nfails. This example discloses the pertinence of the assumption that the cone\nhas a bounded base for the validity of the result in infinite dimensions. Under\nthis latter assumption, the equivalence of the notions of strict maximality and\nmaximality is established\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
