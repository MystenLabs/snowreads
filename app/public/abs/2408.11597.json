The Cauer network components are closed-form\nexpressions consisting only of such parameters that have a clear physical\nmeaning. The parameters include particle permeability, particle conductivity,\ninsulation permeability, insulation thickness, volume fraction, mean particle\ndiameter, variance of particle diameters, and maximal particle diameter. The\nparticle volumes are assumed to be beta-distributed. Since the model is a\nnetwork, it is immediately available in both frequency- and time domains.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X8X0yvU16KJqED9GLXact8-_oHKxsicTK3AdHqZFZxs","pdfSize":"155768"}
