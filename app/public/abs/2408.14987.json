The dynamics undergo qualitative\nchanges due to changes to internal system parameters like stiffness, and also\ndue to changes to external forcing. Mapping out complete bifurcation diagrams\nnumerically or experimentally is resource-consuming, or even infeasible. This\nstudy uses a data-driven approach to investigate how bifurcations can be\nlearned from a few system response measurements. Particularly, the concept of\nreservoir computing (RC) is employed. As proof of concept, a minimal training\ndataset under the resource constraint problem of a Duffing oscillator with\nharmonic external forcing is provided as training data. Our results indicate\nthat the RC not only learns to represent the system dynamics for the trained\nexternal forcing, but it also manages to provide qualitatively accurate and\nrobust system response predictions for completely unknown\n\\textit{multi-}parameter regimes outside the training data. Particularly, while\nbeing trained solely on regular period-2 cycle dynamics, the proposed framework\ncan correctly predict higher-order periodic and even chaotic dynamics for\nout-of-distribution forcing signals.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"--VYpHVdCndt-2jzuKBQ7uDBxtlYI1T-J8u328aRlU0","pdfSize":"5242287"}
