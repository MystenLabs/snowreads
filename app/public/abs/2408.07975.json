While recent Large Language Models (LLMs)\nenhance robots' comprehension of user instructions, their lack of visual\ngrounding constrains their ability to physically interact with the environment.\nThis is because the robot needs to locate the target object for manipulation\nwithin the physical workspace. To this end, we introduce an interactive robotic\nmanipulation framework called Polaris, which integrates perception and\ninteraction by utilizing GPT-4 alongside grounded vision models. For precise\nmanipulation, it is essential that such grounded vision models produce detailed\nobject pose for the target object, rather than merely identifying pixels\nbelonging to them in the image. Consequently, we propose a novel\nSynthetic-to-Real (Syn2Real) pose estimation pipeline. This pipeline utilizes\nrendered synthetic data for training and is then transferred to real-world\nmanipulation tasks. The real-world performance demonstrates the efficacy of our\nproposed pipeline and underscores its potential for extension to more general\ncategories. Moreover, real-robot experiments have showcased the impressive\nperformance of our framework in grasping and executing multiple manipulation\ntasks. This indicates its potential to generalize to scenarios beyond the\ntabletop.
