However,\nstandard police datasets lack the depth to analyze gang violence with such\ngranularity. To address this, we employed a natural language processing\nstrategy to analyze text from a Chicago gangs message board. By identifying\nproper nouns, probabilistically linking them to gang sets, and assuming social\nconnections among names mentioned together, we created a social network dataset\nof 271 individuals across 11 gang sets. Using Louvain community detection, we\nfound that these individuals often connect with gang-affiliated peers from\nvarious gang sets that are physically proximal. Hierarchical logistic\nregression revealed that individuals with ties to homicide victims and central\npositions in the overall gang network were at increased risk of victimization,\nregardless of gang affiliation. This research demonstrates that utilizing\ncrowd-sourced information online can enable the study of otherwise inaccessible\ntopics and populations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
