The usual Brans-Dicke(BD) field and another\nscalar field are minimally coupled to gravity while they interact with each\nother through the Kinetic terms. {The main aim of the present work is to\nexamine whether the model is compatible with cosmic observations. So\ncosmological solutions are obtained using symmetry analysis only.} By imposing\nNoether Symmetry to the Lagrangian of the system the potential of the scalar\nfield as well as the coupling function has been determined. The classical\nsolutions are determined after simplifying the Lagrangian using cyclic\nvariables. Finally, Wheeler-DeWitt(WD) equation in quantum cosmology has been\nformulated and conserved momenta corresponding to Noether symmetry shows the\nperiodic part of the wave function and it helps to have the complete integral\nfor the wave function.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
