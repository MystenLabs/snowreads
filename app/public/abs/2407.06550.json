Levstein, Maldonado and Penazzi have shown that the\nTerwilliger algebra of the Hamming scheme of length $n$ is the $n$-fold\nsymmetric tensor algebra of that of the one-class association scheme.\nFurthermore, Bhattacharyya, Song and Tanaka have established that the\nTerwilliger algebra of the wreath product of a one-class association scheme is\na direct sum of the ``primary'' subalgebra and commutative subalgebras. This\npaper extends these findings to encompass both conclusions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
