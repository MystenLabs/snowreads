The overwhelming volume of misinformation on social media\nand other socioeconomic factors created extraordinary challenges to motivate\npeople to take proper precautions and get vaccinated. In this context, our work\nexplored a novel direction by analyzing an extensive dataset collected over two\nyears, identifying the topics de/motivating the public about COVID-19\nvaccination. We analyzed these topics based on time, geographic location, and\npolitical orientation. We noticed that while the motivating topics remain the\nsame over time and geographic location, the demotivating topics change rapidly.\nWe also identified that intrinsic motivation, rather than external mandate, is\nmore advantageous to inspire the public. This study addresses scientific\ncommunication and public motivation in social media. It can help public health\nofficials, policymakers, and social media platforms develop more effective\nmessaging strategies to cut through the noise of misinformation and educate the\npublic about scientific findings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
