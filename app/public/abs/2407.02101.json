The full\ndiscretization uses the surface finite element method in space and the backward\nEuler method in time. The proposed error indicator bounds the error quantities\nglobally in space from above and below, and globally in time from above and\nlocally from below. A space--time adaptive algorithm is proposed using the\nderived error indicator. Numerical experiments illustrate and complement the\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
