This article utilizes an\nextension of the Non-Relativistic Effective Field Theory (NREFT) and the finite\nvolume particle-dimer framework to derive Lorentz-invariant quantization\nconditions for the $DDK$ three-body system. Using current model input\nconditions, the finite volume energy spectrum of the $DDK$ three-body system\nwas calculated. This new calculation incorporates relativistic kinematics,\nallowing it to be applicable across a broader energy range starting from the\nthreshold. In this work, we present a comprehensive \\( O(p^{2}) \\) calculation.\nThe spurious pole is effectively subtracted within the framework of\nrelativistic kinematics. The spectra in the moving frame are also obtained.\nThese analyses provide a broader testing ground for future lattice simulations.\nThey are expected to reveal more detailed properties of the $DDK$ system and\nother three-hadron systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
