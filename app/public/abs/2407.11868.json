Combined with the production and depletion of\nsurfactants at different locations of source and drains, out-of-equilibrium\nsurface tension gradients can be sustained, resulting in Marangoni flow\npatterns that drive e.g., self-organization of amphiphile myelin assemblies.\nHere, a mathematical model based on the thin-film equations is proposed to\nsimulate these flow patterns. The model equations are based on the surfactant\nsource and drain concentrations, film-height and surfactant bulk concentration.\nWe present a numerical scheme for approximating the model equations and discuss\nthe numerically observed properties of the model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
