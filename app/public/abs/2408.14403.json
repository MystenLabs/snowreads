In this work\nwe attempt to describe the thermodynamics of binary lipid mixtures by mapping\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics systems to two-dimensional simple fluid\nmixtures. By computing and analysing the density fluctuations of this model\nlipid bilayer we determine the numerical value of the quadratic coupling term\nappearing in a model of regular solutions for the DPPC-DLiPC pair of lipids at\nthree different compositions. Our methodology is general and discussed in\ndetail.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
