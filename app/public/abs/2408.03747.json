These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the\nfield, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example,\nhighly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the\nterminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction\nbetween online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally,\nit presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the\nliterature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides\nan extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and\nunsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data,\ncategorising them into different model families and other properties. The\nbiggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is\nno reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This\nproblem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least\none fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and\nrepresentative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most\npublications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions,\nwhich hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances\nin the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
