To differentiate the impact of\nsequence-local versus sequence-nonlocal features of an IDP's charge pattern on\nits conformational dimensions and its phase-separation propensity, the charge\n\"blockiness'' $\\kappa$ and the nonlocality-weighted sequence charge decoration\n(SCD) parameters are compared for their correlations with isolated-chain radii\nof gyration ($R_{\\rm g}$s) and upper critical solution temperatures (UCSTs) of\npolyampholytes modeled by random phase approximation, field-theoretic\nsimulation, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics. SCD is superior to $\\kappa$\nin predicting $R_{\\rm g}$ because SCD accounts for effects of contact order,\ni.e., nonlocality, on dimensions of isolated chains. In contrast, $\\kappa$ and\nSCD are comparably good, though nonideal, predictors of UCST because\nfrequencies of interchain contacts in the multiple-chain condensed phase are\nless sensitive to sequence positions than frequencies of intrachain contacts of\nan isolated chain, as reflected by $\\kappa$ correlating better with\ncondensed-phase interaction energy than SCD.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
