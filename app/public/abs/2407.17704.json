For power weights, such\ninequalities were given by several authors. Owing to the sparse domination, we\ncan treat general weights in Muckenhoupt classes. As a application, we present\nthe local and global existence results for the Hardy-H\\'enon parabolic\nequation, which has a potential belonging to a Muckenhoupt class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
