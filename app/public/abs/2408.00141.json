Currently quantum repeater schemes\ntypically aim to distribute one ebit at a time, the equivalent of one Bell\npair's worth of entanglement. Here we present a method to distribute a\nmacroscopic amount of entanglement across long-distances using a number of\noperations that scales only linearly with the chain length. The scheme involves\nensembles of qubits and entangling them with an $S^z S^z$ interaction, which\ncan be realized using atomic gas ensembles coupled by a shared optical mode.\nUsing only local measurements on the intermediate ensembles, this leaves the\nensembles at the ends of the chain entangled. We show that there are particular\n``magic'' interaction times that allow for distribution of entanglement with\nperfect fidelity, with no degradation with chain length. The scheme is\ndeterministic, such that with suitable local conditional unitary corrections,\nthe same entangled state can always be prepared with good approximation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
