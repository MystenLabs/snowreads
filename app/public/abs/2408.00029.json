Every day we are trying to overcome these limitations and\nimprove our systems for better performance. Among them some problems may not be\nresolvable, for the reason of very basic or root dependencies of physics. In\nthis paper, we have clarified some main drawbacks in our traditional\ncommunication system and provided a conceptual model to overcome these issues\nby using mystic Quantum Entanglement theorem rather than classical or modern\nphysics phenomenon. In the end, we introduced a possible Quantum circuit\ndiagram and Quantum network architecture for end-to-end data communication. It\nis predicted that through this hypothetical model data can be transmitted\nfaster than light and it will be 100% real time between any distances without\nany kinds of traditional communication medium that are being used to date.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
