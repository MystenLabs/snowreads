First, we\nextend to our context some classical results in the context of general flag\nmanifolds, showing that when the element is hyperbolic its dynamics is gradient\nand its fixed points components are given by some suitable right cosets of the\ncentralizer of the element in $K$. Second, we consider the dynamics of a\ngeneral element and characterizes its recurrent set, its minimal Morse\ncomponents and their stable and unstable manifolds in terms of the Jordan\ndecomposition of the element, and we show that each minimal Morse component is\nnormally hyperbolic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
