In general, black hole entropy is subject to the\nGeneralized Second Law of Thermodynamics. For the case of binary black hole\ncoalescence, the difference in corrections to the inspiral and remnant black\nhole entropies is shown, within this law, to be bounded by the difference in\nthe corresponding BH entropies. This latter difference has been measured by\nseveral groups attempting to validate Hawking's Area Theorem on black hole\nhorizons, by analyzing gravitational wave data from possible binary black hole\nmergers. The former difference - that between corrections to remnant and\ninspiral black hole entropies beyond the BH entropy, is thus constrained by a\nbound measured from observational data. We examine the implications of this\nconstraint for general binary black hole coalesence. If calculated entropy\ncorrections follow the essential pattern of BH entropies dictated by the\nHawking Area Theorem, consistency with the observational bound is shown to be\nguaranteed. If they do not, these corrections are then nontrivially constrained\nby the observational bound.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
