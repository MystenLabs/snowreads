However, those representations\nfail at accurately gauging the sound perception associated with these sound\nenvironments, as perception highly depends on the sound sources involved. This\npaper aims at analyzing the need for the representations of sound sources, by\nidentifying the urban stakeholders for whom such representations are assumed to\nbe of importance. Through spoken interviews with various urban stakeholders, we\nhave gained insight into current practices, the strengths and weaknesses of\nexisting tools and the relevance of incorporating sound sources into existing\nurban sound environment representations. Three distinct use of sound source\nrepresentations emerged in this study: 1) noise-related complaints for\nindustrials and specialized citizens, 2) soundscape quality assessment for\ncitizens, and 3) guidance for urban planners. Findings also reveal diverse\nperspectives for the use of visualizations, which should use indicators adapted\nto the target audience, and enable data accessibility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
