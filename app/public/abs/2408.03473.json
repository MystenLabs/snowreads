{"id":"2408.03473","title":"Measures supported on partly normal numbers","authors":"Malabika Pramanik and Junqiang Zhang","authorsParsed":[["Pramanik","Malabika",""],["Zhang","Junqiang",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2024 23:10:38 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-08","timestamp":1722985838000,"abstract":"  A real number $x$ is normal with respect to an integer base $b \\geq 2$ if its\ndigit expansion in this base is ``equitable'', in the sense that for $k \\geq\n1$, every ordered sequence of $k$ digits from $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, b-1\\}$ occurs in\nthe digit expansion of $x$ with the same limiting frequency. Borel's classical\nresult \\cite{b09} asserts that Lebesgue-almost every number $x$ is normal in\nevery base $b \\geq 2$. This three-part article considers sets of partial\nnormality. Given any choice of integer bases $\\mathscr{B}, \\mathscr{B}'\n\\subseteq \\{2, 3, \\ldots\\}$, we investigate measure-theoretic properties of the\nset $\\mathscr{N}(\\mathscr{B}, \\mathscr{B}')$, whose members are, by definition,\nnormal in the bases of $\\mathscr{B}$ and non-normal in the bases of\n$\\mathscr{B}'$. A pair of sets $(\\mathscr{B}, \\mathscr{B}')$ is compatible if\nany $(b, b') \\in \\mathscr{B} \\times \\mathscr{B}'$ is multiplicatively\nindependent. For compatible $(\\mathscr{B}, \\mathscr{B}')$ with $\\mathscr{B}'\n\\ne \\emptyset$, we construct singular probability measures supported on\n$\\mathscr N(\\mathscr{B}, \\mathscr{B}')$ that are both Frostman and Rajchman,\nextending prior work of Pollington \\cite{p81} and Lyons \\cite{l86}. The\nRajchman property completely answers a question of Kahane and Salem\n\\cite{Kahane-Salem-64}, identifying $\\mathscr N(\\mathscr{B}, \\mathscr{B}')$ as\na set of multiplicity (in the Fourier-analytic sense) if and only if\n$(\\mathscr{B}, \\mathscr{B}')$ is compatible. The methodological contribution of\nthe article is the construction of a class of probability measures called\nskewed measures. These measures depend on a number of parameters that can be\nindependently adjusted to ensure (subsets of) properties such as almost\neverywhere normality, non-normality, ball conditions and Fourier decay.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
