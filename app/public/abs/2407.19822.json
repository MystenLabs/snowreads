Here, an exoflop takes a gauged\nLandau-Ginzburg (LG) model, partially compactifies it, and then performs\ncertain birational transformations on it. When certain criteria hold, this can\nprovide a crepant categorical resolution or equivalence of derived categories\nassociated to the gauged LG models. We provide sufficient criteria for when\nthis provides categorical resolutions for (or equivalences between) certain\ncomplete intersections in toric stacks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
