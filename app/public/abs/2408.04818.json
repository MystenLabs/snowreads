Using special functions that diagonalize the single-particle\nHamiltonian, we derive closed-form expressions for these currents. For small\ntemperature differences between the baths, we show that inhomogeneities\nbreaking the mirror symmetry of the chain significantly reduce both heat and\nspin conductivities. Connections with perfect state transfer are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
