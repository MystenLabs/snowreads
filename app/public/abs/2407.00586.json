The focus of this paper is on\ncomputing these parameters on embedded graphs. A typical example of an embedded\ngraph is a planar graph which can be drawn with no edge crossings. It has long\nbeen known that vertex and edge connectivity of planar embedded graphs can be\ncomputed in linear time. Very recently, Biedl and Murali extended the\ntechniques from planar graphs to 1-plane graphs without $\\times$-crossings,\ni.e., crossings whose endpoints induce a matching. While the tools used were\nnovel, they were highly tailored to 1-plane graphs, and do not provide much\nleeway for further extension. In this paper, we develop alternate techniques\nthat are simpler, have wider applications to near-planar graphs, and can be\nused to test both vertex and edge connectivity. Our technique works for all\nthose embedded graphs where any pair of crossing edges are connected by a path\nthat, roughly speaking, can be covered with few cells of the drawing. Important\nexamples of such graphs include optimal 2-planar and optimal 3-planar graphs,\n$d$-map graphs, $d$-framed graphs, graphs with bounded crossing number, and\n$k$-plane graphs with bounded number of $\\times$-crossings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IV2JCfPDdYMplCgCSHmOyoKamP_UUhLU2o10_Wci3ZQ","pdfSize":"1134147"}
