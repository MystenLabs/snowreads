Three cases, two utilizing\nlinear Robin-type slip boundary conditions of differing slip length\n($\\Lambda$), and one non-slip are compared. For the partial-slip cases, a\nstreamwise distribution of slip profile is employed ensuring smooth transition\nbetween no-slip and partial-slip (transition from no-slip to a constant slip\nlength takes 5$\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the inflow boundary layer thickness).\nThe constant target slip length is maintained for $20\\delta$ upstream and\nduring the onset of flow separation. The separation is induced by a wall-normal\nvelocity profile applied at the top boundary. All cases are performed at\n$Re_\\delta = U_{\\infty}\\delta/\\nu = 455$. Initial results indicate that as slip\nlength increases, separation and reattachment are delayed. Most notably, the\nformation and shedding of roller vortices is mitigated as slip length\nincreases, resulting in a less turbulent wake, despite that self-similarity of\nthe plane shear layer is maintained.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
