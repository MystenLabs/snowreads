As verified for unipotent\nrepresentations, it is expected that there is a close relation between the\n(Harish-Chandra-Howe) wavefronts sets of irreducible smooth representations and\ntheir Langlands parameters in the local Langlands correspondence via the\nLusztig-Spaltenstein duality and the Aubert-Zelevinsky duality. In this paper,\nwe define the $\\Gamma$-asymptotic wavefront sets generalizing the notion of\nwavefront sets via the $\\Gamma$-asymptotic expansions (in the sense of\nKim-Murnaghan), and then study the their relation with the Langlands\nparameters. When $G=GL_n$, it turns out that this reduces to the corresponding\nrelation of unipotent representations of the appropriate twisted Levi subgroups\nvia Hecke algebra isomorphisms. For unipotent representations of $GL_n$, we\nalso describe the Harish-Chandra-Howe (HCH) local character expansions of\nirreducible smooth representations using Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, and give\nanother computation of the coefficients in the HCH expansion and the wavefront\nsets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
