Beneficial properties\nof FIR filters are also well-known from digital signal processing, which makes\nthem preferable over infinite impulse response filters in many applications.\nTheir appeal extends to feedback control, offering design flexibility grounded\nsolely on output measurements. However, designing FIR controllers is\nchallenging, which motivates this work. To address the design challenge, we\ninitially show that FIR controller designs for linear systems can equivalently\nbe stated as static or dynamic output feedback problems. After focusing on the\nexistence of stabilizing FIR controllers for a given plant, we tailor two\ncommon design approaches for output feedback to the case of FIR controllers.\nUnfortunately, it will turn out that the FIR characteristics add further\nrestrictions to the LMI-based approaches. Hence, we finally turn to designs\nbuilding on non-convex optimization, which provide satisfactory results for a\nselection of benchmark systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Z6KcUkasi9aeV9bpbYfcboWfFVGChb4Pwd8xJktfCyE","pdfSize":"359434"}
