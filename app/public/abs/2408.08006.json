Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as a\npromising solution for constructing atomistic potentials that can be\ntransferred across different molecular and crystalline systems. Most MLIPs are\ntrained only on energies and forces in vacuum, while an improved description of\nthe potential energy surface could be achieved by including the curvature of\nthe potential energy surface. We present Hessian QM9, the first database of\nequilibrium configurations and numerical Hessian matrices, consisting of 41,645\nmolecules from the QM9 dataset at the $\\omega$B97x/6-31G* level. Molecular\nHessians were calculated in vacuum, as well as water, tetrahydrofuran, and\ntoluene using an implicit solvation model. To demonstrate the utility of this\ndataset, we show that incorporating second derivatives of the potential energy\nsurface into the loss function of a MLIP significantly improves the prediction\nof vibrational frequencies in all solvent environments, thus making this\ndataset extremely useful for studying organic molecules in realistic solvent\nenvironments for experimental characterization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
