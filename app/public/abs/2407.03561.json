The nonlinear transport solver, Tango, enables\nsimulations of very long times, in particular to steady state, by advancing\neach process independently with different time step sizes and couples them\nthrough a relaxed iteration scheme. We examine the use of Anderson Acceleration\n(AA) to reduce the total number of coupling iterations required by interfacing\nTango with the AA implementation, including several extensions to AA, provided\nby the KINSOL nonlinear solver package in SUNDIALS. The ability to easily\nenable and adjust algorithmic options through KINSOL allows for rapid\nexperimentation to evaluate different approaches with minimal effort.\nAdditionally, we leverage the GPTune library to automate the optimization of\nalgorithmic parameters within KINSOL. We show that AA can enable faster\nconvergence in stiff and very stiff tests cases without noise present and in\nall cases, including with noisy fluxes, increases robustness and reduces\nsensitivity to the choice of relaxation strength.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
