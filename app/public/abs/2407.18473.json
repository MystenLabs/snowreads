However, the nature of the spin, charge, and\norbital order in LNO remains unknown, hindering the exploration of the\nmechanism of superconductivity. Here, supported by symmetry analysis and\ndensity functional theory calculations, we unravel a double strip ground state\nof LNO with alternating magnetic moments arrangements. Interestingly, a charge\ndensity wave emerges under this determined magnetic order. Such CDW phase\nexhibits a Pmnm space group with breathing deformation of the NiO$_6$\noctahedra, where the stretching and shrinking of the octahedra correspond to\nthe formation of \\emph{d}$_{z^2}^1$\\emph{d}$_{x^2-y^2}^1$ and\n\\emph{d}$_{z^2}^1$ orbital order. Moreover, we build a first-principles-based\nHamiltonian for LNO, which provides deeper insight into its peculiar magnetic\norder. Our work thus reveals a systematic spin-charge-orbital picture for LNO,\nwhich can be extended to other nickelate-based superconductors, paving the way\nfor determining the mechanism of superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
