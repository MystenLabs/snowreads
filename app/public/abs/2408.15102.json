This structure is readily\ndescribed through the pure spinor superfield formalism, which in particular\nassociates a canonical multiplet for each choice of supersymmetry algebra. We\nstudy the open-closed homotopy algebra associated to (twists of) (resolutions\nof) the canonical multiplet, and show that it fits into a span of open-closed\nhomotopy algebras, extending results of Cederwall et al. arXiv:2304.01258.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
