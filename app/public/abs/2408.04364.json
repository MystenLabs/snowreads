Finally the $n$ blocks of size $k$ are permuted\nin an arbitrary way. For $\\sigma$ chosen uniformly in $G_{n,k}$, let $L_{n,k}$\nbe the length of the longest increasing subsequence in $\\sigma$. For $k,n$\ngrowing, we determine that the limiting mean of $L_{n,k}$ is asymptotic to\n$4\\sqrt{nk}$. This is different from parallel variations of the Vershik-Kerov\ntheorem for colored permutations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
