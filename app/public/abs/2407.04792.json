Integrated photonics has enabled\nchip-scale sources using nonlinear processes, producing high-rate entanglement\nwith sub-100 microwatt power at telecom wavelengths. Many quantum systems\noperate in the visible or near-infrared ranges, necessitating broadband\nvisible-telecom entangled-pair sources for connecting remote systems via\nentanglement swapping and teleportation. This study evaluates broadband\nentanglement generation through spontaneous four-wave mixing in various\nnonlinear integrated photonic materials, including silicon nitride, lithium\nniobate, aluminum gallium arsenide, indium gallium phosphide, and gallium\nnitride. We demonstrate how geometric dispersion engineering facilitates\nphase-matching for each platform and reveals unexpected results, such as robust\ndesigns to fabrication variations and a Type-1 cross-polarized phase-matching\ncondition for III-V materials that expands the operational bandwidth. With\nexperimentally attainable parameters, integrated photonic microresonators with\noptimized designs can achieve pair generation rates greater than ~1 THz/mW$^2$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
