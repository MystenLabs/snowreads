One inequity assumed\nto impact team performance is rest differential, defined as the relative number\nof days between games. Using Bayesian state space models on both game outcomes\nand betting market data, we estimate the competitive effect of rest\ndifferential in American football. We find that the most commonly referred to\ninequities -- both the bye week rest advantage and the mini-bye week rest\nadvantage -- currently show no significant evidence of providing the rested\nteam a competitive edge. Further, we trace a decline in the advantage of a bye\nweek to a 2011 change to the NFL's Collective Bargaining Agreement, which\nrepresents a natural experiment to test the relevance of rest and preparation\nin football. Prior to the agreement, NFL teams off a bye week received a\nsignificant advantage (+2.2 points per game), but since 2011, that benefit has\nbeen mitigated.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
