Our analysis shows that only accelerating black holes\ngenerate gravitational radiation measurable at infinity. This very satisfactory\nresult confirms the goodness of the criterion. To that end, a new metric form\nof the family of exact type D black holes is constructed -- including any\ncosmological constant and a (double-aligned) non-null electromagnetic field --\nwhose expression is suitable for investigation of the asymptotic structure of\nthis large family of spacetimes. The family depends on seven physical\nparameters, namely $m$, $a$, $l$, $\\alpha$, $e$, $g$, and $\\Lambda$ that\ncharacterize mass, specific angular momentum parameter, NUT parameter,\nacceleration, electric and magnetic charges, and the cosmological constant,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
