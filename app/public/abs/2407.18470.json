Conversely,\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) harbor verifiable knowledge and symbolic reasoning\nprowess, thereby complementing LLMs' deficiencies. Against this backdrop, the\nsynergy between KGs and LLMs emerges as a pivotal research direction. Our\ncontribution in this paper is a comprehensive dissection of the latest\ndevelopments in integrating KGs with LLMs. Through meticulous analysis of their\nconfluence points and methodologies, we introduce a unifying framework designed\nto elucidate and stimulate further exploration among scholars engaged in\ncognate disciplines. This framework serves a dual purpose: it consolidates\nextant knowledge while simultaneously delineating novel avenues for real-world\ndeployment, thereby amplifying the translational impact of academic research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
