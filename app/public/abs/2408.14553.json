In this work, we combine a phonon\nmode expansion of the electronic crystal vibrations with the Lindemann\ncriterion to investigate the quantum and thermal stability of these strongly\ncorrelated phases in the exemplary materials of MoSe$_2$ monolayers and twisted\nMoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterostructures. We find that the moir\\'e potential in\nheterobilayers acts as a harmonic trap, flattening the energy dispersion of\nphonon excitations and resulting in an order of magnitude larger melting\ntemperatures compared to monolayer Wigner crystals. Furthermore, we explore the\ntunability of the correlated states with respect to dielectric environment and\nbilayer stacking. In particular, we show that the reduced screening in\nfree-standing TMDs results in a tenfold increase in the melting temperature\ncompared to hBN-encapsulated TMDs. Moreover, the deeper moir\\'e potential in\nR-type stacked heterostructures makes generalized Wigner crystals more stable\nthan in H-type stacking. Overall, our study provides important microscopic\ninsights on the stability and tunability of charge-ordered states in TMD-based\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
