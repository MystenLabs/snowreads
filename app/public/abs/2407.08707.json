In this work, we show these models can\nmemorize responses for training samples and regurgitate them even when the\nrelevant visual information has been removed. This includes Personal\nIdentifiable Information (PII) repeated once in the training set, indicating\nthese models could divulge memorised sensitive information and therefore pose a\nprivacy risk. We quantitatively measure the extractability of information in\ncontrolled experiments and differentiate between cases where it arises from\ngeneralization capabilities or from memorization. We further investigate the\nfactors that influence memorization across multiple state-of-the-art models and\npropose an effective heuristic countermeasure that empirically prevents the\nextractability of PII.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
