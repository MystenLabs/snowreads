At 122(3) GPa, a diffuse signal is observed indicating the\npresence of a non-crystalline phase. Structure factors have been extracted up\nto 182(6) GPa showing the presence of two well-defined peaks. A rapid change in\nthe intensity ratio of the two peaks is identified between 145(10) and 151(10)\nGPa, indicative of a phase change. Present DFT+$U$ calculations of temperatures\nalong Fe$_2$O$_3$ Hugoniot are in agreement with SESAME 7440 and indicate\nrelatively low temperatures, below 2000 K, up to 150 GPa. The non-crystalline\ndiffuse scattering is thus consistent with the - as yet unreported - shock\namorphization of Fe$_2$O$_3$ between 122(3) and 145(10) GPa, followed by an\namorphous-to-liquid transition above 151(10) GPa. Upon release, a\nnon-crystalline phase is observed alongside crystalline $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$.\nThe extracted structure factor and pair distribution function of this release\nphase resemble those reported for Fe$_2$O$_3$ melt at ambient pressure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
