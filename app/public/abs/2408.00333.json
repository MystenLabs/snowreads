When the viscosity\ncoefficient $\\mu(\\rho)$ is a power function of the density\n($\\mu(\\rho)=\\mu\\rho^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha>1$), it is proved that the system will\nadmit a unique global strong solution as long as the initial data are\nsufficiently large. This is the first result concerning the existence of large\nstrong solution for the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations in three\ndimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"IO8_2fWqYsdMo97myjNOi2j3bZyd24xgcyKGu2GjyYM","pdfSize":"188238"}
