We use this method to obtain the algebraic classification\nof complex $3$-dimensional noncommutative Jordan algebras. As a byproduct, we\nobtain the classification of complex $3$-dimensional Kokoris, standard, generic\nPoisson, and generic Poisson--Jordan algebras; and also complex $4$-dimensional\nnilpotent Kokoris and standard algebras. In addition, we consider the geometric\nclassification of varieties of cited algebras, that is the description of its\nirreducible components.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
