Here, we provide a simple pedagogical account of\nthe basic functioning of a feedforward neural network. Then we move forward to\nreviewing two recent applications of machine learning to Earth and Materials\nScience. We will in particular begin by discussing a neural network based\ngeothermobarometer, which returns reliable predictions of the\npressure/temperature conditions of magma storage. Further, we will turn to\nillustrate how machine learning tools, tested on the list of minerals from the\nInternational Mineralogical Association, can help in the search for novel\nsuperconducting materials.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
