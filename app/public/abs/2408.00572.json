These constraints are encoded as sum\nrules on the bulk-to-boundary expansion coefficients. In this paper, we\nconstruct families of sum rules that are (i) complete and (ii) `dual' to sparse\nCFT spectra. The sum rules trivialise the reconstruction of bulk operators in\nstrongly interacting QFTs in AdS space and allow us to write down explicit,\nexact, interacting solutions to the locality problem. Technically, we\ncharacterise `completeness' of a set of sum rules by constructing Schauder\nbases for a certain space of real-analytic functions. In turn, this allows us\nto prove a Paley-Weiner type theorem characterising the space of sum rules.\nRemarkably, with control over this space, it is possible to write down\nclosed-form `designer sum rules', dual to a chosen spectrum of CFT operators\nmeeting certain criteria. We discuss the consequences of our results for both\nanalytic and numerical bootstrap applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
