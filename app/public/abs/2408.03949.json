Specifically, it investigates\na coaxial feed which is displaced from the center (off-center) of\nconcentrically-cascaded cylindrical metasurfaces. Formulas are reported to\nquickly compute the multimodal S-matrix (scattering properties) of a displaced\nfeed from that of the central feed. The theory is rigorously derived based on\nthe addition theorem of Hankel functions for all azimuthal modes. Moreover, the\nresulting multimodal S-matrix is combined with the multimodal wave matrix\ntheory used to model cylindrical metasurfaces, allowing devices to be designed\nthat realize arbitrary field transformations from a displaced coaxial feed. A\ndesign example is reported, which opens new opportunities in the realization of\nrealistic, high-performance cylindrical-metasurface-based devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
