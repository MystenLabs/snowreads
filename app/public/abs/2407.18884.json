The solution mappings\nare considered as set-valued mappings of the measurement vector and the\nregularization parameter. Based on the proposed method, we provide two\nregularity conditions for Lipschitz stability: the weak and strong conditions.\nThe weak condition implies the Lipschitz continuity of solution mapping at the\npoint in question, regardless of solution uniqueness. The strong condition\nyields the local single-valued and Lipschitz continuity of solution mapping.\nWhen applied to the LASSO and Square Root LASSO (SR-LASSO), the weak condition\nis new, while the strong condition is equivalent to some sufficient conditions\nfor Lipschitz stability found in the literature. Specifically, our results\nreveal that the solution mapping of the LASSO is globally (Hausdorff) Lipschitz\ncontinuous without any assumptions. In contrast, the solution mapping of the\nSR-LASSO is not always Lipschitz continuous. A sufficient and necessary\ncondition is proposed for its local Lipschitz property. Furthermore, we fully\ncharacterize the local single-valued and Lipschitz continuity of solution\nmappings for both problems using the strong condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
