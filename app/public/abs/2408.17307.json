By seamlessly integrating the 2D-CNN baseline model\nwith CSO, we unlock the potential for unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in\nAPT detection. The results unveil an impressive accuracy score of $98.4\\%$,\nmarking a significant enhancement in APT detection across various attack\nstages, illuminating a path forward in combating these relentless and\nsophisticated threats.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"ypnC-8fcK2poePgnlWIZkxSV6q32GFWUJqxbJgVsbak","pdfSize":"319325"}
