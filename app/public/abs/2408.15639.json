We use Earth\nObservation (EO) as a canonical functionality of satellites and review its main\ncharacteristics and challenges. We identify the potential of the space segment,\nrepresented by a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, to serve as an\nedge layer for distributed intelligence. Based on that, propose a system\narchitecture that supports semantic and goal-oriented applications for image\nreconstruction and object detection and localization. The simulation results\nshow the intricate trade-offs among energy, time, and task-performance using a\nreal dataset and State-of-the-Art (SoA) processing and communication\nparameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
