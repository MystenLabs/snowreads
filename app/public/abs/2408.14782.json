Here, we study the quantum Fisher information, a central concept in\nquantum metrology, as a multipartite entanglement witness. We generalize the\nentanglement witness functional related to quantum Fisher information regarding\nnon-identical local response operators. We show that it is a good\ninter-molecular entanglement witness for ultrastrong light-matter coupling in\ncavity quantum electrodynamics, including near the superradiant phase\ntransition. We further connect quantum Fisher information to the dipole\ncorrelator, which suggests that this entanglement could be detected by\nabsorption spectroscopy. Our work proposes a general protocol to detect\ninter-molecular entanglement in chemical systems at room temperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
