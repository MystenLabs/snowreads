The detection of single or double taps causes the single-tap latency\nproblem, which creates a bottleneck in terms of the sensitivity of touch\ninputs. To reduce the single-tap latency, we propose a novel\nmachine-learning-based tap prediction method called PredicTaps. Our method\npredicts whether a detected tap is a single tap or the first contact of a\ndouble tap without having to wait for the hundreds of milliseconds\nconventionally required. We present three evaluations and one user evaluation\nthat demonstrate its broad applicability and usability for various tap\nsituations on two form factors (touchpad and smartphone). The results showed\nPredicTaps reduces the single-tap latency from 150-500 ms to 12 ms on laptops\nand to 17.6 ms on smartphones without reducing usability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GDsBDD34V-dyT_yZRFotCTcEKP0nWvnZVHaP-5jeDAM","pdfSize":"5453251"}
