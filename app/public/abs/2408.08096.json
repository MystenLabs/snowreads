To be able to observe the targets shadowed by a\nblockage, we propose a method using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS).\nWe employ a bistatic radar system and scan the obstructed area with RIS using\nhierarchical codebooks (HCB). Moreover, we propose an iterative maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) scheme to yield the optimum sensing accuracy,\nconverging to Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). We take band-specific effects such\nas diffraction and beam squint into account and show that these effects are\nrelevant factors affecting localization performance in RIS-employed radar\nsetups. The results show that under NLOS conditions, the system can still\nlocalize all the targets with very good accuracy using the RIS. The initial\nestimates obtained by the HCBs can provide centimeter-level accuracy, and when\nthe optimal performance is needed, at the cost of a few extra transmissions,\nthe proposed iterative MLE method improves the accuracy to sub-millimeter\naccuracy, yielding the position error bound.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
