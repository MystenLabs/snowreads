We\nprove that every $K$-linear bijection $f : K[X] \\to K[X]$ strongly preserving\nthe set of $k$-free polynomials (or the set of polynomials with a $k$-fold root\nin $K$) is a constant multiple of a $K$-algebra automorphism of $K[X]$, i.e.,\nthere are elements $a, c \\in K^{\\times}$, $b \\in K$ such that $f(P)(X) = c P(a\nX + b)$. When $K$ is a number field or $K=\\mathbb{R}$, we prove that similar\nstatements hold when $f$ preserves the set of polynomials with a root in $K$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
