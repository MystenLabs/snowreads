However, the\napplication of the 3PCF to observed data has been limited due to the\ncomputational challenges of calculating theoretical predictions of the 3PCF\nfrom a bispectrum model. In this paper, we present a new method to compute the\nshear 3PCF efficiently and accurately. We employ the multipole expansion of the\nbispectrum to compute the shear 3PCF, and show that the method is substantially\nmore efficient than direct numerical integration. We found that the\nmultipole-based method can compute the shear 3PCF with 5% accuracy in 10 (40)\nseconds for the single (four) source redshift bin setup. The multipole-based\nmethod can be also used to compute the third-order aperture mass statistics\nquickly and accurately, accounting for the bin-averaging effect on the shear\n3PCF. Our method provides a fast and robust tool for probing the underlying\ncosmological model with third-order statistics of weak lensing shear.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VXR8YBsBhxSu-id4ftWjhYKd1c5YskjedOa6po7RROw","pdfSize":"2452960"}
