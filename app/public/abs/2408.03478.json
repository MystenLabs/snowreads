EEG-based gaze prediction is a new research\ntopic that can serve as an alternative to traditional video-based eye-tracking.\nCompared to the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, we improved the root\nmean-squared-error of EEG-based gaze prediction to 53.06 millimeters, while\nreducing the training time to less than 33% of its original duration.
