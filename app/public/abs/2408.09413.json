This work studies a scenario in which\nmultiple nodes share noisy Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Due to the\ncollapsing nature of quantum measurements, the nodes randomly sample a subset\nof noisy GHZ states for measurement and then estimate the average fidelity of\nthe unsampled states conditioned on the measurement outcome. By developing a\nfidelity-preserving diagonalization operation, analyzing the Bloch\nrepresentation of GHZ states, and maximizing the Fisher information, the\nproposed estimation protocol achieves the minimum mean squared estimation error\nin a challenging scenario characterized by arbitrary noise and the absence of\nprior information. Additionally, this protocol is implementation-friendly as it\nonly uses local Pauli operators according to a predefined sequence. Numerical\nstudies demonstrate that, compared to existing fidelity estimation protocols,\nthe proposed protocol reduces estimation errors in both scenarios involving\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise and correlated noise.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
