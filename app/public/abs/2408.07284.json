One of these is the OASIS Schoolyard Strategy which aims to\ntransform Parisian schoolyards into cool islands. Within this framework, the\nEU-funded ERDF UIA OASIS Project aims to study the transformation of ten\nschoolyards, including an evaluation of their microclimatic performance.The\npresent article presents case study results from one schoolyard using GIS data\nand fixed and mobile microclimatic measurements. An analysis method for mobile\nmeasurement data is proposed, tested and discussed on the basis of this case\nstudy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
