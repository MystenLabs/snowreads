The proton\nsupercurrent entrainment by the neutron superfluid generates, in addition to\nthe neutral supercurrent, a charged current across the interface. Beyond the\nstationary limit, the motions of the neutron vortex line and proton flux tube\narrays, responding to secular changes in the neutron star's rotation rate,\ninduce a time-dependent oscillating Josephson current across this interface. We\nshow that such motion produces radiation from the interface, which is\nphenomenologically significant enough to heat the star and alter its cooling\nrate during the photon cooling era.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JXsHje_pKWakzqDFB4F9f15Xpz4ultjqBhJnIeV2ZWI","pdfSize":"553554"}
