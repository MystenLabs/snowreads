This implies that for a hypergraph\n$H$ with a vertex $v$ that is not isolated and not contained in an induced\nBerge cycle of length $3$, there exists a hypergraph $H'$ with fewer vertices\nthan $H$ such that the independence complex of $H$ is homotopy equivalent to\nthe suspension of the independence complex of $H'$. As an application, we also\nprove that if a hypergraph has no Berge cycle of length $0$ mod $3$, then the\nsum of all reduced Betti numbers of its independence complex is at most $1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
