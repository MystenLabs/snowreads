As the first application, we give series expressions of\nFourier coefficients of the $n$-th root of certain infinite $q$-products. As\nthe second application, we extend Yves Martin's list of multiplicative\nholomorphic eta-quotients of integral weights by first extending the meaning of\nmultiplicativity, then identifying one-dimensional spaces, and finally applying\nWohlfahrt's extension of Hecke operators. A table containing $2277$ of such\neta-quotients is presented. As a related result, we completely classify the\nmultiplier systems induced by eta-quotients of integral exponents. For\ninstance, there are totally $384$ such multiplier systems on $\\Gamma_0(4)$ for\nany fixed weight. We also provide SageMath programs on checking the theorems\nand generating the tables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y9oCRxx4wELPdH7GZjGaHWu30O9h93OdGzO1fPciEXY","pdfSize":"868055","txDigest":"5XaGzN4B9KKAH11oyEpzxanDMaBs4X7gcF2KPiroMazg","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
