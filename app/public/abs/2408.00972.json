In the\nproposed method, the target individual's respiratory features are extracted\nusing the modified raised-cosine-waveform model and their heartbeat features\nare extracted using the mel-frequency cepstral analysis technique. To identify\na suitable combination of features and a classifier, we compare the\nperformances of nine methods based on various combinations of three feature\nvectors with three classifiers. The accuracy of the proposed method in\nperforming individual identification is evaluated using a 79-GHz\nmillimeter-wave radar system with an antenna array in two experimental\nscenarios and we demonstrate the importance of use of the combination of the\nrespiratory and heartbeat features in achieving accurate identification of\nindividuals. The proposed method achieves accuracy of 96.33% when applied to a\nfive-day dataset of six participants and 99.39% when applied to a public\none-day dataset of thirty participants.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
