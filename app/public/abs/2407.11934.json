CoDAT is a tool\ndesigned to maintain consistency between the various levels of code\ndocumentation, e.g. if a line in a code sketch is changed, the comment that\ndocuments the corresponding code is also changed. That is, comments are linked\nand updated so as to remain internally consistent and also consistent with the\ncode. By flagging \"out of date\" comments, CoDAT alerts the developer to\nmaintain up-to-date documentation.\n  We use a large language model to check the semantic consistency between a\nfragment of code and the comments that describe it. Thus we also flag semantic\ninconsistency as well as out of date comments. This helps programers write code\nthat correctly implements a code sketch, and so provides machine support for a\nstep-wise refinement approach, starting with a code sketch and proceeding down\nto code through one or more refinement iterations.\n  CoDAT is implemented in the Intellij IDEA IDE where we use the Code Insight\ndaemon package alongside a custom regular expression algorithm to mark tagged\ncomments whose corresponding code blocks have changed. CoDAT's backend is\nstructurally decentralized to allow a distributed ledger framework for code\nconsistency and architectural compilation tracking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Dm10KkWKwb4STrWzYlGIshR4jrfr2SLGyoV_WSkl4OM","pdfSize":"524962"}
