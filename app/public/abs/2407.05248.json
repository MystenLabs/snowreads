However, this\nparadigm poses a challenge: pseudo-labels generated by image registration come\nwith significant noise. To address this issue, we propose a self-paced sample\nselection framework (SPSS) for BSS. Specifically, SPSS comprises two main\ncomponents: 1) self-paced uncertainty sample selection (SU) for explicitly\nimproving the quality of pseudo labels in the image space, and 2) self-paced\nbidirectional feature contrastive learning (SC) for implicitly improving the\nquality of pseudo labels through enhancing the separability between class\nsemantics in the feature space. Both SU and SC are trained collaboratively in a\nself-paced learning manner, ensuring that SPSS can learn from high-quality\npseudo labels for BSS. Extensive experiments on two public medical image\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of SPSS\nover the state-of-the-art.
