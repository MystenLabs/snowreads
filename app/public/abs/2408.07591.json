Considering that quantum computers\nare dynamical in nature, this paper employs and extends the concepts from the\nverification of dynamical systems to verify properties of quantum circuits. Our\nmain contribution is to propose k-inductive barrier certificates over complex\nvariables and show how to compute them using Hermitian Sum of Squares\noptimization. We apply this new technique to verify properties of different\nquantum circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bKqroObraUM0fAuKLOjESu2DDmde5vH4ZPfIoQfoQQw","pdfSize":"1192020"}
