However, information extraction from chart images is a\ncomplex multitasked process due to style variations and, as a consequence, it\nis challenging to design an end-to-end system. In this study, we propose a deep\nlearning-based framework that provides a solution for key steps in the chart\ninformation extraction pipeline. The proposed framework utilizes hierarchal\nvision transformers for the tasks of chart-type and text-role classification,\nwhile YOLOv7 for text detection. The detected text is then enhanced using Super\nResolution Generative Adversarial Networks to improve the recognition output of\nthe OCR. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that our proposed\nframework achieves excellent performance at every stage with F1-scores of 0.97\nfor chart-type classification, 0.91 for text-role classification, and a mean\nAverage Precision of 0.95 for text detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qWBSqxihu1WSLKxflKyocaraRuBNSh2QUxlWxMTK-RQ","pdfSize":"8286306"}
