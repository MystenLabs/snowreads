Inspired by recent positivity results of Corteel,\nJosuat-Verg\\`{e}s, and Vanden Wyngaerd, we study the evaluation of this\nenumerator at $q=-1$. By considering a cyclic group action on the decorated\nsquare paths which we call cutting and pasting, we show that\n$\\left.\\left\\langle \\frac{[n-k]_q}{[n]_q}\\Delta_{e_{n-k}}\\omega(p_n),\nh_1^n\\right\\rangle\\right|_{q=-1}$ is $0$ whenever $n-k$ is even, and is a\npositive polynomial related to the Euler numbers when $n-k$ is odd. We also\nshow that the combinatorics of this enumerator is closely connected to that of\nthe Dyck path enumerator for $\\langle\\Delta_{e_{n-k-1}}'e_n,h_1^n\\rangle$\nconsidered by Corteel-Josuat Verg\\`{e}s-Vanden Wyngaerd.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"P__PGBCBlIL3V_vidvIqX8vuQk0ji9zN7Rh6NqWYGn0","pdfSize":"702741"}
