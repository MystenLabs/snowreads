We also introduce the\nnotion of homogeneous O-operators of BiHom-Jordan superalgebra associated to a\ngiven representation. Additionnaly we define the BiHom-pre-Jordan superalgebras\nstructures, in which we study the relationship between BiHom-pre-Jordan\nsuperalgebras and BiHom-Jordan superalgebras via a homogeneous O-operators.\nSome other related results are considered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
