Most of these IoT\ndevices lack ready-to-use hardware or software for power measurement. A\ncost-effective solution is to use low-end consumer-grade power meters. However,\nthese low-end power meters cannot provide accurate instantaneous power\nmeasurements. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use approach to derive an\ninstantaneous software-based energy estimation model with only low-end power\nmeters based on data-driven analysis through machine learning. Our solution is\ndemonstrated with a Jetson Nano board and Ruideng UM25C USB power meter.\nVarious machine learning methods combined with our smart data collection method\nand physical measurement are explored. Benchmarks were used to evaluate the\nderived software-power model for the Jetson Nano board and Raspberry Pi. The\nresults show that 92% accuracy can be achieved compared to the long-duration\nmeasurement. A kernel module that can collect running traces of utilization and\nfrequencies needed is developed, together with the power model derived, for\npower prediction for programs running in real environment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Operating Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
