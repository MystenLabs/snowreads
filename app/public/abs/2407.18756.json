It is therefore approached as a\nstochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true\nand the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of\nmetamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is\ndesigned to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for\nhuman trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or\nincorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over\nsource test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human\ntrajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human\nbehaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the\ninput data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic\nhuman trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion\nto statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a\nlabel-preserving metamorphic relation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
