Accurately predicting CLTV is challenging in real-world business\nscenarios, as the distribution of CLTV is complex and mutable. Firstly, there\nis a large number of users without any consumption consisting of a long-tailed\npart that is too complex to fit. Secondly, the small set of high-value users\nspent orders of magnitude more than a typical user leading to a wide range of\nthe CLTV distribution which is hard to capture in a single distribution.\nExisting approaches for CLTV estimation either assume a prior probability\ndistribution and fit a single group of distribution-related parameters for all\nsamples, or directly learn from the posterior distribution with manually\npredefined buckets in a heuristic manner. However, all these methods fail to\nhandle complex and mutable distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel\noptimal distribution selection model OptDist for CLTV prediction, which\nutilizes an adaptive optimal sub-distribution selection mechanism to improve\nthe accuracy of complex distribution modeling. Specifically, OptDist trains\nseveral candidate sub-distribution networks in the distribution learning module\n(DLM) for modeling the probability distribution of CLTV. Then, a distribution\nselection module (DSM) is proposed to select the sub-distribution for each\nsample, thus making the selection automatically and adaptively. Besides, we\ndesign an alignment mechanism that connects both modules, which effectively\nguides the optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on both two public\nand one private dataset to verify that OptDist outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines. Furthermore, OptDist has been deployed on a large-scale financial\nplatform for customer acquisition marketing campaigns and the online\nexperiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of OptDist.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
