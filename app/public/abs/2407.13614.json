All discrete connections induce a connection on the same\nprincipal bundle via a process known as the Lie or derivative functor. The\nIntegration Problem consists of describing, for a principal connection\n$\\mathcal{A}$, the set of all discrete connections whose associated connection\nis $\\mathcal{A}$. Our first result is that for \\emph{flat} principal\nconnections, the Integration Problem has a unique solution among the\n\\emph{flat} discrete connections. More broadly, under a fairly mild condition\non the structure group $G$ of the principal bundle $\\phi$, we prove that the\nexistence part of the Integration Problem has a solution that needs not be\nunique. Last, we see that, when $G$ is abelian, given compatible continuous and\ndiscrete curvatures the Integration Problem has a unique solution constrained\nby those curvatures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"VYNegsfB5cG0eqWMm_ZV4Pl8xaWPok43B7lnpZ_kQ1g","pdfSize":"391904"}
