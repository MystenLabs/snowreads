For that, the biobank data has to meet certain\ncriteria which can be formulated as adherence to the FAIR (findable,\naccessible, interoperable and reusable) principles.\n  We developed a tool, CollectionLocator, which aims at increasing the FAIR\ncompliance of biobank data by supporting researchers in identifying which\nbiobank and which collection are likely to contain cases (material and data)\nsatisfying the requirements of a defined research project when the detailed\nsample data is not available due to privacy restrictions. The CollectionLocator\nis based on an ontology-based metadata model to address the enormous\nheterogeneities and ensure the privacy of the donors of the biological samples\nand the data. Furthermore, the CollectionLocator represents the data and\nmetadata quality of the collections such that the quality requirements of the\nrequester can be matched with the quality of the available data. The concept of\nCollectionLocator is evaluated with a proof-of-concept implementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
