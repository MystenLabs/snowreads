Recent studies of quantum dots\nfabricated on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes have shown\ncontrol and readout of individual spin qubits, yet quantum processors require\ntwo-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm wafer MOS process\ncustomized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron\nspins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, forming the basis of an\nentangling gate such as $\\sqrt{\\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times\nof up to $T_2^{*}\\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of 10. We further\nextend the coherence by up to an order of magnitude using an echo sequence. For\nreadout, we introduce a dispersive readout technique, the radiofrequency\nelectron cascade, that amplifies the signal while retaining the spin-projective\nnature of dispersive measurements. Our results demonstrate an industrial grade\nplatform for two-qubit operations, alongside integration with dispersive\nsensing techniques.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
