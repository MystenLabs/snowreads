A novel pixelated receiving antenna has been\ndeveloped to match the diode impedance of a rectifier, eliminating the need for\na separate matching circuit in the rectenna's rectifier. The receiving antenna\nconfiguration is fine-tuned via a binary optimization algorithm. A rectenna is\ndesigned using optimization algorithm at 2.5 GHz with 38% RF-DC conversion\nefficiency when subjected to 0 dBm incident power, with an output voltage of\n815mV. The proposed rectenna demonstrates versatility across various low-power\nWPT (wireless power transfer) applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
