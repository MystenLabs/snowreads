Planes\nare commonplace in man-made environments, offering an active means to reduce\ndrift, due to their extensive spatial and temporal observability. To make full\nuse of planar information, we propose a novel visual-inertial odometry (VIO)\nusing an RGBD camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), effectively\nintegrating point and plane features in an extended Kalman filter (EKF)\nframework. Depth information of point features is leveraged to improve the\naccuracy of point triangulation, while plane features serve as direct\nobservations added into the state vector. Notably, to benefit long-term\nnavigation,a novel graph-based drift detection strategy is proposed to search\noverlapping and identical structures in the plane map so that the cumulative\ndrift is suppressed subsequently. The experimental results on two public\ndatasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nlocalization accuracy and meanwhile generates a compact and consistent plane\nmap, free of expensive global bundle adjustment and loop closing techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
