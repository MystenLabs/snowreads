While time-resolved XRD has received increasing\nattention, the extraction of information content from signals is challenging\nand requires theoretical support. In this work, we combined X-ray scattering\ntheory and trajectory surface hopping approach to resolve dynamical changes in\nthe electronic structure of photo-excited molecules by studying time evolution\nof electron density changes between electronic excited states and ground state.\nUsing pyrazine molecule as an example, we show that key features of reaction\npathways can be identified, enabling the capture of structural changes\nassociated with electronic transitions for a photo-excited molecule.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TeuUAqlOfW4orHjAPmUz8li7oteWpftvNLLQp1qD7Jo","pdfSize":"1292870"}
