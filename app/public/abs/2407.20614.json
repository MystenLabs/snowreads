This work studies the generalization of cover-free families\nfrom sets to finite vector spaces. Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space\nover the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and let $\\left[V\\atop k\\right]_q$ denote\nthe family of all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. A family\n$\\mathcal{F}\\subseteq \\left[V\\atop k\\right]_q$ is called cover-free if there\nare no three distinct subspaces $F_{0}, F_{1}, F_{2}\\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that\n$F_{0}\\leq (F_{0}\\cap F_{1})+(F_{0}\\cap F_{2})$. A family $\\mathcal{H}\\subseteq\n\\left[V\\atop k\\right]_q$ is called a $q$-Steiner system $S_{q}(t, k, n)$ if for\nevery $T\\in \\left[V\\atop t\\right]_q$, there is exactly one $H\\in \\mathcal{H}$\nsuch that $T\\leq H$. In this paper we investigate cover-free families in the\nvector space $V$. Firstly, we determine the maximum size of a cover-free family\nin $\\left[V\\atop k\\right]_q$. Secondly, we characterize the structures of all\nmaximum cover-free families which are closely related to $q$-Steiner systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
