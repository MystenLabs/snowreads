This paper\npresents a search for such low mass narrow resonances decaying into hadrons\nusing 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data recorded with the ATLAS\ndetector at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The resonances are searched for\nin the invariant mass spectrum of large-radius jets with two-pronged\nsubstructure that are recoiling against an energetic photon from initial state\nradiation, which is used as a trigger to circumvent limitations on the maximum\ndata recording rate. This technique enables the search for boosted hadronically\ndecaying resonances in the mass range 20-100 GeV hitherto unprobed by the ATLAS\nCollaboration. The observed data are found to agree with Standard Model\npredictions and 95% confidence level upper limits are set on the coupling of a\nhypothetical new spin-1 $Z'$ resonance with Standard Model quarks as a function\nof the assumed $Z'$-boson mass in the range between 20 and 200 GeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MPu9Bfm6_k6CgbnvTWWM96-7szz6H4Hhwnt8fORwN38","pdfSize":"1988748"}
