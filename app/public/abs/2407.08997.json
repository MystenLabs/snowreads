For\ncubic nonlinearities $a(t,x)\\phi^3$, we prove $\\phi(t, x) = 2c t^{-2} +\nO(t^{-3+})$ in compact spatial regions, with $c$ computable. For $a(t,x)\\phi^p$\nwith $p \\geq 4$, we show $\\phi(t, x) = d t^{-3} + O(t^{-4+})$, extending\nPrice's law to the nonlinear setting. Our approach combines radiation field\nanalysis with a generalized low-energy resolvent expansion, providing a bridge\nbetween spectral and physical space methods. These results sharpen previous\ndecay estimates and yield complete asymptotics across the entire spacetime,\nincluding black hole backgrounds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
