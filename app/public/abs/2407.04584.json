We describe two emblematic instances in which saddle-point\nestimates may be used to evaluate the frequency, on the set of integers\n$n\\leqslant x$, of the event $\\{f(n)\\leqslant g(n)\\}$ from those relevant to\nthe event $\\{f(n)\\leqslant y\\}$. The first example revisits Dickman's\nhistorical contribution to the theory of friable integers. The second is\nconcerned with the distribution of the squarefree kernel of an integer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
