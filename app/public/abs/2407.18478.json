It has the advantage of\nunderstanding the connection between mathematical calculations and physical\ninterpretations better. Quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman's\npath integral is introduced and reviewed in this paper. Based on the results of\ntransient first-order interference of two independent light beams, it is\npredicted that the classical model for electric field of thermal light\nintroduced by classical optical textbooks may not be accurate. The physics of\ntwo-photon bunching of thermal light and Hong-Ou-Mandel dip of entangled photon\npairs is the same, which can be interpreted by constructive and destructive\ntwo-photon interference, respectively. Quantum optical coherence theory based\non Feynman's path integral is helpful to understand the coherence properties of\nlight, which may eventually lead us to the answer of the question: what is a\nphoton?\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
