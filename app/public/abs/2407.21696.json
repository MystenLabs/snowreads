{"id":"2407.21696","title":"GEO and LEO: The Final Frontier for Plutonic FFP Parallax","authors":"Andrew Gould (OSU, MPIA)","authorsParsed":[["Gould","Andrew","","OSU, MPIA"]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 15:40:21 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-01","timestamp":1722440421000,"abstract":"  I show that microlens parallaxes, $\\pi_{\\rm E}$, can be derived for\nfree-floating planets (FFPs) with masses down to that of Pluto, by combining\nobservations from a satellite in geosynchronous (GEO) orbit with another\nobservatory that is on or near Earth's surface, i.e., either ground-based or in\nlow Earth orbit (LEO). Because these low-mass FFPs typically have measurements\nof the angular Einstein radius, $\\theta_{\\rm E}$, from finite-source effects,\nsuch $\\pi_{\\rm E}$ measurements directly yield the FFP mass $M=\\theta_{\\rm\nE}/\\kappa \\pi_{\\rm E}$ where $\\kappa$ is a physical constant. Such Earth-GEO\nmeasurements almost perfectly complement Earth-L2 measurements, which extend to\nhigher FFP mass and greater FFP distance. LEO-only observations can yield mass\nmeasurement at even smaller FFP mass and nearer FFP distances. I discuss\nmethods for breaking the Refsdal (1966) two-fold degeneracy in $\\pi_{{\\rm\nE},\\pm}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
