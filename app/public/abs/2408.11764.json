There is a growing need for\ninvestigation into how biomechanical and physical abilities can be optimized\nfor esports through training. One such research avenue concerns the ability of\nesports players to perform balance tasks due to the prolonged sedentary states\nthat are required to reach the top echelon of performance.\n  Our aim for this work is to describe and compare physical abilities (balance,\ngrip strength, and self-reported training habits) of top Polish StarCraft~2\ntournament players.\n  Esports players differed significantly from the reference group in their\nability to balance on one leg. Additionally, in a grip strength test, the\nesports group fared worse than the reference group in all consecutive attempts.\n  Despite self-reported physical activity in the esports group, player fitness\nrequires further research. Training optimization could offset the issues\narising from sedentary activity, and intensifying esports training so it could\ntake less time overall.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-WUnUiQrci3UtqOfPCEY2Q-OWzWN04haTGFOzkBkmzc","pdfSize":"409551"}
