However, recent studies have shown that\nintegrating confidence calibration with CP can lead to a degradation in\nefficiency. In this paper, We propose an adaptive approach that considers the\nclassifier's uncertainty and employs entropy-based reweighting to enhance the\nefficiency of prediction sets for conformal classification. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that this method significantly improves efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
