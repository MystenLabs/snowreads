However, recent studies have shown that\nintegrating confidence calibration with CP can lead to a degradation in\nefficiency. In this paper, We propose an adaptive approach that considers the\nclassifier's uncertainty and employs entropy-based reweighting to enhance the\nefficiency of prediction sets for conformal classification. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that this method significantly improves efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sBJjFGdL6QuCvYc4PwvAj8iDP5QMIT4wCysZbDZwww0","pdfSize":"420116","objectId":"0x231f878ee6d3d0ae68953aa60b62545b92f1623638c9176768062c3eea6ec022","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
