The matrix\nquantization problem is solved in the GMRF parameter space, simplifying the\nharder problem of quantizing a large matrix subject to an orthonormality\nconstraint to a low-dimensional vector quantization problem. Typically used\nGMRF parameter estimation methods such as maximum-likelihood (ML) do not\nnecessarily maximize the coding performance of the resulting transform\nmatrices. To this end we propose a method for GMRF parameter estimation from\nsample image data, which maximizes the high-rate transform coding gain. We also\ninvestigate the application of GMRF-based transforms to variable block-size\nadaptive transform coding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
