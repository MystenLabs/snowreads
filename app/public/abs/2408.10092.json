High redundancy inevitably leads to high network resource\nconsumption, and it may constrain the data transmission rate of the network. To\naddress excessive network resource consumption, many studies have explored\nbroadcasting mechanisms in structured P2P overlay networks. However, existing\nDHT-based algorithms cannot assess the quality of neighbors, which is crucial\nfor broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the Neighbor Evaluation\nmechanism to select relay nodes based on their evaluated contributions.\nAccording to experimental results, the Neighbor Evaluation mechanism has a\nsignificant effect on both broadcast latency and coverage rate.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
