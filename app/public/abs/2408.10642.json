The paradigm contains supervised fine tuning and\nreinforce learning from human feedback. This paradigm is also used in\ndownstream scenarios to adapt LLM to specific corpora and applications.\nComparing to SFT, there are many efforts focused on RLHF and several algorithms\nbeing proposed, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, KTO, MinorDPO and etc. Meanwhile most\nefforts for SFT are focused on how to collect, filter and mix high quality\ndata. In this article with insight from DPO and MinorDPO, we propose a training\nmetric for SFT to measure the discrepancy between the optimized model and the\noriginal model, and a loss function MinorSFT that can increase the training\neffectiveness, and reduce the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and\noriginal LLM.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
