Employing a diverse range of\ntechniques, including subadditive ergodic theorems and tailored modifications\nsuited for polygonal paths within groups, the thesis examines the asymptotic\nshape under varying conditions. The investigation extends to subadditive\ncocycles characterized by at least and at most linear growth. Moreover, the\nstudy delves into moderate deviations for FPP models on RGGs, refining previous\nresults with theorems that quantify its speed of convergence to the limiting\nshape, the fluctuation of the geodesics, and its spanning trees. Additionally,\nwe apply the obtained results in a competition model to verify the positive\nprobability of coexistence of two species competing for territory in a random\ngeometric graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
