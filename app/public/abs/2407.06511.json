We introduce and study a $q$-deformation of\nthe Ehrhart series, based on the notions of harmonic spaces and Macaulay's\ninverse systems for coordinate rings of finite point configurations. We\nconjecture that this $q$-Ehrhart series is a rational function, and introduce\nand study a bigraded algebra whose Hilbert series matches the $q$-Ehrhart\nseries. Defining this algebra requires a new result on Macaulay inverse systems\nfor Minkowski sums of point configurations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
