Recent studies have\nproposed new EDAs that employ mutation operators in standard EDAs to increase\nthe population diversity. We present a new mutation operator, a matrix\ntranspose, specifically designed for Bayesian structure learning, and we\nevaluate its performance in Bayesian structure learning. The results indicate\nthat EDAs with transpose mutation give markedly better performance than\nconventional EDAs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
