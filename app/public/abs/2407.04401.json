A general\nstrategy is proposed here in which WENO operators are not only used to\nreconstruct fluxes but also the nonconservative products of the system.\nMoreover, if a Roe linearization is available, the nonconservative products can\nbe computed through matrix-vector operations instead of path-integrals. The\nmethods are extended to problems with source terms and two different strategies\nare introduced to obtain well-balanced schemes. These numerical schemes will be\nthen applied to the two-layer shallow water equations in one- and two-\ndimensions to obtain high-order methods that preserve water-at-rest steady\nstates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
