Many\nreal-life examples illustrate its 4 types of sets, 4 types of functions, and 76\ntypes of constraints. This rich panoply of constraints is the main strength of\nthis model, guaranteeing that any data value stored in a database is plausible,\nwhich is the highest possible level of syntactical data quality. A (E)MDM\nexample scheme is presented and contrasted with some popular family tree\nsoftware products.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
