Consider a ring $R$, we denote by $\\textrm{Id}(R)$ the\nset of all idempotent elements in $R$. Let $a$ is an element of $R$. The\nelement absorb Topology related to $a$ is defined as $\\tau_a:=\\{ I\\subseteq R |\nIa \\subseteq I\\} \\subseteq P(R)$. Since this topology is obtained from act of\nring, it explains Some of algebraic properties of ring in Topological language\n.In a special case when $e$ ia an idempotent element, $\\tau_e:=\\{ I\\subseteq R\n| Ie \\subseteq I\\} \\subseteq P(R)$. We present Topological description of the\npierce decomposition $ R=Re\\oplus R(1-e)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
