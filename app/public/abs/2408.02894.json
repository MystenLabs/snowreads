Strongest nonlocality is the strongest form\nof quantum nonlocality recently presented in multipartite quantum systems: a\nset of orthogonal multipartite quantum states is strongest nonlocal if the only\northogonality-preserving local measurements on the subsystems in every\nbipartition are trivial. In this work, we found a construction of strongest\nnonlocal sets in $\\mathbb{C}^{d_{1}}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d_{2}}\\otimes\n\\mathbb{C}^{d_{3}}$ $(2\\leq d_{1}\\leq d_{2}\\leq d_{3})$ of size $d_2d_3+1$\nwithout stopper states. Then we obtain the strongest nonlocal sets in\nfour-partite systems with $d^3+1$ orthogonal states in $\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes\n\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d}$ $(d\\geq2)$ and\n$d_{2}d_{3}d_{4}+1$ orthogonal states in $\\mathbb{C}^{d_{1}}\\otimes\n\\mathbb{C}^{d_{2}}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d_{3}}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d_{4}}$ $(2\\leq\nd_{1}\\leq d_{2}\\leq d_{3}\\leq d_{4})$. Surprisingly, the number of the elements\nin all above constructions perfectly reaches the recent conjectured lower bound\nand reduces the size of the strongest nonlocal set in $\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes\n\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d}$ of\n[\\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.062407}{Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{108},\n062407 (2023)}] by $d-2$. In particular, the general optimal construction of\nthe strongest nonlocal set in four-partite system is completely solved for the\nfirst time, which further highlights the theory of quantum nonlocality from the\nperspective of state discrimination.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
