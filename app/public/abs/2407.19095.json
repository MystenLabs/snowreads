We propose a\nshift in direction that more broadly embraces existing data infrastructure by\nreconsidering the semantic web's logical foundations. We argue to shift\nattention away from description logic, which has so far underpinned the\nsemantic web, to a different fragment of first-order logic. We argue, using\nexamples from the (geo)spatial domain, that by doing so, the semantic web can\nbe approached as a traditional data migration and integration problem at a\nmassive scale. That way, a huge amount of existing tools and theories can be\ndeployed to the semantic web's benefit, and the original vision of ontology as\nshared abstraction be reinvigorated.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
