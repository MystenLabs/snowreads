Conventional techniques such as\nbinary, semantic, and instance segmentation share a common drawback: they do\nnot accommodate the parts of instruments obscured by tissues or other\ninstruments. Precisely predicting the full extent of these occluded instruments\ncan significantly improve laparoscopic surgeries by providing critical guidance\nduring operations and assisting in the analysis of potential surgical errors,\nas well as serving educational purposes. In this paper, we introduce Amodal\nSegmentation to the realm of surgical instruments in the medical field. This\ntechnique identifies both the visible and occluded parts of an object. To\nachieve this, we introduce a new Amoal Instruments Segmentation (AIS) dataset,\nwhich was developed by reannotating each instrument with its complete mask,\nutilizing the 2017 MICCAI EndoVis Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge\ndataset. Additionally, we evaluate several leading amodal segmentation methods\nto establish a benchmark for this new dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
