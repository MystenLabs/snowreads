In the shot noise of a NbSe$_2$/Au tunnel junction (TJ), we identify\nAndreev reflection regime by demonstrating the effective charge doubling.\nFurther, by creating temperature gradient across the TJ and measuring its\ndelta-$T$ noise in the normal state, we extract electron-phonon scattering\nlength in NbSe$_2$ and its $T$-dependence. The results of delta-$T$ noise\nmeasurements in the absence of a magnetic field when the flake is\nsuperconducting are in qualitative agreement with expectations. The introduced\napproach is promising for the study of nonequilibrium configurations in\nsuperconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
