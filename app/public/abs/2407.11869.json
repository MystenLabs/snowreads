The\nmarket is traditionally examined on the basis of individual's price-taking\nbehavior. However, this assumption breaks in markets such as online advertising\nand e-commerce, where several oligopolists dominate the market and are able to\ncompete with each other via strategic actions. Motivated by this, we study the\nprice competition among sellers in linear Fisher markets. From an algorithmic\ngame-theoretic perspective, we establish a model to analyze behaviors of buyers\nand sellers that are driven by utility-maximizing purposes and also constrained\nby computational tractability. The main economic observation is the role played\nby personalization: the classic benchmark market outcome, namely competitive\nequilibrium, remains to be a steady-state if every buyer must be treated\n\"equally\"; however, sellers have the incentive to personalize, and as a result\nthe market would become more unpredictable and less efficient. In addition, we\nbuild a series of algorithmic and complexity results along the road to justify\nour modeling choices and reveal market structures. We find interesting\nconnections between our model and other computational problems such as stable\nmatching, network flow, etc. We believe these results and techniques are of\nindependent interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
