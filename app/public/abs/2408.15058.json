A relevant\nexample is the study of mortality after a cancer diagnosis, where time since\ndiagnosis but also age may jointly determine the hazards of death due to\ndifferent causes. Multiple time scales have rarely been explored in the context\nof competing events. Here, we propose a model in which the cause-specific\nhazards vary smoothly over two times scales. It is estimated by two-dimensional\n$P$-splines, exploiting the equivalence between hazard smoothing and Poisson\nregression. The data are arranged on a grid so that we can make use of\ngeneralized linear array models for efficient computations. The R-package\nTwoTimeScales implements the model.\n  As a motivating example we analyse mortality after diagnosis of breast cancer\nand we distinguish between death due to breast cancer and all other causes of\ndeath. The time scales are age and time since diagnosis. We use data from the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. In the SEER data,\nage at diagnosis is provided with a last open-ended category, leading to\ncoarsely grouped data. We use the two-dimensional penalised composite link\nmodel to ungroup the data before applying the competing risks model with two\ntime scales.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
