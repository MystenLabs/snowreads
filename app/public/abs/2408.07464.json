Our goal is to derive the higher-derivative corrections to the\nDirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) Lagrangian for both the bulk and boundary terms.\n  For the bulk terms, we calculate the $\\alpha'$ corrections for the massless\nopen string fields, up to the 8th order in the dimensionless Maxwell field\nstrength. We demonstrate that the bulk Lagrangian can satisfy the T-duality\nconstraint without residual total derivative terms in the base space. This\ndetermines the most general independent couplings of the massless open string\nfields in the bulk Lagrangian, encompassing 145 coupling constants, up to three\nparameters. Two of these parameters are physical and are determined by\ndisk-level S-matrix elements, while the third is unphysical and can be\neliminated by field redefinitions and integration by parts. The final result\nfor the bulk Lagrangian consists of 49 couplings.\n  For the boundary terms, the application of T-duality symmetry to massless\nopen and closed string fields enables us to extend the DBI Lagrangian to\ninclude the boundary unit normal vector field $n_\\mu$ and its first derivative.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
