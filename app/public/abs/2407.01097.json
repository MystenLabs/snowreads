The recently proposed\noccupancy flow field prediction method has shown to be a more effective and\nscalable representation compared to general trajectory prediction methods.\nHowever, in complex multi-agent traffic scenarios, it remains difficult to\nmodel the interactions among various factors and the dependencies among\nprediction outputs at different time steps. In view of this, we propose a\ntransformer-based hierarchical feature guided network (HGNET), which can\nefficiently extract features of agents and map information from visual and\nvectorized inputs, modeling multimodal interaction relationships. Second, we\ndesign the Feature-Guided Attention (FGAT) module to leverage the potential\nguiding effects between different prediction targets, thereby improving\nprediction accuracy. Additionally, to enhance the temporal consistency and\ncausal relationships of the predictions, we propose a Time Series Memory\nframework to learn the conditional distribution models of the prediction\noutputs at future time steps from multivariate time series. The results\ndemonstrate that our model exhibits competitive performance, which ranks 3rd in\nthe 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
