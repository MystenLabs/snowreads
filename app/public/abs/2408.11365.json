With the increasing ease of manipulating or generating human\nfaces in images, the potential misuse of such forged images is a growing\nconcern. This study aims to comprehensively review the knowledge structure and\nresearch hotspots related to image anti-forensics by analyzing publications in\nthe Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The bibliometric analysis\nconducted using VOSViewer software has revealed the research trends, major\nresearch institutions, most influential publications, top publishing venues,\nand most active contributors in this field. This is the first comprehensive\nbibliometric study summarizing research trends and developments in image\nanti-forensics. The information highlights recent and primary research\ndirections, serving as a reference for future research in image anti-forensics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
