However, they often fail when faced with the\nlimitless permutations of real-world unstructured environments. This motivates\nrobotics methods which learn from experience, rather than follow a pre-defined\nset of rules. In this thesis, we present a range of learning-based methods\naimed at enabling robots, operating in dynamic and unstructured environments,\nto better understand their surroundings, anticipate the actions of others, and\ntake informed actions accordingly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cw_MtxN6qFinPLMzCNAwJLTstpMm5BleHaA1uGhkcMk","pdfSize":"48117858"}
