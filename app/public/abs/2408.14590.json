In\nprevious work, we developed the theoretical basis for applications of spread\ndimension as an intrinsic dimension estimator. In this paper we introduce the\npseudo spread dimension which is an efficient approximation of spread\ndimension, and we derive a formula for the standard error associated with this\napproximation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
