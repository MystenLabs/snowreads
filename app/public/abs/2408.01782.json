By decomposing emissions time series\ninto trend and cycle components and considering them within a panel data\nframework, our research highlights that the impacts of low-carbon economy\nexpenditures vary, qualitatively and quantitatively, with the targeted regions'\ndevelopment level. We find significant emissions reductions in developed and\ntransition regions yet less favourable outcomes in less developed areas.\nFurther analysis into specific greenhouse gas emissions types (CO$_2$, CH$_4$,\nand N$_2$O) reveals inconsistent impacts, underscoring the complexity of\nachieving emissions reductions. Our findings emphasise the need for tailored\nenvironmental strategies that accommodate the economic disparities of regions\nin the European Union.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
