This work is a\nuser guide to our Python library PyTreeNet. It includes code examples and\nexercises to introduce the library's functions and familiarise the reader with\nthe concepts and methods surrounding tree tensor networks. PyTreeNet implements\nall the tools required to implement general tree tensor network methods, such\nas tensor decompositions and arbitrary tree structures. The main focus is on\nthe time evolution of quantum systems. This includes an introduction to tree\ntensor network states and operators and the time-evolving block decimation and\ntime-dependent variational principle. The library's capabilities are showcased\nwith the example of a modified transverse field Ising model on tree structures\nthat go far beyond the ability of common state vector methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
