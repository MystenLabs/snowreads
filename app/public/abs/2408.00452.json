An insight into the basics for understanding the interior volume\nis presented. A general analogy to investigate the interior volume of a black\nhole, the associated quantum mode's entropy, and the evolution relation between\nthe interior and exterior entropy is explained. Using this analogy, we\npredicted the future of information stored in a BH, its radiation, and\nevaporation. The results are noted in tables (\\ref{tab:1}) and (\\ref{tab:2}).\nTo apply this analogy in BH space-time, we investigated the interior volume,\nentropy, and evaluation relation for different types of BHs. Finally, we also\ninvestigated the nature of BH radiation and the probability of particle\nemission during the evaporation process.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
