We also compute the number\nof Grassmanian permutations in $\\mathcal{S}_n$ whose $k$-th powers remain\nGrassmanian, and the number of permutations in $\\mathcal{S}_n$ whose $k$-th\npowers have the maximum number of descents.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CGanqqq-kk354kBsfyQF_CBQUD2t2rFvCaQ0JBM0vIQ","pdfSize":"189724"}
