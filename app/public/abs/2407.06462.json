However, recent studies have suggested the applicability of\nclassical nucleation theory to systems far from equilibrium. In this Article,\nwe formulate a purely mechanical perspective of homogeneous nucleation and\ngrowth, elucidating the criteria for the properties of a critical nucleus\nwithout appealing to equilibrium notions. Applying this theory to active fluids\nundergoing motility-induced phase separation, we find that nucleation proceeds\nin a qualitatively similar fashion to equilibrium systems, with concepts such\nas the Gibbs-Thomson effect and nucleation barriers remaining valid. We further\ndemonstrate that the recovery of such concepts allows us to extend classical\ntheories of nucleation rates and coarsening dynamics to active systems upon\nusing the mechanically-derived definitions of the nucleation barrier and\nsurface tensions.Three distinct surface tensions -- the mechanical, capillary,\nand Ostwald tensions -- play a central role in our theory. While these three\nsurface tensions are identical in equilibrium, our work highlights the\ndistinctive role of each tension in the stability of active interfaces and the\nnucleation and growth of motility-induced phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
