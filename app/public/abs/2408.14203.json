From the proposed\nrandom profile generation scheme, we strive for a generic design space that\ndoes not contain impractical designs, i.e., profiles with sharp gradations. We\nalso show that the power law is a strict subset of the proposed design space.\nWe use a dense neural network-based surrogate model for the prediction of\nmaximum stress, while the deep neural operator DeepONet is used for the\nprediction of the thermal field. The point-wise effective prediction of the\nthermal field enables us to implement the constraint that the metallic content\nof the FGM remains within a specified limit. The integration of the profile\ngeneration scheme and DL-based surrogate models with GA provides us with an\nefficient optimization scheme. The efficacy of the proposed framework is\ndemonstrated through various numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
