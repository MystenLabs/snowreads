Under this\nsituation, this paper studies the profit-oriented dynamic pricing strategy of\nCSAs. As the practicability basis, a privacy-protected bidirectional real-time\ninformation interaction framework is designed, under which the status of EVs is\nutilized as the reference for pricing, and the prices of CSs are the reference\nfor charging decisions. Based on this framework, the decision-making models of\nEVs and CSs are established, in which the uncertainty caused by the information\nasymmetry between EVs and CSs and the bounded rationality of EV users are\nintegrated. To solve the pricing decision model, the evolutionary game theory\nis adopted to describe the dynamic pricing game among CSAs, the equilibrium of\nwhich gives the optimal pricing strategy. Finally, the case study results in a\nreal urban area in Shanghai, China verifies the practicability of the framework\nand the effectiveness of the dynamic pricing strategy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
