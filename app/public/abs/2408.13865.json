This paper explores our investigation into Hermitian coupling between\nlasers in an array, with the aim of achieving arbitrary coupling and creating\nartificial gauge fields that can break time-reversal symmetry. For that, we\ninvestigated Hermitian coupling within three laser array geometries: a square\narray of 100 lasers, a triangular array of 130 lasers, and a ring array of 8\nlasers. In the square array, we implemented arbitrary laser coupling with a\nprecision of $2\\pi/120$ radians, enabling the attainment of any desired\nphase-locking state. In the triangular array, we controlled the chirality of\nthe lasers with 99% purity. In the ring array, the introduction of an\nartificial gauge field revealed discrete quantized first-order transitions\nbetween distinct topological phase-locking states. This arbitrary coupling,\nwith control over both the strength and phase, paves the way for exploring spin\nsystems and configurations characterized by exotic, non-conventional coupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
