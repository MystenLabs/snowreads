We derive a general\nformalism for the dense coding capacity (DCC) of generic two-mode Gaussian\nstates. When the constituent modes are affected by quantum-limited amplifiers,\npure-loss channels, and environmental interactions together with an inefficient\ndecoding mechanism comprising imperfect double-homodyne detection, we\ninvestigate the pattern of DCC of the two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSV) by\nvarying the strength of the noise. We further establish that the negative\nconditional entropy is responsible for providing quantum advantage in CV dense\ncoding and identify a class of pure states capable of furnishing the maximal\ndense coding capacity equal to that of the TMSV under equal energy. We also\ndemonstrate that, while the TMSV state provides the maximum quantum advantage\nin the DC protocol, there exists a class of states that is more resilient\nagainst noise than the TMSV state in the context of the DCC.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
