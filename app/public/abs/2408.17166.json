As a consequence, the localization performance of such systems is\nto a large extent determined by the quality of the audio features that are used\nas inputs to the system. We propose a new feature, based on neural generalized\ncross-correlations with phase-transform (NGCC-PHAT), that learns audio\nrepresentations suitable for localization. Using permutation invariant training\nfor the time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation problem enables NGCC-PHAT\nto learn TDOA features for multiple overlapping sound events. These features\ncan be used as a drop-in replacement for GCC-PHAT inputs to a SELD-network. We\ntest our method on the STARSS23 dataset and demonstrate improved localization\nperformance compared to using standard GCC-PHAT or SALSA-Lite input features.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
