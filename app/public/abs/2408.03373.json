We use the\nproton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) and the\nnuclear shell model to calculate the N$^2$LO NMEs from very low-momentum\n(ultrasoft) neutrinos and from loop diagrams usually neglected in\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ studies. Our results indicate that, separately, the new\nN$^2$LO NMEs can have up to a $15\\%$ impact on the total NME, but cancellations\nlead to an overall N$^2$LO contribution centered around $-5\\%$ for the shell\nmodel and $+10\\%$ for the pnQRPA, with sizable uncertainties due to the\nshort-range nature of the loop NMEs. The sign discrepancy between many-body\nmethods is common to all studied nuclei and points to the different behaviour\nof the intermediate states of the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. In addition, our\nresults support the $\\chi$EFT prediction that the ultrasoft NME is closely\nrelated to contributions usually referred to as ``beyond the closure\napproximation''.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
