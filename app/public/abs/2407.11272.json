The proposed approach achieves fast,\nflexible, and accurate voxelization of 3D meshes, admitting the computation of\ngradients with respect to the input mesh and GPU acceleration. We further\ndemonstrate the application of the proposed voxelization in mesh morphing,\nwhere the voxelized mesh is deformed by a neural network. The proposed method\nis evaluated on the ShapeNet dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin terms of both accuracy and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
