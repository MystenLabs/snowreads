We establish a systematic framework that optimizes the {\\alpha}\nparameter, thereby enhancing learning efficiency and stability. Our results\nshow that there is a relationship between the learning rate and the angle\nbetween a vector T (total time steps in each episode of learning) and R (the\nreward vector for each episode). The concept of angular bisector between\nvectors T and R and Nash Equilibrium provide insight into estimating $\\alpha$\nsuch that the algorithm minimizes losses arising from exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/Theoretical Economics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gdu23TraaHQ8jPB1dqNOAQC1fHthy8C-8aB3EfIm3Sk","pdfSize":"1351243"}
