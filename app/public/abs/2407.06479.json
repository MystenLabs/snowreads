Our framework collects\ndialogue-level interactivity labels (e.g., topic management; 4 labels in total)\nand micro-level span features (e.g., backchannels; 17 features in total). Given\nour annotated data, we study how the micro-level features influence the (higher\nlevel) interactivity quality of ESL dialogues by constructing various machine\nlearning-based models. Our results demonstrate that certain micro-level\nfeatures strongly correlate with interactivity quality, like reference word\n(e.g., she, her, he), revealing new insights about the interaction between\nhigher-level dialogue quality and lower-level linguistic signals. Our framework\nalso provides a means to assess ESL communication, which is useful for language\nassessment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
