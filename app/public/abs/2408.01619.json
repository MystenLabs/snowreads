With the help\nof analytic techniques, we observed that switching the electrical stimulation\nfrom voltage to current significantly prevents structural changes and cation\nsegregation at the nanoscale, improving also the device cycle-to-cycle\nvariability. These findings could contribute to the design of more reliable\noxide-based memristors and underscore the crucial effect that has the type of\nelectrical stimulation applied to the devices on their integrity and\nreliability.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GG9jH7JbvTJJ6KsenrRFogHRlqjfcSyOA1kche_jMm0","pdfSize":"1318638","txDigest":"2CStrEKHTsCH6RrQzXVhq3Grzb8bfK3masvzMdCtz7xB","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
