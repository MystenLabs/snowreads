To do\nso, we identify a necessary combinatorial condition on graphs with\nreflection-symmetric flexible realisations. This condition is based on a\nspecific type of edge colouring, where edges are assigned one of three colours\nin a symmetric way. From some of these colourings we also construct concrete\nreflection-symmetric realisations with their corresponding symmetry preserving\nmotion. We study also a specific class of reflection-symmetric realisations\nconsisting of triangles and parallelograms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U8HRZLPLDNj1hYSlXk2CYoT1_aKTOYzaaBifZk4xxao","pdfSize":"375371"}
