The approach, PC-Indexed Data Address Translation (PCAX), uses the\nPC of a load instruction, and not a data virtual address, to obtain the page\ntable entry (PTE) for the data accessed by a load instruction. PCAX is intended\nto be used for a small subset of the static loads in a program. We observe\nthat: (i) a small subset of static loads is responsible for most of the misses\nin a data translation lookaside buffer (DTLB), and (ii) often a dynamic\ninstance of a static load instruction accesses the same PTE as the last dynamic\ninstance, and consider PCAX for this subset. With PCAX the effective miss rate\nof a conventional DTLB can be cut down by a factor of 2-3X in many cases, and\neven more in some cases. PCAX is also beneficial in reducing the number of\nsecondary TLB (STLB) misses. Since the tables used for PCAX can be accessed\nalongside instruction fetch, they can be slow, yet frequently provide a valid\nPTE even before the data address calculation. This results in a performance\nimprovement, and reduced data address translation energy, in most cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"JqhERQl-bFJOkigDwrXX9__ro2Ujo6fQToOrmUMgu34","pdfSize":"762179"}
