They often appear in tandem with\nFrobenius algebras inside them. Motivations for this range from the theory of\nmodule categories to the construction of correlators in conformal field theory.\nWe generalize the Baez-Dolan microcosm principle to consistently describe all\nthese types of algebras by extending it to cyclic and modular algebras in the\nsense of Getzler-Kapranov. Our main result links the microcosm principle for\ncyclic algebras to the one for modular algebras via Costello's modular\nenvelope. The result can be understood as a local-to-global construction for\nvarious flavors of Frobenius algebras that substantially generalizes and\nunifies the available, and often intrinsically semisimple methods using for\nexample triangulations, state-sum constructions or skein theory. Several\napplications of the main result in conformal field theory are presented: We\nclassify consistent systems of correlators for open conformal field theories\nand show that the genus zero correlators for logarithmic conformal field\ntheories constructed by Fuchs-Schweigert can be uniquely extended to\nhandlebodies. This establishes a very general correspondence between full genus\nzero conformal field theory in dimension two and skein theory in dimension\nthree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
