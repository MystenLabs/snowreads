While previous\nsurveys in the late 2010s covered the first stage of this revolution, the last\nfive years of research brought further ground-breaking advancements to the\nfield. This paper aims to fill this gap in a two-fold manner: first, we offer\nan in-depth examination of the latest developments in deep stereo matching,\nfocusing on the pioneering architectural designs and groundbreaking paradigms\nthat have redefined the field in the 2020s; second, we present a thorough\nanalysis of the critical challenges that have emerged alongside these advances,\nproviding a comprehensive taxonomy of these issues and exploring the\nstate-of-the-art techniques proposed to address them. By reviewing both the\narchitectural innovations and the key challenges, we offer a holistic view of\ndeep stereo matching and highlight the specific areas that require further\ninvestigation. To accompany this survey, we maintain a regularly updated\nproject page that catalogs papers on deep stereo matching in our\nAwesome-Deep-Stereo-Matching\n(https://github.com/fabiotosi92/Awesome-Deep-Stereo-Matching) repository.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
