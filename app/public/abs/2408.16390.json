Recognizing the need for a precise evaluation metric to address the\nissues of chat translation, this study introduces Multidimensional Quality\nMetrics for Chat Translation (MQM-Chat). Through the experiments of five models\nusing MQM-Chat, we observed that all models generated certain fundamental\nerrors, while each of them has different shortcomings, such as omission, overly\ncorrecting ambiguous source content, and buzzword issues, resulting in the loss\nof stylized information. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of MQM-Chat\nin evaluating chat translation, emphasizing the importance of stylized content\nand dialogue consistency for future studies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
