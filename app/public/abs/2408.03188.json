Applying such visualizations in the\ncontext of simulation science where High-Performance Computing (HPC) produces\never-growing amounts of data that is more complex, potentially\nmultidimensional, and multimodal, takes up resources and a high level of\ntechnological experience often not available to domain experts. In this work,\nwe present DaVE -- a curated database of visualization examples, which aims to\nprovide state-of-the-art and advanced visualization methods that arise in the\ncontext of HPC applications. Based on domain- or data-specific descriptors\nentered by the user, DaVE provides a list of appropriate visualization\ntechniques, each accompanied by descriptions, examples, references, and\nresources. Sample code, adaptable container templates, and recipes for easy\nintegration in HPC applications can be downloaded for easy access to\nhigh-fidelity visualizations. While the database is currently filled with a\nlimited number of entries based on a broad evaluation of needs and challenges\nof current HPC users, DaVE is designed to be easily extended by experts from\nboth the visualization and HPC communities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
