An agent\ndevelops a new technology and, while privately learning about its harms and\nbenefits, continually chooses whether to continue development. A principal,\nuncertain about what the agent might learn, chooses among dynamic mechanisms\n(e.g., paths of taxes or subsidies) to influence the agent's choices in\ndifferent states. We show that learning robust mechanisms -- those which\ndeliver the highest payoff guarantee across all learning processes -- are\nsimple and resemble `regulatory sandboxes' consisting of zero marginal tax on\nR&D which keeps the agent maximally sensitive to new information up to a hard\nquota, upon which the agent turns maximally insensitive. Robustness is\nimportant: we characterize the worst-case learning process under non-robust\nmechanisms and show that they induce growing but weak optimism which can\ndeliver unboundedly poor principal payoffs; hard quotas safeguard against this.\nIf the regulator also learns, adaptive hard quotas are robustly optimal which\nhighlights the importance of expertise in regulation.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
