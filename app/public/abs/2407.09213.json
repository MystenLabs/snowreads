While hyperbolicity\ncones are furnished with a generalization of the notion of eigenvalues,\nobtaining closed form expressions for the projection operator as in the case of\nsemidefinite matrices is an elusive endeavour. To address that we propose a\nFrank-Wolfe method to handle this task and, more generally, strongly convex\noptimization over closed convex cones. One of our innovations is that the\nFrank-Wolfe method is actually applied to the dual problem and, by doing so,\nsubproblems can be solved in closed-form using minimum eigenvalue functions and\nconjugate vectors. To test the validity of our proposed approach, we present\nnumerical experiments where we check the performance of alternative approaches\nincluding interior point methods and an earlier accelerated gradient method\nproposed by Renegar. We also show numerical examples where the hyperbolic\npolynomial has millions of monomials. Finally, we also discuss the problem of\nprojecting onto p-cones which, although not hyperbolicity cones in general, are\nstill amenable to our techniques.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
