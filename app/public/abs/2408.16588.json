The procedure of the coherent density fluctuation model is employed to\nformulate the Relativistic-EDF and Brueckner energy density functional\n(Brueckner-EDF) at local density. A few signatures of shell and/or sub-shell\nclosure are observed in the symmetry energy and its components, i.e., surface\nand volume symmetry energy, far from the beta-stable region for odd-A Sc and V,\nand even-even Ti and Cr nuclei with non-linear NL3 and G3 parameter sets. A\ncomparison is made with the results obtained from Relativistic-EDF and\nBrueckner-EDF with both NL3 and G3 for the considered isotopic chains. We find\nRelativistic-EDF outperforms the Brueckner-EDF in predicting the shell and/or\nsub-shell closure of neutron-rich isotopes at N = 50 for these atomic nuclei.\nMoreover, a relative comparison has been made for the results obtained with the\nnon-linear NL3 and G3 parameter sets.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
