Studying the mechanisms behind such observed heterogeneity in\nmammalian cells presents challenges due for instance to the prolonged\nproliferation times compared to widely studied unicellular organisms like\nbacteria and yeast. Here, we studied the response of leukemia cell populations\nto serum starvation via a protocol, we recently developed, that makes use of\nlive cell fluorescence and flow cytometry in combination with a quantitative\nanalytical model to follow the population proliferation while monitoring the\ndynamics of its phenotype distributions. We found that upon switching between a\nserum-rich to a serum-poor media, leukemia cells (i) maintain a memory of the\nprevious environment up to one generation even in the presence of severe\nmedium-depletion, before (ii) adapting their growth and division rates to the\nnovel environment while preserving a sizer-like division strategy. Finally,\nlooking at the mitochondria content of the proliferating vs non-proliferating\ncells, we found that the latter is characterized by a higher number of older\nmitochondria, suggesting a possible functional role of the observed asymmetric\npartitioning of (aged) mitochondria in leukemia cells.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
