In order to\nensure confidence in research results they need to be reproducible. In the past\nwe reported [18] that in many publications important information such as\ndetails about the equipment used are missing. In this paper we report on our\nown experiments that we run to verify the parameters reported in the datasheets\nthat came along with our experimental equipment. Our results show that there\nare significant discrepancies between the datasheets and the real world data.\nThese deviations concern accuracy of positions, movements, duration of laser\nshots etc. In order to improve reproducibility of results we therefore argue on\nthe one hand that research groups verify the data given in datasheets of\nequipment they use and on the other hand that they provide measurement set-up\nparameters in globally accepted units such as cm, seconds, etc.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2cIlSCcqHaaW-mwHC8b74_yws7c9UtzdKuvfaYrnuy8","pdfSize":"1286586"}
