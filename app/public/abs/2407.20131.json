In this paper we provide further insight into the apparent tension\nbetween the frequency-domain and the time-domain descriptions by analyzing the\nscattering properties of the problem. In the frequency domain, we study\nanalytically the solutions corresponding to the perturbed potential. We show\nthat there are two qualitatively different classes of instabilities, and that\nboth Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are affected by what we call a \"Type\nII\" instability, i.e., an exponential migration of the mode frequencies away\nfrom their unperturbed value as the perturbing \"bump\" moves away from the peak\nof the unperturbed potential. In the time domain, we elucidate the effect of\nthe spectral instability in terms of the causal structure of the Green's\nfunction. By using an equivalent scattering problem we confirm analytically\n(and show numerically) that the deviation from the unperturbed waveform in the\nearly ringdown stage is proportional to $\\epsilon$ when\n$\\epsilon\\lesssim10^{-2}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
