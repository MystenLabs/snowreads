Employing percolation-based network dismantling\napproach like Sequential Removal of Nodes and Giant Connected Component\nanalysis, alongside random, centrality-based targeted attacks and flooding\nfailure, findings reveal Domirank centrality's superior resilience in\ndisruption and recovery phases. Kendall's tau coefficient's application further\nelucidates the relationships between network properties and resilience,\nunderscoring larger networks' vulnerability yet faster recovery due to inherent\nredundancy and connectivity. Key attributes like average degree and path length\nconsistently influence recovery effectiveness, while the clustering\ncoefficient's positive correlation with recovery highlights the benefits of\nlocal interconnectivity. This analysis emphasizes the critical role of select\nnodes and the importance of balancing network design for enhanced resilience,\noffering insights for future urban rail system planning against multi-hazard\nthreats.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
