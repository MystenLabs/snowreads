This fibration is similar to the MRC\nfibration, and we call it the MU fibration of $ X $. The MU fibration $ \\pi: X\n\\dashrightarrow MU(X) $ is characterized by the following properties: i) The\nvery general fibres of $ \\pi $ are unirational, ii) if $ Z $ is a unirational\nsub-variety of $ X $, $ z $ is a very general point of $ MU(X) $ (i.e., a point\nin the complement of a countable union of Zariski closed sub-sets of $ MU(X)\n$), and $ Z $ intersects $ \\pi^{-1}(z) $ non-trivially, then $ Z $ is contained\nin $ \\pi^{-1}(z) $, iii) The variety $ MU(X) $ is unique up to birational\nequivalence. If we call $ MU(X) $ a maximal unirational quotient, then $ X $ is\nunirational if and only if the dimension of any maximal unirational quotient is\nequal to zero. We use this work to show that unirationality, rational\nconnectedness, and rational chain connectedness are equivalent for smooth\nvarieties over a field of characteristic zero, and that the MRC quotient of a\nsmooth, projective variety over a field of characteristic zero is not uniruled.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
