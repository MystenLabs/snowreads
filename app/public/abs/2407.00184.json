A laser is used to excite optical dipoles in\nthe vapor while probing the Faraday rotation noise. We report unusual\nlineshapes of the spin noise spectra with a strong density dependence, which we\nattribute to interactions arising between particles in the system. Introducing\na two-body model and simulations, we show that these features are the hallmark\nof a strong dipole-dipole interaction between binaries within the ensemble. A\nprecise fit of the experimental spectra allows to extract the strength and the\nduration of the dipole-dipole interaction. We unveil its impact on the spin\nnoise frequency and investigate the role of the atomic motion in the unexpected\nlineshapes. This work demonstrates the potential of spin noise spectroscopy to\nobserve and quantify strong interactions occurring within a particle ensemble.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EhvutOGWLW7i1zlqUIM1JHRKGGSRtIcfhMT1ryLz2yo","pdfSize":"1882768"}
