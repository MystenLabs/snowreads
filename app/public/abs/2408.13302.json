Such defects have been realized physically by\nhalf-space gauging in theories with 1-form symmetries $A[1]$ for an abelian\ngroup $A$, and have found applications in the continuum and the lattice. These\nfusion 3-categories will be called (generalized) Tambara-Yamagami fusion\n3-categories $(\\mathbf{3TY})$. We consider the Brauer-Picard and Picard\n4-groupoids to construct these categories using a 3-categorical version of the\nextension theory introduced by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik. These two\n4-groupoids correspond to the construction of duality defects either directly\nin 4d, or from the 5d Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). The Witt\ngroup of non-degenerate braided fusion 1-categories naturally appears in the\naforementioned 4-groupoids and represents enrichments of standard duality\ndefects by (2+1)d TFTs. Our main objective is to study graded extensions of the\nfusion 3-category $\\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$. Firstly, we use invertible bimodule\n3-categories and the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid. Secondly, we use that the\nBrauer-Picard 4-groupoid of $\\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$ can be identified with the\nPicard 4-groupoid of its Drinfeld center. Moreover, the Drinfeld center of\n$\\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$, which represents topological defects of the SymTFT, is\ncompletely described by a sylleptic strongly fusion 2-category formed by\ntopological surface defects of the SymTFT. These are classified by a finite\nabelian group equipped with an alternating 2-form. We relate the Picard\n4-groupoid of the corresponding braided fusion 3-categories with a generalized\nWitt group constructed from certain graded braided fusion 1-categories using a\ntwisted Deligne tensor product. We perform explicit computations for\n$\\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/4$ graded $\\mathbf{3TY}$ categories.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2bHv6VCtnmYgEMh6vMqAb7AGJEXhskZ07-lpE0bjAl8","pdfSize":"802972"}
