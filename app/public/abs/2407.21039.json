To study this, structured clinical variables from\nElectronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many\nresearchers. Presently, Natural Language Processing models have received great\nattention in clinical research which expanded the possibilities of using\nclinical narratives. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for\ndeveloping sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on\ndiverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with\nsepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted\nprognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the\ndynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways\nsheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across\nvarious contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers\ninfluencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration\nor improvement. This empowers healthcare providers to implement more\npersonalized and effective healthcare strategies for individual patients.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
