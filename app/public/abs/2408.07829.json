The oscillations are circuit-dual to those ordinarily observed in\nsingle junctions. The dual circuit quantitatively accounts for temporal\ndynamics of the array, including the dependence on biasing conditions.\nInjection locking the oscillations results in well-developed current plateaux.\nA thermal model explains the relaxation step of the oscillations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
