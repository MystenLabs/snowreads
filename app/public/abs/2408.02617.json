However, recent studies often favor higher J transitions of the CO\nmolecule which are brighter and accessible for redshift ranges where CO(1-0) is\nnot. These lines are not perfect analogues for CO(1-0), owing to their more\nstringent excitation conditions, and must be calibrated for use as molecular\ngas tracers. Here we introduce the Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT\n(AMISS), a multi-CO line survey of z~0 galaxies conducted to calibrate the\nCO(2-1) and CO(3-2) lines. The final survey includes CO(2-1) spectra of 176\ngalaxies and CO(3-2) spectra for a subset of 45. We supplement these with\narchival CO(1-0) spectra from xCOLD GASS for all sources and additional CO(1-0)\nobservations with the Kitt Peak 12m Telescope. Targets were selected to be\nrepresentative of the galaxy population in the stellar mass range of $10^9$ to\n$10^{11.5}$ M$_\\odot$. Our project emphasized careful characterization of\nstatistical and systematic uncertainties to enable studies of trends in CO line\nratios. We show that optical and CO disk sizes are on average equal, for both\nthe CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) line. We measure the distribution of CO line luminosity\nratios, finding medians (16th-84th percentile) of 0.71 (0.51-0.96) for the\nCO(2-1)-to-CO(1-0) ratio, 0.39 (0.24-0.53) for the CO(3-2)-to-CO(1-0) ratio,\nand 0.53 (0.41-0.74) for the CO(3-2)-to-CO(2-1) ratio. A companion paper\npresents our study of CO(2-1)'s applicability as a molecular gas mass tracer\nand search for trends in the CO(2-1)-to-CO(1-0) ratio. Our catalog of CO line\nluminosities will be publicly available with the published version of this\narticle.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"50eXmQt0jrZW5Yw3kjNCBs-LXSg1qZp5uktGgy3LwZs","pdfSize":"2037275","txDigest":"VMGhsigk6nQ383D79skmf5cWA7s6eyj1jbvxg6KNEzJ","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
