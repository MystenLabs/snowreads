Recent work\nhas shown how to extend field theories in both the Lagrangian and de\nDonder-Weyl formalism to contact geometry. In this article I show how dynamical\nsimilarity applies in field theory. This is applied in both the Lagrangian and\nHamiltonian frameworks, producing the contact equivalents. The result can be\napplied to general relativity where I demonstrate how to construct a complete\ndescription of the dynamics, equivalent to those derived from the\nEinstein-Hilbert action, without reference to the conformal factor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
