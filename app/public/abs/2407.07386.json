Despite the justification for these secondary trades, such as\nunpredictable demand, they may encourage speculation and result in the\nmisallocation of permits. In this paper, our aim is to underscore the\nimportance of efficiency in the initial allocation mechanism and to explore how\nconcerns leading to the establishment of secondary markets, such as uncertain\ndemand, can be addressed through alternative means, such as frequent auctions.\nWe demonstrate that the existence of a secondary market could lead to higher\nuntruthful bids in the auction, further encouraging speculation and the\naccumulation of rent. Our results suggest that an inefficient initial\nallocation could enable speculators with no use value for the permits to bid in\nthe auction and subsequently earn rents in secondary markets by trading these\npermits. Even if the secondary market operates efficiently, the resulting rent,\nwhich represents a potential loss of auction revenue, cannot be overlooked.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NjxrX1bsaSjnRTkfMkYe-eVUBa0ZFQ3Ek69WZMJc8VQ","pdfSize":"161192"}
