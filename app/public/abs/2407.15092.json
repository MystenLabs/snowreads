However, it is difficult to solve the problems\nnumerically due to their strong nonlinearities and higher-order terms. This\nwork is devoted to solving forward and inverse problems of the phase-field\nmodels by a novel deep learning framework named Phase-Field Weak-form Neural\nNetworks (PFWNN), which is based on the weak forms of the phase-field\nequations. In this framework, the weak solutions are parameterized as deep\nneural networks with a periodic layer, while the test function space is\nconstructed by functions compactly supported in small regions. The PFWNN can\nefficiently solve the phase-field equations characterizing the sharp\ntransitions and identify the important parameters by employing the weak forms.\nIt also allows local training in small regions, which significantly reduce the\ncomputational cost. Moreover, it can guarantee the residual descending along\nthe time marching direction, enhancing the convergence of the method. Numerical\nexamples are presented for several benchmark problems. The results validate the\nefficiency and accuracy of the PFWNN. This work also sheds light on solving the\nforward and inverse problems of general high-order time-dependent partial\ndifferential equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
