In this\nwork, we aim to investigate the atomistic mechanisms of radiation-induced\ndamage in AlGaN compounds, providing insights that bridge the gap between\nhigh-length-scale experimental data and detailed atomic-level processes.\nThrough extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the compositional\ndependence of radiation-induced defect production in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N systems\nwith $x$ ranging from 0 to 1. The damage accumulation characteristics observed\nin our simulations align notably well with available experimental data at\ntemperatures up to room temperature. Our findings indicate that alloy\ncomposition significantly influences defect production and microstructural\nevolution, including the formation of dislocation loops and defect clusters.\nSpecifically, with increasing Al content, defect production from individual\nrecoil events is reduced; however, extended interstitial defects are more\nlikely to form considering cumulative effects, leading to enhanced damage at\nhigh doses. Among the compositions studied, we find that 25\\% Al content leads\nto the least overall radiation damage, suggesting an optimal alloying strategy\nfor mitigating radiation effects. These findings underscore the interplay\nbetween defect formation, dynamic annealing, and cascade effects, offering\ninsights for optimizing AlGaN materials for radiation resistance in practical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
