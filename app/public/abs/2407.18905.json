Our approach leans on a simple proposition:\nall non-proportional hazards (NPH) models are equivalent to a proportional\nhazards model. The nph2ph transform brings an NPH model into a PH form. We\noften find very simple approximations for this transform, enabling us to\nanalyze complex NPH observations as though they had arisen under proportional\nhazards. Many techniques become available to us, and we use these to understand\ntreatment effects better.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RWnsVLaEfdVlpYqnuvwsSdL9I21dnmVSjYWUUjbDGgQ","pdfSize":"698336"}
