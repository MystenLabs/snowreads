However,\ndevelopers face challenges in integrating RAG-enhanced LLMs into software\nsystems, due to lack of interface specification, requirements from software\ncontext, and complicated system management. In this paper, we manually studied\n100 open-source applications that incorporate RAG-enhanced LLMs, and their\nissue reports. We have found that more than 98% of applications contain\nmultiple integration defects that harm software functionality, efficiency, and\nsecurity. We have also generalized 19 defect patterns and proposed guidelines\nto tackle them. We hope this work could aid LLM-enabled software development\nand motivate future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
