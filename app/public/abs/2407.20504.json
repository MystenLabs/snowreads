Compared to magnetic space groups where spatial\nand spin rotation of elements are completely locked, the superconducting\nchannels and the forms of basis functions in spin space groups can be\ndifferent. Furthermore, we utilize the obtained basis functions to construct\nthe Ginzburg-Landau free energy and show the possible superconducting ground\nstates. By virtue of those results, we discuss the application of our theory to\nrealistic systems. Our work provides a rigorous description of superconducting\ngap functions in the case of spin space group, and enables further study of the\ninterplay between superconductivity and magnetism.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
