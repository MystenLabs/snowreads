We study the\ngraded pieces of integral filtration on $D_{\\rm dR}(T)$ given by Nyggard\nfiltration of the attached Breuil-Kisin module of $T$. We show that the\n$i$-graded piece has nontrivial $p$-torsion only if $ i = r_j +m p$ for a\nHodge-Tate weight $ r_j$ of $T$ and $m$ a positive integer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_Lj1_IqZm7I-hAlUbTKRPhqKFkRYY5o_2H5Z5f6_qN8","pdfSize":"188045"}
