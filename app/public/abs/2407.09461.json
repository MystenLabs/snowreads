The system uses a mirror mounted on the sample holder such that the\nsample can be illuminated without being tilted. Notably the mirror can be\nremoved and replaced with an ablation target and a higher power laser used to\nablate material directly onto the sample. We argue that new capabilities hold\nthe potential to transform the electron microscope from an analysis tool\ntowards a more flexible synthesis system, where atomic scale fabrication and\natom-by-atom experiments can be performed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"KKjPSNN_b8r0XeTvdsVc50187a6n2g2Makv8w_uWpHs","pdfSize":"10611709"}
