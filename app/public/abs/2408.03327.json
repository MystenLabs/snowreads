The CNN\nis based on a UNET architecture with residual block modules. The database has\nbeen constructed using the experimental patterns generated by perfectly known\npseudo-particles programmed on a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) and under\nlaser illumination. The CNN has been trained on a basis of 18000 experimental\ninterferometric images using the AUSTRAL super computer (at CRIANN in\nNormandy). The CNN is tested in the case of centrosymmetric (stick, cross,\ndendrite) and non-centrosymmetric (like T, Y or L) particles. The size and the\n3D orientation of the programmed particles are random. The different shapes are\nreconstructed by the CNN with good accuracy. Using three angles of view, the 3D\nreconstruction of particles from three reconstructed faces can be further done.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
