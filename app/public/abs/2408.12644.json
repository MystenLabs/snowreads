In this article, we propose a novel way to\ntest the computation of lepton PDFs of the proton by analyzing both\nnon-resonant di-lepton and resonant Z gauge boson production processes induced\nby leptons within the proton at proton-electron colliders like HERA and EIC.\nDespite the fact that lepton PDFs of the proton are known to be small, this\nwork demonstrates that both processes imply a measurable yield of events at\nHERA and EIC, which could be used to test these PDFs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
