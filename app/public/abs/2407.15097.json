All 2D A-type altermagnets must belong to these 17 layer\ngroups, which will be helpful to search for 2D A-type altermagnet. (2) It is\nimpossible to connect the two sublattices of BSAA using $S_{3z}$ or $S_{6z}$, a\nconstraint that is also applicable to all 2D altermagnets. (3) $C_{2\\alpha}$ is\na general stacking operation to generate BSAA for an arbitrary monolayer. Our\ntheory not only can explain the previously reported twisted-bilayer\naltermagnets, but also can provide more possibilities to generate A-type\naltermagnets. Our research has significantly broadened the range of candidate\nmaterials for 2D altermagnets. Based on conclusion (1), the bilayer NiZrCl$_6$\nis predicted to exhibit intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. Additionally, we use\ntwisted-bilayer NiCl$_2$, previously reported in the literature, as the second\nexample of BSAA. Furthermore, utilizing symmetry analysis and first-principles\ncalculation, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristic to\nsubstantiate their altermagnetic properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
