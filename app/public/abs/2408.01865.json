Our approach, which accommodates strong system-bath couplings,\ngeneralizes the recently developed reaction-coordinate polaron transform method\n[PRX Quantum ${\\bf 4}$, 020307 (2023)] to handle couplings to baths via\nnoncommuting system operators. This approach creates an effective Hamiltonian\nthat reveals the cooperative effect of the baths on the system. For a spin\nimpurity coupled to both dissipative and decoherring environments, the\neffective Hamiltonian predicts the suppression of relaxation by decoherence --\na phenomenon previously observed in simulations but lacking a theoretical\nfoundation. We also apply the method to an ensemble of spins coupled to local\nbaths through noncommuting operators, demonstrating the engineering of the\nKitaev XY spin chain interaction. Noncommutativity is a feature of quantum\nsystems; future prospects of our approach include the study of thermal machines\nthat leverage such genuine quantum effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
