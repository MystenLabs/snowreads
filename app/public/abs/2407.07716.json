In this\nwork, a comparison of Samarium-Cobalt films for five different\nbuffer/protective layers, namely Ti, W, TiW, Ta, Cr and two different annealing\ntemperatures, 650{\\deg}C and 750{\\deg}C, is presented. Depending on materials\nand annealing temperatures, magnetic properties such as saturation and\ncoercivity of the SmCo film can be finely tuned. We show that coercivity up to\n3.65 T or saturation magnetization up to 0.95 T can be reached by proper choice\nof the relevant process parameters: deposition temperature, material for the\nbuffer/protective layer and annealing temperature. Such value of coercivity is\namong the highest found in literature for thin films of SmCo.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
