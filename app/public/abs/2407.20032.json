This\nresult was derived using the theory of linear perturbations about a Minkowki\nbackground, and in this work the model is extended to be more physically\nrealistic by allowing the background geometry to be Schwarzschild. It is found\nthat the difference between using a Schwarzschild or Minkowski background is\nminimal when either $r\\gg M$ or $\\lambda< M$, where $r$ is the radius of the\nshell, $\\lambda$ is the GW wavelength and $M$ is the mass of the system in\ngeometric units (so that $1M_\\odot=1.48$km). However, when $r\\sim 6M$ and\n$\\lambda\\sim 25M$, then the damping and heating effects are about 9 times\nlarger on a Schwarzschild background than on Minkowski, and such situations\noccur astrophysically.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BLghsoVSu8qxbe_EQ5m105ACpi1z4THdxRFZIPgHC-8","pdfSize":"416085"}
