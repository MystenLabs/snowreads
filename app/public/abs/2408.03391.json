Assuming that $\\langle x\\rangle^{2+}V(x) \\in L^1$ and that $u$ is\northogonal to any zero-energy resonances, we show that solutions exhibit\nmodified scattering behavior. Our decay assumptions are weaker than those\nappearing in previous work and are likely nearly optimal for exceptional\npotentials, since the M\\o{}ller wave operators are not known to be bounded on\n$L^p$ spaces unless $\\langle x\\rangle^2V \\in L^1$.\n  Our method combines two techniques: First, we prove a new class of linear\nestimates, which allow us to relate weights associated with the equation with\npotential to weights associated with the flat equation, up to localized error\nterms. By using the improved local decay coming from the zero-energy\nassumption, we can treat these errors perturbatively, allowing us to treat the\nweighted estimates using the same vector field arguments as in the flat case.\nSecond, we derive the asymptotic profile using the wave packet testing method\nintroduced by Ifrim and Tataru. Again, by taking advantage of improved local\ndecay near the origin, we are able to treat the potential as a lower-order\nperturbation, allowing us to use tools developed to study the flat problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
