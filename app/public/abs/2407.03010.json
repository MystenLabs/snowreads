To efficiently\nextract and leverage this information, we propose the Context-Aware Instance\nTracker (CAIT), which merges contextual data surrounding the instances with the\ncore instance features to improve tracking accuracy. Additionally, we introduce\nthe Prototypical Cross-frame Contrastive (PCC) loss, which ensures consistency\nin object-level features across frames, thereby significantly enhancing\ninstance matching accuracy. CAVIS demonstrates superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art methods on all benchmark datasets in video instance\nsegmentation (VIS) and video panoptic segmentation (VPS). Notably, our method\nexcels on the OVIS dataset, which is known for its particularly challenging\nvideos.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
