The compactification of spaces of flow lines given by adding\nbroken flow lines then has a natural interpretation via a projection to\nBertram's resolution of secant varieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
