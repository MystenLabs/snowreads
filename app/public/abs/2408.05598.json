In this\npaper, we study the Cauchy problem for a semilinear hypoelliptic damped wave\nequation involving a positive Rockland operator $\\mathcal{R}$ of homogeneous\ndegree $\\nu\\geq 2$ on $\\mathbb G$ with power type nonlinearity $|u|^p$ and\ninitial data taken from negative order homogeneous Sobolev space $\\dot\nH^{-\\gamma}(\\mathbb G), \\gamma>0,$ for the critical exponent case\n$p=1+\\frac{2\\nu}{Q+2\\gamma}.$ We also explore the diffusion phenomenon of the\nhigher-order hypoelliptic damped wave equations on graded Lie groups with\ninitial data belonging to Sobolev spaces of negative order. We emphasize that\nour results are also new, even in the setting of higher-order differential\noperators on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and more generally, on stratified Lie groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dJ5E95YAFTcVji30RFpQipL0x8bE6ga-KXpFsYYq9g4","pdfSize":"307886"}
