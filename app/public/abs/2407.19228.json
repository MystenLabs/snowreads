Here we explore many-body dynamical\nlocalization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain\nunder periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase diagram\nwith the MBDL and delocalization states and show dynamical observables to\nextract the phase diagram. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL regime, we\nreveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of\ncertain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information\nat high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to\nobtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other\nnon-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer\nrepetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store\nquantum information robust against thermal noises.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
