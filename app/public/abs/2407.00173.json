A dispatcher\ndetermines routes to maximize total satisfaction. We call this problem the\nAmbulance Bus Routing Problem. We develop efficient approximate policies for\nthe dispatcher to allocate individuals to multiple routes, characterize an\noptimal solution of the relaxed approximate model, and devise a heuristic to\nobtain a near-optimal integer solution quickly.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
