The standard approach\nuses binary relevances derived from pairs of audio samples and their\nhuman-provided captions, categorizing each pair as either positive or negative.\nThis may result in suboptimal systems due to varying levels of relevance\nbetween audio samples and captions. In contrast, a recent study used\nhuman-assigned relevance ratings, i.e., continuous relevances, for these pairs\nbut did not obtain performance gains in audio-text relevance learning. This\nwork introduces a relevance learning method that utilizes both human-assigned\ncontinuous relevance ratings and binary relevances using a combination of a\nlistwise ranking objective and a contrastive learning objective. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing\nimprovements in language-based audio retrieval, a downstream task in audio-text\nrelevance learning. In addition, we analyze how properties of the captions or\naudio clips contribute to the continuous audio-text relevances provided by\nhumans or learned by the machine.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qzT2RP5ghjP0lZWdFTwrs2EQjfiU4s5i7oZKZOO1XJY","pdfSize":"277597"}
