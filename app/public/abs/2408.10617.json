In this paper, we analysis the\ndeformation process of spiral tube under tension and torsion. Based on the\ngeometrical relationship between tapes and spiral tube, the mechanical behavior\nof tapes in HFRC is further studied.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
