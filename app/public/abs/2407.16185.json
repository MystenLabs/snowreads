In this paper, we consider this operator on a non-embeddable CR\nmanifold. This operator is essentially self-adjoint and its spectrum is\ndiscrete except zero. Moreover, the eigenspace corresponding to each non-zero\neigenvalue is a finite dimensional subspace of the space of smooth functions.\nFurthermore, we show that the CR Paneitz operator on the Rossi sphere, an\nexample of non-embeddable CR manifolds, has infinitely many negative\neigenvalues, which is significantly different from the embeddable case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
