This non-commutative spacetime is present\nin Deformed Special Relativity (DSR) theories, where a fundamental length is\nrelativistically incorporated into Special Relativity as an effective\ndescription of Quantum Gravity near Planckian energy scales. To avoid\nmathematical and physical ambiguities, such as the inability to twist-deform\nthe Poincar\\'e symmetry group such that $\\kappa$-Minkowski becomes its\ncovariant spacetime, we propose a novel approach to DSR and non-commutative\ntheories, twisting the Dilatation-enlarged IGL(3,1) group and constructing\ndeformed General Relativity accordingly. Physically, we interpret this as\nminimally modifying classical relativistic physics to accommodate quantum\neffects solely through spacetime uncertainties in a relativistic manner, a\npossibility new to DSR theories. These tools open the way to developing the\ndynamic sector of DSR, which would allow for predictions testable by\nastrophysical observations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
