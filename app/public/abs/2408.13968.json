Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nand Machine Learning (ML) technologies are now pivotal in enhancing the\nefficiency of power dispatch operations, effectively overcoming the constraints\nof traditional optimization solvers with long computation times. However, this\nincreased efficiency comes at a high environmental cost, escalating energy\nconsumption and carbon emissions from computationally intensive AI/ML models.\nDespite their potential to transform power systems management, the\nenvironmental impact of these technologies often remains an overlooked aspect.\nThis paper introduces the first comparison of energy demands across\ncentralized, distributed, and decentralized ML-driven power dispatch models. We\nprovide a detailed analysis of the energy and carbon footprint required for\ncontinuous operations on an IEEE 33 bus system, highlighting the critical\ntrade-offs between operational efficiency and environmental sustainability.\nThis study aims to guide future AI implementations in energy systems, ensuring\nthey enhance not only efficiency but also prioritize ecological integrity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"bJIL7QNdgSKl5UP5gciGXCs6bLTGCQWeLEpsbj15kuU","pdfSize":"2150612"}
