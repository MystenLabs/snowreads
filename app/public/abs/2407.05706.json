Most of FCIs have been proposed on two-dimensional (2D)\nEuclidean lattice models with various boundary conditions. In this work, we\ninvestigate hyperbolic FCIs which are constructed in hyperbolic geometry with\nconstant negative curvature. Through the studies on hyperbolic analogs of\nkagome lattices with hard-core bosons loaded into topological flat bands, we\nfind convincing numerical evidences of two types of $\\nu=1/2$ FCI states,\n{\\emph {i.e.}}, the conventional and unconventional FCIs. Multiple branches of\nedge excitations and geometry-dependent wave functions for both conventional\nand unconventional $\\nu=1/2$ FCI states are revealed, however, the geometric\ndegree of freedom in these FCIs plays various roles. Additionally, a\ncenter-localized orbital plays a crucial role in the unconventional FCI state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
