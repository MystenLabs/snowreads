In vivo OCT\noffers rapid, non-invasive imaging but can suffer from clarity issues and\nmotion artifacts, while ex vivo confocal microscopy, providing high-resolution,\ncellular-detailed color images, is invasive and raises ethical concerns. To\nbridge the benefits of both modalities, we propose a novel framework based on\nunsupervised 3D CycleGAN for translating unpaired in vivo OCT to ex vivo\nconfocal microscopy images. This marks the first attempt to exploit the\ninherent 3D information of OCT and translate it into the rich, detailed color\ndomain of confocal microscopy. We also introduce a unique dataset,\nOCT2Confocal, comprising mouse OCT and confocal retinal images, facilitating\nthe development of and establishing a benchmark for cross-modal image\ntranslation research. Our model has been evaluated both quantitatively and\nqualitatively, achieving Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores of 0.766 and\nKernel Inception Distance (KID) scores as low as 0.153, and leading subjective\nMean Opinion Scores (MOS). Our model demonstrated superior image fidelity and\nquality with limited data over existing methods. Our approach effectively\nsynthesizes color information from 3D confocal images, closely approximating\ntarget outcomes and suggesting enhanced potential for diagnostic and monitoring\napplications in ophthalmology.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
