The form\nof this relation and its intrinsic scatter are potentially valuable constraints\non theories of globular cluster formation and galaxy evolution. In this work,\nwe use the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey to make a large-scale, homogeneous\nestimate of GC abundance around 707 galaxies at distances $\\lesssim\n30\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ with luminosities $8 \\leq \\log_{10}L/\\mathrm{L}_\\odot \\leq\n11.5$. The combination of depth and sky coverage in DESI-LS allow us to extend\nthe techniques used by previous ground-based photometric GC surveys to a larger\nand potentially more representative sample of galaxies. We find average GC\ncounts and radial profiles that are broadly consistent with the literature on\nindividual galaxies, including good agreement with the distribution of GCs in\nthe Milky Way, demonstrating the viability of DESI-LS images for this purpose.\nWe find a relation between GC counts and virial mass in agreement with previous\nestimates based on heterogenous datasets, except at the lowest masses we probe,\nwhere we find a larger scatter in the number of cluster candidates and a\nslightly higher average count.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Hp_8HllF56H4FnUyn_3C1IrjyyHg9kAAfiqA0uCxFuk","pdfSize":"25485481"}
