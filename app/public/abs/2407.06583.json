CliNR implements Clifford circuits by splitting them into\nsub-circuits that are performed using gate teleportation. A few random\nstabilizer measurements are used to detect errors in the resources states\nconsumed by the gate teleportation. This can be seen as a teleported version of\nthe CPC scheme, with offline fault-detection making it scalable. We prove that\nCliNR achieves a vanishing logical error rate for families of $n$-qubit\nClifford circuits with size $s$ such that $nsp^2$ goes to 0, where $p$ is the\nphysical error rate, meaning that it reaches the regime $ns = o(1/p^2)$ whereas\nthe direct implementation is limited to $s = o(1/p)$. Moreover, CliNR uses only\n$3n+1$ qubits, $2s + o(s)$ gates and has zero rejection rate. This small\noverhead makes it more practical than quantum error correction in the near term\nand our numerical simulations show that CliNR provides a reduction of the\nlogical error rate in relevant noise regimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pKyxb6Vh_T0p7N6G3qDEwvgOmk4SmVH9jh1z8dPGCoI","pdfSize":"703359"}
