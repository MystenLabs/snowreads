This class of control systems has linear dynamics (in both the state\nand control), while minimizing a quadratic cost. Upon application of\nPontryagin's maximum principle, the co-states can be fully decoupled from the\nstate which results in a matrix Riccati equation. As such, solutions can be\nfound by solving this matrix equation backwards. The purpose of this work is to\nextend this analysis to systems with linear state jumps, which are referred to\nas linear hybrid systems. The extension of the maximum principle to these\nsystems results in the ``hybrid maximum principle.'' However, successful\napplication of this theory requires many subtle properties which are usually\nignored - specifically beating/blocking and Zeno. It turns out that these\nphenomena occur in linear hybrid systems and as such, the hybrid maximum\nprinciple is not immediately applicable to these seemingly simple systems. We\nshow that for spatially triggered linear hybrid systems, beating always occurs\nwhile blocking and Zeno can be successfully avoided if a certain\ncontrollability assumption is satisfied. For these trivially blocking systems,\nwe develop conditions for optimality for the two cases of when beating is\nexcluded and present. This work concluded with an example.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
