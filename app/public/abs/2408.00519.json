Then, we\ndemonstrate that the global dimension, as defined in arXiv:2008.00282 and\narXiv:1807.00469, is 3 for any stability condition on $\\mathbb P^3$ constructed\nin arXiv:1410.1585. Finally, we formulate a conjecture concerning the\ncontractibility of a principal connected component of $\\mathrm{Stab}(\\mathbb\nP^3)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
