To further improve material\nand device performance, it is important to understand the surface structures of\nCsSnI$_3$. We generate surface structures with various stoichiometries, perform\ndensity functional theory calculations to create phase diagrams of the\nCsSnI$_3$ (001), (110), and (100) surfaces, and determine the most stable\nsurfaces under a wide range of Cs, Sn, and I chemical potentials. Under I-rich\nconditions, surfaces with Cs vacancies are stable, which lead to partially\noccupied surface states above the valence band maximum. Under I-poor\nconditions, we find the stoichiometric (100) surface to be stable under a wide\nregion of the phase diagram, which does not have any surface states and can\ncontribute to long charge carrier lifetimes. Consequently, the I-poor (Sn-rich)\nconditions will be more beneficial to improve the device performance.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
