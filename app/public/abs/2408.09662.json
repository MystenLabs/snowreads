However, integrating\nmodel-based optimization into this process remains challenging due to the\ncomplexity of formulating and solving optimization problems across thousands of\ninstances. In this work, we present CusADi, an extension of the CasADi symbolic\nframework to support the parallelization of arbitrary closed-form expressions\non GPUs with CUDA. We also formulate a closed-form approximation for solving\ngeneral optimal control problems, enabling large-scale parallelization and\nevaluation of MPC controllers. Our results show a ten-fold speedup relative to\nsimilar MPC implementation on the CPU, and we demonstrate the use of CusADi for\nvarious applications, including parallel simulation, parameter sweeps, and\npolicy training.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3XproNK01pPmKPAjHVvXDXeNqcQp3hYqwciL804raL4","pdfSize":"5148463"}
