The\nresult shows that the fluctuations of Hamiltonian $N$- particle systems\ngoverned by truncated power law potentials of the form $\\mathcal{U}(r)\\sim\n|r/\\varepsilon|^{-s}$ (near $r \\approx 0$) converge to solutions of kinetic\nequations in appropriate scaling limits $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$ and\n$N\\rightarrow \\infty$. We prove that for $s\\in [0,1)$, the limiting system\napproaches the uncutoff linearized Boltzmann equation or the linearized Landau\nequation, depending on the scaling limit. The Coulomb singularity $s=1$ appears\nas a threshold value. Kinetic scaling limits with $s\\in (0,1]$ universally\nconverge to the linearized Landau equation, and we prove the onset of the\nCoulomb logarithm for $s=1$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nresult on the derivation of kinetic equations from interacting particle systems\nwith long-range power-law interaction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ibeZqlt9TaWlL5VeLAkRu3CPRWCnMZnlTBgUi5sXffQ","pdfSize":"1278620"}
