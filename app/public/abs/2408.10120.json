Although\ntokenization of molecular graphs exists, that for 3D geometries is largely\nunexplored. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing the Geo2Seq, which\nconverts molecular geometries into $SE(3)$-invariant 1D discrete sequences.\nGeo2Seq consists of canonical labeling and invariant spherical representation\nsteps, which together maintain geometric and atomic fidelity in a format\nconducive to LMs. Our experiments show that, when coupled with Geo2Seq, various\nLMs excel in molecular geometry generation, especially in controlled generation\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
