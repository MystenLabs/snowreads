Our contribution is to show that the particle paths\nsimulated within source iteration are associated with the adjoint flux density\nand the adjoint particle paths are associated with the flux density. We make\nour assertion rigorous through the use of stochastic calculus by representing\nthe particle path used in source iteration as a solution to a stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE). The solution to the adjoint Boltzmann equation is\nthen expressed in terms of the same SDE and the solution to the Boltzmann\nequation is expressed in terms of the SDE associated with the adjoint particle\nprocess. An important consequence is that the particle paths used within source\niteration simultaneously provide Monte Carlo approximations of the flux density\nand adjoint flux density. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to support the\nsimultaneous use of the particle paths.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
