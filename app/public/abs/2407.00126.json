We consider Hermiticity and\nrenormalizability a criterion to define the derivative Elko-Higgs interaction\nas the suitable candidate for a dark coupling. Then, the free parameters of the\nmodel are fixed by cosmological constraints on the dark matter abundance,\nbounds on the Higgs invisible decays, and limits on the electron-dark matter\nscattering mediated by the Higgs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
