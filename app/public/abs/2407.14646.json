Using heuristic methods, we sample ground states of instances to\ndetermine their energies while eliciting excitations through manipulating\nboundary conditions. We exploit the universality of the phase diagram of\nbond-diluted lattices to make such a study in higher dimensions computationally\nfeasible. As a result, we obtain a verity of accurate exponents for domain wall\nstiffness and finite-size corrections that allow us to examine their\ndimensional behavior and their connection with predictions from mean-field\ntheory. We also provide an experimentally testable prediction for the\nthermal-to-percolative crossover exponent in dilute lattices Ising spin\nglasses.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
