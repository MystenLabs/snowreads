Using the distributional zeta-function method, we obtain a series\nrepresentation for the quenched free energy. It is possible to show that for\neach moment of the partition function, the multiplet of $k$-fields the Gaussian\ncontribution has one field with the contribution of the disorder and\n$(k-1)$-fields with the usual propagator. Although the non-gaussian\ncontribution is non-perturbative we are able to show that the model is confined\nbetween two $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathcal{O}(k-1)$-symmetric models. Using\narguments of lower critical dimension alongside with monotone operators, we\nshow that the phase of the continuous RFIM can be restricted by an\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathcal{O}(k-1) \\to \\mathcal{O}(k-2)$ phase transition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
