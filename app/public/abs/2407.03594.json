Unlike existing methods that detect\nplanes from local observations and associate them across the video for the\nfinal reconstruction, UniPlane unifies both the detection and the\nreconstruction tasks in a single network, which allows us to directly optimize\nfinal reconstruction quality and fully leverage temporal information.\nSpecifically, we build a Transformers-based deep neural network that jointly\nconstructs a 3D feature volume for the environment and estimates a set of\nper-plane embeddings as queries. UniPlane directly reconstructs the 3D planes\nby taking dot products between voxel embeddings and the plane embeddings\nfollowed by binary thresholding. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that UniPlane outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both plane\ndetection and reconstruction tasks, achieving +4.6 in F-score in geometry as\nwell as consistent improvements in other geometry and segmentation metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
