We determine the condition on a p.q.-Baer $*$-ring (in terms of the\nsmallest central projection in a lattice of central projections of a $*$-ring),\nso that its strong zero-divisor graph contains a cut vertex. It is proved that\nthe set of cut vertices of a strong zero-divisor graph of a p.q.-Baer $*$-ring\nforms a complete subgraph. We prove that the complement of the strong\nzero-divisor graph of a p.q.-Baer $*$-ring is connected if and only if the\n$*$-ring contains at least six central projections. We characterize the\ndiameter and girth of the complement of a strong zero-divisor graph of a\np.q.-Baer $*$-ring. Also, we characterize p.q.-Baer $*$-rings whose strong\nzero-divisor graph is complemented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
