We examine the key aspects of the scheme\nincluding sector function construction, singular limit parametrization,\nsubtraction counterterm derivation, and integration techniques. As a\nproof-of-concept, we numerically implement LASS for the process $e^+e^-\n\\rightarrow 3$ jets. In this study we examine the limiting behavior of\nsubtraction terms for real-virtual contribution and explicitly demonstrate the\npole cancellation of the double-virtual contribution. Differential cross\nsections are computed for several event shape observables, showing the\nstability and efficiency of LASS scheme. This work lays the foundation for\ndeveloping an automated tool for NNLO QCD calculations using this promising\nscheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
