In various biomedical\nand microfluidic scenarios, especially those necessitating unconventional\nspecimen chambers, there is a demand for controlling the collection of\nmicro-objects at fluid-fluid interfaces. This requirement arises in contexts\nsuch as the transport of materials across liquid interfaces for applications\nlike living cell manipulation, drug delivery, soft functional material\ncreation, and various industrial processes. For many of these cases, a regular\narray of trap sites as well as tightly confinement are not essential. For such\napplications at interfaces, we expand on the concept of speckle tweezers (ST),\nwhich incorporate randomly distributed light fields for quasi-2D optical\nmanipulation. The proposed technique is demonstrated experimentally by applying\nST to govern the movement of PS micro-particles at water-oil and water-air\ninterfaces. The efficacy of the method is validated through the temporal\ncharacterization of micro-particle motions using digital video microscopy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
