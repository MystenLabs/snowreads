However, its computational\ncost remains a major drawback, which can be attributed to statistical errors\nwhen handling flows with low Mach numbers. Thus, many studies have focused on\nvariance reduction to reduce the computational cost. One approach is the\ndeviational particle (DP) method, which focuses solely on modeling deviations\nfrom the equilibrium state. The DP method has been implemented in the\nlow-variance deviational simulation Monte Carlo (LVDSMC) method, which has\nproven effective for monatomic gas simulations but faces limitations when\nextended to polyatomic gases. In this study, we present a practical DP method\nfor polyatomic gas simulations that combines the LVDSMC method with the\nLarsen-Borgnakke (LB) model, which introduces a group reduction algorithm for\nthe inelastic collision process. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the\nproposed method efficiently and accurately simulates flows across a relatively\nbroad range of non-equilibrium values. Remarkably, the variance was reduced to\nabout 5% that of the DSMC method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
