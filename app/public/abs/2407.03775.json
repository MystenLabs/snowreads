Following standard approaches, we introduce a quantum scalar field\npropagating in such black hole spacetimes and discretize the field degrees of\nfreedom on a lattice of spherical shells. We observe that, at leading order,\nthe entanglement entropy associated with the scalar field is proportional to\nBekestein-Hawking entropy, while the corresponding entanglement energy scales\nproportionally to Komar energy. We then compute the heat capacity in both\nscenarios, discussing the black hole stability conditions and the possible\nappearance of second-order phase transitions. Finally, we extend our analysis\nto the black hole core, showing that in this sector entanglement energy serves\nas a valuable tool towards discriminating between singular and regular\nsolutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
