Ab-initio\nDFT calculations have shown that structural polymorphism might be solely\nresolvable using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy\nat mega-bar pressures, however technical challenges have precluded such\nexperiments thus far. Here, we present in-situ high-pressure high-resolution\nNMR experiments in hydrogen phase III between 181 GPa and 208 GPa at room\ntemperature. Our spectra suggest that at lower pressures phase III adopts a\nhexagonal P6122 crystal structure, transitioning into a monoclinic C2/c phase\nat about 197 GPa. The high resolution spectra are in excellent agreement with\nearlier structural and spectral predictions and underline the possibility of a\nsubtle P6122 to C2/c phase transition in hydrogen phase III. These experiments\nshow the importance of a combination of ab-initio calculations and low-Z\nsensitive spectral probes in high-pressure science in elucidating the\nstructural complexity of the most abundant element in our universe.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_RNhjrv5R1A0miBh2alFpCl7Nc8pIQ1pmPeWs9HZUZQ","pdfSize":"1369303"}
