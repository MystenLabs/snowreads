A relatively complete humanoid agent first needs to have face and body,\nthen possess both verbal and non-verbal (such as eye contact, facial\nexpression, lip motion, gesture, and manipulation) abilities, and finally, it\nis capable of real-time duplex communication, e.g., the ability to actively\ninterrupt conversations. Most prior systems typically only consider a subset of\nthese elements, leaving a gap from realistic humanoid agent. In this work, we\npropose a real-time, duplex, interactive end-to-end network capable of modeling\nrealistic agent behaviors, including speech, full-body movements for talking,\nresponding, idling, and manipulation. This system is a multimodal model\nintegrating audio and visual inputs, extended from a pre-trained large language\nmodel (LLM). We collect approximately 200,000 hours of audio, around 130,000\nhours of video data, and about 20,000 alignment samples to build the model. The\nfinal model demonstrates capabilities that are difficult to achieve in previous\nsystems, such as generalized object manipulation. This work performs a\npreliminary exploration of the end-to-end approach in this field, aiming to\ninspire further research towards scaling up.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
