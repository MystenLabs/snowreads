Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals that excess\nenergy associated with optical excitation of \\textit{intra}-layer excitons and\nrelaxation to IXs affects the overall IX-PL lineshape, while the spectrally\nnarrow emission lines conventionally associated with moir\\'e IXs are\nunaffected. A striking uniform line-spacing of the sharp emission lines is\nobserved together with temperature and excitation level dependent spectra\nsuggesting an entirely new picture that photo-generated phonons lead to\nphonon-replicas shaping the IX-emission. Excitation power and time resolved\ndata indicate that these features are polaronic in nature. Our experimental\nfindings modify our current understanding of the photophysics of IXs beyond\ncurrent interpretations based on moir\\'e-trapped IXs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
