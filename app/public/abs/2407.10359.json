This\napproach has demonstrated success in enabling ANNs to perform multiple tasks\nwhile avoiding catastrophic forgetting. One unique aspect of this approach is\nthe use of separate developmental programs evolved to regulate the development\nof separate soma and dendrite units. An opportunity afforded by this approach\nis the ability to incorporate Activity Dependence (AD) into the model such that\nenvironmental feedback can help to regulate the behavior of each type of unit.\nPrevious work has shown a limited version of AD (influencing neural bias) to\nprovide marginal improvements over non-AD ANNs. In this work, we present\npromising results from new extensions to AD. Specifically, we demonstrate a\nmore significant improvement via AD on new neural parameters including health\nand position, as well as a combination of all of these along with bias. We\nreport on the implications of this work and suggest several promising\ndirections for future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
