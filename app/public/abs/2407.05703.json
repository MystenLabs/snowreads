To this end, we collect and annotate the first ultrasound video\ndataset with 100 videos for uterine fibroid segmentation (UFUV). We also\npresent Local-Global Reciprocal Network (LGRNet) to efficiently and effectively\npropagate the long-term temporal context which is crucial to help distinguish\nbetween uninformative noisy surrounding tissues and target lesion regions.\nSpecifically, the Cyclic Neighborhood Propagation (CNP) is introduced to\npropagate the inter-frame local temporal context in a cyclic manner. Moreover,\nto aggregate global temporal context, we first condense each frame into a set\nof frame bottleneck queries and devise Hilbert Selective Scan (HilbertSS) to\nboth efficiently path connect each frame and preserve the locality bias. A\ndistribute layer is then utilized to disseminate back the global context for\nreciprocal refinement. Extensive experiments on UFUV and three public Video\nPolyp Segmentation (VPS) datasets demonstrate consistent improvements compared\nto state-of-the-art segmentation methods, indicating the effectiveness and\nversatility of LGRNet.
