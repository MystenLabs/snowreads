Our model\nextends the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry by incorporating modular $S_3$ symmetry\nto specifically address neutrino mixing. It features two vector-like colored\nfermions and three colored scalars as $S_3$ singlets, an isospin doublet inert\nscalar and a singlet PQ scalar with appropriate modular weights assigned. Tiny\nneutrino masses are generated radiatively through colored mediators, while the\nKSVZ-type axion appears to dynamically resolve the strong CP problem. We\ninvestigate the phenomenology of lepton flavor violation and the muon $g-2$\nanomaly within this framework. Additionally, we explore the axion's properties\nand its role as dark matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
