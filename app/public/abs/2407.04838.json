Inspired by the classical\ntheory of ($S$-arithmetic) lattices and the flourishing theory of\nacylindrically hyperbolic groups, we show that, up to virtual isomorphism,\nfinitely generated groups in this class enjoy a strongly canonical product\ndecomposition. This semi-simple decomposition also descends to the\nouter-automorphism group, allowing us to give a partial resolution to a recent\nconjecture of Sela. We also develop various structure results including a free\nvs abelian Tits' Alternative, and connections to lattice envelopes. Along the\nway we give representation-theoretic proofs of various results about\nacylindricity -- some methods are new even in the rank-1 setting.\n  The vastness of this class of groups is exhibited by recognizing that it\ncontains, for example, $S$-arithmetic lattices with rank-1 factors,\nacylindrically hyperbolic groups, HHGs, groups with property (QT), and is\nclosed under direct products, passing to (totally general type) subgroups, and\nfinite index over-groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
