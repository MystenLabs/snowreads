The proposed method involves augmenting a neural network with a\nmemory component to stochastically compare current image views with previously\nencountered concepts. Additionally, we introduce stochastic memory blocks to\nregularize training and enforce consistency between image views. We extensively\nbenchmark our method on many vision tasks, such as linear probing, transfer\nlearning, low-shot classification, and image retrieval on many datasets. The\nexperimental results consolidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in\nachieving stable SSL training without additional regularizers while learning\nhighly transferable representations and requiring less computing time and\nresources.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9Gm_qIBryA3Cb8C7JWTLPY0KaBEvMWMZ77PvG0gAc8A","pdfSize":"8327300","objectId":"0xe0142cc09d6d25473afad7e1106cacdfcf296ef97ee2166a824ffdf1183ac89a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
