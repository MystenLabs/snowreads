However, most systems have only been investigated computationally\nand limited understanding of their stabilizing mechanisms restricts translation\nto experimental synthesis. To better elucidate key factors in designing ternary\nTMNs, we experimentally fabricate and analyze the physical properties of the\nternary Zr-Pt-N system. Structural analysis and DFT modeling demonstrate that\nPt substitutes nitrogen on the non-metallic sublattice, which destabilizes the\nrock-salt structure and forms a complex cubic phase. We also show insolubility\nof Pt in the Zr-Pt-N at 45 at % with the formation of a secondary Pt-rich\nphase. The measured reduced plasma frequency, decrease in resistivity, and\ndecrease in hardness reflect a dominance of metallic behavior in bonding.\nContrary to previous computational predictions, Zr-Pt-N films are shown to be\nmetastable systems where even low Pt concentrations (1%) facilitate a solid\nreaction with the Si-substrate, that is inaccessible in ZrN films.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
