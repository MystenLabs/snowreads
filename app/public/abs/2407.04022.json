Despite\nconsiderable attention, theoretically-motivated approaches are few and far\nbetween, with most methods building on top of some form of heuristic. Recently,\nU-OOD was formalized in the context of data invariants, allowing a clearer\nunderstanding of how to characterize U-OOD, and methods leveraging affine\ninvariants have attained state-of-the-art results on large-scale benchmarks.\nNevertheless, the restriction to affine invariants hinders the expressiveness\nof the approach. In this work, we broaden the affine invariants formulation to\na more general case and propose a framework consisting of a normalizing\nflow-like architecture capable of learning non-linear invariants. Our novel\napproach achieves state-of-the-art results on an extensive U-OOD benchmark, and\nwe demonstrate its further applicability to tabular data. Finally, we show our\nmethod has the same desirable properties as those based on affine invariants.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
