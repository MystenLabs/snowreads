The best asymptotic decomposition of an n-controlled X\ngate with one borrowed ancilla into single qubit and CNOT gates produces\ncircuits with degree 3 polylogarithmic depth and employs a divide-and-conquer\nstrategy. In this paper, we reduce the number of recursive calls in the\ndivide-and-conquer algorithm and decrease the depth of n-controlled X gate\ndecomposition to a degree of 2.799 polylogarithmic depth. With this optimized\ndecomposition, we also reduce the depth of n-controlled SU(2) gates and\napproximate n-controlled U(2) gates. Decompositions described in this work\nachieve the lowest asymptotic depth reported in the literature. We also perform\nan optimization in the base of the recursive approach. Starting at 52 control\nqubits, the proposed n-controlled X gate with one borrowed ancilla has the\nshortest circuit depth in the literature.
