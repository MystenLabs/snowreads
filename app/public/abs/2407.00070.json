Realizing nonvolatility can\nfurther reduce power consumption and expand application scenarios. We propose a\nnonvolatile 2*2 silicon photonic micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) switch\ncompatible with standard silicon photonic foundry processes. The switch employs\nelectrostatic comb actuator to change the air gap of the compact horizontal\nadiabatic coupler and achieves nonvolatility with centrally-clamped stepped\nbistable mechanical beams. The photonic switch features a 10s us-scale\nswitching speed and a 10s fJ-scale simulated switching energy within a 100*100\num2 footprint, with <=12 V driving voltages. This 2*2 switch can be used in a\nvariety of topologies for large-scale photonic switches, and its nonvolatility\ncan potentially support future photonic FPGA designs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
