Due to its ability\nto represent nonlinear dynamics as a linear operator, Koopman theory offers a\nfresh lens through which to understand and tackle the modeling and control of\ncomplex robotic systems. Moreover, it enables incremental updates and is\ncomputationally inexpensive making it particularly appealing for real-time\napplications and online active learning. This review comprehensively presents\nrecent research results on advancing Koopman operator theory across diverse\ndomains of robotics, encompassing aerial, legged, wheeled, underwater, soft,\nand manipulator robotics. Furthermore, it offers practical tutorials to help\nnew users get started as well as a treatise of more advanced topics leading to\nan outlook on future directions and open research questions. Taken together,\nthese provide insights into the potential evolution of Koopman theory as\napplied to the field of robotics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M9DgZqMh-Bca6c1Q49EJA8bEDn9d7x7VBEZDe234C5M","pdfSize":"1544623"}
