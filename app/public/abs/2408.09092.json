This is crucial for smart city\ndevelopment and public transportation planning. Existing research primarily\nrelies on statistical methods and sequential models to learn from individual\nhistorical interactions, which ignores the correlations between passengers and\nstations. To address these issues, this paper proposes DyGPP, which leverages\ndynamic graphs to capture the intricate evolution of passenger behavior. First,\nwe formalize passengers and stations as heterogeneous vertices in a dynamic\ngraph, with connections between vertices representing interactions between\npassengers and stations. Then, we sample the historical interaction sequences\nfor passengers and stations separately. We capture the temporal patterns from\nindividual sequences and correlate the temporal behavior between the two\nsequences. Finally, we use an MLP-based encoder to learn the temporal patterns\nin the interactions and generate real-time representations of passengers and\nstations. Experiments on real-world datasets confirmed that DyGPP outperformed\ncurrent models in the behavior prediction task, demonstrating the superiority\nof our model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"il0PRi2ecYtZhrSygDjhenEP3Q1DW9oo19EXqEIVe9k","pdfSize":"1293426"}
