This mechanism relies on the\nrecently discovered attractor of SCNI in the strong backreaction regime, where\nthe gauge fields do not decay on super-horizon scales and their backreaction\nleads to a stable new trajectory for the rolling axion field. The large\nsuper-horizon gauge fields are partly transformed after the electroweak phase\ntransition into electromagnetic fields. The strength and correlation length of\nthe resulting helical magnetic fields depend on the inflationary Hubble scale\nand the details of the SCNI sector. For suitable parameter choices we show that\nthe strength of the resulting magnetic fields having correlation lengths around\n$1\\, {\\rm {Mpc}}$ are consistent with the required intergalactic magnetic\nfields for explaining the spectra of high energy $\\gamma$ rays from distant\nblazars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VO3hw972ztix9ZM8ZqfggSTU92bARvQmD8WK3uGzpvo","pdfSize":"771479"}
