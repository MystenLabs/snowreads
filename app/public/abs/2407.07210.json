In the present work, we\nleverage popular pre-trained CNN models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and\nDenseNet121 to determine $N_{\\rm part}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=200$\nGeV on an event-by-event basis. Remarkably, all three models achieved good\nperformance despite the pre-trained models being trained for databases of other\ndomains. Particularly noteworthy is the superior performance of the VGG16\nmodel, showcasing the potential of transfer learning techniques for extracting\ndiverse observables from heavy-ion collision data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
