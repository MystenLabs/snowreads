The\nconsequences of the associated axion-polariton state on the thermal radiation\nare investigated. Planck's radiation law is shown to exhibit remarkable\nanisotropic behavior as a result of the strong refraction caused by the\nheat-matter interaction. A crossover scenario at low temperature is identified\nand an associated regime in which the system's internal energy does not scale\nwith the traditional fourth power of the temperature is revealed. We show that\nthe polarization purity of the heat radiation and its angular distribution can\nbe controlled via the magnetic field, paving the way toward a\ndirectional-tunable mechanism for thermal quanta manipulation and storage.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
