This calculation\nrepresents the first non-trivial step towards determining the N$^4$LO\nHamiltonian in the weak coupling regime. To cope with the large amount of\ncalculations, we make use of the $\\beta$ expansion and differential equation\nfor master integrals and systematize the procedure.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KwLoBpzQ6fBG3nCeWOQn5K3qfuSlA_nVF4XZQNitBRY","pdfSize":"171719"}
