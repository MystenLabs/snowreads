In this paper, we reformulated a generalized complex\nmanifold as a holomorphic symplectic differentiable formal stack in a\nhomotopical sense. Meanwhile, by developing the machinery for shifted\nsymplectic formal stack, we prove that the coisotropic intersection inherits\nshifted Poisson structure. Generalized complex branes are also studied.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
