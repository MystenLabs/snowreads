We show here that k-contact manifolds are generalized Sasakian if\nand only if they are classically Sasakian. We show also that strictly\npseudo-convex CR manifolds are always generalized Sasakian.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
