We impose constraints on the free\nparameters of the derived solution by utilizing MCMC analysis assuming the $CC,\nPantheon+SH0ES$, and $CC+Pantheon+SH0ES$ as data samples. We explore the\ndynamics of cosmological parameters. The evolutionary profile of the\ndeceleration parameter exhibits the transition %from the decelerated to the\naccelerated phase. The effective Equation-of-State parameter indicates the\nmodel remains in the quintessence era and gradually becomes the\nEinsteins-de-Sitter model. In addition to this, we also explore the jerk, snap,\nand lerk parameters. Furthermore, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows that the model\nhas a consistent positive slope across the entire evolution, but resembles the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model in the near future. At last, we conclude that the\npower law function of the modified $f(T)$ gravity model in the framework of the\nFLRW universe aligns more closely with the $\\Lambda$CDM model for given\nobservational data.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ajI2c3wYg1l2l4MlGS7jR_4wJpL-90K9yYsLNkODfOE","pdfSize":"1033131"}
