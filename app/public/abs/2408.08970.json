The\ncontribution of this article lies in the numerical implementation of the method\nbased on the Kronecker product, enabling scalability to over 1000 state\ndimensions. The tensor structure and symmetries arising from the Kronecker\nproduct representation are key to the development of efficient and scalable\nalgorithms. We derive the explicit algebraic structure for the equations,\npresent rigorous theory for the solvability and algorithmic complexity of those\nequations, and provide general purpose open-source software implementations for\nthe proposed algorithms. The method is illustrated on two simple academic\nmodels, followed by a high-dimensional semidiscretized PDE model of dimension\nas large as $n=1080$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
