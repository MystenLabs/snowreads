Despite cultural differences, some symbolic elements (e.g., heroes and\ntricksters) are common across many cultures. Here, we reconcile these seemingly\ncontradictory aspects by analyzing mythological themes and traditions at\nvarious scales. Our analysis revealed that global mythologies exhibit both\ngeographic and thematic nesting across different scales, manifesting in a\nlayered structure. The largest geographic clusters correspond to the New and\nOld Worlds, which further divide into smaller bioregions. This hierarchical\nmanifestation closely aligns with historical human migration patterns at a\nlarge scale, suggesting that narrative themes were carried through deep\nhistory. At smaller scales, the correspondence with bioregions indicates that\nthese themes are locally adapted and diffused into variations across cultures\nover time. Our approach, which treats myths and traditions as random variables\nwithout considering factors like geography, history, or story lineage, suggests\nthat the manifestation of mythology has been well-preserved over time and thus\nopens exciting research avenues to reconstruct historical patterns and provide\ninsight into human cultural narratives.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-nv6t3Ymcw4VESakPwI1xrltciF9qu42EJgK-QvHb4M","pdfSize":"16068921"}
