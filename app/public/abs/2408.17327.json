Li, S.-Y. Zhu, and G. S. Agarwal, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{121}, 203601 (2018)}]. By applying an external standing wave control,\nwe observe modifications in the transmission profile of a probe light beam,\nsignifying the presence of MMIG. Through numerical analysis, we explore the\ndiffraction intensities of the probe field, examining the impact of\ninteractions between cavity magnons, magnon-phonon interactions, standing wave\nfield strength, and interaction length. MMIG systems leverage the unique\nproperties of magnons, and collective spin excitations with attributes like\nlong coherence times and spin-wave propagation. These distinctive features can\nbe harnessed in MMIG systems for innovative applications in information\nstorage, retrieval, and quantum memories, offering various orders of\ndiffraction grating.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VDB8SRzAHiBhSvSpC9veJPpkQRmVk0LuI6KIYuA2bL8","pdfSize":"1137508"}
