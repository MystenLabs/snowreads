If this\nhappens, we prove that there is some gaps between them, namely $b \\gg \\frac{a\n\\log a)^{1/6}}{\\log \\log a)^{1/3}}$. We also consider other polynomial\nsequences such as $a^2 (a^2 + l)$ dividing $b^2 (b^2 + l)$ for some fixed\ninteger $l$. Our method is based on effective Liouville-Baker-Feldman theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VXaQGo7Q8T_6wAslMRozebAaCaiuydO68BYx72mfXnc","pdfSize":"129985"}
