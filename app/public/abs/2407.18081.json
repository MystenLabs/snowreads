An analysis of\nthe convergence properties of composite Bernstein polynomials is provided, and\nbeneficial properties of composite Bernstein polynomials for the solution of\noptimal control problems are discussed. The efficacy of the proposed\napproximation method is demonstrated through a bang-bang example. Lastly, we\napply this method to a motion planning problem, offering a practical solution\nthat emphasizes the ability of this method to solve complex optimal control\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
