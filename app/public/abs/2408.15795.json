The primary challenge is to achieve control over the phase\ncomposition and purity of the kesterite absorber. This is hampered by the fact\nthat the metals copper and tin have multiple valence states and this leads\ninevitably to the formation of multiple phases. Specifically for solution-based\nfabrication procedures for kesterite, the pursuit of phase purity extends to\nthe synthesis of CZTS precursor solution or nanoparticle dispersed inks (nano\ninks). In this work, a \"redox-free\" synthesis of CZTS nano ink is developed by\nmixing metal precursors with careful valence state control in non-toxic\nsolvents. The issue of secondary phase formation during the synthesis process\nof kesterite is effectively resolved. Additionally, molecular solutions and\nnanoparticle inks with identical compositions exhibit significantly different\nabilities in phase control. Nanoparticles pre-synthesized in the solution state\nexhibit superior phase control by following a more ideal phase formation path.\nThis provides a new pathway for the synthesis of kesterite with unprecedented\ncontrol of the phase composition and purity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
