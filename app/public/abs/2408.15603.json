The mathematical and\nnumerical procedure is described in generality, with the results presented for\nan Earth-like radius ratio. Through the weakly nonlinear analysis a\nStuart--Landau equation is obtained for the amplitude of the convective\ninstability, valid in the vicinity of its onset. Using this amplitude equation\nwe derive a reduced order model for the saturation of the instability via\nnonlinear effects and can completely describe the resultant limit cycle without\nthe need to solve initial value problems. In particular the weakly nonlinear\nanalysis is able to determine whether convection onsets as a supercritical or\nsubcritical Hopf bifurcation through solving only linear 2D problems,\nspecifically one eigenvalue and two linear boundary value problems. Using this,\nwe efficiently determine that convection can onset subcritically in a spherical\nshell for a range of Prandtl numbers if the shell is heated internally,\nconfirming previous predictions. Furthermore, by examining the weakly nonlinear\ncoefficients we show that it is the strong zonal flow created through Reynolds\nand thermal stresses that determines whether convection is supercritical or\nsubcritical.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
