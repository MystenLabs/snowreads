Nevertheless, detecting minute temperature changes with\nthermography is challenging as it is disturbed by not only noise but also\noutside temperature surrounding the object. In this study, we demonstrate\ndetecting face temperature variation by implementing lock-in thermography using\nheartbeat signals as a reference. It allows us to detect minute temperature\nchanges, as low as $\\sim$10 mK, on the forehead with a commercially available\nthermal camera. The proposed approach enables stable measurement of body\ntemperature variation, showing potential for non-contact emotion estimation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
