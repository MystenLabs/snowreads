Achieving anti-reflection in high-refractive-index materials poses\nchallenges due to their high reflectivity (Fresnel equations). Based on theory\nwith new boundary conditions, we propose modifying surface properties on a\nnanoscale to tackle this. Our study on weakly rough opaque surfaces reveals\nsignificant changes in specular and diffuse scattering, predicting\nanti-reflection where roughness matches light penetration depth for the first\ntime. Experimental validation on nano-roughened Si films (at wavelengths\n300-400 nm) supports our findings. We also analyze angular and polarization\ndependences of nanoroughness-induced haze, showing predominant p-polarization\nand minimal haze at nanoscale, yet impactful specular reflection reduction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
