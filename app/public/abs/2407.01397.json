Herein, we believe that exploring this\nproblem within the context of Continual Learning is crucial. While numerous\nstudies focus on skeleton-based action recognition from a traditional offline\nperspective, only a handful venture into online approaches. In this respect, we\nintroduce CHARON (Continual Human Action Recognition On skeletoNs), which\nmaintains consistent performance while operating within an efficient framework.\nThrough techniques like uniform sampling, interpolation, and a memory-efficient\ntraining stage based on masking, we achieve improved recognition accuracy while\nminimizing computational overhead. Our experiments on Split NTU-60 and the\nproposed Split NTU-120 datasets demonstrate that CHARON sets a new benchmark in\nthis domain.
