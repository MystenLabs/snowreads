We can\nresolve some of them via semantic markup using, e.g., sTeX, which also has\nother potential benefits, such as interoperability with computer algebra\nsystems, proof systems, and increased accessibility. However, semantic markup\nis more involved than \"regular\" typesetting and presents a challenge for\nauthors of mathematical documents. We aim to smooth out the transition from\nplain LaTeX to semantic markup by developing semi-automatic tools for authors.\nIn this paper we present an approach to semantic markup of formulas by\n(semi-)automatically generating grammars from existing sTeX macro definitions\nand parsing mathematical formulas with them. We also present a GUI-based tool\nfor the disambiguation of parse results and showcase its functionality and\npotential using a grammar for parsing untyped $\\lambda$-terms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
