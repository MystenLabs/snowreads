In contrast to state-of-the-art\nimplementations, tulip agent does not encode the descriptions of all available\ntools in the system prompt, which counts against the model's context window, or\nembed the entire prompt for retrieving suitable tools. Instead, the tulip agent\ncan recursively search for suitable tools in its extensible tool library,\nimplemented exemplarily as a vector store. The tulip agent architecture\nsignificantly reduces inference costs, allows using even large tool libraries,\nand enables the agent to adapt and extend its set of tools. We evaluate the\narchitecture with several ablation studies in a mathematics context and\ndemonstrate its generalizability with an application to robotics.
