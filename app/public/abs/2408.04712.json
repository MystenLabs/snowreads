We began by tiling the CMB variance map\n(which are produced by different smoothing scales) with stripes of different\nsizes along the most prominent dipole direction. We were able to confirm\nprevious findings regarding the significance of the dipole. Furthermore, we\ndiscovered that some of the higher multipoles exhibit significance comparable\nto the dipole which naturally depends on the smoothing scales. At the end, we\ndiscussed this result having an eye on look-elsewhere-effect. We believe our\nresults may indicate an anomalous patch in the CMB sky that warrants further\ninvestigation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
