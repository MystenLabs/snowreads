The latter is a newly introduced CVD source designed for\nepitaxial development of group IV semiconductors under low thermal budgets and\nCMOS compatible conditions. The $\\rm{Ge}_{1-x-y}Si_{x}Sn_{y}$ films were\nproduced between 160-200oC with 3-5% Si and ~ 5-11 % Sn, which traverses the\nindirect to direct gap transition in Ge-Sn materials. The films were fully\nstrained to Ge and exhibited defect-free microstructures, flat surfaces,\nhomogeneous compositions, uniform thicknesses and sharp interfaces as required\nfor device manufacturing. A comparative study was then conducted to investigate\nthe applicability of $\\rm GeH_{3}Cl$ for the synthesis of $\\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$\nbinaries under similar experimental conditions. The$\\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ films\nwere grown fully strained to Ge, but with reduced Sn compositions ranging from\n~ 2 - 7 % and lower thicknesses relative to $\\rm{Ge}_{1-x-y}Si_{x}Sn_{y}$. This\nprompted efforts to further investigate the growth behavior of $\\rm\nGe_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ using the $\\rm GeH_{3}Cl$ method, bypassing the Ge buffer to\nproduce samples directly on Si, with the aim of exploring how to manage\ninterface strain. In this case the $\\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ on Si films exhibited\ncompositions and thicknesses comparable to $\\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$-on-Ge films;\nhowever, their strain states were mostly relaxed, presumably due to the large\nmisfit between $\\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ and Si. Efforts to increase the\nconcentration and thickness of these samples resulted in non-homogeneous\nmulti-phase materials containing large amounts of interstitial Sn impurities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"J3zEtE-68lFejVTvCRe-CbN9UXtaVkzUI32y0vRZwvM","pdfSize":"3293258"}
