In this paper, we are interested in\npairs of real-valued functions $(F,f)$ on $[0,\\infty)$ that are related by the\nprojection/slicing formula $F (\\| x \\|) = \\mathbb E_{\\xi} \\big[ f \\big(|\\langle\nx,\\xi \\rangle| \\big) \\big]$ for $x\\in\\mathbb R^d$, where the expectation value\nis taken over uniformly distributed direction in $\\mathbb R^d$. While it is\nknown that $F$ can be obtained from $f$ by an Abel-like integral formula, we\nconstruct conversely $f$ from given $F$ using their Fourier transforms. First,\nwe consider the relation between $F$ and $f$ for radial functions $F(\\| \\cdot\\|\n)$ that are Fourier transforms of $L^1$ functions. Besides $d$- and\none-dimensional Fourier transforms, it relies on a rotation operator, an\naveraging operator and a multiplication operator to manage the walk from $d$ to\none dimension in the Fourier space. Then, we generalize the results to tempered\ndistributions, where we are mainly interested in radial regular tempered\ndistributions. Based on Bochner's theorem, this includes positive definite\nfunctions $F(\\| \\cdot\\| )$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
