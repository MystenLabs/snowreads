The SM Higgs quartic coupling parameter is expected\nto become negative at high scales, potentially generating an unstable vacuum\nwell before reaching the Planck scale. We investigate whether the introduction\nof vector-like leptons (VLLs) in six distinct gauge anomaly-independent\nrepresentations can stabilize the SM vacuum without introducing additional\nscalar fields. By analyzing the mass spectrum and mixing angles of these VLLs\nwith the SM leptons, we identify conditions under which the Higgs potential\nremains stable. We demonstrate that there exists a set of allowed but narrowed\nVLL spectra that can indeed stabilize the SM vacuum. We also study the effect\nof these VLLs on electroweak precision observables, particularly the oblique\nparameters S and T to ensure fit within global experimental constraints.\nFinally, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the parameter space allowed by\nelectroweak precision data and the parameter space required for stability,\nhighlighting cases that accommodate both. This study opens up new avenues for\nunderstanding the role of vector-like leptons in extending the validity of the\nStandard Model up to the Planck scale.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
