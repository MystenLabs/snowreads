However,\nthe existing tools may not meet the needs for scenarios such as the low-earth\norbit (LEO) satellite networks. To address the problem, this paper proposes and\nimplements a trace-driven emulation method based on Linux's eBPF technology.\nBuilding a Starlink traces collection system, we demonstrate that the method\ncan effectively and efficiently emulate the connection conditions, and\ntherefore provides a means for evaluating applications on local hosts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
