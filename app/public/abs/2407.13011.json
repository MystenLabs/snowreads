The characterization consists of individual\nmeasurements, which are required to be precisely known. A mismatch between\nactual and assumed constituent measurements limits the accuracy of this\ncharacterization. Here, we show that such a mismatch introduces reconstruction\nartifacts in quantum state tomography. We use these artifacts to detect and\nquantify the mismatch and gain information about the actual measurement\noperators. It consequently allows the mitigation of systematic errors in\nquantum measurement and state preparation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
