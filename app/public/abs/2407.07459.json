Using right and left retractions we obtain new results on minimal\nparabolic subgroups, intersection of parabolic subgroups, double cosets with\nrespect to parabolic subgroups and conjugacy classes in Artin groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
