Here, we demonstrate that coarse-grained, reinforcement\nlearning-based protocols can be developed to achieve highly localized and\ntargeted cargo transport by kinesin motors on intracellular tracks. These\nprotocols can be implemented in practice using optical tweezers, and their\nfeasibility is showcased within experimentally relevant parameter regimes. Our\nresults open new avenues for targeted control of intracellular transport\nprocesses, especially when opportunities for control are limited.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
