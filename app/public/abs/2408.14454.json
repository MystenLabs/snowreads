However, unidentified\nlines exist in the Fe IX and Fe X spectra, greatly impeding the spectroscopic\ndiagnostic potential of these ions. Here, we present measurements using the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory EBIT-I electron beam ion trap in the\nwavelength range 238-258 A. These studies enable us to unambiguously identify\nthe charge state associated with each of the observed lines. This wavelength\nrange is of particular interest because it contains the Fe IX density\ndiagnostic line ratio 241.74 A/244.91 A, which is predicted to be one of the\nbest density diagnostics of the solar corona, as well as the Fe X 257.26 A\nmagnetic-field-induced transition. We compare our measurements to the Fe IX and\nFe X lines tabulated in CHIANTI v10.0.1, which is used for modeling the solar\nspectrum. In addition, we have measured previously unidentified Fe X lines that\nwill need to be added to CHIANTI and other spectroscopic databases.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
