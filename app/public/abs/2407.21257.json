In this work, we obtained HST\nWFC3/F110W imaging to measure the sizes of 171 massive\n($\\mathrm{log(M_{*}/M_{\\odot})\\sim\\,11)}$ spectroscopically identified PSBs at\n$1<z<1.3$ selected from the DESI Survey Validation Luminous Red Galaxy sample.\nThis statistical sample constitutes an order of magnitude increase from the\n$\\sim20$ PSBs with space-based imaging and deep spectroscopy. We perform\nstructural fitting of the target galaxies with \\texttt{pysersic} and compare\nthem to quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the 3D-HST survey. We find that\nthese PSBs are more compact than the general population of quiescent galaxies,\nlying systematically $\\mathrm{\\sim\\,0.1\\,dex}$ below the established size-mass\nrelation. However, their central surface mass densities are similar to those of\ntheir quiescent counterparts\n($\\mathrm{\\,log(\\Sigma_{1\\,kpc}/(M_{\\odot}/kpc^2))\\sim\\,10.1}$). These findings\nare easily reconciled by later ex-situ growth via minor mergers or a slight\nprogenitor bias. These PSBs are round in projection ($b/a_{median}\\sim0.8$),\nsuggesting that they are primarily spheroids, not disks, in 3D. We find no\ncorrelation between time since quenching and light-weighted PSB sizes or\ncentral densities. This disfavors apparent structural growth due to the fading\nof centralized starbursts in this galaxy population. Instead, we posit that the\nfast quenching of massive galaxies at this epoch occurs preferentially in\ngalaxies with pre-existing compact structures.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"065TBpdUAHOfW-FH5Uz9IaIBr98z-NzDAo-PziWdlCU","pdfSize":"1572783"}
