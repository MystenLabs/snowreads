This combination holds great promise for enhancing the efficiency of\ncausal effect estimation, offering benefits such as reduced trial participant\nnumbers and expedited drug access for patients. Despite the availability of\nnumerous data fusion methods, selecting the most appropriate one for a specific\nresearch question remains challenging. This paper systematically reviews and\ncompares these methods regarding their assumptions, limitations, and\nimplementation complexities. Through simulations reflecting real-world\nscenarios, we identify a prevalent risk-reward trade-off across different\nmethods. We investigate and interpret this trade-off, providing key insights\ninto the strengths and weaknesses of various methods; thereby helping\nresearchers navigate through the application of data fusion for improved causal\ninference.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
