This study aims to use heart rate variability (HRV) features to\ndevelop an effective predictive model for sepsis detection. Critical HRV\nfeatures are identified through feature engineering methods, including\nstatistical bootstrapping and the Boruta algorithm, after which XGBoost and\nRandom Forest classifiers are trained with differential hyperparameter\nsettings. In addition, ensemble models are constructed to pool the prediction\nprobabilities of high-recall and high-precision classifiers and improve model\nperformance. Finally, a neural network model is trained on the HRV features,\nachieving an F1 score of 0.805, a precision of 0.851, and a recall of 0.763.\nThe best-performing machine learning model is compared to this neural network\nthrough an interpretability analysis, where Local Interpretable Model-agnostic\nExplanations are implemented to determine decision-making criterion based on\nnumerical ranges and thresholds for specific features. This study not only\nhighlights the efficacy of HRV in automated sepsis diagnosis but also increases\nthe transparency of black box outputs, maximizing clinical applicability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pv5gTKMvDgp5ISjIV2RR39YAM_yWjSkd-n44p3wl63M","pdfSize":"545673"}
