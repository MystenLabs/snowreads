While advantageous regularization effects and better optima have\nbeen found for some inverse problems, the benefit for topology optimization has\nbeen limited -- where the focus of investigations has been the compliance\nproblem. We demonstrate how neural network material discretizations can, under\ncertain conditions, find better local optima in more challenging optimization\nproblems, where we here specifically consider acoustic topology optimization.\nThe chances of identifying a better optimum can significantly be improved by\nrunning multiple partial optimizations with different neural network\ninitializations. Furthermore, we show that the neural network material\ndiscretization's advantage comes from the interplay with the Adam optimizer and\nemphasize its current limitations when competing with constrained and\nhigher-order optimization techniques. At the moment, this discretization has\nonly been shown to be beneficial for unconstrained first-order optimization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
