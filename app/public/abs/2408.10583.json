In this study, two amino acids,\ncrystalline L-serine and L-glutamic acid that were detected in meteorites, are\nprocessed by HPT and examined by ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,\nnuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in\nsitu mechanical shear testing. No polymerization, chemical reactions, or phase\ntransformations are detected after HPT, indicating that the stability and\npresence of these two amino acids in meteorites are quite reasonable. However,\nsome microstructural and mechanical changes like crystal size reduction to the\nnanometer level, crystal defect formation, lattice expansion by vacancy\nformation, and shear strength enhancement to the steady state are found which\nare similar to the behaviors reported in metals and ceramics after HPT\nprocessing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
