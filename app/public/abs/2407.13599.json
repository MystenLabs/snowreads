We follow the path of Lapid and Mao to reduce it\nto the conjectural local identity. Our strategy is based on the work of\nGinzburg--Rallis--Soudry on automorphic descent. We present the analogue result\nfor odd special orthogonal groups, which is conditional on unfolding Whittaker\nfunctions of descents.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
