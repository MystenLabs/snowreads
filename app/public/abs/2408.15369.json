It is possible thanks to the proposed purely probabilistic\ndefinition of the Gibbs random field without refereing to any physical notion.\nHowever, we do not oppose to each other the physical and probabilistic points\nof view on mathematical statistical physics; on the contrary, we show their\nnatural compatibility within the framework of the suggested Gibbs scheme. The\noutlines of the corresponding theory are presented. In this theory, the\nDLR--definition is not used. At the same time, the related existence theorem\nprovides one of adequate ways to construct Gibbs random fields (in the sense of\nprobabilistic definition). The results of mathematical statistical physics are\nembedded in the theory of Gibbs random fields under development as its\nimportant (if not the most important) part. We describe in general terms the\nrange of those problems that are more natural to solve using our definition.\nFor example, the problem of the Gibbsian description of known classes of random\nfields as well as questions of validity of limit theorems of probability\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nowdc7_6tV2oHDgnBQiGc6cng2h846VZqe8V2Padr0g","pdfSize":"239439"}
