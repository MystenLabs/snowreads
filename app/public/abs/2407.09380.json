We find that a detector network can improve the\nmeasurement precision of anisotropies by at most fourteen orders of magnitude,\ndepending on the angular multipoles. By doing so, we can enhance our\nunderstanding of the physical origins of SGWB, both in astrophysical and\ncosmological contexts. We assess the prospects of the detector networks for\nmeasuring the parameters of angular power spectrum. We further find an\ninevitable effect of cosmic variance, which can be suppressed by a better\nangular resolution, strengthening the importance of configuring detector\nnetworks. Our findings also suggest a potential detection of the kinematic\ndipole due to Doppler boosting of SGWB.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lQtdqGPcnvJ60eAcqUbg7H9UNFmklravoWU8Li-82Tw","pdfSize":"1386415"}
