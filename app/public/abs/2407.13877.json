For a very weakly irreducible hyperbolic automorphism $L$ we show that\nany $C^1$ conjugacy is $C^\\infty$. For a very weakly irreducible ergodic\npartially hyperbolic automorphism $L$ we show that any $C^{1+\\text{H\\\"older}}$\nconjugacy is $C^\\infty$. As a corollary, we improve regularity of the conjugacy\nto $C^\\infty$ in prior local and global rigidity results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
