In this paper, we\ninvestigates multi-user localization and tracking problem in\nmulti-RISs-assisted system. In particular, we incorporate statistical\nspatiotemporal correlation of multi-user locations and develop a general\nspatiotemporal Markov random field model (ST-+MRF) to capture multi-user\ndynamic motion states. To achieve superior performance, a novel multi-user\ntracking algorithm is proposed based on Bayesian inference to effectively\nutilize the correlation among users. Besides that, considering the necessity of\nRISs configuration for tracking performance, we further propose a predictive\nRISs beamforming optimization scheme via semidefinite relaxation (SDR).\nCompared to other pioneering work, finally, we confirm that the proposed\nstrategy by alternating tracking algorithm and RISs optimization, can achieve\nsignificant performance gains over benchmark schemes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
