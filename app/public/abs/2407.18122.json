Such a set of arrays can be viewed as a\ntwo-dimensional generalization of a perfect factor in the de Bruijn graph.\nNecessary conditions for the existence of such arrays are given. Several direct\nconstructions and recursive constructions for such arrays are given. A\nframework for a theory of two-dimensional feedback shift register which is akin\nto (one-dimensional) feedback shift registers is suggested.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
