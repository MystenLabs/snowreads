Some recent analyses support either view, and we\nlack a comparative test on cross-cultural data. We address this longstanding\nproblem through a rigorous, computational comparison of the main theories\nagainst 1,314 scales from 96 countries. There is near-universal support for\nmelodic theories, which predict step-sizes of 1-3 semitones. Harmony accounts\nfor the prevalence of some simple-integer-ratio intervals, particularly for\nmusic-theoretic scales from Eurasian societies, which may explain their\ndominance amongst Western scholars. However, harmony poorly predicts scales\nmeasured from ethnographic recordings, particularly outside of Eurasia.\nOverall, we show that the historical emphasis on harmony is misguided and that\nmelody is the primary determinant of the world's musical scales.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
