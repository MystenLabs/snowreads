Many\ngraph neural network (GNN) architectures are inspired by such dynamical\nsystems, typically based on the graph Laplacian. Here, we introduce\nDirac--Bianconi GNNs (DBGNNs), which are based on the topological Dirac\nequation recently proposed by Bianconi. Based on the graph Laplacian, we\ndemonstrate that DBGNNs explore the geometry of the graph in a fundamentally\ndifferent way than conventional message passing neural networks (MPNNs). While\nregular MPNNs propagate features diffusively, analogous to the heat equation,\nDBGNNs allow for coherent long-range propagation. Experimental results showcase\nthe superior performance of DBGNNs over existing conventional MPNNs for\nlong-range predictions of power grid stability and peptide properties. This\nstudy highlights the effectiveness of DBGNNs in capturing intricate graph\ndynamics, providing notable advancements in GNN architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kdtekAQWExnjutB9QunqHqO2piovqQ89_eBqn2Ja_VM","pdfSize":"4775238"}
