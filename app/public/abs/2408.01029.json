Electrical\ntransport experiments reveal that thick films have properties similar to bulk\nmaterials. By employing co-deposition, we introduced either magnetic or\nnon-magnetic elements during the growth of thinner films, significantly\naltering their electrical properties. Notably, magnetic element Cr induces\nlong-range ferromagnetic ordering, leading to the observation of significant\nanomalous Hall effect in NiTe2 thin films. The Hall conductivity remains nearly\nconstant well below the Curie temperature, indicating the correlation with the\nintrinsic topological nature of the band structure. Theoretical first\nprinciples band calculations support the generation of the Weyl semimetal state\nin the material through magnetic doping. These findings pave the way for\nexploring more magnetic Weyl semimetal materials and related low-dimensional\nquantum devices based on topological semimetal materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
