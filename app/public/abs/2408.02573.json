The new\nsharp testable equalities can detect all possible observable violations of the\nidentifying conditions. We propose a testing procedure for the model's validity\nusing existing inference methods for intersection bounds. Simulation results\nsuggests proper size for large samples and that the test is powerful to detect\nlarge violation of the exogeneity assumption and violations in the error\nstructure. Finally, we review and propose new alternative paths to partially\nidentify the parameters of interest under less restrictive assumptions.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_z8Orwo1Mo3VfPP7g7e3UmrkffJv5bgrigwUI5Itd74","pdfSize":"340926","txDigest":"G8y6K8wjmmbtQCZXiC2hiq2Qimd14mEPKyE7KbHJgUiA","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
