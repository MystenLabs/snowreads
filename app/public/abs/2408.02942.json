We developed detailed time usage\nand location visit profiles for 60,131 people in England and Wales by analyzing\nabout 120 million cell phone location and timestamp records on March 2020 and\nMarch 2021. We found that both at-home time and amenity visits increased during\nCOVID-19, while workplace visits decreased. Individual visits to different\nlocations are determined by three key factors: individual preference measured\nby pre-pandemic location visit frequency, time constraints influenced by\nwork-from-home, and space accessibility. We also find that WFH improves\nequality of individual amenity usage between people of different incomes.\nLow-income and middle-income people saw an 8% and 4% increase in additional\namenity visits, respectively, compared to high-income people during the\npandemic.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6iIT_-o4Ih6GrO4wRxi-fJGMhxWO9VCiMn8MbZWZ4zU","pdfSize":"1319862"}
