The\nmethod is based on the data-based identification of a discrete Lagrangian\ndensity. It is a geometric machine learning technique in the sense that the\nvariational structure of the true field theory is reflected in the data-driven\nmodel by design. We provide a rigorous convergence statement of the method. The\nproof circumvents challenges posed by the ambiguity of discrete Lagrangian\ndensities in the inverse problem of variational calculus. Moreover, our method\ncan be used to quantify model uncertainty in the equations of motions and any\nlinear observable of the discrete field theory. This is illustrated on the\nexample of the discrete wave equation and Schr\\\"odinger equation. The article\nconstitutes an extension of our previous article arXiv:2404.19626 for the\ndata-driven identification of (discrete) Lagrangians for variational dynamics\nfrom an ode setting to the setting of discrete pdes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
