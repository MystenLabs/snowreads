This paper\ncontribution comprising two main elements. Firstly, we present a novel dataset\nof authentic guest reviews sourced from a prominent online travel platform,\ntotaling over two million reviews from 50,000 distinct accommodations.\nSecondly, we propose an innovative approach for personalized review ranking.\nOur method employs contrastive learning to intricately capture the relationship\nbetween a review and the contextual information of its respective reviewer.\nThrough a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate that our approach\nsurpasses several baselines across all reported metrics. Augmented by a\ncomparative analysis, we showcase the efficacy of our method in elevating\npersonalized review ranking. The implications of our research extend beyond the\ntravel domain, with potential applications in other sectors where personalized\nreview ranking is paramount, such as online e-commerce platforms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
