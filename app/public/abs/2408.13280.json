The model takes as input a sequence of\nfloating-point numbers with lengths ranging from 30 to 35 and produces a\ntwo-dimensional vector output. It integrates floating-point embeddings and\npositional encoding, and is trained using binary cross-entropy loss. The paper\nprovides a detailed description of the model's components and training methods,\nand compares the performance of the traditional least squares method, the\npreviously used deep neural network, and the modified Transformer in mass\nestimation. The results show that the modified Transformer model achieves\ngreater accuracy in mass estimation than the traditional least squares method.\nAdditionally, compared to the deep neural network, this model utilizes\npositional encoding and can handle input sequences of varying lengths, offering\nenhanced adaptability.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
