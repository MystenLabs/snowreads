Whereas\nprevious approaches induce slots by clustering value spans extracted directly\nfrom the dialogue text, we demonstrate the power of discovering slots using a\ngenerative approach. By training a model to generate slot names and values that\nsummarize key dialogue information with no prior task knowledge, our SSI method\ndiscovers high-quality candidate information for representing dialogue state.\nThese discovered slot-value candidates can be easily clustered into unified\nslot schemas that align well with human-authored schemas. Experimental\ncomparisons on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets demonstrate that Generative\nDialogue State Inference (GenDSI) outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on\nmultiple aspects of the SSI task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
