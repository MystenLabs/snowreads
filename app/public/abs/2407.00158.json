Our framework is motivated by the recent experimental demonstrations of\ntwo-site and three-site artificial Kitaev chains in a similar setup. We find\nthat introducing a $\\pi$-phase domain wall in the Kitaev chain leads to a pair\nof mirror-protected Majorana zero modes located at or near the junction.\nJoining two $\\pi$-junctions into a closed loop, we can simulate two distinct\nclasses of two-dimensional higher-order topological superconducting phases,\nboth carrying symmetry-protected Majorana modes around the sample corners. As\nan extension of the $\\pi$-junction, we further consider a general vertex\nstructure where $n$ Kitaev chains meet, i.e., a Kitaev $n$-vertex. We prove\nthat such an $n$-vertex, if respecting a dihedral symmetry group $D_n$,\nnecessarily carries $n$ vertex-bound Majorana modes protected by the $D_n$\nsymmetry. Resilience of the junction and vertex Majorana bound states against\ndisorder and correlation effects is also discussed. Our architecture paves the\nway for designing, constructing, and exploring a wide variety of artificial\ntopological crystalline phases in experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
