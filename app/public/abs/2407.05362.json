We define an insertion procedure we call collapsing\non multiline queues which can be described by raising and lowering crystal\noperators. Using this procedure, one naturally recovers several classical\nresults such as the Lascoux--Sch\\\"utzenberger charge formulas for $q$-Whittaker\npolynomials, Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and the dual Cauchy identity.\nWe extend the results to generalized multiline queues by defining a statistic\non these objects that allows us to derive a family of formulas, indexed by\ncompositions, for the $q$-Whittaker polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
