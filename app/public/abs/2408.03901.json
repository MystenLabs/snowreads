Within a holographic framework, the stress tensor\nand the boundary Cotton tensor are computed from the electric/magnetic content\nof the Weyl tensor. The holographic stress tensor/Cotton tensor duality is\nrecovered along the (anti-)self-dual curve in parameter space. We show that the\nlatter not only implies a duality relation for the mass but also for the\nangular momentum. The partition function is computed to first order in the\nsaddle-point approximation and a BPS bound is obtained. The ground state of the\ntheory is enlarged to all the (anti-)self-dual configurations when the $SO(4)$\nand $U(1)$ Pontryagin densities are introduced. We demonstrate this at the\nlevel of the action and variations thereof.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mtnr4FrnWJICPTCbZW2r1bKYjQQP878HFvx0DyNN-vk","pdfSize":"248153"}
