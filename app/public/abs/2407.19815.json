Our study focuses on symmetrized weight enumerators of pairs of\nType II codes over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$ and the ring\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{4}$. These pairs have been examined as invariants for a specified\ngroup. In particular, we concentrate on the scenarios where the space of the\ninvariant ring is of degree 8 and 16. Our findings show that in certain\nsituations, the ring produced by the symmetrized weight enumerators precisely\nmatches with the invariant ring of the designated group. This coincidence\npoints to a profound relationship between the invariant ring's structure and\nthe algebraic characteristics of the weight enumerators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
