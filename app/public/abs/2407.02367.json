This work focuses on temporal hierarchies, such as\naggregating monthly time series data to annual data. We explore the impact of\nvarious forecast reconciliation methods on temporally aggregated ARIMA models,\nthereby bridging the fields of hierarchical forecast reconciliation and\ntemporal aggregation both theoretically and experimentally. Our paper is the\nfirst to theoretically examine the effects of temporal hierarchical forecast\nreconciliation, demonstrating that the optimal method aligns with a bottom-up\naggregation approach. To assess the practical implications and performance of\nthe reconciled forecasts, we conduct a series of simulation studies, confirming\nthat the findings extend to more complex models. This result helps explain the\nstrong performance of the bottom-up approach observed in many prior studies.\nFinally, we apply our methods to real data examples, where we observe similar\nresults.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1r5MxPT25_V6Wn12qITlT9bPpdIX9FG1TYd-nWPKGwE","pdfSize":"1731186"}
