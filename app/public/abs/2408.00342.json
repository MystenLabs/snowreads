We find that sparse reward functions of\nHumanoidBench yield undesirable and unrealistic behaviors when optimized;\ntherefore, we propose a set of regularization terms that stabilize the robot\nbehavior across tasks. Current evaluations on a subset of tasks demonstrate\nthat our proposed reward function allows achieving the highest HumanoidBench\nscores while maintaining realistic posture and smooth control signals. Our code\nis publicly available and will become a part of MuJoCo MPC, enabling rapid\nprototyping of robot behaviors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
