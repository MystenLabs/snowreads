This dataset is uniquely positioned to facilitate the detection and\nprediction of motor health issues, enabling a more efficient maintenance\nscheduling process that can potentially obviate the need for regular checks.\nUnlike existing datasets, often created under controlled conditions or through\nsimulations, FAN-COIL-I is compiled from real-world operational data, providing\nan invaluable resource for authentic motor diagnosis and predictive maintenance\nresearch. Gathered using a high-resolution 32KHz sampling rate, the dataset\nencompasses comprehensive vibration readings from both the forward and rear\nsides of the Fan Coil motor over a continuous two-week period, offering a rare\nglimpse into the dynamic operational patterns of these systems in a corporate\nsetting. FAN-COIL-I stands out not only for its real-world applicability but\nalso for its potential to serve as a reliable benchmark for researchers and\npractitioners seeking to validate their models against genuine engine\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KqgW-SX9em6gYeQZmiP4QLV3HqriRRnCstcRJj8MTbw","pdfSize":"767633"}
