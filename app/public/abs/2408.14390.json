One approach is to search for frequently\noccurring patterns in speech. We revisit this idea with DUSTED: Discrete Unit\nSpoken-TErm Discovery. Leveraging self-supervised models, we encode input audio\ninto sequences of discrete units. Next, we find repeated patterns by searching\nfor similar unit sub-sequences, inspired by alignment algorithms from\nbioinformatics. Since discretization discards speaker information, DUSTED finds\nbetter matches across speakers, improving the coverage and consistency of the\ndiscovered patterns. We demonstrate these improvements on the ZeroSpeech\nChallenge, achieving state-of-the-art results on the spoken-term discovery\ntrack. Finally, we analyze the duration distribution of the patterns, showing\nthat our method finds longer word- or phrase-like terms.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X9N3hcl6LcMY6lY09LDwmt8WalvUn5CVc4XmZY_9aGA","pdfSize":"583264"}
