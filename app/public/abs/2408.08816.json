Linear ordinary differential equations are derived for the\ntangent vectors on two-dimensional fold-angle planes, with the coefficient\nmatrix depending exclusively on the sector angles. By taking the limit to the\nflat state, we generalize the fold-angle multipliers previously defined for\nflat-foldable vertices to general and collinear developable degree-4 vertices,\nand obtain a compatibility theorem on the rigid-foldability of polygons with\n$n$ developable degree-4 vertices. We further explore the rigid-foldable\npolygons of equimodular type and compose tangent vectors involving fold angles\nat the creases of the central polygon.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
