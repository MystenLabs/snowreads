We prove that larger symbol classes\nlead to H\\\"older continuity with respect to the parameter. This result is then\nused to investigate the behavior of frame bounds of families of Gabor systems\n$\\mathcal{G}(g,\\alpha\\Lambda)$ with respect to the parameter $\\alpha>0$, where\n$\\Lambda$ is a set of non-uniform, relatively separated time-frequency shifts,\nand $g\\in M^1_s(\\mathbb{R}^d)$, $0\\leq s\\leq 2$. In particular, we show that\nthe frame bounds depend continuously on $\\alpha$ if $g\\in M^1(\\mathbb{R}^d)$,\nand are H\\\"older continuous if $g\\in M^1_s(\\mathbb{R}^d)$, $0<s\\leq 2$, with\nthe H\\\"older exponent explicitly given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
