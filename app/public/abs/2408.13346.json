For $e_jp_A(n)$, we prove\nanalogs of the classical formula for the partition function, $p(n)=1/n\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\sigma_1(n-k)p(k)$, where $\\sigma_1$ is the sum of divisors\nfunction. We prove several congruences for $e_2p_4(n)$, the sum of $e_2$ over\nthe set of partitions of $n$ into four parts. Define the function\n$\\textrm{pre}_j(\\lambda)$ to be the multiset of monomials in $e_j(\\lambda)$,\nwhich is itself a partition. If $\\mathcal A$ is a set of partitions, we define\n$\\textrm{pre}_j(\\mathcal A)$ to be the set of partitions\n$\\textrm{pre}_j(\\lambda)$ as $\\lambda$ ranges over $\\mathcal A$. If $\\mathcal\nP(n)$ is the set of all partitions of $n$, we conjecture that the number of odd\npartitions in $\\textrm{pre}_2(\\mathcal P(n))$ is at least the number of\ndistinct partitions. We prove some results about $\\textrm{pre}_2(\\mathcal\nB(n))$, where $\\mathcal B(n)$ is the set of binary partitions of $n$.
