Restricting to a particular class of dispersion\nrelationships, we identify a map between the number of particles produced in a\nspecial kinematic limit and a Stokes phenomena related topology of analytic\ncontinuation of the Bogoliubov coefficient functions. Intuitively, this\nkinematic limit corresponds to the long wavelength limit although a more\nprecise description depends on the nature of the curved spacetime. To identify\nthe topology, we reformulate the usual Bogoliubov computations as a type of\nSU(1,1) gauged differential equation and utilize a special gauge together with\na discrete symmetry that naturally characterizes the dispersion relationship.\nUsing a dark matter model and a nonzero constant spatial curvature model, we\nestimate how such topological contributions will arise in physical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
