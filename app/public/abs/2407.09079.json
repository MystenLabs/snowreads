Here, we propose a topological phase\nprotected by spacetime inversion symmetry - the crossed real nodal line (RNL)\nin the phonon spectrum of gold monobromide (AuBr). In AuBr, there exist four\nstraight nodal lines, which are linked by a crossed nodal line formed by two\nlower bands. Remarkably, each adjacent two of the four straight nodal lines is\na pair, forming a crossed RNL with nontrivial real Chern number. Such\nconfiguration and pairing mode of RNL have never been reported. The crossed RNL\nexhibits unique surface and hinge states distinguished from that of the\nconventional RNLs. The symmetry protection and the transformation under the\nsymmetry-preserving strain of the crossed RNL are also investigated. Our\nresults open the door to a new class of topological states, and predict its\nrealization in experimentally synthesized material.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
