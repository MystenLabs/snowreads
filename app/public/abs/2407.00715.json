The ES exhibits an exponential\ncharacteristic that varies with temperature ($\\exp,[\\frac{T_0}{T}]$), T0 is\ncharacteristics temperature. The characteristics temperature,T$_0$, decreases\nas the effective interface diminishes and the amplitude of the dc magnetic\nfield increases. The creation of ferromagnetic dimers between Gd$^{+3}$ ions in\nGdO is observed as a result of vortex-dipole interaction, which causes the\nobservation of this unusual ES at temperatures much lower than the\nsuperconducting onset temperature T$_{S}^{onset}$. This type of ferromagnetic\ndimer formation much below superconducting transition temperature is found\ncomparable with the formation of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state and interaction\nbetween these YSR state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JvT-4lOUckyW5aBIsh5tp1S0hGTZ-_Nvp0A2p_-ksRE","pdfSize":"1188534"}
