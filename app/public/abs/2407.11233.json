The\ninfection-rate is dependent on population mixing patterns that do not vary\nerratically day-to-day; in contrast, daily case-counts used in contemporary\nsurveillance algorithms are corrupted by reporting errors. The technical\nchallenge lies in estimating the latent infection-rate from case-counts. Here\nwe devise a Bayesian method to estimate the infection-rate across multiple\nadjoining areal units, and then use it, via an anomaly detector, to discern a\nchange in epidemiological dynamics. We extend an existing model for estimating\nthe infection-rate in an areal unit by incorporating a Markov random field\nmodel, so that we may estimate infection-rates across multiple areal units,\nwhile preserving spatial correlations observed in the epidemiological dynamics.\nTo carry out the high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problem, we develop an\nimplementation of mean-field variational inference specific to the infection\nmodel and integrate it with the random field model to incorporate correlations\nacross counties. The method is tested on estimating the COVID-19\ninfection-rates across all 33 counties in New Mexico using data from the summer\nof 2020, and then employing them to detect the arrival of the Fall 2020\nCOVID-19 wave. We perform the detection using a temporal algorithm that is\napplied county-by-county. We also show how the infection-rate field can be used\nto cluster counties with similar epidemiological dynamics.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wWe0pX_3d32rTFunNmDDLaO8mlX-bRCg2yESowySYUM","pdfSize":"1467119","objectId":"0xf772d3a2e9b089aa409cf506b792dca3069521fda0a5f4163bf923a737f713a2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
