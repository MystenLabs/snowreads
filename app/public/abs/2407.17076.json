Initially motivated by the\nintriguing uniform spread of the zeros of the spectrogram of white noise, it\nhas led to fruitful theoretical developments combining probability theory,\ncomplex analysis and signal processing. In this vein, the present work proposes\na characterization of the zeros of the Stockwell Transform of white noise,\nwhich consists in an hybrid time--frequency multiresolution representation.\nFirst of all, an analytic version of the Stockwell Transform is designed. Then,\nanalyticity is leveraged to establish a connection with the hyperbolic Gaussian\nAnalytic Function, whose zero set is invariant under the isometries of the\nPoincar\\'e disk. Finally, the theoretical spatial statistics of the zeros of\nthe hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function and the empirical statistics of the\nzeros the Analytic Stockwell Transform of white noise are compared through\nintensive Monte Carlo simulations, supporting the established connection. A\npublicly available documented Python toolbox accompanies this work.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
