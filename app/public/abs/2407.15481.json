The existing harmonization methods can only\nproduce one deterministic result for a composite image, ignoring that a\ncomposite image could have multiple plausible harmonization results due to\nmultiple plausible reflectances. In this work, we first propose a\nreflectance-guided harmonization network, which can achieve better performance\nwith the guidance of ground-truth foreground reflectance. Then, we also design\na diverse reflectance generation network to predict multiple plausible\nforeground reflectances, leading to multiple plausible harmonization results.\nThe extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
