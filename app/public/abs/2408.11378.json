Based on\nthis classification, we show that a three-dimensional terminal del Pezzo\nfibration onto a curve over an algebraically closed field always admits a\nsection. Moreover, we prove that the total space is rational if the base curve\nis rational and the anticanonical degree of a fibre is at least five.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
