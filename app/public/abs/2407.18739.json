The study introduces a new RMF parameter set, TM1m, which is a\nmodification of the TM1e model with an adjusted effective mass, maintaining the\nsaturation properties of nuclear matter. The TM1m model, with a larger\neffective mass ratio ($M^{\\ast}/M \\sim 0.8$) compared to the TM1e model\n($M^{\\ast}/M \\sim 0.63$), is employed to construct a new EOS table, EOS5. This\nEOS table is designed to offer insights into the influence of effective nucleon\nmass on the EOS within a relativistic framework, particularly above the\nsaturation density. The properties of cold neutron stars, calculated using the\nTM1m model, are compared with those of the TM1e and original TM1 models. Both\nthe TM1m and TM1e models are found to be compatible with the latest constraints\non tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, derived from astrophysical\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
