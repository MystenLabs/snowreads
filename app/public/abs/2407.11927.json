Understanding how interventions or experiences such as\npart-time work can influence this growth is also important. Traditional methods\nlike difference-in-differences are effective for estimating causal effects from\nlongitudinal data. Meanwhile, Bayesian non-parametric methods have recently\nbecome popular for estimating causal effects from single time point\nobservational studies. However, there remains a scarcity of methods capable of\ncombining the strengths of these two approaches to flexibly estimate\nheterogeneous causal effects from longitudinal data. Motivated by two waves of\ndata from the High School Longitudinal Study, the NCES' most recent\nlongitudinal study which tracks a representative sample of over 20,000 students\nin the US, our study introduces a longitudinal extension of Bayesian Causal\nForests. This model allows for the flexible identification of both individual\ngrowth in mathematical ability and the effects of participation in part-time\nwork. Simulation studies demonstrate the predictive performance and reliable\nuncertainty quantification of the proposed model. Results reveal the negative\nimpact of part time work for most students, but hint at potential benefits for\nthose students with an initially low sense of school belonging. Clear signs of\na widening achievement gap between students with high and low academic\nachievement are also identified. Potential policy implications are discussed,\nalong with promising areas for future research.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
