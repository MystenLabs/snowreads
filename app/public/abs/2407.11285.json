We develop properties of the graph of lines, in\nwhich adjacency means having a common point, especially its strong regularity\nand clique structure. The main construction of projective rectangles, stated in\na previous paper, gives rectangles whose graph of lines is a known strongly\nregular bilinear forms graph. That fact leads to a proof that the main\nconstruction does produce projective rectangles, and also gives a new\nrepresentation of bilinear forms graphs. We conclude by mentioning a few simple\ngraph properties, such as the chromatic number, which is not known, and a\npartial geometry obtained from the graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
