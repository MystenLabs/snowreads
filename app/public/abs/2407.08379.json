Working with the light\ntransforms of the operators belonging to the modified Mellin basis, we found\nthat the leading order singularity in the OPE of such operators could be fixed\npurely using Poincar\\'e symmetries owing to the non-trivial action of the\ntranslations on these operators. The OPE coefficient is then fixed using the\nsoft limit of the correlation functions. We check that this singular structure\nobtained from symmetries is consistent with the OPE limit of three-point\nfunctions. This approach could potentially be useful for studying Celestial CFT\nwithout adverting to bulk physics. As another goal, we explore the significance\nof light transformation in Carrollian CFTs. In the special cases we considered,\nwe show that light transformation equips us with a map between two branches of\nCarroll CFT in $d=3$ dimension at the level of correlation functions in the\nnear coincident limit.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rDDOy3aacSZXjAsOixhMMyZRTcmNfyx-YRHy1BXE1kg","pdfSize":"482106"}
