Recent\nwork highlights the importance of causal ML models in ADM systems, but\nimplementing them in complex social environments poses significant challenges.\nResearch on how these challenges impact the performance in specific downstream\ndecision-making tasks is limited. Addressing this gap, we make use of a\ncomprehensive real-world dataset of jobseekers to illustrate how the\nperformance of a single CATE model can vary significantly across different\ndecision-making scenarios and highlight the differential influence of\nchallenges such as distribution shifts on predictions and allocations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
