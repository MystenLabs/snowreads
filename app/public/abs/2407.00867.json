Recent hardware advancements in CPU and interconnection\ntechnologies, enabled the possibility of disaggregating peripherals and system\nmemory. The memory system heterogeneity is further increasing, composability\nand disaggregation are beneficial to increase memory capacity and improve\nmemory utilization in a cost-effective way, and reduce total cost of ownership.\nHeterogeneous and Composable Disaggregated Systems (HCDS) provide a system\ndesign approach for reducing the imbalance between workloads resource\nrequirements and the static availability of resources in a computing system.\nThe HCDS workshop aims at exploring the novel research ideas around composable\ndisaggregated systems and their integration with operating systems and software\nruntimes to maximize the benefit perceived from user workloads.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
