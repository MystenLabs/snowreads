We selected the HEMT for its\nunique noise reduction properties, crucial for quantum engineering. The main\ngoal is to minimize the noise figure within the C-band frequency range (4-8\nGHz) to induce nonclassicality in quantum signals. While achieving a noise\nfigure of less than 0.065 dB within this band, we recognized the trade-off with\ngain, mitigated by incorporating additional stages to maintain noise figure at\noptimal levels. Quantum analysis of the circuit, employing a simplified model\nof HEMT due to its complexity, revealed insights into its nonlinear properties\nand interactions between circuit components and environmental factors.\nLeveraging Qutip toolbox in Python, we conducted time-evolution analysis of the\nsystem, revealing the circuit's behavior as an open quantum system under\ncryogenic conditions. Our investigation extends to quantifying quantum\ncorrelation (quantum discord) and its relationship with noise figure, posing\nimportant questions regarding the direct impact of its minimization on circuit\nnonclassicality at cryogenic temperatures. This comprehensive study sheds light\non the intricate interplay between circuit design, and its influence on the\nrelationship between the noise figure and quantum correlation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JeUEtzx3FXUGlEGuqWY6fqqwNWztYZlgXlU912wHCyM","pdfSize":"1649534"}
