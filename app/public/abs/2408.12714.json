The main characteristics are the droplet's force exerted\non the surface and its maximal spreading radius. The crucial question is: How\ndo they depend on the (dimensionless) control parameters, which are the Weber\nnumber $We$ (non-dimensionalized kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$\n(dimensionless viscosity)? Here we perform direct numerical simulations over\nthe huge parameter range $1\\le We \\le 10^3$ and $10^{-3}\\le Oh \\le 10^2$ and in\nparticular develop a unifying theoretical approach, which is inspired by the\nGrossmann-Lohse theory for wall-bounded turbulence [J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27\n(2000); PRL 86, 3316 (2001)]. The key idea is to split the energy dissipation\nrate into the different phases of the impact process, in which different\nphysical mechanisms dominate. The theory can consistently and quantitatively\naccount for the $We$ and $Oh$ dependences of the maximal impact force and the\nmaximal spreading diameter over the huge parameter space. It also clarifies why\nviscous dissipation plays a significant role during impact, even for\nlow-viscosity droplets (low $Oh$), in contrast to what had been assumed in\nprior theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SreUwudsf8IxwmJ2aiIldait4RjxbwigWM96jVj1p2c","pdfSize":"3273493"}
