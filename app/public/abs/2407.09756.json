However, this\ntask can be challenging as the audience often lacks specific knowledge about\nthe presented research. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that\nintegrates three LLMs mimicking the real-world\nwriting-reading-feedback-revision workflow, with one LLM acting as the\njournalist, a smaller LLM as the general public reader, and the third LLM as an\neditor. The journalist's writing is iteratively refined by feedback from the\nreader and suggestions from the editor. Our experiments demonstrate that by\nleveraging the collaboration of two 7B and one 1.8B open-source LLMs, we can\ngenerate articles that are more accessible than those generated by existing\nmethods, including advanced models such as GPT-4.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U-4eXxNws4TsXZklsKR4oCVBkeifXvji3PJUaWM5efA","pdfSize":"747722"}
