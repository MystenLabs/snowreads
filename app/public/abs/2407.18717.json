The Cucker-Smale model is a well-known\nmathematical framework that describes this behavior. Many continuous\ndescriptions of the Cucker-Smale model use PDEs with both particle position and\nvelocity as independent variables, thus providing a full description of the\nparticles mean-field limit (MFL) dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nreduced inertial PDE model consisting of two equations that depend solely on\nparticle position. In contrast to other reduced models, ours is not derived\nfrom the MFL, but directly includes the model reduction at the level of the\nempirical densities, thus allowing for a straightforward connection to the\nunderlying particle dynamics. We present a thorough analytical investigation of\nour reduced model, showing that: firstly, our reduced PDE satisfies a natural\nand interpretable continuous definition of flocking; secondly, in specific\ncases, we can fully quantify the discrepancy between PDE solution and particle\nsystem. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
