Synthetic Transmit Aperture is a novel approach in ultrasound imaging\nsystem by which frame rate and image quality is increased significantly on less\ndata-transfer and computational requirements. The real-time beam-forming\nperformance of Phased Array(PA) method is limited by high computation and cost.\nThus STA method(data-transfer rate-8MB/frame) advances over the Phased Array\nMethod(data-transfer rate-95MB/frame) with comparitively much higher frame rate\nand Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR. In this paper, we have implemented receive\nbeamforming using Synthetic Transmit Aperture (STA) method for eight channels\nand have obtained the sample data for reconstruction of image. The experimental\nresults are compared with the conventional phased array and linear array\nbeamforming, where it can be observed that the reduction in memory requirement\nand high SNR\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pIYuOk1sNCIm04B2Fy093G-SAsxCL7e6PCOXy4lJBSs","pdfSize":"310637"}
