We\ninvestigate musical connections between certain generalizations of maximally\neven sets, one of the oldest Puerto Rican musical traditions of African origin\ncalled bomba, and with certain scales ranging from the familiar to the\nesoteric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
