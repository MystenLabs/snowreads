In this first-hand\naccount, the origin of the acronym 'GPS' in this context is retraced, along\nwith the first crucial steps and the major milestones set in course of\nevolution of this now vibrant branch of extragalactic radio astronomy. A brief\nupdate on the recent developments in this field is also presented.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
