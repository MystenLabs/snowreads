We discover an interesting symmetry-breaking transition from\nquantum limit cycle oscillation to quantum inhomogeneous steady state; This\ntransition is contrary to the previously known symmetry-breaking transition\nfrom quantum homogeneous to inhomogeneous steady state. The result is supported\nby the analysis on the noisy classical model of the quantum system in the weak\nquantum regime. Remarkably, we find the generation of entanglement associated\nwith the symmetry-breaking transition that has no analogue in the classical\ndomain. This study will enrich our understanding of the collective behaviors\nshown by coupled oscillators in the quantum domain.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
