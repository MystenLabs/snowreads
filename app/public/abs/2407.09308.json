In this work, we propose a quantum\ngenetic algorithm within the DAQC framework using a Rydberg atom emulator. The\nalgorithm employs single-qubit operations in the digital domain and a global\ndriving interaction based on the Rydberg Hamiltonian in the analog domain. We\nevaluate the algorithm performance by estimating the ground-state energy of\nHamiltonians, with a focus on molecules such as $\\rm H_2$, $\\rm LiH$ and $\\rm\nBeH_2$. Our results show energy estimations with less than 1% error and state\noverlaps nearing 1, with computation times ranging from a few minutes for $\\rm\nH_2$ (2-qubit circuits) to one to two days for $\\rm LiH$ and $\\rm BeH_2$\n(6-qubit circuits). The gate fidelities of global analog operations further\nunderscore DAQC as a promising quantum computing strategy in the NISQ era.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
