The low\nmagnetic-field superconductivity onset temperature is fitted to the\nWerthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory to model the temperature dependence of the\nupper critical field. The magnetoresistance in the intermediate temperature and\nfield regime is described using thermally activated flux flow dictated by field\ndependent activation barrier. The barrier also depends on the gate voltage\nwhich dictates the inter-island Josephson coupling and disorder. The\nmagnetoresistance near the upper critical field at low temperatures shows\nsignatures of a gate dependent continuous quantum phase transition between\nsuperconductor and metal. The finite size scaling analysis shows that this\ntransition belongs to the $(2+1)$D-XY universality class without disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9_C4eyPFDRwjC6TUIL29mcsNcA6SPEb41DlVEhp9-Q4","pdfSize":"5269014"}
