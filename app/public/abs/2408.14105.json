In this work, we propose a\nsystematic assessment of the accuracy of a map. We perform error analyses for\ndiffusive quantum trajectories, based on single-time-step Kraus operators\nproposed in the literature, and find the orders in time increment, $\\Delta t$,\nto which such operators satisfy the conditions for valid average quantum\nevolution (completely positive, convex-linear, and trace-preserving), and the\norders to which they match the Lindblad solutions. Given these error analyses,\nwe propose a Kraus operator that satisfies the valid average quantum evolution\nconditions and agrees with the Lindblad master equation, to second order in\n$\\Delta t$, thus surpassing all other existing approaches. In order to test how\nwell our proposed operator reproduces exact quantum trajectories, we analyze\ntwo examples of qubit measurement, where exact maps can be derived: a qubit\nsubjected to a dispersive ($z$-basis) measurement and a fluorescence\n(dissipative) measurement. We show analytically that our proposed operator\ngives the smallest average trace distance to the exact quantum trajectories,\ncompared to existing approaches.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NrvM9Dr5oldpgarirz2WYWJbg4EXiDAL9vz_YbcMS6E","pdfSize":"936072"}
