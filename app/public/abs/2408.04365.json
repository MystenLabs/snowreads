This BH is\ncharacterized by the NUT charge and a parameter Q that comprises the electric\nand magnetic charge. We compute the image of the BH shadow in two types: 1) at\ninfinity, 2) at specific limit by analytical approach. We also investigate the\neffect of Nut, spin, inclination angle, and cosmological constant on the shape\nof shadow. We analyze that for type 1, the shadow in increasing for higher\nvalues of NUT charge, the cosmological constant, rotation parameters, and\ninclination angle, while for type 2, by increasing these parameters, the\ncircular symmetry of the image of the BH shadow variate. Moreover, we discuss\nwell-known thermal geometries such as Weinhold, Ruppeiner, HPEM, and Quevedo\ncase I & II spacetime. It is found that Ruppeiner , HPEM and Quevedo (II)\nformulations provide physical information about the microscopic structure as\ncompared to Weinhold and Quevedo (I) geometries of Hot\nNUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-AdS BH. Our findings provides distinctive\ncharacteristics in the shadow and thermal geometries of this BH as compare to\nother BH types.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
