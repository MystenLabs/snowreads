We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the\nsimultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\\\"uneisen\ncoefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the\nGr\\\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements\nallows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption\ncoefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\\\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the\naddition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the\nGr\\\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations\nbased on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed idea.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
