Employing the NGSIM datasets, the performance of\nEcoFollower was assessed in comparison with the well-established Intelligent\nDriver Model (IDM). The findings demonstrate that EcoFollower excels in\nsimulating realistic driving behaviors, maintaining smooth vehicle operations,\nand closely matching the ground truth metrics of time-to-collision (TTC),\nheadway, and comfort. Notably, the model achieved a significant reduction in\nfuel consumption, lowering it by 10.42\\% compared to actual driving scenarios.\nThese results underscore the capability of RL-based models like EcoFollower to\nenhance autonomous vehicle algorithms, promoting safer and more\nenergy-efficient driving strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
