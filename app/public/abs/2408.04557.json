In this report, recent studies on exotic resonances in\nproton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV at CMS are presented. For the\nexotic hadrons, these results include the first evidence for X(3872) in\nheavy-ion collisions and three new structures in $J/\\psi J/\\psi$ mass spectrum.\nBeside the exotic hadrons, we also found new decay channels in conventional\nbeauty hadrons, including $B^{0}_{s}\\rightarrow\\psi(2S)K^{0}_{S}$,\n$\\Lambda_{b}^{0}\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\Xi^{-}K^{+} $, $B^{0} \\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S)K^{0}_{S}\\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$, and $\\Xi_{b}^{-} \\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S)\\Xi^{-}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
