The spatial discretization is done by\na spectral Galerkin method, followed by the temporal discretization by a tamed\naccelerated exponential Euler scheme. Based on the time-independent boundedness\nof moments of numerical solutions, we present the weak error analysis in an\ninfinite time interval by using Malliavin calculus. This provides a way to\nnumerically approximate the invariant measure for the stochastic Allen-Cahn\nequation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
