This issue is addressed by\ncomparing the stellar \"edges\" of galaxies $D_{\\rm stellar}$, defined as the\noutermost diameter where in situ star formation significantly drops, with the\ngaseous distribution parameterized by the neutral atomic hydrogen diameter\nmeasured at 1 $M_{sun}$/pc$^2$, $D_{HI}$. By sampling a broad HI mass range\n$10^5 M_{sun} < M_{HI} < 10^{11} M_{sun}$, we find several dwarf galaxies with\n$M_{HI} < 10^9 M_{sun}$ from the field and Fornax Cluster which are\ndistinguished by $D_{\\rm stellar} >> D_{HI}$. For the cluster dwarfs, the\naverage HI surface density near $D_{\\rm stellar}$ is $\\sim$0.3\n$M_{sun}$/pc$^2$, reflecting the impact of quenching and outside-in gas removal\nfrom ram pressure and tidal interactions. In comparison, $D_{\\rm\nstellar}/D_{HI}$ ranges between 0.5-2 in dwarf field galaxies, consistent with\nthe expectations from stellar feedback. Only more massive disk galaxies in the\nfield can thus be characterized by the common assumption that $D_{\\rm stellar}\n\\lesssim D_{HI}$. We discover a break in the $D_{\\rm stellar}-M_{\\rm stellar}$\nrelation at $m_{break} \\sim 4\\times10^8 M_{sun}$ that potentially\ndifferentiates the low mass regime where the influence of stellar feedback and\nenvironmental processes more prominently regulates the sizes of nearby\ngalaxies. Our results highlight the importance of combining deep optical and HI\nimaging for understanding galaxy evolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
