This competition has two\ntracks, including weakly-supervised infrared small target detection (Track 1)\nand lightweight infrared small target detection (Track 2). 46 and 60 teams\nsuccessfully registered and took part in Tracks 1 and Track 2, respectively.\nThe top-performing methods and their results in each track are described with\ndetails. This competition inspires the community to explore the tough problems\nin the application of infrared small target detection, and ultimately promote\nthe deployment of this technology under limited resource.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7iUe3KOtFBM1Jzsvpv6oKMQn2HzZFuu7oMzoU_82yfk","pdfSize":"3078344"}
