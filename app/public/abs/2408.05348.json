Discovering popular topics\nfrom web faces a sea of noise webpages which never evolve into popular topics.\nIn this paper, we discover that the similarity values between webpages in a\npopular topic contain the statistically similar features observed in Levy\nwalks. Consequently, we present a simple, novel, yet very powerful\nExplore-Exploit (EE) approach to group topics by simulating Levy walks nature\nin the similarity space. The proposed EE-based topic clustering is an effective\nand effcient method which is a solid move towards handling a sea of noise\nwebpages. Experiments on two public data sets demonstrate that our approach is\nnot only comparable to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness\nbut also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nefficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
