We prove that this is the case if $X$ is the dual\nof a subspace of a predual of an $\\ell_1(I)$ space and $Y$ is $1$-complemented\nin its bidual under approximation properties assumptions. This result allows us\nto provide some new examples where $X$ is a Lipschitz-free space. We also prove\nthat the set of norm-attaining elements is dense in $X\\widehat{\\otimes}_\\pi Y$\nif, for instance, $X=L_1(\\mu)$ and $Y$ is any Banach space, or if $X$ has the\nmetric $\\pi$-property and $Y$ is a dual space with the RNP.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
