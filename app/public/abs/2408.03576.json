This study explores the use of mind wandering -- a\nphenomenon where attention spontaneously shifts from a primary task to\ninternal, task-related thoughts or unrelated distractions -- as a dynamic\nmeasure during visualization exploration. Participants reported mind wandering\nwhile viewing visualizations from a pre-labeled visualization database and then\nprovided quantitative ratings of trust, engagement, and design quality, along\nwith qualitative descriptions and short-term/long-term recall assessments.\nResults show that mind wandering negatively affects short-term visualization\nrecall and various post-viewing measures, particularly for visualizations with\nlittle text annotation. Further, the type of mind wandering impacts engagement\nand emotional response. Mind wandering also functions as an intermediate\nprocess linking visualization design elements to post-viewing measures,\ninfluencing how viewers engage with and interpret visual information over time.\nOverall, this research underscores the importance of incorporating mind\nwandering as a dynamic measure in visualization design and evaluation, offering\nnovel avenues for enhancing user engagement and comprehension.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
