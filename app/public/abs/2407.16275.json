Let $K<G$ be maximal\ncompact, and let $\\Gamma < G$ be discrete and such that $\\Gamma \\backslash G$\nhas finite volume. If the real rank of $G$ is $1$ and $\\Gamma$ is torsion-free,\nthen Barbasch and Moscovici obtained an index theorem for Dirac operators on\nthe locally symmetric space $\\Gamma \\backslash G/K$. We obtain a higher version\nof this, by constructing an index of Dirac operators on $G/K$ in the $K$-theory\nof an algebra on which the conjugation-invariant terms in Barbasch and\nMoscovici's index theorem define continuous traces. The resulting index\ntheorems also apply when $\\Gamma$ has torsion. The cases of these index\ntheorems for traces defined by semisimple orbital integrals extend to Song and\nTang's higher orbital integrals, and yield nonzero and computable results even\nwhen $\\operatorname{rank}(G)> \\operatorname{rank}(K)$, or the real rank of $G$\nis larger than $1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u-Ox9QVzV89mJQtwJ-BThFGvlvva9JTh9pxS6EBQXEw","pdfSize":"541097"}
