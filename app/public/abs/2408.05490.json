Here, we present a robust, physically-motivated protocol\nby which global quantum correlations, as characterised by the discord, can be\ndistributed to quantum memories using a mixed state of information carriers\nwhich possess only classical correlations. In addition to this, said\ndistribution is measurement-outcome independent, and the distribution is done\nusing only bilocal unitary operations and projective measurements. We also\nexplore the scaling of this protocol for larger networks and illustrate the\nstructure of the quantum correlations, showing its dependence on the local\noperations performed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
