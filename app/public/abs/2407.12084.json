These \"molecular states\" of boson stars have a multipolar\nstructure and both positive and negative Noether charges within one star, and\nthe opposite charges swap with time. Thanks to the gravitational attraction,\nthey exist even in the case of a free scalar field. We also explore the effects\nof scalar self-interactions on these complex structures. We propose to use\ngalactic-scale charge-swapping boson stars as a potential solution to the\nproblem of the observed anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
