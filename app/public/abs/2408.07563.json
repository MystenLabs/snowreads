Using the transport model JAM, we\ninvestigate the directed flow of $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, and $K^0$ as functions\nof rapidity, $p_T$, and collision energy in Au + Au collisions at the same\nenergies as those in the E895 and STAR experiments. We find that the JAM model\ncan qualitatively reproduce the anti-flow of $K^0_S$ observed in the E895\nexperiment. The $v_1$ slopes of pions and kaons are analyzed as functions of\nthe $p_T$ window, revealing a strong $p_T$ dependence of the $v_1$ slopes.\nNegative $v_1$ slopes are observed in the low $p_T$ region, $p_T < 0.8$\nGeV/$c$, while positive slopes are shown in the higher $p_T$ region. We find\nthat the shadowing effect from spectators is crucial in generating the\nanti-flow of mesons at low $p_T$ in the high baryon density region.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N4r-WZnzsZGEva483k5EdMp_bG9rD7gFlwMgKjUd4xQ","pdfSize":"492685"}
