The assessment employs a\nhierarchy of error metrics, ranging from simple mean bias to advanced metrics\nthat account for the dependence of wind speeds on variables such as friction\nvelocity and stability. The results reveal that (i) the value of roughness\nlength (z0) has a large effect on the simulation of wind speeds, (ii) using a\nlower limit for the Obhukov length instead of a lower limit for the lowest\nlevel wind speed seems to deteriorate the simulation of wind speeds under very\nstable conditions, (iii) the choice of stability function has a small but\nnoticeable impact on the wind speeds, (iv) the turbulent orographic form drag\nscheme shows improvement over effective roughness length approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CPTT7DCxK8ztWdVRCf3XHkpIuzeieyqFc-sqTPK46hM","pdfSize":"5362521"}
