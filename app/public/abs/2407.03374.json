Presently, generative artificial intelligence (AI),\nrepresented by Large Model, heralds a technological revolution with the\npotential to fundamentally reshape traditional technological fields and human\nproduction methods. Its capabilities, including strong generalization,\nreasoning, and generative attributes, present opportunities to address PHM's\nbottlenecks. To this end, based on a systematic analysis of the current\nchallenges and bottlenecks in PHM, as well as the research status and\nadvantages of Large Model, we propose a novel concept and three progressive\nparadigms of Prognosis and Health Management Large Model (PHM-LM) through the\nintegration of the Large Model with PHM. Subsequently, we provide feasible\ntechnical approaches for PHM-LM to bolster PHM's core capabilities within the\nframework of the three paradigms. Moreover, to address core issues confronting\nPHM, we discuss a series of technical challenges of PHM-LM throughout the\nentire process of construction and application. This comprehensive effort\noffers a holistic PHM-LM technical framework, and provides avenues for new PHM\ntechnologies, methodologies, tools, platforms and applications, which also\npotentially innovates design, research & development, verification and\napplication mode of PHM. And furthermore, a new generation of PHM with AI will\nalso capably be realized, i.e., from custom to generalized, from discriminative\nto generative, and from theoretical conditions to practical applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
