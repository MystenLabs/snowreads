All the fields change non-trivially under an additional\n$Z_{4}\\times Z_{2}$ symmetry. The $Z_{4}\\times Z_{2}$ symmetry allows only\ndiagonal Yukawa couplings among different generations of SM leptons and\nright-handed singlet neutrinos. The one-loop radiative diagrams generate\nneutrino mass. The Yukawa coupling of the triplet fermion with the inert\ndoublet positively contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The\nimposed $Z_{4}\\times Z_{2}$ symmetry forbids the conventional leptogenesis from\nthe right-handed neutrino decay. A net lepton asymmetry can be generated in the\nmuonic sector from triplet fermion decay. Involvement of the Yukawa coupling\nboth in leptogenesis and in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon results\nin a strong correlation between leptogenesis and the recent Fermi lab result.\nWe show a viable parameter space for TeV scale leptogenesis while explaining\nthe Fermi lab results. The inert scalar is the dark matter candidate in this\nmodel. The model also poses the potential to explain the latest results on W\nboson mass from the CDF-II experiment.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
