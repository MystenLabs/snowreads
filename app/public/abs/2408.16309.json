We approach by computing\nthe second cohomology $H^2_{1/2}(V, V)$ constructed by Yi-Zhi Huang. We start\nwith the cocycle on two generators and show that its cohomology class is\ncompletely determined by its singular part. To extend the cocycle to any pair\nof elements in $V$, we take a generating function approach, formulate the\ncocycle equation, and show that all the complementary solutions are\ncoboundaries. Then we use a very general procedure to construct a particular\nsolution. The procedure applies to vertex algebras that are not freely\ngenerated. As a by-product, we show that $H^2_{1/2}(V, V) = H^2_\\infty(V, V)$.\nUsing these results, we explicitly determine the first-order deformations of\nthe universal Virasoro VOA $Vir_c$, universal affine VOA $V^l(\\mathfrak{g})$,\nHeisenberg VOA $V^l(\\mathfrak{h})$, and the universal Zamolodchikov VOA\n$W_3^c$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
