The key to integrate such\nspintronic circuits with electronic circuits is the ability to inject, control\nand detect coherent spin waves with charge currents. Here, we propose a tunable\nsetup consisting of a synthetic antiferromagnet in an inhomogeneous magnetic\nfield in which one of the magnetic layers is thin and biased by spin-orbit\ntorque. We show that for appriopriate conditions single-mode coherent spin\nwaves are emitted in this set-up. The set-up implements coupling of continuum\nspin waves with a finite region of negative energy spin waves, such that\nspecific frequencies become self-amplified and thus start lasing. We show there\nexist a large region in parameter space for which the coherent spin wave laser\nis stabilized by non-linearities and spin-orbit torques. Our findings may lead\nto new ways of injecting coherent spin waves with direct currents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
