In\nthis article, we review the appearance of this number in the graph theory. More\nprecisely, we review the relevance of this number in topics such as the number\nof spanning trees, topological indices, energy, chromatic roots, domination\nroots and the number of domatic partitions of graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
