The method consists of three phases:\nan almost exact prescaling, that can be beneficial to the LAPACK's xLASV2\nroutine for the SVD of upper triangular 2x2 matrices as well, a highly\nrelatively accurate triangularization in the absence of underflows, and an\nalternative procedure for computing the SVD of triangular matrices, that\nemploys the correctly rounded hypot function. A heuristic for improving\nnumerical orthogonality of the left singular vectors is also presented and\ntested on a wide spectrum of random input matrices. On upper triangular\nmatrices under test, the proposed method, unlike xLASV2, finds both singular\nvalues with high relative accuracy as long as the input elements are within a\nsafe range that is almost as wide as the entire normal range. On general\nmatrices of order two, the method's safe range for which the smaller singular\nvalues remain accurate is of about half the width of the normal range.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
