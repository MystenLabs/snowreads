We demonstrate that the constructed inflationary\nmodel do not contradict to observation data and is suitable for primordial\nblack hole (PBH) formation. The estimation of PBH masses allows to consider\nPBHs as dark matter candidates.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
