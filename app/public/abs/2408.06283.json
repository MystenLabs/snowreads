This process was recently extended to hypergraphs. We introduce a\nvariant of hypergraph burning that uses an alternative propagation rule for how\nthe fire spreads - if some fixed proportion of vertices are on fire in a\nhyperedge, then in the next round the entire hyperedge catches fire. This new\nvariant has more potential for applications than the original model, and it is\nsimilarly viable for obtaining deep theoretical results. We obtain bounds which\napply to general hypergraphs, and introduce the concept of the burning\ndistribution, which describes how the model changes as the proportion ranges\nover (0,1). We also obtain computational results which suggest there is a\nstrong correlation between the automorphism group order and the lazy burning\nnumber of a balanced incomplete block design.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
