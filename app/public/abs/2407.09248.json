This is achieved with a new UV mapping pre-processing step which\nleverages semantic information of indoor scenes to more accurately match the UV\nislands with the 3D representation of distinct structural elements like walls\nand floors. Semantic UV Mapping enriches classic UV unwrapping algorithms by\nnot only relying on geometric features but also visual features originating\nfrom the present texture. The segmentation improves the UV mapping and\nsimultaneously simplifies the 3D geometric reconstruction of the scene after\nthe removal of loose objects. Each segmented element can be reconstructed\nseparately using the boundary conditions of the adjacent elements. Because this\nis performed as a pre-processing step, other specialized methods for geometric\nand texture reconstruction can be used in the future to improve the results\neven further.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
