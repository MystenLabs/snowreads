Under this\ntransformation, original flat-band systems containing magnetic impurities are\nmapped onto a generalized Fano-Anderson model, where flat-band states act as\nFano defects. From this perspective, several features of exact RKKY couplings\ncalculated numerically can be understood easily. As an illustrative example, we\nanalyze a dimerized diamond chain model, which can exhibit either gapped or\ngapless spectra depending on the ratio of hopping integrals. We find that\nanomalous decay in the RKKY couplings arises exclusively in the gapless case\nand with specific magnetic coupling configurations. Furthermore, the\nconventional wisdom regarding the signs of RKKY interactions breaks down under\ncertain conditions. These subtleties arising from flat bands find explanation\nwithin our present approach. Our investigation offers deeper insights into how\nflat bands influence carrier-mediated exchange interactions, with implications\nextending to broader contexts.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
