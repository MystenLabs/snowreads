Thereby, we can show some\nstatistical results as follows. For abelian extensions over a fixed number\nfield K, we show infinite Cp-moments for the Sylow p-subgroup of the relative\nclass group when p divides the degree of the extension. For sextic number\nfields with A4-closure, we can show infinite C2-moments for the Sylow\n2-subgroup of the relative class group when the extensions run over a fixed\nGalois cubic field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
