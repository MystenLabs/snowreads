In its classical form, the lemma states that if $I$ is a\nproper ideal of the ring $R=F[t_1,\\ldots,t_n]$ of polynomials over a field $F$,\nthen the quotient ring $R/I$ is a finite extension of a polynomial ring over\n$F$. We prove that the lemma holds when $R=D[t_1,\\ldots,t_n]$ is the ring of\npolynomials in $n$ central variables over a division algebra $D$. We provide\nexamples demonstrating that Noether's normalization may fail for the skew\npolynomial ring $D[t_1,\\ldots,t_n;\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_n]$ with respect to\ncommuting automorphisms $\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_n$ of $D$. We give a sufficient\ncondition for $\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_n$ under which the normalization lemma\nholds for such ring. In the case where $D=F$ is a field, this sufficient\ncondition is proved to be necessary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W8JovfVKWWiLpGc1mWnLM5Hzm5lap1jrf8VsmfFLlvA","pdfSize":"276942"}
