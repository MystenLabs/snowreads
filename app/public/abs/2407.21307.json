Crafted for developing countries, where\nutilitarian travel heavily relies on motorcycles, the model integrates\nsociocultural factors that influence transport behavior. Multinomial models and\ninferential statistics applied to survey data from Cali, Colombia, inform the\nmodel, revealing significant influences of sociodemographic factors and travel\nattributes on mode choice. Findings highlight the importance of cost, time,\nsafety, comfort, and personal security, with disparities across socioeconomic\ngroups. Policy simulations demonstrate positive responses to interventions like\nfree public transportation, increased bus frequency, and enhanced security, yet\nwith modest shifts in mode choice. Multifaceted policy approaches are deemed\nmore effective, addressing diverse user preferences. Outputs can be extended to\ncities with similar sociocultural characteristics and transport dynamics. The\nmethodology applied in this work can be replicated for other territories.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
