Here, we present a\nfacile experimental strategy for fabricating active rotors using chemically\ncross-linked clusters of Janus colloids. Janus clusters are propelled by\ninduced charge electrophoresis in an alternating electric field. We demonstrate\ncapillary-assisted assembly as a feasible path toward expanding the fabrication\nprocess to get large amounts of uniform circular clusters. Systematic studies\nof the Janus clusters reveal circular motion with tunable angular velocity,\norbit radius, and chirality and a relation between the radius of gyration of\nthe cluster and their rotational dynamics. Importantly, clusters with uniform\nazimuthal angles behave distinctly exhibiting larger orbit radii, while those\nwith random angles exhibit higher angular velocities and smaller radii. We also\nvalidate the kinetic model for clusters beyond dimers. Collectively, our\nstudies highlight that Janus clusters as promising candidates as controlled\ncircular rotors with tunable properties and, hence in the future, will\nfacilitate studies on the collective behaviors of synthetic chiral rotors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XiWoEQevdBfxaiAc5hEPAnnlZ0-NzEH3_6dkwI60kWU","pdfSize":"1595329"}
