The scheme builds on the recently proposed\nsparse-regression low-density parity-check (SR-LDPC) code, and extends the\nunderlying notions to scenarios with many concurrent users. The resulting\nscheme, called Multi-User SR-LDPC (MU-SR-LDPC) coding, consists of each user\ntransmitting its own SR-LDPC codeword using a unique sensing matrix in\nconjunction with a characteristic outer LDPC code. To recover the sent\ninformation, the decoder jointly processes the received signals using a\nlow-complexity and highly-parallelizable AMP-BP algorithm. At finite\nblocklengths (FBL), MU-SR-LDPC codes are shown to achieve a target BER at a\nhigher spectral efficiency than baseline orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes with similar computational\ncomplexity. Furthermore, MU-SR-LDPC codes are shown to match the performance of\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding in certain regimes. For certain\nblocklengths and a sufficiently high number of users, MU-SR-LDPC codes may\nachieve a higher spectral efficiency than the approximate FBL capacity of the\neffective single-user Gaussian channel seen by each user in a comparable OMA\nscheme. Results are supported by numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HGldiaEBL6fUjpADFEokVQod-uRJuvi9-d1AuUWXgIo","pdfSize":"217348"}
