However, ambient\nradiofrequency energy is weak (less than -20 dBm), and thermodynamic limits and\nhigh-frequency parasitic impedance restrict the performance of state-of-the-art\nradiofrequency rectifiers. Nanoscale spin rectifiers based on magnetic tunnel\njunctions have recently demonstrated high sensitivity, but suffer from a low\na.c.-to-d.c. conversion efficiency (less than 1%). Here, we report a sensitive\nspin rectifier rectenna that can harvest ambient radiofrequency signals between\n-62 and -20 dBm. We also develop an on-chip co-planar waveguide-based spin\nrectifier array with a large zero-bias sensitivity (around 34,500 mV/mW) and\nhigh efficiency (7.81%). Self-parametric excitation driven by\nvoltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy is a key mechanism that contributes to\nthe performance of the spin-rectifier array. We show that these spin rectifiers\ncan wirelessly power a sensor at a radiofrequency power of -27 dBm.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
