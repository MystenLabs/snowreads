In this work, we\ninvestigate how these symmetry violations affect the response of atoms and\nmolecules to applied electric and magnetic fields. We recover well-known\nobservables like the P-odd, T-odd spin-electric field coupling that is used for\nsearches of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) or the effect of P-odd,\nT-even optical rotation in atomic gases. Besides these, we obtain several other\npossible observables. This includes, in particular, effects that can only be\nseen when using oscillating or inhomogeneous fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"whL3xPAJZEv8_vD5ZAra4l5I6MZ59eaTa-KUagQe0ns","pdfSize":"611239"}
