In the context of quantum optomechanics, it allows,\nin principle, calibration-free inference of the thermal equilibrium of a\nmacroscopic mechanical resonator with its optical bath. At room temperature,\nthis phenomenon has been observed in pioneering experiments using levitated\nnanoparticles. Measuring this effect with solid-state mechanical resonators has\nbeen compounded by thermal intermodulation noise, mirror frequency noise and\nlow quantum cooperativity. Here, we sideband-cool a membrane-in-the-middle\nsystem close to the quantum ground state from room temperature, and observe\nmotional sideband asymmetry in a dual-homodyne measurement. Sideband\nthermometry yields a minimum phonon occupancy of $\\bar{n}_{eff}=9.5$. Our work\nprovides insights into nonlinear optomechanical dynamics at room temperature\nand facilitates accessible optomechanical quantum technologies without the need\nfor complex feedback control and cryogenic cooling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QfCcJo7gmh29foLK_A55G44cSJ4nBPr4GXSF3Oas0BU","pdfSize":"1984602"}
