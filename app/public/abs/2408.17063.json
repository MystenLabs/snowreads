A crucial step in PDQ protocols based on\nhomomorphic encryption is homomorphic compression, which compresses encrypted\nsparse vectors consisting of query results. In this work, we propose a new\nhomomorphic compression scheme with PDQ as its main application. Unlike\nexisting approaches, our scheme (i) can be efficiently implemented by fully\nexploiting homomorphic SIMD technique and (ii) enjoys both asymptotically\noptimal compression rate and asymptotically good decompression complexity.\nExperimental results show that our approach is 4.7x to 33.2x faster than the\nprevious best results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZUiW7I6GiqGvhPj0Myy7NtRvpYHkgumAa_TdqJmrtkY","pdfSize":"300761"}
