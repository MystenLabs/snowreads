Moreover, point-wise\nclustering ignores the rich spatial context information of objects, which\nresults in less expressive representation for semantic segmentation. To address\nthe above challenges, we propose a novel self-labeling strategy that adaptively\ngenerates high-quality pseudo-labels for imbalanced classes during model\ntraining. In addition, we develop a dual-level representation that incorporates\nregional consistency into the point-level classifier learning, reducing noise\nin generated segmentation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two\nwidely used datasets, SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS, and the results show our\nmethod outperforms the state of the art by a large margin.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
