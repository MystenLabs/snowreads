For ideal bands\nwith higher Chern numbers $C>1$, we find that $C$ color Landau levels are\ncarried by $C$ spinors with Skyrme textures. We identify a SU(C) gauge symmetry\nin the color space of spinors and an emergent non-Abelian connection in real\nspace intimately linked to the Pontryagin winding index of the layer skyrmions.\nThey result in a total real-space Chern number of $-1$, screening the magnetic\nphase, irrespective of $C$ and of the number of layers. The topologically\nrobust Skyrme texture remains remarkably intact in twisted bilayer graphene,\neven far from the chiral limit, and for realistic values of corrugation, making\nit an experimentally testable feature. We verify our predictions at the first\nmagic angle of twisted bilayer, trilayer, and monolayer-bilayer graphene.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
