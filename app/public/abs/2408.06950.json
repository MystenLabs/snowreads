We now show, by using a hydrodynamical model, the onset of\nintermittency and the consequent multiscaling of Eulerian and Lagrangian\nstructure functions as a function of the bacterial activity. Our results bridge\nthe worlds of low and high Reynolds number flows as well as open up intriguing\npossibilities of what makes flows intermittent.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
