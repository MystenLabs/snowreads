The\nthermodynamics of the resulting effective black hole spacetime is then studied\nwith particular attention to the influence of the dark matter parameters on\nvarious thermodynamic properties. We examine the specific heat and free energy\nto assess the thermodynamic stability of the model. Furthermore, the null\ngeodesics and the effective potential of light rays are studied to investigate\nhow the dark matter parameters affect these geodesics and the radii of circular\norbits. The stability of circular null geodesics is analyzed using dynamical\nsystems and Lyapunov exponents, which represents the dynamical behaviour of the\ncircular photon orbits. Finally, we studied if the circular geodesics exhibit\nchaotic behaviour using the chaos-bound condition.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
