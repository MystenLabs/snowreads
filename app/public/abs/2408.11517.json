The proposed method explores the multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o to\ninterpret visual content and create engaging stories, which are illustrated by\na Stable Diffusion XL model. The method is supported by a fully implemented\ntool, called ImageTeller, which accepts images from diverse sources as input.\nUsers can guide the narrative's development according to the conventions of\nfundamental genres - such as Comedy, Romance, Tragedy, Satire or Mystery -, opt\nto generate data-driven stories, or to leave the prototype free to decide how\nto handle the narrative structure. User interaction is provided along the\ngeneration process, allowing the user to request alternative chapters or\nillustrations, and even reject and restart the story generation based on the\nsame input. Additionally, users can attach captions to the input images,\ninfluencing the system's interpretation of the visual content. Examples of\ngenerated stories are provided, along with details on how to access the\nprototype.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
