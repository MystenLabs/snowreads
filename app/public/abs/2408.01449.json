It can be expected that the stipulations of the\nAct, in turn, are going to affect the work of many software engineers, software\ntesters, data engineers, and other professionals across the IT sector in Europe\nand beyond. The 113 articles, 180 recitals, and 13 annexes that make up the Act\ncover 144 pages. This paper aims at providing an aid for navigating the Act\nfrom the perspective of some professional in the software domain, termed \"the\nworking programmer\", who feels the need to know about the stipulations of the\nAct.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
