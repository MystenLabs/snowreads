In this work, we construct and analyze fusion surface models on the\nhoneycomb lattice built from braided fusion 1-categories. These models preserve\nmutually commuting plaquette operators and anomalous 1-form symmetries. Their\nHamiltonian is chosen to mimic the structure of Kitaev's honeycomb model, which\nis unitarily equivalent to the Ising fusion surface model. In the anisotropic\nlimit, where one coupling constant is dominant, the fusion surface models\nreduce to Levin-Wen string-nets. In the isotropic limit, they are described by\nweakly coupled anyon chains and are likely to realize chiral topological order.\nWe focus on three specific examples: (i) Kitaev's honeycomb model with a\nperturbation breaking time-reversal symmetry that realizes chiral Ising\ntopological order, (ii) a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalization proposed by Barkeshli\net al., which potentially realizes chiral parafermion topological order, and\n(iii) a novel Fibonacci honeycomb model featuring a non-invertible 1-form\nsymmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
