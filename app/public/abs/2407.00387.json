The main tools of the\nproofs are respectively a version of the well-known classical logarithmic\nLyapunov function applied to kinetic systems and its generalization to the\ndelayed case as a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Finally, we demonstrate our\nresults through illustrative examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
