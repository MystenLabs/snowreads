The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ensures this by providing a\nsystem for digital certificates that authenticate the identities of entities\ninvolved, securing data and command transmissions between drones and their\noperators. However, the centralized trust model of traditional PKI, dependent\non Certificate Authorities (CAs), presents a vulnerability due to its single\npoint of failure, risking security breaches. To counteract this, the paper\npresents D2XChain, a blockchain-based PKI framework designed for the Internet\nof Drone Things (IoDT). By decentralizing the CA infrastructure, D2XChain\neliminates this single point of failure, thereby enhancing the security and\nreliability of drone communications. Fully compatible with the X.509 standard,\nit integrates seamlessly with existing PKI systems, supporting all key\noperations such as certificate registration, validation, verification, and\nrevocation in a distributed manner. This innovative approach not only\nstrengthens the defense of drone services against various security threats but\nalso showcases its practical application through deployment on a private\nEthereum testbed, representing a significant advancement in addressing the\nunique security challenges of drone-based services and ensuring their\ntrustworthy operation in critical tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
