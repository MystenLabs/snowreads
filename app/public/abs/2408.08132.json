Users are categorized as near users (NUs) and far users (FUs)\ndepending on their proximity to the BS. The BS serves the NUs, while the APs\ncater to the FUs. Through activating only the closest AP of each FU, the use of\ndownlink pilots is enabled, thereby enhancing performance. This heterogeneous\ndesign outperforms other homogeneous massive MIMO configurations, demonstrating\nsuperior sum capacity while maintaining comparable user-experienced rates.\nMoreover, it lowers the costs associated with AP installations and reduces\nsignaling overhead for the fronthaul network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
