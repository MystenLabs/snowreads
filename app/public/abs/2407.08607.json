A pipeline of text\nenrichment using a Large Language Model (LLM) followed by DeBERTA fine-tuning\ndemonstrates a significant improvement in the Pearson Correlation Coefficient\nand F1 scores for empathy detection, highlighting the effectiveness of our\napproach. Our system officially ranked 7th at the CONV-turn track.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
