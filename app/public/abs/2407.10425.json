The theoretical explanation of cosmic rays anisotropy\nfrom experiments remains challenging and even puzzling for a long time. In this\npaper, by following the ideas of Jokipii 2007, we use a simple analytical model\nto study the CR dipole anisotropy amplitude, considering that CRs diffuse only\nin perpendicular direction, with the ratio between the secondary and primary\ncosmic rays omnidirectional particle distribution function as an input. We make\npower law fitting of the observed B/C ratio and use it as the input of the\nanisotropy model. We show that the modeling results can roughly describe the\ngeneral trend of the observational data in energy range from $6\\times 10^1$ to\n$3\\times 10^{11}$ GeV. It is suggested that the perpendicular diffusion may\nplay a significant role in CR anisotropy in the wide energy range.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
