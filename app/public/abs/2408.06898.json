Here, first, we\nreveal the topological dynamics of continuous beam structures by rigorously\nproving the existence of infinitely many topological edge states within the\nbandgaps. Then, we obtain the analytical expressions for the topological phases\nof bulk bands, and propose a topological index related to the Zak phase that\ndetermines the existence of the edge states. The theoretical approach is\ndirectly applicable to general continuum lattice structures. We demonstrate the\ntopological edge states of bridge-like frames, plates, and continuous beams on\nelastic foundations and springs, and the topological corner states of kagome\nframes. The continuum lattice structures serve as excellent platforms for\nexploring various kinds of topological phases and demonstrating the\ntopologically protected states at multifrequencies, and their topological\ndynamics has significant implications in safety assessment, structural health\nmonitoring, and energy harvesting.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
