The\ninter-frame similarity of the sample's local structures is found to be a\npowerful constraint in phasing a sequence of diffraction patterns. We devised a\nnew image reconstruction algorithm that exploits this inter-frame constraint\nenabled by an adaptive similar region determination approach. We demonstrated\nthe feasibility of this technique in visible light experiments with various\nreal samples, achieving reconstructions of good quality within a few hundred\niterations. With a setup as simple as conventional coherent diffraction imaging\nbut with much-improved convergence and robustness to missing data and noise,\nour method is expected to enrich X-ray imaging techniques and electron\nmicroscopy, offering a new tool for dynamics studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
