The problem admits maximal\nsolutions as long as the velocity of the moving boundary stays bounded,\n[3,6,7]. We apply Malliavin calculus on the transformed equation and prove\nfirst that its maximal solution u has continuous paths a.s. In the case of the\nunreflected problem, the previous enables localization of a proper\napproximating sequence of the maximal solution. Then, we derive there locally\nthe differentiability of maximal $u$ in the Malliavin sense. The novelty of\nthis work, apart from the derivation of continuity of the paths for the maximal\nsolution with reflection, is that for the unreflected case we introduce a\nlocalization argument on maximal solutions and define efficiently the relevant\nsample space. More precisely, we present a methodology suitable for the proof\nof the expected local only (in the sample space) existence of the Malliavin\nderivative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sUs3KZ1kkDXBfLSf8P9E1wokTExFoNNxc_ZhtlDDITg","pdfSize":"286783"}
