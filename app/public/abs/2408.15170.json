Yet, a research gap for advanced\ncontrol adoption is the ability to benchmark algorithm performance. CityLearn\naddresses this gap an open-source Gym environment for the easy implementation\nand benchmarking of simple rule-based control and advanced algorithms that has\nan advantage of modeling simplicity, multi-agent control, district-level\nobjectives, and control resiliency assessment. Here we demonstrate the\nfunctionalities of CityLearn using 17 different building control problems that\nhave varying complexity with respect to the number of controllable distributed\nenergy resources in buildings, the simplicity of the control algorithm, the\ncontrol objective, and district size.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WLcDEwjkW6Gsjd4zirIwsukk2zitnm3Dh_fULrhSXmY","pdfSize":"590508"}
