In particular, the momentum and the\ndensity of Klein-Gordon converge to the the momentum and the density of the\nrelativistic Euler system in Lebesgue norms. The relativistic Euler with\npotential is equivalent to the usual relativistic Euler with pressure up to a\nrescaling. The proof relies on the modulated energy method adapted to the wave\nequation and the relativistic setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
