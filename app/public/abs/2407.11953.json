Introducing complex quaternions\nallows us to extend the result to elliptic and hyperbolic rotations on the\nMinkowski space, that is, to proper Lorentz rotations. Another generalization\ndeals with complex rotations on the complex-quaternion algebra. Appropriate\nquaternionic expressions of differential operators lead to a quaternionic form\nof Maxwell equations; the quaternionic expressions of an electromagnetic-field\nin two Galilean frames in relative motion are linked by a complex rotation;\nsome relativistic invariants of electromagnetic waves are deduced, including\ntheir polarization states and their degrees of polarization. Quaternionic forms\nof proper Lorentz rotations are applied to polarization optics along with\nillustrative examples. Equivalences between relativistic effects and crystal\noptics effects are mentioned. A derivation of the triangle inequality on the\nMinkowski space is given; the inequality is illustrated by some properties of\npartially polarized lightwaves.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
