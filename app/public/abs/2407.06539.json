Both tests,\nhowever, have well-known statistical limitations, sometimes suggesting\ndiscrimination even when there is none. Despite the fallibility of the\nbenchmark and outcome tests individually, here we prove a surprisingly strong\nstatistical guarantee: under a common non-parametric assumption, at least one\nof the two tests must be correct; consequently, when both tests agree, they are\nguaranteed to yield correct conclusions. We present empirical evidence that the\nunderlying assumption holds approximately in several important domains,\nincluding lending, education, and criminal justice -- and that our hybrid test\nis robust to the moderate violations of the assumption that we observe in\npractice. Applying this approach to 2.8 million police stops across California,\nwe find evidence of widespread racial discrimination.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
