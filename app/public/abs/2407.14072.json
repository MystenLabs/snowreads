Without interactive systems for\ninterpreting factor models, researchers are frequently exposed to subjectivity,\npotentially leading to misinterpretations or overlooked crucial information.\nThis paper introduces FAVis, a novel interactive visualization tool designed to\naid researchers in interpreting and evaluating factor analysis results. FAVis\nenhances the understanding of relationships between variables and factors by\nsupporting multiple views for visualizing factor loadings and correlations,\nallowing users to analyze information from various perspectives. The primary\nfeature of FAVis is to enable users to set optimal thresholds for factor\nloadings to balance clarity and information retention. FAVis also allows users\nto assign tags to variables, enhancing the understanding of factors by linking\nthem to their associated psychological constructs. Our user study demonstrates\nthe utility of FAVis in various tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
