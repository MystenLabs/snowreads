For complex atomic\nsystems, high-precision calculations are a major challenge due to the\nexponential scaling of the involved electronic configuration sets. This\nexacerbates the problem of required computational resources for these\ncomputations, and makes indispensable the development of approaches to select\nthe most important configurations out of otherwise intractably huge sets. We\nhave developed a neural network (NN) tool for running high-precision atomic\nconfiguration interaction (CI) computations with iterative selection of the\nmost important configurations. Integrated with the established pCI atomic\ncodes, our approach results in computations with significantly reduced\ncomputational requirements in comparison with those without NN support. We\nshowcase a number of NN-supported computations for the energy levels of\nFe$^{16+}$ and Ni$^{12+}$, and demonstrate that our approach can be reliably\nused and automated for solving specific computational problems for a wide\nvariety of systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wODIvh-JLzM-yP8P3ZZnxB3qwXliNtsw0IK-_YddvWA","pdfSize":"419383","txDigest":"61WpsjEdqFvYvYBxrAUzLwasxapUWwsRanKnLWvEm2j","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
