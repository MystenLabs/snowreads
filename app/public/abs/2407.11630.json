This development promises to\nrevolutionize the intersection of quantum computing and graph theory , charting\nnew frontiers in the application of quantum algorithms to graph computing and\nnetwork science.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
