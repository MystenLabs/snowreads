The Divertor-Tokamak-Test (DTT) facility under\nconstruction at ENEA Frascati will test several magnetic configurations and\nmitigation strategies, that are usually based on the realization of nontrivial\ntopologies in which one or more X points are present. In order to get a clear\nunderstanding of turbulent transport near one of such X points, we perform 3D\nelectro-static fluid simulations of tokamak edge plasma for a DTT-like\nscenario. We will outline: i) the resulting turbulent spectral features and\ntheir dependence on some model parameters (the background pressure gradients\nand diffusivity) and on the magnetic geometry through a comparative analysis\nwith the results of the companion paper [19], ii) the connection between small\nscale poloidal structures and toroidal asymmetries, iii) the formation of\nquiescent regions, iv)the crucial role of radial Dirichlet boundary conditions\nfor the excitation of zonal flows that can screen the radial component of the\nmagnetic geometry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
