Despite AI's potential as a valuable assistant, its role\nin complex medical data analysis often oversimplifies human-AI collaboration\ndynamics. To address this, we collaborated with a local hospital, engaging six\nphysicians and one data scientist in a formative study. From this\ncollaboration, we propose a framework integrating two-phase interactive\nvisualization systems: one for Human-Led, AI-Assisted Retrospective Analysis\nand another for AI-Mediated, Human-Reviewed Iterative Modeling. This framework\naims to enhance understanding and discussion around effective human-AI\ncollaboration in healthcare.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ClT0Gf4U9foQDkr3xka5KtvBVrIhWy4s9UJp2N19_0s","pdfSize":"1325693","objectId":"0x7386d5bbbf48f3ae001b4122406752aaf09c85cb85834712fa0fd55859adadfd","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
