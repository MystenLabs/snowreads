Results on continuous time reservoirs make use of the\nlogarithmic norm of the connectivity matrix. Further analysis yields some\nsimple guidelines on how to better construct the connectivity matrix in these\nsystems. Additionally, we outline how the Universal Approximation Property of\ndiscrete time reservoirs is readily satisfied by virtue of the activation\nfunction being contracting, and how continuous time reservoirs may inherit a\nlimited form of universal approximation by virtue of them overlapping with\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations. The ability of the Reservoir Computing\nframework to universally approximate topological conjugates, along with their\nfast training, make them a compelling data-driven, black-box surrogate of\ndynamical systems, and a potential mechanism for developing digital twins.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
