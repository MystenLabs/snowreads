We first provide a historical survey of the evolution\nof random access protocols, focusing specifically on the case in which\nuncoordinated users share a wireless broadcasting medium. Next, we highlight\nthe change of perspective originated by the UMAC model, in which the physical\nand medium access layer's protocols cooperate, thus reframing random access as\na novel coding-theoretic problem. By now, a large variety of UMAC protocols\n(codes) emerged, necessitating a certain classification that we indeed propose\nhere. Although some random access schemes require a radical change of the\nphysical layer, others can be implemented with minimal changes to existing\nindustry standards. As an example, we discuss a simple modification to the 5GNR\nRelease 16 random access channel that builds on the UMAC theory and that\ndramatically improves energy efficiency for systems with even moderate number\nof simultaneous users (e.g., $5-10$ dB gain for $10-50$ users), and also\nenables handling of high number of users, something completely out of reach of\nthe state-of-the-art.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
