However, in cases where more information than just the class\nlabel is available, would it be possible to train models more efficiently? We\nintroduce two novel model architectures, which we call hybrid concept-based\nmodels, that train using both class labels and additional information in the\ndataset referred to as concepts. In order to thoroughly assess their\nperformance, we introduce ConceptShapes, an open and flexible class of datasets\nwith concept labels. We show that the hybrid concept-based models outperform\nstandard computer vision models and previously proposed concept-based models\nwith respect to accuracy, especially in sparse data settings. We also introduce\nan algorithm for performing adversarial concept attacks, where an image is\nperturbed in a way that does not change a concept-based model's concept\npredictions, but changes the class prediction. The existence of such\nadversarial examples raises questions about the interpretable qualities\npromised by concept-based models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
