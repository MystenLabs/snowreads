The ambipolar\nelectric field accelerates ions radially and cools electrons. Ions lose energy\nand angular momentum in collisions with low-temperature electrons. The angular\nmomentum of ions decreases much faster than their energy in cycles. The\ntrajectories of ions are close to radial, and the density distribution\nresembles pseudo-isothermal.\n  The velocity distributions of baryons moving outward and inward in galaxies\ntend to approach independent Maxwell distributions. This characteristic\nsuppresses small-angle scattering of ions, reducing the ion collision\ncross-section by three orders of magnitude. In the massive galaxies, baryons\ncan replace all dark matter.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
