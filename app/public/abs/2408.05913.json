This\ncontrasts with cuprate superconductors, where such interaction has been\nneglected for a long time. The recent report of a non-trivial spin orbit\ncoupling in overdoped Bi2212 cuprate superconductor, has re-opened an old\ndebate on both the source and role of such interaction and its evolution\nthroughout the superconducting dome. Using high-resolution spin- and\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal a momentum-dependent spin\ntexture throughout the hole-doped side of the superconducting phase diagram for\nsingle- and double-layer bismuth-based cuprates. The universality of the\nreported effect among different dopings and the disappearance of spin\npolarization upon lead substitution, suggest a common source. We argue that\nlocal structural fluctuations of the CuO planes and the resulting charge\nimbalance may cause local inversion symmetry breaking and spin polarization,\nwhich might be crucial for understanding cuprates physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
