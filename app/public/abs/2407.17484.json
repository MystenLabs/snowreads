Accessible\nexplanations are crucial as accessibility in technology promotes digital\ninclusion and allows everyone, regardless of their physical, sensory, or\ncognitive abilities, to use these technologies effectively. This paper presents\na systematic literature review of the research on the accessibility of\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically considering persons\nwith sight loss. Our methodology includes searching several academic databases\nwith search terms to capture intersections between XAI and accessibility. The\nresults of this survey highlight the lack of research on Accessible XAI (AXAI)\nand stress the importance of including the disability community in XAI\ndevelopment to promote digital inclusion and accessibility and remove barriers.\nMost XAI techniques rely on visual explanations, such as heatmaps or graphs,\nwhich are not accessible to persons who are blind or have low vision.\nTherefore, it is necessary to develop explanation methods through non-visual\nmodalities, such as auditory and tactile feedback, visual modalities accessible\nto persons with low vision, and personalized solutions that meet the needs of\nindividuals, including those with multiple disabilities. We further emphasize\nthe importance of integrating universal design principles into AI development\npractices to ensure that AI technologies are usable by everyone.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DoBGmk3GSTpaG_uRXTTEwU47rzbMIOHSHejLO41Jad4","pdfSize":"193939"}
