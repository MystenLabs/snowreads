Automated flare\ndetection enables exploiting vast photometric datasets from missions like\nKepler. Prior methods rely on outlier detection, facing challenges of\ncomplexity, detection accuracy, and scalability. This paper presents FCN4Flare,\na deep learning approach using fully convolutional networks for precise\npoint-to-point flare prediction regardless of light curve length. Key\ninnovations include the NaN Mask to handle missing data, dilated convolutions\nto preserve local information, and the MaskDice loss to mitigate severe class\nimbalance. Experiments demonstrate significantly improved detection performance\nover previous models, with a 0.64 Dice coefficient on Kepler data. Applying\nFCN4Flare to Kepler and LAMOST, we compile a catalog of 30,285 high-confidence\nflares across 1426 stars. Flare energies are estimated and stellar/exoplanet\nproperties analyzed, identifying pronounced activity for an M-dwarf hosting a\nhabitable zone planet. This work overcomes limitations of prior flare detection\nmethods via deep learning, enabling new scientific discoveries through analysis\nof photometric time-series data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"z3pUvI9V3RsK4goIZOjZOn_Lurc8AsS-HTodnPf4Lz4","pdfSize":"885194"}
