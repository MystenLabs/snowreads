Leveraging the\ncapabilities of ControlNet, we empower users with finer control over the\nsynthesis process, enabling enhanced manipulation of synthesized imagery.\nInspired by the minimalist forms found in abstract artworks, we introduce a\nnovel condition crafted from geometric primitives such as triangles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nOW6S-gy6qMTAkHsh_TJ76AMe_0DxQ5fAQPHkGNw_mE","pdfSize":"6457453"}
