The novelty of the paper\nrelies in the fact that, differently from the existing literature, the\nsuperposition occurs in both $s$ and $p$.\n  Here we introduce a new framework which is so broad to include, for example,\nthe scenarios of the finite sum of different (in both $s$ and $p$) Laplacians,\nor of a fractional $p$-Laplacian plus a $p$-Laplacian, or even combinations\ninvolving some fractional Laplacians with the \"wrong\" sign.\n  The development of this new setting comes with two applications, which are\nrelated to the Weierstrass Theorem and a Mountain Pass technique. The results\nobtained contribute to the existing literature with several specific cases of\ninterest which are entirely new.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
