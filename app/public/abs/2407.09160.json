In this paper we show that the assumption that p divides q is\nin fact redundant, and we also prove that M \\cap N is even p+q list-colorable.\n  The result uses topology and relies on a new parameter yielding a lower bound\nfor the topological connectivity of the intersection of two matroids.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
