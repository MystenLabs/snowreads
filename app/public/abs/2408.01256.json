Orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) has shown the potential for high spectrum efficiencies in radio\nfrequency domains. To investigate the advantage of OAM in multiuser\ncommunications, in this paper we propose the reconfigurable intelligence\nsurface (RIS) assisted OAM multiuser (MU) wireless communication schemes, where\nRIS is deployed to establish the direct links blocked by obstacles between the\nOAM transmitter and users, to significantly increase the achievable sum rate\n(ASR) of MU systems. To maximize the ASR, we develop the alternative\noptimization algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit power and phase shifts\nof RIS. The numerical outcomes demonstrate the superiority of our proposed\nscheme compared to existing methods in terms of ASR.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
