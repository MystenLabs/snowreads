In practical implementations, however, the\nRIS has finite size and the incident wave is a beam of finite $k$-content,\nrather than a plane wave of $\\delta$-like $k$-content. To understand the\nimplications of the finite extent of both the RIS and the incident beam, here\nwe treat the RIS as a spatial filter, the transfer function of which is\ndetermined by both the prescribed RIS operation and the shape of the RIS\nboundary. Following this approach, we study how the RIS transforms the incident\n$k$-content and we demonstrate how, by engineering the RIS shape, size, and\nresponse, it is possible to shape beams with nontrivial $k$-content to suppress\nunwanted interference, while concentrating the reflected power to desired\ndirections. We also demonstrate how our framework, when applied in the context\nof near-field communications, provides the necessary insights into how the\nwavefront of the beam is tailored to enable focusing, propagation with\ninvariant profile, and bending, beyond conventional beamforming.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
