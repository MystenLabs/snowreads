In this paper we establish various vanishing\ntheorems for the space of $L^2$-harmonic forms and spinors (in the spin case)\nunder suitable positive curvature assumptions on the ambient manifold. Our\nresults in the setting of forms extend to higher dimensions and more general\nambient Riemannian manifolds previous vanishing theorems due to Tanno\n\\cite{Tanno} and Zhu \\cite{Zhu}. In the setting of spin manifolds our results\nallow to conclude, for instance, that any oriented, complete, stable, minimal,\nimmersed hypersurface of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ or $\\mathbb{S}^m$ carries no\nnon-trivial $L^2$-harmonic spinors. Finally, analogous results are proved for\nstrongly stable constant mean curvature hypersurfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
