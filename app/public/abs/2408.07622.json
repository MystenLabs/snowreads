The measurement uses both dimuon and\ndielectron events, and is performed as a function of the dilepton mass and\nrapidity. The unfolded angular coefficient $A_4$ is also extracted, as a\nfunction of the dilepton mass and rapidity. Using the CT18Z set of parton\ndistribution functions, we obtain $\\sin\\theta^\\ell_\\text{eff}$ = 0.23157 $\\pm$\n0.00031, where the uncertainty includes the experimental and theoretical\ncontributions. The measured value agrees with the standard model fit result to\nglobal experimental data. This is the most precise $\\sin\\theta^\\ell_\\text{eff}$\nmeasurement at a hadron collider, with a precision comparable to the results\nobtained at LEP and SLD.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
