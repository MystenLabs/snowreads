We\nalso give a complementary general procedure for constructing sequences $(a_n)$\nsatisfying the Type I and Type II estimates, which in many cases proves that\nour lower bounds on $\\sum_p a_p$ are best possible. A key role in both the\nsieve method and the construction method is played by the geometry of special\nsubsets of $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n  This allows us to determine precisely the ranges of Type I and Type II\nestimates for which an asymptotic for $\\sum_p a_p$ is guaranteed, that a\nsubstantial Type II range is always necessary to guarantee a non-trivial lower\nbound for $\\sum_p a_p$, and to determine the optimal bounds in some naturally\noccurring families of parameters from the literature. We also demonstrate that\nthe optimal upper and lower bounds for $\\sum_p a_p$ exhibit many\ndiscontinuities with respect to the Type I and Type II ranges, ruling out the\npossibility of a particularly simple characterization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
