These\nsymmetric spaces have been studied in the paper arXiv: 2003.05764. We prove\nthat the zeta functions satisfy a functional equation which is given explicitly\n(see Theorem 4.3.9 and Theorem 4.4.5). Moreover, for a subclass of these\nspaces, we define L-functions and epsilon-factors associated to the\nrepresentations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
