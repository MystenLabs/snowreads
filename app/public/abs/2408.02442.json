This study\ninvestigates whether such constraints on generation space impact LLMs'\nabilities, including reasoning and domain knowledge comprehension.\nSpecifically, we evaluate LLMs' performance when restricted to adhere to\nstructured formats versus generating free-form responses across various common\ntasks. Surprisingly, we observe a significant decline in LLMs' reasoning\nabilities under format restrictions. Furthermore, we find that stricter format\nconstraints generally lead to greater performance degradation in reasoning\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
