Through studying fixed point stability and\nfixation times for 2x2 games with all-to-all interactions, we find that the\nflow changes significantly as a function of q. Further, we investigate the\neffects of changing the underlying topology from an all-to-all interacting\nsystem to an uncorrelated graph via the pair approximation. We also develop the\nframework for studying games with more than two strategies, such as the\nrock-paper-scissors game where we show that changing q leads to the emergence\nof new types of flow.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kt70SE5hC7xvIAYaPT_YHDg4shzlLL5bhfZv2o8NJTg","pdfSize":"8241759"}
