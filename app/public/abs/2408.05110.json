There are some methods to extract pattern\nform mass data. In this case we firstly asked passenger car marketing experts\nto rank more important factors which affect customer decision making behavior\nusing fuzzy Delphi technique, then we provided a sample set from questionnaires\nand tried to apply a useful artificial neural network method called\nself_organizing map SOM to find out which factors have more effect on Iranian\ncustomer's buying decision making. Fuzzy tools were applied to adjust the study\nto be more real. MATLAB software was used for developing and training network.\nResults report four factors are more important rather than the others. Results\nare rather different from marketing expert rankings. Such results would help\nmanufacturers to focus on more important factors and increase company sales\nlevel.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8SaIFdn8gza47jUza_OSqBi8QkfxsP3Z60DO4lBXosc","pdfSize":"470301"}
