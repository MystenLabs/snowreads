We have carried out a bunch of diffusion Monte Carlo calculations up to\ngas parameters of $10^{-2}$ to explore how the departure from the universality\nemerges. Using different model potentials, we calculate the energies of the gas\nin an exact way, within some statistical noise, and report the results as a\nfunction of the three relevant scattering parameters: the $s$-wave scattering\nlength $a_0$, the $s$-wave effective range $r_0$, and the $p$-wave scattering\nlength $a_1$. If the effective range is not large we observe universality in\nterms of $a_0$ and $r_0$ up to gas parameters of $10^{-2}$. If $r_0$ grows the\nregime of universality in these two parameters is reduced and effects of $a_1$\nstart to be observed. In the $(a_0,r_0)$ universal regime we propose an\nanalytical law that reproduces fairly well the exact energies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S7ln5QeYAUZrC6Nhu81zdJOswmEPjb2aPYz6oD5HMAk","pdfSize":"1873408","objectId":"0x5a6b08d855e33e9dff83934060f8e4d64e12227bda73895a566923c4705fa1da","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
