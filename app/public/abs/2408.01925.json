The method used to compute the radiative correction to\nthe Casimir energy differs from conventional approaches by applying a unique\nrenormalization scheme that is consistent with specific boundary conditions or\nbackgrounds. Despite this divergence from conventional methodologies, our\nresults demonstrate consistency within established physical limits.\nFurthermore, employing a toy model, we calculated the total Casimir energy\ndensity in the bulk, taking into account both thermal and radiative\ncorrections. We also provide a thorough characterization of the total Casimir\nenergy density in the compact dimension, detailing its magnitude and sign using\ngraphical representations and quantitative data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JgXw0exeCcyWaKvl5X2OrLV3p99fivWXw8LEovA1-G8","pdfSize":"530251","txDigest":"GCWW8agkkiskazXhWD5yNDK8hfpRVfhVNdy5FHLTWVHS","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
