We analyze the statistical distribution of\na quantum system coupled strongly with a heat bath. This distribution is\ndetermined by tracing over the bath's degrees of freedom for the equilibrium\nsystem-plus-bath composite. The stability of system distribution is largely\naffected by the system--bath interaction strength. We propose that the quantum\nsystem exhibits a stable distribution only when its system response function in\nthe frequency domain satisfies $\\tilde\\chi(\\omega = 0+)>0$. We show our results\nby investigating the non-interacting bosonic impurity system from both the\nthermodynamic and dynamic perspectives. Our study refines the theoretical\nframework of canonical statistics, offering insights into thermodynamic\nphenomena in small-scale systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
