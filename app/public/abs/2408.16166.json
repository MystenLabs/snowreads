A core question is, by exploiting the intrinsic low dimensional\nstructure of the signal, how to design the sensing process and decoder in a way\nthat the number of measurements is essentially close to the complexity of the\nsignal set. This chapter provides a survey of important results in answering\nthis question, with an emphasis on a basis pursuit like convex optimization\ndecoder that admits a wide range of random sensing matrices. The results are\nquite established in the case signals are sparse in an orthonormal basis, while\nthe case with frame sparse signals is much less explored. In addition to\npresenting the latest results on recovery guarantee and how few random\nheavier-tailed measurements fulfill these recovery guarantees, this chapter\nalso aims to provide some insights in proof techniques. We also take the\nopportunity of this book chapter to publish an interesting result (Theorem\n3.10) about a restricted isometry like property related to a frame.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
