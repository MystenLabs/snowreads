Unfortunately, simulations of large hardware\nsystems are often a design bottleneck due to slow throughput and long build\ntimes. In this article, we propose a solution targeting designs composed of\nmodular blocks connected by latency-insensitive interfaces. Our approach is to\nconstruct the hardware simulation in a similar fashion as the design itself,\nusing a prebuilt simulator for each block and connecting the simulators via\nfast shared-memory queues at runtime. This improves build time, because\nsimulation scale-up simply involves running more instances of the prebuilt\nsimulators. It also addresses simulation speed, because prebuilt simulators can\nrun in parallel, without fine-grained synchronization or global barriers. We\nintroduce a framework, Switchboard, that implements our approach, and discuss\ntwo applications, demonstrating its speed, scalability, and accuracy: (1) a web\napplication where users can run fast simulations of chiplets on an interposer,\nand (2) a wafer-scale simulation of one million RISC-V cores distributed across\nthousands of cloud compute cores.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
