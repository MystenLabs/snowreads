Our study, together with previous results on strongly non-nilpotent\nstructures, completes the classification of 8-dimensional nilpotent Lie\nalgebras admitting complex structures of non-nilpotent type. As an application,\nwe identify those that support a pseudo-K\\\"ahler metric, thus providing new\ncounterexamples to a previous conjecture and an infinite family of (Ricci-flat)\nnon-flat neutral Calabi-Yau structures. Moreover, we arrive at the topological\nrestriction $b_1(X)\\geq 3$ for every pseudo-K\\\"ahler nilmanifold $X$ with\ninvariant complex structure, up to complex dimension four.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
