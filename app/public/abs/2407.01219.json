While many RAG\napproaches have been proposed to enhance large language models through\nquery-dependent retrievals, these approaches still suffer from their complex\nimplementation and prolonged response times. Typically, a RAG workflow involves\nmultiple processing steps, each of which can be executed in various ways. Here,\nwe investigate existing RAG approaches and their potential combinations to\nidentify optimal RAG practices. Through extensive experiments, we suggest\nseveral strategies for deploying RAG that balance both performance and\nefficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that multimodal retrieval techniques can\nsignificantly enhance question-answering capabilities about visual inputs and\naccelerate the generation of multimodal content using a \"retrieval as\ngeneration\" strategy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YyDO-GIJA4jd3253lRTQs1WjT_BZ3wuL-FI3PtXqsgo","pdfSize":"914162"}
