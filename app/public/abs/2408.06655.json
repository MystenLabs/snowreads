For the one-dimensional problem, we first\nintroduce a high-order compact Strang splitting scheme (denoted as\nHOC-Splitting), which is fourth-order accurate in space and second-order\naccurate in time. Then, by incorporating the Lagrange multiplier approach with\nthe HOC-Splitting scheme, we construct two additional bound-preserving or/and\nmass-conservative HOC-Splitting schemes that do not require excessive\ncomputational cost and can automatically ensure the uniform bounds of the\nnumerical solution. These schemes combined with an alternating direction\nimplicit (ADI) method are generalized to the two-dimensional problem, which\nfurther enhance the computational efficiency for large-scale modeling and\nsimulation. Besides, we present an optimal-order error estimate for the\nbound-preserving ADI scheme in the discrete $L_2$ norm. Finally, ample\nnumerical examples are presented to verify the theoretical results and\ndemonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness in preserving bounds\nor/and mass of the proposed schemes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"KtzwQ27X0BYvfybUb58Lszr7LbK4_MdCmMPAQ0ySsTQ","pdfSize":"1673853"}
