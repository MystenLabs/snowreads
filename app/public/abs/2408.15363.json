In this paper, we investigate the\nimplications/potentialities of TW XFELs on the generation of harmonics at still\nshorter wavelengths and higher photon energies with variable polarization. The\nsimulations indicate that significant power levels are possible at high\nharmonics of the XFEL resonance and that these XFELs can be an important\ncoherent source of hard x-rays through the gamma ray spectrum. For this\npurpose, we use the MINERVA simulation code which self-consistently includes\nharmonic generation. Both helical and planar undulators are discussed in which\nthe fundamental is at 1.5 {\\AA} and study the associated harmonic generation.\nWhile tapered undulators are needed to reach TW powers at the fundamental, the\ntaper does not enhance the harmonics because the taper must start before\nsaturation of the fundamental, while the harmonics saturate before this point\nis reached. Nevertheless, the harmonics reach substantial powers. Simulations\nindicate that, for the parameters under consideration, peak powers of the order\nof 180 MW are possible at the fifth harmonic with a photon energy of about 41\nkeV and still high harmonics may also be generated at substantial powers. Such\nhigh harmonic powers are certain to enable a host of enhanced applications\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
