The material point\nmethod is well known to exhibit volumetric locking due to the presence of large\nnumbers of material points per element that are used to decrease the quadrature\nerror. Although there has been considerable research on the treatment of\nnear-incompressibility in the traditional material point method, the issue has\nnot been studied in depth for higher order material point methods. Using the\nBbar and Fbar methods as our point of departure we develop an appropriate\nprojection technique for material point methods that use higher order shape\nfunctions for the background discretization. The approach is based on the\nprojection of the dilatational part of the appropriate strain rate measure onto\na lower dimensional approximation space, according to the traditional Bbar and\nFbar techniques, but tailored to the material point method. The presented\nnumerical examples exhibit reduced stress oscillations and are free of\nvolumetric locking and hourglassing phenomena.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
