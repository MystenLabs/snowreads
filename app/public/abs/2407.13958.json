However, likelihood-based inference methods for\nmax-stable processes still heavily rely on composite likelihoods, rendering\nthem intractable in high dimensions due to their intractable densities. In this\npaper, we introduce a fast and efficient inference method for max-stable\nprocesses based on their angular densities for a class of max-stable processes\nwhose angular densities do not put mass on the boundary space of the simplex.\nThis class can also be used to construct r-Pareto processes. We demonstrate the\nefficiency of the proposed method through two new max-stable processes: the\ntruncated extremal-t process and the skewed Brown-Resnick process. The skewed\nBrown-Resnick process contains the popular Brown-Resnick model as a special\ncase and possesses nonstationary extremal dependence structures. The proposed\nmethod is shown to be computationally efficient and can be applied to large\ndatasets. We showcase the new max-stable processes on simulated and real data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0DIvbIK1Y-Fwd36wAXyrrURRFvrpRXB3WwTfgz71hDI","pdfSize":"1800274"}
