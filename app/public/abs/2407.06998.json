This problem is further exacerbated when the underlying topology of\nthese networks is affected by individual highly-dimensional node attributes. We\naddress this issue by tracking a network's modularity as a proxy of its\ncommunity structure. We leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to estimate each\nsnapshot's modularity. GNNs can account for both network structure and\nhigh-dimensional node attributes, providing a comprehensive approach for\nestimating network statistics. Our method is validated through simulations that\ndemonstrate its ability to detect changes in highly-attributed networks by\nanalyzing shifts in modularity. Moreover, we find our method is able to detect\na real-world event within the \\#Iran Twitter reply network, where each node has\nhigh-dimensional textual attributes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
