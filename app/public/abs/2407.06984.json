We present CODERS, a one-stage approach for\nCategory-level Object Detection, pose Estimation and Reconstruction from Stereo\nimages. The base of our pipeline is an implicit stereo matching module that\ncombines stereo image features with 3D position information. Concatenating this\npresented module and the following transform-decoder architecture leads to\nend-to-end learning of multiple tasks required by robot manipulation. Our\napproach significantly outperforms all competing methods in the public TOD\ndataset. Furthermore, trained on simulated data, CODERS generalize well to\nunseen category-level object instances in real-world robot manipulation\nexperiments. Our dataset, code, and demos will be available on our project\npage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
