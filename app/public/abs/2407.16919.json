We prove small data scattering when $1/2<\\alpha<1$ and modified\nscattering when $1<\\alpha<1+\\delta$ for some $\\delta>0$. Moreover, we show the\nexistence of (modified) wave operators for such a regime. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first result on the existence of modified scattering\nwith polynomial correction in kinetic models.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"CiuRFTij5ogTdo077qhLe73mo5nAhExuehLBKsqAo6k","pdfSize":"388596"}
