Furthermore,\ncurrent validation approaches do not align with authorisation and monitoring\nrequirements put forth by regulatory bodies. We address these validation gaps\nby outlining a universal evaluation framework that: incorporates the notion of\ncareful and competent driving, unifies behavioural competencies and evaluation\ncriteria, and is amenable at a scenario-specific and aggregate behaviour level.\nThis framework can be leveraged to evaluate optimal driving in scenario-based\ntesting, and for post-deployment monitoring to ensure continual compliance with\nregulation and safety standards.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
