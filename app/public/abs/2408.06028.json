In this paper, we introduce a new\ntool that can instantaneously identify control flow errors in BPMN models, make\nthem understandable for modelers, and suggest corrections to resolve them. We\ndemonstrate that detection is instantaneous by benchmarking our tool against\nsynthetic BPMN models with increasing size and state space complexity, as well\nas realistic models. Moreover, the tool directly displays detected errors in\nthe model, including an interactive visualization, and suggests fixes to\nresolve them. The tool is open source, extensible, and integrated into a\npopular BPMN modeling tool.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ix-FmLeTwZwa8QjbDX9oBdK5e4vQ5F8E_jO4PSYyKCw","pdfSize":"906063"}
