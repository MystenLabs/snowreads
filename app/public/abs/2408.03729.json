We obtain not only the reduced density matrix\nof the qubit, but also the backreaction obtained by quantum field theory as the\nenvironment. The result shows that the energy variation of the quantum field\ntheory is related to trajectory and the initial state of the qubit, the\nexpectation values of the linear and quadratic field operators, and the\ntemporal order product operator. When the qubit is in accelerated motion, the\nconventional Unruh effect causes the vacuum state to possess a \"temperature\",\nwhich raises some doubts about the validity of Landauer's principle. We prove\nthat Landauer's principle still holds for any state of motion.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XU_e6_wqKXfabcPjwmXsxn5WK0Qz0yC96VGW2DcLsLk","pdfSize":"205556"}
