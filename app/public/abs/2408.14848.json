These devices always encounter\nsignificant obstacles such as inevitable physical errors and the limited\nscalability of current near-term algorithms. Meanwhile, assuming a typical\narchitecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), realistic\napplications inevitably require a vast number of qubits, typically exceeding\n$10^6$, which seems far beyond near-term realization. In this work, to bridge\nthe gap between the NISQ and FTQC eras, we propose an alternative approach to\nachieve practical quantum advantages on early-FTQC devices. Our framework is\nbased on partially fault-tolerant logical operations to minimize spatial\noverhead and avoids the costly distillation techniques typically required for\nexecuting non-Clifford gates. To this end, we develop a space-time efficient\nstate preparation protocol to generate an ancillary non-Clifford state consumed\nfor implementing an analog rotation gate with an arbitrary small angle $\\theta$\nand a remarkably low worst-case error rate below $\\mathcal{O}(|\\theta|\np_{\\text{ph}})$, where $p_{\\text{ph}}$ is the physical error rate. Furthermore,\nwe propose several error suppression schemes tailored to our preparation\nprotocol, which are essential to minimize the overhead for mitigating errors.\nBased on this framework, we present several promising applications that\nleverage the potential of our framework, including the Trotter simulation and\nquantum phase estimation (QPE). Notably, we demonstrate that our framework\nallows us to perform the QPE for $(8\\times 8)$-site Hubbard model with fewer\nthan $4.9\\times 10^4$ qubits and an execution time of 9 days (or 12 minutes\nwith full parallelization) under $p_{\\text{ph}}=10^{-4}$, which is\nsignificantly faster than recent classical estimation with tensor network\ntechniques (DMRG and PEPS).\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
