This\nproximity effect brought a lot of new exciting physics and gave a powerful\nimpulse to development of superconducting spintronics. Nowadays a new direction\nof spintronics is actively developing, which is based on antiferromagnets and\ntheir heterostructures. It is called antiferromagnetic spintronics. By analogy\nwith an important role played by triplet Cooper pairs in conventional\nsuperconducting spintronics based on ferromagnets the question arises: does the\ntriplet proximity effect exist in superconductor/antiferromagnet\nheterostructures and, if so, what are the properties of the induced triplet\ncorrelations and the prospects for use in superconducting spintronics? Recent\ntheoretical findings predict that despite the absence of a net magnetization,\nthe Neel magnetic order of the antiferromagnet does give rise to specific\nspin-triplet correlations at superconductor/antiferromagnet interfaces. They\nwere called Neel triplet correlations. The goal of this review is to discuss\nthe current understanding of the fundamental physics of these Neel triplet\ncorrelations and their physical manifestations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
