We\ndefine three galactic types, based on our reference model, with reference to\nages of stellar populations. ``Normal'' late-type galaxies dominate the star\nformation in the nearby Universe; ``starburst'' galaxies take over at higher\nredshifts, up to z ~1.5; while ``protospheroidal'' galaxies dominate at high\nredshift. A reanalysis of data from the COSMOS field combined with literature\nresults shows that, for each population, the data are consistent with an almost\nredshift-independent mean value of the parameter q_IR, which quantifies the\ninfrared-radio correlation. However, we find a hint of an upturn of the mean\nq_IR at z>~3.5 consistent with the predicted dimming of synchrotron emission\ndue to cooling of relativistic electrons by inverse Compton scattering off the\ncosmic microwave background. The typical stellar masses increase from normal,\nto starburst, and to protospheroidal galaxies, accounting for the reported\ndependence of the mean q_IR on stellar mass. Higher values of q_IR found for\nhigh-z strongly lensed dusty galaxies selected at 500 micron might be explained\nby differential magnification.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
