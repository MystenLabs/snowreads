The required number of physical qubits arranged in an array depends on\nthe chosen Quantum Error Correction code and the achievable physical qubit\nerror rate. As the qubit count in the array increases, parallel gating -\nsimultaneously manipulating many qubits - becomes a crucial ingredient for\nsuccessful computation. In this study, small arrays of a type of donor- and\nquantum dot-based qubits, known as flip-flop qubits, are investigated.\nSimulation results of gate fidelities in linear, square and star arrays of four\nflip-flop qubits affected by realistic 1/f noise are presented to study the\neffect of parallel gating. The impact of two, three and four parallel one-qubit\ngates, as well as two parallel two-qubit gates, on fidelity is calculated by\ncomparing different array geometries. Our findings can contribute to the\noptimized manipulation of small flip-flop qubit arrays and the design of larger\nones.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
