We studied some basic properties of $k$-edge\ngeodetic graphs. We investigated the $k$ edge-geodeticity of complete bipartite\ngraph $K_{m,n}$ and provide the minimum number of largest fixed order path that\ncan cover $K_{m,n}$. We also studied the $k$-edge geodeticity of tree and the\nproduct graphs like Cartesian product, Strong product, Corona product, and\nprovide the bounds for the minimum number of the largest fixed order path that\ncan cover the graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8WqSx4lr9-ki_wXD-D1DSZ7kfGMmCA7DPZOs7slU7zE","pdfSize":"117363"}
