Over\na four-week period, data was gathered from 25 participants to develop models\ncapable of predicting daily mood averages. Utilizing the GLOBEM behavior\nmodeling platform, we benchmarked the utility of pupillary response as a\npredictor for mood. Our proposed model demonstrated a Matthew's Correlation\nCoefficient (MCC) score of 0.15 for Valence and 0.12 for Arousal, which is on\npar with or exceeds those achieved by existing behavioral modeling algorithms\nsupported by GLOBEM. This capability to accurately predict mood trends\nunderscores the effectiveness of pupillary response data in providing crucial\ninsights for timely mental health interventions and resource allocation. The\noutcomes are encouraging, demonstrating the potential of real-time and\npredictive mood analysis to support mental health interventions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
