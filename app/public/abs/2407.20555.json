In the case of multicomponent droplets\nundergoing solidification, the emergence of concentration gradients may trigger\nsignificant interfacial flows that dominate the freezing dynamics. Here, we\nexperimentally investigate the fascinating snow-globe freezing dynamics of\nsupercooled ethanol-water droplets. We reveal that these unique freezing\ndynamics are driven by solidification-induced solutal Marangoni flow within the\ndroplets. We quantitatively characterize the concentration-dependent migration\nand growth dynamics of ice particles, tightly connecting them to the solutal\nMarangoni effect and the associated convective heat transfer. Moreover, we show\nthat the final wrapping state of droplets can be modulated by the concentration\nof ethanol. Our findings may pave the way for novel insights into the\nphysicochemical hydrodynamics of multicomponent liquids undergoing phase\ntransitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ja8r299b3Pqk41BslELMw5iqqbfKRSUBJf4o5QFfKH8","pdfSize":"6655051"}
