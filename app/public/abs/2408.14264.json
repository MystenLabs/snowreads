Employing the macroscopic fluctuation theory, we evaluate the\nprobability density that the front velocity $c$ is smaller than the limiting\nvelocity $c_0$, predicted by the deterministic theory. We show that for\n$c_0-c\\ll c_0$ the corresponding rate function $s(c)$ coincides, up to a\nnumerical factor, with the similar rate functions for other front models\nbelonging to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov universality class. For\nlarge negative values of $c$, $s(c)$ approaches a simple bound, obtained under\nthe assumption that the branching is completely suppressed during the whole\ntime.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e3PCVHtsksex0k9FHYbgW0IiAwRoLD-Nh7zcUch8umE","pdfSize":"553112"}
