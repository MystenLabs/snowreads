The comparison between\nobserved and synthetic photometry yields residual dispersions of just 3.4-8.7\nmmag, resulting in the most accurate and precise whole-sky large-dynamic-range\noptical photometric system ever obtained. We include some tests and\napplications.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
