Here, we propose a novel\nLiberty lexicon evaluated on more than 3,000 manually annotated data both in\nin- and out-of-domain scenarios. As a result of this evaluation, we produce a\ncombined lexicon that constitutes the main outcome of this work. This final\nlexicon incorporates information from an ensemble of lexicons that have been\ngenerated using word embedding similarity (WE) and compositional semantics\n(CS). Our key contributions include enriching the liberty annotations,\ndeveloping a robust liberty lexicon for broader application, and revealing the\ncomplexity of expressions related to liberty across different platforms.\nThrough the evaluation, we show that the difficulty of the task calls for\ndesigning approaches that combine knowledge, in an effort of improving the\nrepresentations of learning systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ci2pn2q3VIjWxDoX7K5Ha7oCPw7l8YA5OmVwXTMEmsk","pdfSize":"334129"}
