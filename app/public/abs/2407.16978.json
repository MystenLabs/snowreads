Then, the half-filled minority-spin $e_g^\\pi$\ndoublet of the high-spin Fe$^{2+}$ ions ($d^{5\\uparrow,1\\downarrow}$) splits by\nthe SOC into the lower $L_{z+}$ and higher $L_{z-}$ states. The spin-orbital\nground state $d^{5\\uparrow}$$L_{z+}^{1\\downarrow}$ formally with $S_z$ = 2 and\n$L_z$ = 1 gives the large z-axis spin/orbital moments of 3.51/0.76 $\\mu_{B}$\n(3.41/0.67 $\\mu_{B}$) for FePS$_3$ (FePSe$_3$) monolayer, and both the moments\nare reduced by the strong (stronger) Fe 3d hybridizations with S 3p (Se 4p)\nstates. As a result, FePS3 (FePSe3) monolayer has a huge perpendicular\nsingle-ion anisotropy energy of 19.4 meV (14.9 meV), giving an Ising-type\nmagnetism. Moreover, via the maximally localized Wannier functions, we find\nthat the first nearest neighboring (1NN) Fe-Fe pair has large hopping\nparameters in between some specific orbitals, and so does the 3NN Fe-Fe pair.\nIn contrast, the 2NN Fe-Fe pair has much smaller hopping parameters and the 4NN\nFe-Fe pair has negligibly small ones. Then, a combination of those hopping\nparameters and the superexchange picture can readily explain the computed\nstrong 1NN ferromagnetic coupling and the strong 3NN antiferromagnetic one but\nthe relatively much smaller 2NN antiferromagnetic coupling. Furthermore, our\nPTMC simulations give TN of 119 K for FePS3 monolayer and also predict for\nFePSe3 monolayer the same magnetic structure with a close or even higher TN.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
