By introducing new CNC-type phase space point\noperators, we construct a quasiprobability representation for quantum\ncomputation which is covariant with respect to the Clifford group and\npositivity preserving under Pauli measurements, and whose nonnegative sector\nstrictly contains the subtheory of quantum theory described by nonnegative\nWigner functions. This allows for a broader class of magic state quantum\ncircuits to be efficiently classically simulated than those covered by the\nstabilizer formalism and Wigner function methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
