By assuming randomness in their interactions,\nuniversality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to\nsystem-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the\ngenerality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics,\nthat these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and\nthat solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in\nthe interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new\nspecies without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the\nspectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge\nbetween results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond\nthem to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of\necological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an\nincreased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species\nincreases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in\ntheoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
