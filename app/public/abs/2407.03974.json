However, the resource requirements to\nconduct the respective user studies can be prohibitively high and often only\nallow for a narrow analysis of specific dialogue goals and participant\ndemographics. In this paper, we propose LLM-Roleplay: a goal-oriented,\npersona-based method to automatically generate diverse multi-turn dialogues\nsimulating human-chatbot interaction. LLM-Roleplay can be applied to generate\ndialogues with any type of chatbot and uses large language models (LLMs) to\nplay the role of textually described personas. To validate our method we\ncollect natural human-chatbot dialogues from different sociodemographic groups\nand conduct a human evaluation to compare real human-chatbot dialogues with our\ngenerated dialogues. We compare the abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in\nembodying personas and holding a conversation and find that our method can\nsimulate human-chatbot dialogues with a high indistinguishability rate.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
