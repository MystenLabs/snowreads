We\ncharacterize the complexity of a learning problem by the metric entropy of its\nstate space. We then describe how learning efficiency is determined by this\nmeasure of complexity. This is, then, applied to two models where agents learn\nhigh-dimensional states.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0lPa7pjPE2lx7y79v1lrT3myD0i6yB3cbWHqt1oWDkQ","pdfSize":"318509"}
