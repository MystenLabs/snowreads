To this end, we introduce the RuleAlign\nframework, designed to align LLMs with specific diagnostic rules. We develop a\nmedical dialogue dataset comprising rule-based communications between patients\nand physicians and design an alignment learning approach through preference\nlearning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. We hope that our work can serve as an inspiration for exploring the\npotential of LLMs as AI physicians.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
