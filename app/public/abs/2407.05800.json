A primary hurdle in FL arises from the\nnon-IID nature of data samples across clients, which typically results in a\ndecline in the performance of the aggregated global model. In this study, we\nintroduce FedMRL, a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning\nframework designed to address data heterogeneity. FedMRL incorporates a novel\nloss function to facilitate fairness among clients, preventing bias in the\nfinal global model. Additionally, it employs a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) approach to calculate the proximal term $(\\mu)$ for the\npersonalized local objective function, ensuring convergence to the global\noptimum. Furthermore, FedMRL integrates an adaptive weight adjustment method\nusing a Self-organizing map (SOM) on the server side to counteract distribution\nshifts among clients' local data distributions. We assess our approach using\ntwo publicly available real-world medical datasets, and the results demonstrate\nthat FedMRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, showing its\nefficacy in addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning.
