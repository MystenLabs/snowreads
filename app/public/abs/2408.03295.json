The approach is to compare the IC design\nworkflow with that for printed circuit boards, then to discern a classification\nfor threats. The need to define and secure workflows is amplified by both U.S.\ninvestment in the semiconductor manufacturing and market forces affecting GPU\nproduction for AI applications. The origin of this knowledge gap can be the\nproprietary nature of solution spaces, but it can be the lack of demand for\nteaching and learning for engineers and technicians in this domain. This paper\npresents a framework for understanding the security of design workflows in a\nvendor- and tool-agnostic way.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
