We present a simple\nand compact analytic expression for the bound in the $\\Delta m^2_{41} - \\sin^2\n2\\theta_{14}$ plane, which includes all relevant parameters. Dependencies of\nthe bound on unknown CP-phases and the type of mass spectrum of light neutrinos\n(mass ordering and level of degeneracy) are studied in detail. We have computed\nthe bounds using the latest and most stringent data from KamLAND-Zen. The\nprojected constraints from future experiments are estimated. The obtained\nbounds are confronted with positive indications of the presence of sterile\nneutrinos as well as with the other existing bounds. The $0\\nu \\beta \\beta$\ndecay results exclude the regions of parameters implied by BEST and Neutrino-4,\nand the regions indicated by LSND and MiniBooNE are in conflict with $0\\nu\n\\beta \\beta$ results combined with $\\nu_\\mu-$ disappearance bounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
