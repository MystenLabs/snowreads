We obtain an explicit lower bound\non the corresponding optimal density, conjecture its tightness, and prove it in\ncase one of the gap lengths, $a$ or $b$, appears only once. This is equivalent\nto a Motzkin problem on the independence ratio of certain integer distance\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
