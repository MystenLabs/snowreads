This survey paper proposes a general\ntaxonomy of the technologies and a broad overview of current progress and\nchallenges. Vocal biomarkers are often secondary measures that are\napproximating a signal of another sensor or identifying an underlying mental,\ncognitive, or physiological state. Their measurement involve disturbances and\nuncertainties that may be considered as noise sources and the biomarkers are\ncoarsely qualified in terms of the various sources of noise involved in their\ndetermination. While in some proposed biomarkers the error levels seem high,\nthere are vocal biomarkers where the errors are expected to be low and thus are\nmore likely to qualify as candidates for adoption in healthcare applications.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
