Therefore, the main objective of this chapter is to provide a\nconceptual model of SLA for the IoT as well as rich vocabularies to describe\nthe QoS and domain-specific configuration parameters of the IoT on an\nend-to-end basis. We first propose a conceptual model that identifies the main\nconcepts that play a role in specifying end-to-end SLAs. Then, we identify some\nof the most common QoS metrics and configuration parameters related to each\nconcept. We evaluated the proposed conceptual model using a goal-oriented\napproach, and the participants in the study reported a high level of\nsatisfaction regarding the proposed conceptual model and its ability to capture\nmain concepts in a general way.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OY_LaC-QEHG0LgRsLRhyiJ3kLJ37JrRkXVC58OuMBeU","pdfSize":"1148340"}
