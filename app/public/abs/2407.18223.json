Our approach leverages dimensionality reshaping of 2D feature\nmaps to 1D signal representation and vice versa, enabling the joint usage of 1D\nand 2D blocks. We propose an original network topology that preserves the\nvolume of channel-timestep-frequency outputs of 1D and 2D blocks, facilitating\nefficient residual feature maps aggregation. Moreover, ReDimNet is efficiently\nscalable, and we introduce a range of model sizes, varying from 1 to 15 M\nparameters and from 0.5 to 20 GMACs. Our experimental results demonstrate that\nReDimNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in speaker recognition while\nreducing computational complexity and the number of model parameters.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
