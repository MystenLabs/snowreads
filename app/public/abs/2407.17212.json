Here we introduce one-component patchy-particle systems that\nin simulations are able to form face-centred IQCs that are made up of\ninterconnected icosahedra. The directional bonding of the particles facilitates\nthe formation of a network of bonds with icosahedral orientational order and\nhence quasiperiodic positional order. The assembled quasicrystals have similar\nenergies to periodic approximants but are entropically stabilized by phason\ndisorder. Their long-range quasiperiodic order is confirmed by a\nhigher-dimensional analysis. Promising routes to realize these IQCs\nexperimentally include via protein design and DNA origami particles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jH6K4SUoYYU_4X9j_OtL_7n4zQclnl4yFOgnZwx-4TQ","pdfSize":"27023457"}
