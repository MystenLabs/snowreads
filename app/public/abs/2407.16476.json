We obtain new exact\ncompact formulae for heavy-heavy-light-light scattering amplitudes in open or\nclosed bosonic string theories, and derive explicit exact expressions for the\nabsorption cross-sections, and corresponding emission rates, of highly excited\nstring states using the optical theorem and time reversal symmetry. We show\nthat these expressions are independent of the microscopic structure of the\nexcited string states without averaging. For the absorption of massless modes\nin open string theory, in particular, we find a constant, frequency-independent\ncross-section. In contrast, the corresponding cross-section for the absorption\nof massless modes by excited closed strings depends linearly on the frequency,\nimplying a non-trivial grey-body factor. In both cases, at energies below the\nscale set by the mass of the highly excited strings, we find emission rates\nwith a Boltzmann factor at Hagedorn temperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
