Such flows are commonly studied using the lubrication\napproximation approach which is intrinsically limited to small interface slopes\nand thus small contact angles. Flows for arbitrary contact angles, however, can\nbe studied using a generalized lubrication theory that builds upon viscous\ncorner flow solutions. Here we derive this generalized lubrication theory for\nviscoelastic liquids that exhibit normal stress effects and are modelled using\nthe second-order fluid model. We apply our theory to advancing and receding\ncontact lines in dip-coating, highlighting the influence of viscoelastic normal\nstresses for contact line motion at arbitrary contact angle.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
