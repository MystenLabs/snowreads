Despite recent excitement about their potential,\nresearch applications outside of industry are limited by the high cost of\ntraining a comprehensive suite of SAEs. In this work, we introduce Gemma Scope,\nan open suite of JumpReLU SAEs trained on all layers and sub-layers of Gemma 2\n2B and 9B and select layers of Gemma 2 27B base models. We primarily train SAEs\non the Gemma 2 pre-trained models, but additionally release SAEs trained on\ninstruction-tuned Gemma 2 9B for comparison. We evaluate the quality of each\nSAE on standard metrics and release these results. We hope that by releasing\nthese SAE weights, we can help make more ambitious safety and interpretability\nresearch easier for the community.
