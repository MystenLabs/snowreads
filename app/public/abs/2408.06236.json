We\ndiscuss the conditions for the existence of a variational $\\lambda_1$,\ndepending on the boundary parameter, the space dimension, and $p$. Our analysis\ninvolves the first $p$-harmonic Steklov eigenvalue in exterior domains. We\nestablish properties of $\\lambda_1$ for the exterior of a ball, including\ngeneral inequalities, the asymptotic behavior as the boundary parameter\napproaches zero, and a monotonicity result with respect to a special type of\ndomain inclusion. In two dimensions, we generalized to $p\\neq 2$ some known\nshape optimization results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
