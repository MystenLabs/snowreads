Unlike prior methods, our\napproach does not depend on symbolic solvers for reasoning about missing\nlabels. Instead, it evaluates logical implications and constraints in a\ndifferentiable manner by embedding both neural network outputs and logic\nprograms into matrices. This method facilitates more efficient learning under\ndistant supervision. We evaluated our approach against existing methods while\nmaintaining a constant volume of training data. The findings indicate that our\nmethod not only matches or exceeds the accuracy of other methods across various\ntasks but also speeds up the learning process. These results highlight the\npotential of our approach to enhance both accuracy and learning efficiency in\nNeSy applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OBqQtu_Fqlzj-5WwgIHUTQh-hWacMvxA7N2ji9X53qY","pdfSize":"500525"}
