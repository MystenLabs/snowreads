Monitoring the sleep\npatterns in neonates in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is imperative for\nunderstanding the maturation process. While polysomnography (PSG) is considered\nthe best practice for sleep classification, its expense and reliance on human\nannotation pose challenges. Existing research often relies on multichannel EEG\nsignals; however, concerns arise regarding the vulnerability of neonates and\nthe potential impact on their sleep quality. This paper introduces a novel\napproach to neonatal sleep stage classification using a single-channel gradient\nboosting algorithm with Hjorth features. The gradient boosting parameters are\nfine-tuned using random search cross-validation (randomsearchCV), achieving an\naccuracy of 82.35% for neonatal sleep-wake classification. Validation is\nconducted through 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed algorithm not only\nenhances existing neonatal sleep algorithms but also opens avenues for broader\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
