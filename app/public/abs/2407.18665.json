Texture is an important feature that has been widely used in many\nimage processing tasks. Therefore, analyzing and understanding texture plays a\npivotal role in image analysis and understanding.Local binary pattern (LBP) is\na powerful operator that describes the local texture features of images. This\npaper provides a novel mathematical representation of the LBP by separating the\noperator into three matrices, two of which are always fixed and do not depend\non the input data. These fixed matrices are analyzed in depth, and a new\nalgorithm is proposed to optimize them for improved classification performance.\nThe optimization process is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD)\nalgorithm. As a result, the authors present optimal LBPs that effectively\ndescribe the texture of human face images. Several experiment results presented\nin this paper convincingly verify the efficiency and superiority of the\noptimized LBPs for face detection and facial expression recognition tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z3qx37H_mQZV3n4PxF2fqRp1vC4s4gpLv_r8d8uSR8Y","pdfSize":"1694612"}
