For \\(a = c/\\sqrt{\\ln n}\\), we show that\nif \\(c < \\pi/\\sqrt{2}\\), then the volume remains close to that of \\(\\Omega\\).\nConversely, if \\(c > \\pi\\), we construct a domain \\(\\Omega\\) for which the\nvolume of the sum is significantly less than that of \\(\\Omega\\). These results\nextend to generalized hypercubes, providing precise volume bounds based on the\nsparsity ratio of the vertices used in the translations. The findings have\nimplications for adversarial hypothesis testing, particularly in scenarios\nwhere an adversary, after observing a Gaussian random vector, perturbs a subset\nof its components by a fixed magnitude.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
