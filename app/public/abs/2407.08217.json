Using Noether symmetry analysis, not only the symmetry vector but\nalso the coupling function in the Lagrangian and the potential of the scalar\nfield has been determined. Also symmetry analysis identifies a cyclic variable\nin the Lagrangian along the symmetry vector and as a result the Lagrangian\nsimplifies to a great extend so that classical solution is obtained.\nSubsequently, in quantum cosmology Wheeler-DeWitt(WD) equation has been\nconstructed and the quantum version of the conserved momenta corresponding to\nNoether symmetry identifies the periodic part of the wave function of the\nuniverse and as a result the Wheeler-DeWitt equation becomes solvable. Finally,\nquantum description shows finite non-zero probability at the classical big-bang\nsingularity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NqNt1sbQO0Sv_s9t8WF83L4vfFpgd8OpyEETa9E9jpQ","pdfSize":"219891"}
