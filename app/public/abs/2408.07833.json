Their identification and spectral line data are\nrequired in reliable astrophysical spectral analyses. In motivation for\nimproving the atomic data of Fe II, we analysed emission spectra of a Fe-Ne\nplasma produced by a Penning discharge lamp recorded by high-resolution Fourier\ntransform spectroscopy in the region 9000-27,000 cm$^{-1}$ (11,111-3704 {\\AA}).\nSemi-empirical transition probability calculations and stellar spectra of Fe II\nwere used to guide the analysis. In total, 24 energy levels of the 3d$^6$4f and\n3d$^6$5d configurations of Fe II lying between 122,351-127,881 cm$^{-1}$ were\nconfirmed in the laboratory for the first time, in agreement with their\nidentities proposed by previous investigations involving only stellar spectra.\nLevel energy and wavelength uncertainties of the 24 levels are improved by up\nto an order-of-magnitude compared to previously published values. These results\nwill enable more reliable application of Fe II in astrophysical spectroscopic\nanalyses and support further investigations of the spectrum and energy levels\nof Fe II.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pl5Pq_jtO38FXG2hhS5cm7H_N65yD1w-L7XjqJPnmNk","pdfSize":"313875"}
