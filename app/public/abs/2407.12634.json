The stabilization of solitons by an external\npotential is a challenging issue. This study demonstrates that the suppression\nof both the amplitude increase and the position shift of self-steepening\nsolitons can be achieved by adding a periodic PT-symmetric potential to the\nMNLS equation.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
