Remarkably large linear\nEO and elasto-optic coefficients are discovered in both systems, when under\nstress-free conditions. We further found that the EO responses of bulk and\nmonolayer NbOI$_{2}$ can be further enhanced with epitaxial strain, because of\na strain-driven ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition that originates from\nthe softening of some polar optical modes. Our findings thus point out that\nNbOI$_{2}$, as well as other niobium oxide dihalides are highly promising for\npaving the way for potentially efficient nonlinear optical device applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
