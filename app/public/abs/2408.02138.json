Unfortunately, prior methods often ignore the score rubric used by\nhuman experts and fall short of quantifying the uncertainty of the model\nprediction. To bridge the gap, we present RICA^2 - a deep probabilistic model\nthat integrates score rubric and accounts for prediction uncertainty for AQA.\nCentral to our method lies in stochastic embeddings of action steps, defined on\na graph structure that encodes the score rubric. The embeddings spread\nprobabilistic density in the latent space and allow our method to represent\nmodel uncertainty. The graph encodes the scoring criteria, based on which the\nquality scores can be decoded. We demonstrate that our method establishes new\nstate of the art on public benchmarks, including FineDiving, MTL-AQA, and\nJIGSAWS, with superior performance in score prediction and uncertainty\ncalibration.
