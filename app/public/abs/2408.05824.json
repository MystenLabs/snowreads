At sufficiently high substrate temperature, TEGa can act as a strong\netchant for \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 utilizing the suboxide reaction between Ga and Ga2O3.\nWe observe that due to monoclinic crystal structure of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3, TEGa\netching on both (010) and (001) substrates is highly anisotropic in nature,\nboth in terms of sidewall roughness and lateral etch rate. Smooth sidewalls are\nonly obtained along crystal orientations that minimize sidewall surface energy.\nUtilizing this technique we also demonstrate deep sub-micron fins with smooth\nsidewalls and high aspect ratios. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the damage\nfree nature of TEGa etching by fabricating Schottky diodes on the etched\nsurface which display no change in net donor concentration.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
