The CP asymmetries in the SM are induced by the CP violation in\n$K^0-\\bar{K}^0$ mixing. To investigate the BSM CP-violating (CPV) effects, a\nmodel-independent analysis is performed by using the low-energy effective field\ntheory (LEFT) framework at $\\mu=2$~GeV. If one further assumes the BSM physics\nto stem from above the electroweak scale, the LEFT shall then be matched onto\nthe SM effective field theory (SMEFT), the operators of which contributing to\n$\\tau\\to K_S\\pi\\nu_\\tau$ decays will also contribute to the neutron electric\ndipole moment (EDM) and $D^0-\\bar{D}^0$ mixing. The stringent bounds from the\nlatter suggest that no remarkable CPV effects can be observed in either the\ndecay rate or the angular distributions. The prospects for future measurements\nof these observables are also mentioned.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
