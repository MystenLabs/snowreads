Such singularity-free\nuniverses have no beginning, but they do have an origin of time. In\nmathematical terms, we are dealing with signature-type changing manifolds where\na Riemannian region (i.e., a region with a positive definite metric) is\nsmoothly joined to a Lorentzian region at the surface of transition where time\nbegins.\n  We present a transformation prescription to transform an arbitrary Lorentzian\nmanifold into a singular signature-type changing manifold. Then we establish\nthe Transformation Theorem, asserting that, conversely, under certain\nconditions, such a metric $(M,\\tilde{g})$ can be obtained from some Lorentz\nmetric $g$ through the aforementioned transformation procedure. By augmenting\nthe assumption by certain constraints, mutatis mutandis, the global version of\nthe Transformation Theorem can be proven as well. In conclusion, we make use of\nthe Transformation Prescription to demonstrate that the induced metric on the\nhypersurface of signature change is either Riemannian or a positive\nsemi-definite pseudo metric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
