However, as\ndata grows in size and availability, and the number of models that aim to aid\nor replace human decisions, it raises the concern that these models can be\nsusceptible to bias, which can lead to harm to specific individuals by basing\nits decisions on protected attributes such as gender, religion, sexual\norientation, ethnicity, and others. Visualization techniques might generate\ninsights and help summarize large datasets, enabling data scientists to\nunderstand the data better before training a model by evaluating pre-training\nmetrics applied to the datasets before training, which might contribute to\nidentifying potential harm before any effort is put into training and deploying\nthe models. This work uses the severe acute respiratory syndrome dataset from\nOpenDataSUS to visualize three pre-training bias metrics and their distribution\nacross different regions in Brazil. A random forest model is trained in each\nregion and applied to the others. The aim is to compare the bias for the\ndifferent regions, focusing on their protected attributes and comparing the\nmodel's performance with the metric values.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_RqR4WRjGlni9DP3te7LrZ2Y1p6mdpfmz18TlpVYLUA","pdfSize":"2331864"}
