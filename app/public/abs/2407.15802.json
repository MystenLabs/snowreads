One such change is the imperative to implement mass\ncustomization, wherein products are tailored to individual customer\nspecifications while still ensuring cost efficiency through large-scale\nproduction processes. These shifts can profoundly impact various facets of the\nindustry. This study focuses on the necessary adaptations in shop-floor\nproduction planning. Specifically, it proposes the use of efficient\nevolutionary algorithms to tackle the flowshop with missing operations,\nconsidering different optimization objectives: makespan, weighted total\ntardiness, and total completion time. An extensive computational\nexperimentation is conducted across a range of realistic instances,\nencompassing varying numbers of jobs, operations, and probabilities of missing\noperations. The findings demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed\napproach and enable the identification of the most suitable evolutionary\nalgorithms for addressing this problem. Additionally, the impact of the\nprobability of missing operations on optimization objectives is discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oITV_LlikBs6rDqXic8M7ps_j3BgDHrBbetTBpQe7y0","pdfSize":"1864389"}
