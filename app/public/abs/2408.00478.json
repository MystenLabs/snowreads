Real-space imaging of the electronic\ntransitions reveals the Jahn--Teller distortion occurring upon formation of the\nfirst and second anionic charge states. The experimental findings are\nrationalized by a theoretical many-body model which highlights the crucial role\nplayed by the substrate. The latter enhances and stabilizes the intrinsic\nJahn--Teller distortion of the negatively charged molecule hosting a degenerate\npair of single-particle frontier orbitals. Consequently, two excess electrons\nare found to occupy, in the ground state, the same localized orbital, despite a\nlarger Coulomb repulsion than the one for the competing delocalized electronic\nconfiguration. Control over the charging sequence by varying the applied bias\nvoltage is also predicted.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
