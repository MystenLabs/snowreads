The well-posedness in the sense of \\cite{DF} is proved via a variant\nof Doss-Sussman transformation. Moreover, we show that our rough RBSDEs can be\napproximated by a sequence of penalized BSDEs with rough drivers. As\napplications, firstly we provide the equivalence between rough RBSDEs and the\nobstacle problem of rough PDEs. Secondly, we show the solution of rough RBSDE\nsolves the corresponding optimal stopping problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yxqdN7E_XgucZ0Rvrjs_HOkgabxzxVNJCqYFjsNQ6ko","pdfSize":"593844"}
