Unipa-GPT relies\non gpt-3.5-turbo, it was presented in the context of the European Researchers'\nNight (SHARPER night). In our experiments we adopted both the Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) approach and fine-tuning to develop the system. The\nwhole architecture of Unipa-GPT is presented, both the RAG and the fine-tuned\nsystems are compared, and a brief discussion on their performance is reported.\nFurther comparison with other Large Language Models and the experimental\nresults during the SHARPER night are illustrated.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
