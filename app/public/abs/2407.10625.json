Moreover, video-based models require extensive,\nhigh-quality data and substantial computational resources. To tackle these\nissues, we reconceptualize video try-on as a process of generating videos\nconditioned on garment descriptions and human motion. Our solution, WildVidFit,\nemploys image-based controlled diffusion models for a streamlined, one-stage\napproach. This model, conditioned on specific garments and individuals, is\ntrained on still images rather than videos. It leverages diffusion guidance\nfrom pre-trained models including a video masked autoencoder for segment\nsmoothness improvement and a self-supervised model for feature alignment of\nadjacent frame in the latent space. This integration markedly boosts the\nmodel's ability to maintain temporal coherence, enabling more effective video\ntry-on within an image-based framework. Our experiments on the VITON-HD and\nDressCode datasets, along with tests on the VVT and TikTok datasets,\ndemonstrate WildVidFit's capability to generate fluid and coherent videos.
