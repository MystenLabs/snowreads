This follows from an application of the Howe-Moore\ntheorem and a theorem of Meyerovitch about the nonexistence of thinnings of the\nPoisson point process. We also give an alternative proof of Meyerovitch's\ntheorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
