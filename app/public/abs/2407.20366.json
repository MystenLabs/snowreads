We employ the Stackelberg-Nash strategy with two\nleaders and two followers. The leaders are responsible for selecting the policy\ntargeting null controllability, while the followers solve a bi-objective\noptimal control problem which consists of maintaining the solution process\nclose to prefixed targets. Once the Nash equilibrium is determined, the problem\nreduces to achieving null controllability of a coupled forward-backward\nstochastic system. To solve this problem, via Carleman estimates, we establish\na suitable observability inequality. Subsequently, we achieve the desired\ncontrollability result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hiWqTZ-HFSwknqi-EvOK9ogEHZOrE65f7evryWPY7Is","pdfSize":"273140"}
