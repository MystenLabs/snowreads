The proposed framework is an extension of\nthe one for computing the mean of complex multivariate Gaussian distribution.\nBy applying the proposed framework, the information geometry approach (IGA) and\nthe approximate information geometry approach (AIGA) for basis pursuit\nde-noising (BPDN) in standard linear regression are derived. The framework can\nalso be applied to other standard linear regression problems. With the\ntransformations of natural and expectation parameters of Gaussian\ndistributions, we then show the relationship between the IGA and the message\npassing (MP) algorithm. Finally, we prove that the AIGA is equivalent to the\napproximate message passing (AMP) algorithm. These intrinsic results offer a\nnew perspective for the AMP algorithm, and clues for understanding and\nimproving stochastic reasoning methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
