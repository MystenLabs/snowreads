In the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field\nthe motion is quadratically confined, while in the direction along the field\nline the motion is a Coulomb-distorted free motion. In this work, we identify\nthe asymptotically relevant parts of the Hamiltonian and cast the problem into\na Lippmann-Schwinger form. Then, we approximate the asymptotically irrelevant\nparts by a discrete Hilbert space basis that allows an exact analytic\nevaluation of the relevant Green's operators by continued fractions. The total\nasymptotic Green's operator is calculated by a complex contour integral of\nsubsystem Green's operators. We present a sample of numerical results for a\nwide range of magnetic field strengths.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QrePRbGnldn96a8dnrlv7V7RJarnBEUVYmfFK69jDc8","pdfSize":"345502"}
