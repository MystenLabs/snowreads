Traditional\napproaches typically represent stories with one line per character, progressing\nfrom left to right. While effective for simpler narratives, this method faces\nsignificant challenges when dealing with complex stories involving multiple\ncharacters, as well as temporal and spatial dynamics. In this study, we\ninvestigate the potential of immersive environments for enhancing storyline\nvisualizations. We begin by summarizing the key design considerations for\neffective storyline visualization in virtual reality (VR). Guided by these\nprinciples, we develop 3DStoryline, a system that allows users to view and\ninteract with 3D immersive storyline visualizations. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of 3DStoryline, we conduct a task-based user study, revealing\nthat the system significantly enhances users' comprehension of complex\nnarratives.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
