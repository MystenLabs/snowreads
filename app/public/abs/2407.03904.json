In complex social networks, individuals' choices are also influenced\nby their neighbors. To explore the evolution of strategies in realistic\nsettings, we conducted repeated asymmetric prisoners dilemma experiments on a\nweighted BA scale-free network. Our analysis highlighted how the four\ncomponents of memory-one strategies affect win rates, found two special\nstrategies in the evolutionary process, and increased the cooperation levels\namong individuals. These findings offer practical insights for addressing\nreal-world problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
