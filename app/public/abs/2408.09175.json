Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs),\nwhich utilize large language models in place of real subjects, are gaining\nincreasing public attention. Far from aiming for comprehensiveness, this paper\naims to offer readers an opportunity to understand how large language models\nare disrupting complex systems research and behavioral sciences. In particular,\nwe evaluate recent advancements in various domains within complex systems,\nencompassing network science, evolutionary game theory, social dynamics, and\nepidemic propagation. Additionally, we propose possible directions for future\nresearch to further advance these fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
