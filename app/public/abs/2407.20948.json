Through experimental analyses\nand X-ray imaging, we show that grippers with soft particles exhibit improved\nwrapping of the object after jamming, in contrast to grippers with rigid\nparticles. This results in significantly increased holding force through the\ninterlocking. The addition of a small proportion of rigid particles into a\npredominantly soft particle mixture maintains the improved wrapping but also\nsignificantly increases the maximum holding force. These results suggest a\ntunable approach to optimizing the design of granular grippers for improved\nperformance in soft robotics applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
