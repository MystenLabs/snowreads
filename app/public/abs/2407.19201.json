Our central proposition is an enhanced inference technique and\nlong-range dependency method for SNLDS. The cornerstone of our approach is the\nfusion of S4 and SNLDS, leveraging the strengths of both models to effectively\naddress the intricacies of long-range dependencies in switching time series.\nThrough rigorous testing, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology adeptly\nsegments and reproduces long-range dependencies in both the 1-D Lorenz dataset\nand the 2-D bouncing ball dataset. Notably, our integrated approach outperforms\nthe standalone SNLDS in these tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
