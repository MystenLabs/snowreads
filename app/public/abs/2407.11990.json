Sport, on the other hand, has become a\nconstant companion of the modern human suffering a lack of a healthy way of\nlife. The application of digital twins in sport has brought dramatic changes\nnot only in the domain of sport training, but also in managing athletes during\ncompetitions, searching for strategical solutions before and tactical solutions\nduring the games by coaches. In this paper, the domain of digital twins in\nsport is reviewed based on papers which have emerged in this area. At first,\nthe concept of a digital twin is discussed in general. Then, taxonomies of\ndigital twins are appointed. According to these taxonomies, the collection of\nrelevant papers is analyzed, and some real examples of digital twins are\nexposed. The review finishes with a discussion about how the digital twins\naffect changes in the modern sport disciplines, and what challenges and\nopportunities await the digital twins in the future.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
