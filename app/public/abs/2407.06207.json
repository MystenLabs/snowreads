Apart from the vacuum energy problem viewed as a\nquantum gravity problem, we discuss the \"smoking gun\" experiments involving\nhigher order quantum interference, as well as experimental probes of the\nstatistics of spacetime quanta. Finally, we address the conundrum of the\nintricately patterned spectrum of masses of elementary particles as well as\ntheir mixing angles, as another telltale problem of quantum gravity viewed as\ngravitized quantum theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
