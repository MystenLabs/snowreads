In particular we prove\nthat the star product (also known as Markov product)\n$S_{\\delta_1}*S_{\\delta_2}$ of two LSL copulas $S_{\\delta_1},S_{\\delta_2}$ is\nagain a LSL copula, i.e., that the family $\\mathcal{C}^{LSL}$ is closed with\nrespect to the star product. Moreover, we show that translating the star\nproduct to the class of corresponding diagonals $\\mathcal{D}^{LSL}$ allows to\ndetermine the limit of the sequence $S_\\delta, S_\\delta*S_\\delta,\nS_\\delta*S_\\delta*S_\\delta,\\ldots$ for every diagonal $\\delta \\in\n\\mathcal{D}^{LSL}$. In fact, for every LSL copula $S_\\delta$ the sequence\n$(S_\\delta^{*n})_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges to some LSL copula\n$S_{\\overline{\\delta}}$, the limit $S_{\\overline{\\delta}}$ is idempotent, and\nthe class of all idempotent LSL copulas allows for a simple characterization.\nComplementing these results we then focus on concordance of LSL copulas. After\nderiving simple formulas for Kendall's $\\tau$ and Spearman's $\\rho$ we study\nthe exact region $\\Omega^{LSL}$ determined by these two concordance measures of\nall elements in $\\mathcal{C}^{LSL}$, derive a sharp lower bound and finally\nshow that $\\Omega^{LSL}$ is convex and compact.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"864yiQr_VeCxGttOpwgvH9-XRSK3tn5cVt_wN9bDTKI","pdfSize":"2486433"}
