We show that many classes of perfect graphs can be\npartitioned into (at most) two comparability subgraphs and this holds for\nalmost all perfect graphs. On the other hand, we prove that for interval graphs\nan arbitrarily large number of comparability subgraphs might be necessary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
