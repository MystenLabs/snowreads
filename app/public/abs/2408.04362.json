Existing systems were built using\ni-vector/x-vector approaches along with Bi-LSTMs, which were trained to\ndiscriminate speakers, irrespective of the language. Instead of exploring the\ndesign space manually, we propose a neural architecture search for multilingual\nspeaker verification suitable for mobile devices, called\n\\textbf{NeuralMultiling}. First, our algorithm searches for an optimal\noperational combination of neural cells with different architectures for normal\ncells and reduction cells and then derives a CNN model by stacking neural\ncells. Using the derived architecture, we performed two different studies:1)\nlanguage agnostic condition and 2) interoperability between languages and\ndevices on the publicly available Multilingual Audio-Visual Smartphone (MAVS)\ndataset. The experimental results suggest that the derived architecture\nsignificantly outperforms the existing Autospeech method by a 5-6\\% reduction\nin the Equal Error Rate (EER) with fewer model parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dV2U4mNydeV2Tr5-rZulN4hOUu8YnFYgm4vCq9hWDlg","pdfSize":"2901540"}
