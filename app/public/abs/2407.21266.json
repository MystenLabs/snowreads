In this work, a\nnovel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain\ndecomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed. Specifically,\na domain decomposition-based U-Net (DDU-Net) architecture is introduced, which\npartitions input images into non-overlapping patches that can be processed\nindependently on separate devices. A communication network is added to\nfacilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of\nspatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset\nthat is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network.\nThen, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification\ndataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the\napproach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into\n$16\\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\\,\\%$ higher\nintersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without\ninter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes\ncommunication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full\nimage, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting\nultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context.
