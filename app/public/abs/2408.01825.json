At each Poisson event, the moving particle turns clockwise or\ncounterclockwise according to a rule which depends on the current direction. We\nprove that the components of the vector $\\big(X(t),\\,Y(t)\\big)$ can be\nrepresented as linear combinations of two independent telegraph processes with\ndifferent intensities. The exact distribution of $\\big(X(t),\\,Y(t)\\big)$ is\nthen obtained both in the interior of the support and on its boundary, where a\nsingular component is present. We show that, in the hydrodynamic limit, the\nprocess behaves as a planar Brownian motion with correlated components. The\ndistribution of the time spent by the process moving vertically is then\nstudied. We obtain its exact distribution and discuss its hydrodynamic limit.\nIn particular, in the limiting case, the process $\\big(X(t),\\,Y(t)\\big)$ spends\nhalf of the time moving vertically.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
