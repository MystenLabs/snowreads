By\nexploiting the well-known analogy between polymer systems and the $O(n)$-vector\nspin model in the limit $n \\to 0$, we derive an exact field-theoretic\nexpression for the partition function of the system. The latter is then\nevaluated at the saddle-point, providing a mean-field estimate of the free\nenergy. The resulting expression, which conforms to the Flory-Huggins type, is\nthen used to analyze the system's stability with respect to phase separation,\ncomplemented by a numerical approach based on convex hull evaluation. We\ndemonstrate that this simple lattice model can effectively explain the behavior\nof polymer systems in explicit solvent, which has been predominantly\ninvestigated through numerical simulations. This includes both single-chain\nsystems and polymer solutions. Our findings emphasize the fundamental role of\nvacancies whose presence, rendering the system a ternary mixture, is a crucial\nfactor in the observed phase behavior.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
