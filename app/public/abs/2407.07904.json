For\npositive equilibrium, conditions guaranteeing absolute stability are\nestablished, based on the delay value and model parameters. The analysis\ndemonstrates the existence of a unique maximal solution for the proposed model,\nwhich remains non-negative for nonnegative initial conditions and is\nwell-defined for all $t$ greater than zero. Furthermore, numerical simulations\nwith different parameter values were performed to investigate the effects of\nsystematically removing a percentage of predators or prey. Numerical\nsimulations attempt to exemplify and put into practice the theorems proved in\nthis article.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
