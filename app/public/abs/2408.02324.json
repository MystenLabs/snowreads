While the excitation to the Rydberg orbitals are typically\nachieved in more than tens of nanoseconds, the physical limit is in fact much\nfaster, at the ten picoseconds level. Here, we tackle such ultrafast Rydberg\nexcitation of a Rubidium atom by designing a dedicated pulsed laser system\ngenerating 480 nm pulses of 10 ps duration. In particular, we improved upon our\nprevious design by using an injection-seeded optical parametric amplifier (OPA)\nto obtain stable pulsed energy, decreasing the fluctuation from 30 % to 6 %. We\nthen succeeded in ultrafast excitation of Rydberg atoms with excitation\nprobability of ~90 %, not limited anymore by energy fluctuation but rather by\nthe atomic state preparation, addressable in future works. This achievement\nbroadens the range of applications of Rydberg atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
