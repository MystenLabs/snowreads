The proposed algorithm operates by training an\ninterpretable neural network, designed from the unrolling framework. The\nproposed technique can be used both as a graph learning and a graph signal\nreconstruction algorithm. This work enhances prior work in graph signal\nreconstruction by allowing the underlying graph to be unknown; and also builds\non prior work in graph learning by tailoring the learned graph to the signal\nreconstruction task.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
