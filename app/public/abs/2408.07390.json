M. Bisgaard proved that the $*$-algebra ${\\bf\nC}[z,\\overline{z},1/z\\overline{z}]$ has the moment property, that is, each\npositive linear functional on this $*$-algebra is a moment functional. We\ngeneralize this result to polynomials in $d$ variables $z_1,...,z_d$. We prove\nthat there exist $3d-2$ linear polynomials as denominators such that the\ncorresponding $*$-algebra has the moment property, while for 3 linear\npolynomials in case $d=2$ the moment property always fails. Further, it is\nshown that for the real algebras ${\\bf R}[x,y,1/(x^2+y^2)]$ (the hermitean part\nof ${\\bf C}[z,\\overline{z},1/z\\overline{z}]$) and ${\\bf\nR}[x,y,x^2/(x^2+y^2),xy/(x^2+y^2)]$, all positive semidefinite elements are\nsums of squares. These results are used to prove that for the semigroup\n$*$-algebras of ${\\bf Z}^2$, ${\\bf N}_0\\times{\\bf Z}$ and ${\\mathsf\nN}_+:=\\{(k,n)\\in{\\bf Z}^2:k+n\\geq 0\\}$, all positive semidefinite elements are\nsums of hermitean squares.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
