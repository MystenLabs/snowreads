In consequence, the compatibility relations for the nearest neighbour\nrecurrence coefficients provide a new algorithm for the computation of the\nJacobi coefficients of the one-step or multi-step Christoffel transforms. More\ngenerally, we investigate multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the\nsystem of measures obtained by applying a Christoffel transform to each of the\northogonality measures. We present an algorithm for computing the transformed\nrecurrence coefficients, and determinantal formulas for the transformed\nmultiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II. Finally, we show that\nzeros of multiple orthogonal polynomials of an Angelesco or an AT system\ninterlace with the zeros of the polynomial corresponding to the one-step\nChristoffel transform. This allows us to prove a number of interlacing\nproperties satisfied by the multiple orthogonality analogues of classical\northogonal polynomials. For the discrete polynomials, this also produces an\nestimate on the smallest distance between consecutive zeros.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H0iuSJlr31Tgw3hnZ8WhqcG8K6DiiZdMpyaLLkJtPyU","pdfSize":"820055","objectId":"0x0dd03f318a2f27d5af5290cdc6a32d5d927d29edf0374fbc997b92c674994615","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
