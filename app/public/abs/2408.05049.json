In order to\nunderstand how their strong repulsion affects the crystal structure and\ndynamics, we study the thermal motion and rearrangement of small mixed linear\nand homogeneous crystals by both measurements and simulations. Co-crystallized\nHCIs divide the crystal into domains, where different reordering rates, melting\npoints and localized phase transitions are observed due to decoupling of\nmotional modes across boundaries. These results improve our understanding of\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous ion strings over a wide range of charge-to-mass\nratios. This allows us to test our own simulations of the dynamic behavior of\nion strings and gives us confidence in their suitability for applications\nrelated to quantum simulation as well as computing and the search for new\nphysics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
