From the\ntight binding model we estimate the strength of the valley coupling to be of\nthe order of $0.2$ eV$\\cdot{\\AA}$ for typical heteropairs. We show that the\nvalley mixing gives rise to the in-plane $g$-factor of localized electrons\nleading to the spin precession in the in-plane magnetic field. We further study\nthe effects of the valley mixing on the fine structure and dynamics of excitons\nat type-II lateral heterojunctions. We find that the interplay of the valley\nmixing and long-range exchange interaction leads to the linear polarization of\nexciton photoluminescence along the armchair heterojunction with the degree of\npolarization up to $1/3$ under unpolarized excitation. Application of the\nin-plane magnetic field of the order of 10$-$100 mT in any direction leads to\nthe depolarization of the photoluminescence.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
