However,\nadaptation of the prior is necessary when there exists a discrepancy between\nthe training and testing distributions. In this work, we propose deep diffusion\nimage prior (DDIP), which generalizes the recent adaptation method of SCD by\nintroducing a formal connection to the deep image prior. Under this framework,\nwe propose an efficient adaptation method dubbed D3IP, specified for 3D\nmeasurements, which accelerates DDIP by orders of magnitude while achieving\nsuperior performance. D3IP enables seamless integration of 3D inverse solvers\nand thus leads to coherent 3D reconstruction. Moreover, we show that\nmeta-learning techniques can also be applied to yield even better performance.\nWe show that our method is capable of solving diverse 3D reconstructive tasks\nfrom the generative prior trained only with phantom images that are vastly\ndifferent from the training set, opening up new opportunities of applying\ndiffusion inverse solvers even when training with gold standard data is\nimpossible.
