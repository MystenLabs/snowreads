Unlike existing methods using an overly sparse\nhigh-dimensional latent, we propose a phase manifold consisting of multiple\nclosed curves, each corresponding to a latent amplitude. With our proposed\nvector quantized periodic autoencoder, we learn a shared phase manifold for\nmultiple characters, such as a human and a dog, without any supervision. This\nis achieved by exploiting the discrete structure and a shallow network as\nbottlenecks, such that semantically similar motions are clustered into the same\ncurve of the manifold, and the motions within the same component are aligned\ntemporally by the phase variable. In combination with an improved motion\nmatching framework, we demonstrate the manifold's capability of timing and\nsemantics alignment in several applications, including motion retrieval,\ntransfer and stylization.
