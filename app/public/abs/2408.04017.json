Due to the unconventional nature of vdW ferroelectricity,\nthese topological polar structures have proven difficult to observe\nexperimentally. Here we propose that these textures may be probed optically by\nshowing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear\noptical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian\nBerry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding\nand first-principles calculations. For the case of moir\\'e materials without\ncentrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift\nphotoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of\nfrequencies where transitions occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift\nphotocurrents are anti-parallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field.\nOur findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and\nnonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after\nstrategy for the experimental detection of topological polarization structures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
