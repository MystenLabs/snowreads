Key to the procedure is our introduction of Flannery\nbrackets, which generalize Poisson brackets. We conjecture on some\nimplications, including the possibility of replacing Poisson brackets with\nFlannery brackets in Dirac's brackets to provide the quantization procedure for\ngeneral non-holonomic equality constraint systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
