Our modelling is (equational) logic-based involving\nadvanced techniques from algebraic specification, and it can be executed by\nequational programming systems such as those from the OBJ-family. We show how\nthis provides a form of experimental mathematics for strategy problems\ninvolving combinatorial games.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Bye6pW8HMrcsx9mowti48a3JK5IdTtjMds3dx2wwOVY","pdfSize":"458860"}
