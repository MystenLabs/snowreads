The thermopower of samples containing CrSb is\nincreased due to an increase in the effective mass of the charge carriers,\nindicating that there is a drag effect originating from the magnetic particles.\nHowever, this was at the expense of reduced electrical conductivity caused by\nreduced charge carrier mobility. While overall only marginal improvements in\npower factors were observed, these samples exhibited significantly lower\nthermal conductivity compared to the single-phase material. As a result, a peak\n$\\textit{zT}$ value of $\\sim$1.4 was achieved at 325 K for the sample with\n0.125 wt.% CrSb. These results highlight the potential of incorporating\nmagnetic secondary phases to enhance the thermoelectric performance of\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"yoJbNv57cgvKrgiKBNyygGT4a1MIneyBFixlZRtkta8","pdfSize":"2920675"}
