However, existing methods struggle with efficient DAG sampling\ndue to the complex acyclicity constraint. In this study, we propose a scalable\nBayesian approach to effectively learn the posterior distribution over causal\ngraphs given observational data thanks to the ability to generate DAGs without\nexplicitly enforcing acyclicity. Specifically, we introduce a novel\ndifferentiable DAG sampling method that can generate a valid acyclic causal\ngraph by mapping an unconstrained distribution of implicit topological orders\nto a distribution over DAGs. Given this efficient DAG sampling scheme, we are\nable to model the posterior distribution over causal graphs using a simple\nvariational distribution over a continuous domain, which can be learned via the\nvariational inference framework. Extensive empirical experiments on both\nsimulated and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the\nproposed model compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TiXngCUEvSPaGOlzKBGTT372viPnGJFKOC4xdi1exR8","pdfSize":"796203"}
