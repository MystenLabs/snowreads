In this work, we develop a new method to construct reliable XC\npotentials by properly mixing the exact exchange and the local density\napproximation potentials in real space. The spatially dependent mixing\nparameter is derived based on the derivative discontinuity of electron density\nand is first-principle. We derived the equations for solving the mixing\nparameter and proposed an approximation to simplify these equations. Based on\nthis approximation, this new method gives reasonable predictions for the\nionization energies, fundamental gaps, and singlet-triplet energy differences\nfor various molecular systems. The impact of the approximation on the\nconstructed XC potentials is examined, and it is found that the quality of the\nXC potentials can be further improved by removing the approximation. This work\ndemonstrates that the derivative discontinuity of electron density is a\npromising constraint for constructing high-quality XC potentials.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
