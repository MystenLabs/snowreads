In comparison to traditional footage,\n360{\\deg} videos can convey engaging, immersive experiences that accurately\nrepresent the atmosphere of real-world locations. As the entire environment is\ncaptured simultaneously, it is necessary to anonymize the faces of bystanders\nin recordings of public spaces. Since this alters the video content, the\nperceived realism and immersion could be reduced. To understand these effects,\nwe compare non-anonymized and anonymized 360{\\deg} videos using blurring, black\nboxes, and face-swapping shown either on a regular screen or in a head-mounted\ndisplay (HMD).\n  Our results indicate significant differences in the perception of the\nanonymization techniques. We find that face-swapping is most realistic and\nleast disruptive, however, participants raised concerns regarding the\neffectiveness of the anonymization. Furthermore, we observe that presence is\naffected by facial anonymization in HMD condition. Overall, the results\nunderscore the need for facial anonymization techniques that balance both\nphoto-realism and a sense of privacy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
