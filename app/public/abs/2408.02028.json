A copula-based information measure is required to\nquantify the uncertainty inherent in these dependencies. This paper introduces\na multivariate variant of the cumulative copula entropy and explores its\nvarious properties, including bounds, stochastic orders, and\nconvergence-related results. Additionally, we define a cumulative copula\ninformation generating function and derive it for several well-known families\nof multivariate copulas. A fractional generalization of the multivariate\ncumulative copula entropy is also introduced and examined. We present a\nnon-parametric estimator of the cumulative copula entropy using empirical beta\ncopula. Furthermore, we propose a new distance measure between two copulas\nbased on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and discuss a goodness-of-fit test\nbased on this measure.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Lgj51IeP4AFR7lykODGzQjV6VLKbSgghWIoUd7MJ16Q","pdfSize":"661779","txDigest":"8vDAv8nqcxS8u6ZcZ43kskg49uokRrS8qLjB46uSZpCh","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
