The key idea of the paper is to\nreplace the underlying calculus of variations problems with continuous time\nMarkov decision problems. This directly leads to an approximation of the\nstationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation by the Bellman equation for a discounting\nMarkov decision problem. Developing elements of the weak KAM theory for the\nMarkov decision problem, we obtain an approximation of the effective\nHamiltonian. Additionally, convergences of the functional parts of the discrete\nweak KAM equations and Mather measures are shown. It turns out that the\napproximating equations are systems of algebraic equations. Thus, the paper's\nresult can be seen as numerical schemes for stationary and weak KAM\nHamilton-Jacobi equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MmgBdNAhqmBBy8v6A3I3nb_a3Qkog4jZysFPWJzgSEg","pdfSize":"361566","objectId":"0x9ebb77756112f407fb44d89c1632710bd3b8e1316b2b4bddef25125814491681","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
