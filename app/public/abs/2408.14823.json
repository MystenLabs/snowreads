This paper proposes LapisGS, a layered 3DGS\nthat supports adaptive streaming and progressive rendering. Our method\nconstructs a layered structure for cumulative representation, incorporates\ndynamic opacity optimization to maintain visual fidelity, and utilizes\noccupancy maps to efficiently manage Gaussian splats. This proposed model\noffers a progressive representation supporting a continuous rendering quality\nadapted for bandwidth-aware streaming. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our approach in balancing visual fidelity with the compactness\nof the model, with up to 50.71% improvement in SSIM, 286.53% improvement in\nLPIPS, and 318.41% reduction in model size, and shows its potential for\nbandwidth-adapted 3D streaming and rendering applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
