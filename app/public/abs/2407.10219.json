Calculations are performed within the framework of\nthe nuclear shell model. It is shown that the central force predominantly\ncontributes to the excitation energy. While the spin-orbit and tensor forces\ncontribute relatively less, their roles are noted crucial in a few cases, such\nas in $^{22}$O. Further, it is demonstrated that the Hamiltonian projection\napproach should be preferred for rightly assessing the contributions of each\nforce to the excitation energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
