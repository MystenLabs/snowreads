On the one hand, we have proved the global\nwell-posedness for the initial-value problem. Utilizing the fact that the\ninitial data belongs to the discrete weighted $\\ell^2$ space, we construct a\nRiemann-Hilbert problem for the initial-value problem. By Fredholm theory, the\nRiemann-Hilbert problem is uniquely solved with the jump contour consisting of\nthree circles that all center around the origin. On the other hand, based on\nthe global well-posedness and the Riemann-Hilbert problem, we allow the\nsolution to have the higher-order solitons, and then analyze the long-time\nasymptotics for the solution in different sectors on the upper-half plane.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
