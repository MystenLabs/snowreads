CARMA\nprocesses are the continuous-time analogue of ARMA processes as well as a\ngeneralization of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. However, unlike\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck processes with a tempered stable driver (see, e.g., Qu et\nal. (2021)) exact transition probabilities for higher order CARMA processes are\nnot explicitly given. Therefore, we follow the sample path generation method of\nKawai (2017) and approximate the driving tempered stable L\\'evy process by a\ntruncated series representations. We derive a result of a series representation\nfor ptempered {\\alpha}-stable distributions extending Rosi\\'nski (2007). We\nprove approximation error bounds and conduct Monte Carlo experiments to\nillustrate the usefulness of the approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wfkN4Wc4o8l0pi_tECZvPn6yY6rWldpWBzxbBj7odLA","pdfSize":"726317"}
