Distributed amplifiers are attractive for\ndesigners due to their wideband capability. When designing a distributed\namplifier, the first question that comes to mind is how wide the bandwidth can\nbe. This paper answers this question by using the self-matching and low-pass\nproperties of a distributed amplifier. Self-matching property of a distributed\npower amplifier is an interesting point that distinguishes it from other types\nof power amplifiers that are usually based on input and output matching\nnetworks. Here the estimation of the bandwidth of a distributed amplifier\nstructure is discussed. The equations that are used in this paper can bring\ngood insight and they can assist designers. Furthermore, we have explained the\nfrequency behavior of a tapered distributed amplifier analytically for the\nfirst time. In order to validate the approach presented here, we have used\npublished designs including our previously published design as practical\nexamples. The flowchart of the design procedure is also provided.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
