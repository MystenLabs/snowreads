For the purpose of these calculations a database of\nmore than 200 heavy fermions was compiled from the literature. The deep\nlearning networks trained on the database were then used for regression\ncalculations, and predictions were made about the coherence temperature,\nSommerfeld coefficient and carrier effective mass of potential new heavy\nfermions. Classification calculations were also performed in order to check\nwhether predicted heavy fermions are superconducting and/or antiferromagnetic.\nChemical composition was the only physical predictor used during the learning\nprocess. Suggestions were made for future improvements in terms of expanding\nthe database, as well as for other artificial intelligence calculations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fjqqnl_k7YyU1Ug0nPK21V15zvEBS2ozUF7drdSRe-Q","pdfSize":"615095"}
