However, for\nmulti-antenna communication systems, moving each antenna independently not only\nrequires prohibitive complexity to find the optimal antenna positions, but also\nincurs sophisticated movement control in practice. To address this issue, this\nletter proposes a new MA architecture termed group MA (GMA), enabling the group\nmovement of all elements collectively in a continuous manner, and\nsimultaneously achieving flexible array architecture by antenna selection (AS).\nIn this letter, we focus on the uniform sparse array based GMA, where equally\nspaced antenna elements are selected to achieve desired array sparsity. The\narray position and sparsity level are jointly optimized to maximize the sum\nrate of the multi-user communication system. Numerical results verify the\nnecessity to optimize the position and sparsity of GMA, and considerable\nperformance gain is achieved as compared to the conventional fixed-position\nantenna (FPA).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
