Multi-particle production in the\nfar-forward region is particularly relevant to astroparticle physics.\nHigh-energy cosmic rays initiate extensive air showers (EASs) in the\natmosphere, driven by hadron-ion collisions at low momentum transfer in the\nnon-perturbative regime of QCD. Therefore, understanding high-energy hadronic\ninteractions in the forward region is essential for interpreting EAS data and\nestimating backgrounds for astrophysical neutrino searches, among other\napplications. The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposal to construct a\nnew underground cavern at the HL-LHC dedicated to hosting a range of\nexperiments aimed at detecting particles beyond the current capabilities of LHC\nexperiments. This article will provide an update on the current planning status\nof the FPF and emphasize its synergies with astroparticle physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
