M. Keck\nObservatory. We observed a transit of KELT-18 b, an inflated ultra-hot Jupiter\norbiting a hot star ($T_\\text{eff} = 6670$ K) with a binary stellar companion.\nBy modeling the perturbation to the measured cross correlation functions using\nthe Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique, we derived a sky projected\nobliquity of $\\lambda = -94.8 \\pm 0.7$ deg ($\\psi = 93.8_{-1.8}^{+1.6}$ deg for\nisotropic $i_\\star$). The data are consistent with an extreme stellar\ndifferential rotation ($\\alpha = 0.9$), though a more likely explanation is\nmoderate center-to-limb variations of the emergent stellar spectrum. We see\nadditional evidence for the latter from line widths increasing towards the\nlimb. Using loose constraints on the stellar rotation period from observed\nvariability in the available TESS photometry, we were able to constrain the\nstellar inclination and thus the true 3D stellar obliquity to $\\psi =\n91.7_{-1.8}^{+2.2}$ deg. KELT-18 b could have obtained its polar orbit through\nhigh-eccentricity migration initiated by Kozai-Lidov oscillations induced by\nthe binary stellar companion KELT-18 B, as the two likely have a large mutual\ninclination as evidenced by Gaia astrometry. KELT-18 b adds another data point\nto the growing population of close-in polar planets, particularly around hot\nstars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
