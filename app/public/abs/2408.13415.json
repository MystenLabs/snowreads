The $\\phi$-$\\alpha$ potential is determined\nthrough a folding procedure of the HAL QCD $\\phi$-$N$ interaction in the\n$^4S_{3/2}$ channel with the matter distribution of $^4$He. The\nphenomenological $\\alpha$-$\\alpha$ and $\\phi$-$\\phi$ potentials are taken from\nthe literature. Additionally, we construct a Wood-Saxon (WS) type interaction\nto simulate the $\\phi$-$\\alpha$ potential, also taken from the literature,\nbased on an effective Lagrangian approach that includes $K\\bar{K}$ meson loops\nin the $\\phi$-meson self-energy. A comparison of binding energies obtained for\nboth types of the $\\phi$-$\\alpha$ interactions reveals qualitative agreement.\n%between the obtained approaches. We predict the binding energy for the\n$^{9}_{\\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\\phi\\phi}$He hypernuclei as the mirror\n$\\phi$+$\\alpha$+$\\alpha$ and $\\phi$+$\\phi$+$\\alpha$ systems in the range of\n1-11 MeV and 3-10 MeV, respectively. The range of values of the binding\nenergies relies on the choice of the WS $\\phi$-$\\alpha$ interaction parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
