Our main general result is a dimension-independent\nsemi-continuity relation for the quantum relative entropy with respect to the\nfirst argument. Using it, we obtain a number of results: (1) a tight continuity\nrelation for the conditional entropy in the case where the two states have\nequal marginals on the conditioning system, resolving a conjecture by Wilde in\nthis special case; (2) a stronger version of the Fannes-Audenaert inequality on\nquantum entropy; (3) a tighter continuity relation for quantum capacity; (4)\nbetter estimates on the quantum capacity of approximately degradable channels;\n(5) an improved continuity relation for the entanglement cost; (6) general\nupper bounds on asymptotic transformation rates in infinite-dimensional\nentanglement theory; and (7) a proof of a conjecture due to Christandl,\nFerrara, and Lancien on the continuity of 'filtered' relative entropy\ndistances.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
