However, existing SCG methods for detecting AO and\nMC typically rely on electrocardiogram (ECG) data. In this study, we propose an\ninnovative approach to identify AO and MC events in SCG signals without the\nneed for ECG information. Our method utilized a template bank, which consists\nof signal templates extracted from SCG waveforms of 5 healthy subjects. These\ntemplates represent characteristic features of a heart cycle. When analyzing\nnew, unseen SCG signals from another group of 6 healthy subjects, we employ\nthese templates to accurately detect cardiac cycles and subsequently pinpoint\nAO and MC events. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\ntemplate bank approach in achieving ECG-independent AO and MC detection, laying\nthe groundwork for more convenient remote cardiovascular assessment.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"NF9fk294Givunv4RbNCUVD0nm_E9mK_taaIB_SnOJ_g","pdfSize":"1735006"}
