As a first application, the neutron-rich He\nhyper-isotope chains, from 6{\\Lambda}He to 9{\\Lambda}He have been investigated\nto accurately account for the loosely bound or neutron-unbound character of\nhypernuclear many-body states. The energy spectra calculated with a\nphenomenological Hamiltonian show good agreement with experimental data. In\nparticular, neutron-emitting resonant states are predicted for the neutron-rich\nnuclei 5-7He and the hypernucleus 6{\\Lambda}He. Furthermore, one-neutron\ndensities exhibit the long-range character of weakly bound and resonant states.\nThis study demonstrates that GSM is a practical tool for describing the complex\nstructure of hypernuclei, especially for those close to drip lines.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
