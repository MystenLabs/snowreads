We propose an optimized framework for adjusting airport\noperational schedules for such pre-disaster scenarios. We first, aggregate\noperational data from multiple airports and then determine the optimal count of\nevacuation flights to maximize the impacted airport's outgoing capacity without\nimpeding regular air traffic. We then propose a novel Neural Network (NN)\naccelerated Genetic Algorithm(GA) for evacuation planning. Our experiments show\nthat integration yielded comparable results but with smaller computational\noverhead. We find that the utilization of a NN enhances the efficiency of a GA,\nfacilitating more rapid convergence even when operating with a reduced\npopulation size. This effectiveness persists even when the model is trained on\ndata from airports different from those under test.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nq_n2Oeu2vKZS6vxnmTztojiJUkCkc6M-DmrxeMZ2OU","pdfSize":"858800","txDigest":"HhMuPkvMDymgC1M72YdAGZWuERfjzPJwUsTEP398mSKi","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
