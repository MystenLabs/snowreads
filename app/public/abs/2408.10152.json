We demonstrate how the robot\nswarm determines its direction of movement to approach the source using only\nfield intensity measurements taken by each robot. In contrast with the current\nliterature, our algorithm accommodates a generic (non-degenerate) geometry for\nthe swarm's formation. Additionally, we rigorously show the effectiveness of\nthe algorithm even when the dynamics of the robots are complex, such as a\nunicycle with constant speed. Not requiring a strict geometry for the swarm\nsignificantly enhances its resilience. For example, this allows the swarm to\nchange its size and formation in the presence of obstacles or other real-world\nfactors, including the loss or addition of individuals to the swarm on the fly.\nFor clarity, the article begins by presenting the algorithm for robots with\nfree dynamics. In the second part, we demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness\neven considering non-holonomic dynamics for the robots, using the vector field\nguidance paradigm. Finally, we verify and validate our algorithm with various\nnumerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
