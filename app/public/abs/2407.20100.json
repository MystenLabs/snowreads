By\nutilizing the adaptive activation capabilities of KANs in a federated\nframework, we aim to improve classification capabilities while preserving\nprivacy. The study evaluates the performance of federated KANs (F- KANs)\ncompared to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) on classification task.\nThe results show that the F-KANs model significantly outperforms the federated\nMLP model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and stability, and\nachieves better performance, paving the way for more efficient and\nprivacy-preserving predictive analytics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
