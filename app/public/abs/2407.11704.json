We call this the\nphysical basis approach. In practice, we first express the NLO quark singlet\nand gluon PDFs in terms of the structure functions $F_2$ and $F_{\\rm L}$ in\nmomentum space. Employing these expressions in the DGLAP evolution, we arrive\nat the evolution equations for $F_2$ and $F_{\\rm L}$ in the physical basis. We\ndemonstrate how one is free from defining a factorization scale and scheme when\nusing the physical basis evolution equations. We also discuss the process of\napplying the NLO physical basis to global analysis of LHC cross sections.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
