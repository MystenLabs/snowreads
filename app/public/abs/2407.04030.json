The\nonly exception is the class of reflexive tournaments: they have neither dual\nsmall nor dual big Ramsey degrees. Our proof strategy is based on the\ncategorical interpretation of structural Ramsey theory. Starting from a\ncategory we are interested in, we engineer an synthetic expansion to piggyback\non a category where the dual Ramsey property has been established. We then use\nthe additive properties of dual Ramsey degrees to get back to the original\ncategory of \"natural\" objects and morphisms and conclude that it has finite\ndual Ramsey degrees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
