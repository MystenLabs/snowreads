In [European J. Combin. 24 (2023)\n777--784], Miklavi\\v{c} and Poto\\v{c}nik expanded upon this field, achieving a\ncomplete characterization of distance-regular Cayley graphs over cyclic groups\nby employing the method of Schur rings. In [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 97 (2007)\n14--33], they formally proposed the problem of characterizing distance-regular\nCayley graphs for any given class of groups. In this context, abelian groups\nare of particular importance, as a considerable number of distance-regular\ngraphs with classical parameters are precisely Cayley graphs over abelian\ngroups. In this paper, we address the Miklavi\\v{c}-Poto\\v{c}nik problem for\nabelian groups of rank $2$. More specifically, we identify all distance-regular\nCayley graphs over the group $\\mathbb{Z}_n \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p$ is\nan odd prime. Our proof utilizes novel tools such as polynomial addition sets,\nDesarguesian affine planes, and the duality of Schur rings over abelian groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
