By adopting the philosophy of taking medical\nimages as videos, MedSAM-2 not only applies to 3D medical images but also\nunlocks new One-prompt Segmentation capability. That allows users to provide a\nprompt for just one or a specific image targeting an object, after which the\nmodel can autonomously segment the same type of object in all subsequent\nimages, regardless of temporal relationships between the images. We evaluated\nMedSAM-2 across a variety of medical imaging modalities, including abdominal\norgans, optic discs, brain tumors, thyroid nodules, and skin lesions, comparing\nit against state-of-the-art models in both traditional and interactive\nsegmentation settings. Our findings show that MedSAM-2 not only surpasses\nexisting models in performance but also exhibits superior generalization across\na range of medical image segmentation tasks.
