Cardiac ultrasound faces two\nmajor challenges: (1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2)\nsignificant individual variations. Previous works have only learned the\npopulation-averaged 2D and 3D structures of the heart rather than personalized\ncardiac structural features, leading to a performance bottleneck. Clinically,\nwe observed that sonographers adjust their understanding of a patient's cardiac\nstructure based on prior scanning sequences, thereby modifying their scanning\nstrategies. Inspired by this, we propose a sequence-aware self-supervised\npre-training method. Specifically, our approach learns personalized 2D and 3D\ncardiac structural features by predicting the masked-out images and actions in\na scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can predict the missing\ncontent it has acquired a good understanding of the personalized cardiac\nstructure. In the downstream probe guidance task, we also introduced a sequence\nmodeling approach that models individual cardiac structural information based\non the images and actions from historical scan data, enabling more accurate\nnavigation decisions. Experiments on a large-scale dataset with 1.36 million\nsamples demonstrated that our proposed sequence-aware paradigm can\nsignificantly reduce navigation errors, with translation errors decreasing by\n15.90% to 36.87% and rotation errors decreasing by 11.13% to 20.77%, compared\nto state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QNpZTByHK-HjyYWlGldiGDErumwXlHIRAPl9voZ2F-U","pdfSize":"19399034"}
