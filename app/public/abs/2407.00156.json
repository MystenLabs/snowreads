Using Kohn's trick to differentiate between\nmetals and insulators by threading a flux in a torus geometry, we uncover the\nstriking property that Hatsugai-Kohmoto models with an interaction-induced gap\nin the spectrum sustain a current that grows as the linear size at any non-zero\nflux and which can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hMB4u2MXq4zqVq_Mhe3-PZ9Vl1jc2JFsYhbR6L45Eu0","pdfSize":"1543465"}
