It involves the cognitive process of interpreting data from the\nenvironment to determine what is happening, what factors are involved, and what\nactions caused those situations. This interpretation of situations is\nformulated as a semantic role labeling problem in computer vision-based\nsituation recognition. Situations depicted in images and videos hold pivotal\ninformation, essential for various applications like image and video\ncaptioning, multimedia retrieval, autonomous systems and event monitoring.\nHowever, existing methods often struggle with ambiguity and lack of context in\ngenerating meaningful and accurate predictions. Leveraging multimodal models\nsuch as CLIP, we propose ClipSitu, which sidesteps the need for full\nfine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results in situation recognition and\nlocalization tasks. ClipSitu harnesses CLIP-based image, verb, and role\nembeddings to predict nouns fulfilling all the roles associated with a verb,\nproviding a comprehensive understanding of depicted scenarios. Through a\ncross-attention Transformer, ClipSitu XTF enhances the connection between\nsemantic role queries and visual token representations, leading to superior\nperformance in situation recognition. We also propose a verb-wise role\nprediction model with near-perfect accuracy to create an end-to-end framework\nfor producing situational summaries for out-of-domain images. We show that\nsituational summaries empower our ClipSitu models to produce structured\ndescriptions with reduced ambiguity compared to generic captions. Finally, we\nextend ClipSitu to video situation recognition to showcase its versatility and\nproduce comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZqcnhQEDY3L03NqYmvswOYgMOff_gT_SdjBeZGNZZhM","pdfSize":"18518603"}
