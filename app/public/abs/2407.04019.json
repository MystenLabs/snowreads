We apply the formalism to the generalized Seiberg-Witten\nequations and show that the obtained CohFT functionals agree with the existing\nones proposed by physicists. This leads to a unified perspective from which to\nview the full supersymmetric functionals of the Donaldson-Witten,\nSeiberg-Witten, and Kapustin-Witten theories and understand the relations\nbetween them. We also outline a quantization program for our framework and\ndiscuss its potential to produce manifold invariants and quantum cohomologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
