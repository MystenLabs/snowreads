Data obtained by DESI Collaboration can help\nsolve this problem, establishing with high precision the value of the product\nof the Hubble constant h and comoving of sound horizon at the end of drag epoch\nto be equal to 101.8 Mpc. This value agrees very well with the earlier\nrefinement of the standard recombination theory and the value of the Hubble\nconstant H0=73.5 km/s/Mpc obtained from measurements in the late Universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nhdrwHjxhhmNE8CSw_WV4qkyFpDtnPTfyeV_BADkx-E","pdfSize":"169027"}
