Besides,\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key feature in\nfuture wireless networks. In this work, we consider a full-duplex ISAC- based\nD2D underlaid system, and propose a joint beamforming and power allocation\nscheme to improve the performance of the coexisting ISAC and D2D networks. To\nenhance spectral efficiency, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated for\nthe full-duplex ISAC-based D2D underlaid system, which is non-convex. To solve\nthe non-convex optimization problem, we propose a successive convex\napproximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm and prove its convergence.\nNumerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nscheme with the iterative algorithm, demonstrating that the proposed scheme\noutperforms state-of-the-art ones in both communication and sensing\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U-f9tvUGno0c6s0ZRFatoTdnhOK7et7OYqqPtQd6rlk","pdfSize":"849431"}
