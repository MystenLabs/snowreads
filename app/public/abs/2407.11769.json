We\nshow that these two $L$-classes differ if they do for an intersection of\ngeneral hyperplane sections which has only cohomologically isolated\nsingularities. So the study of a sufficient condition for non-coincidence is\nreduced to the latter case, where a necessary and sufficient condition has been\nobtained in terms of mixed Hodge structures on the stalks of the intersection\ncomplex in our previous paper. We also construct examples of projective\nvarieties where the two $L$-classes differ although the constant coefficient\nand intersection cohomologies coincide.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
