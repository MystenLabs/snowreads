The proposed methods are natural extensions of\nwell-known time-discrete schemes for deterministic wave equations, hence, they\nare easy to implement. It is proved that both methods are energy-stable.\nMoreover, the first method is shown to converge with the linear order in the\nenergy norm, while the second method converges with the\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\tau^{\\frac32})$ order in the $L^2$-norm, which is optimal with\nrespect to the time regularity of the solution to the underlying stochastic\nPDE. The convergence analyses of both methods, which are different and quite\ninvolved, require some novel numerical techniques to overcome difficulties\ncaused by the nonlinear noise term and the interplay between nonlinear drift\nand diffusion. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the sharpness of\nthe theoretical error estimate results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
