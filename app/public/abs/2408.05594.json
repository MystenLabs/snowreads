Our study systematically investigates the\ntrends and patterns in emission energies as a function of shape, size, dopant\ntype and dopant percentage. Twelve structures are identified to have emission\nwavelengths in the visible spectrum. The emission energies derived from our\ncalculations can guide the formulation of specific GQD mixtures to achieve\ndesired emission spectra within and beyond the visible range for industrial\napplications. Furthermore, the extensive dataset, including emission energies\nalong with molecular structures generated in this work, creates a DFT dateset\nfor further machine learning studies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
