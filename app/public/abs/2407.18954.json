In addition, the recently introduced 1MP generalized\ninverse and its dual are used to characterize the diamond partial order as a\n${\\cal G}$-based one. Finally, the one-sided star partial order is investigated\nby using 1MP- and MP1-inverses.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
