Moreover, a simple counterexample shows that $T^{-1}$ need\nnot be positive even if $T$ is unital and its spectrum is contained in the unit\ncircle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
