Still,\nexisting solutions are characterized by limited accuracy, especially in the\ncase of aggressive driving or poor generalization to unseen road conditions. To\naddress these issues, we propose to utilize Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with\na learned dynamics model that is optimized directly for the state estimation\ntask. Moreover, we propose to aid this model with the online-estimated friction\ncoefficient, which increases the estimation accuracy and enables zero-shot\nadaptation to the new road conditions. To evaluate the UKF-based velocity\nestimator with the proposed dynamics model, we introduced a publicly available\ndataset of aggressive manoeuvres performed by an F1TENTH car, with sideslip\nangles reaching 40{\\deg}. Using this dataset, we show that learning the\ndynamics model through UKF leads to improved estimation performance and that\nthe proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based state\nestimators by 17% in the nominal scenario. Moreover, we present unseen\nzero-shot adaptation abilities of the proposed method to the new road surface\nthanks to the use of the proposed learning-based tire dynamics model with\nonline friction estimation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
