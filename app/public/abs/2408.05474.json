While numerous\nsophisticated graph learning methods have emerged, their complexity often\nhinders practical implementation. In this article, we address this challenge by\nproposing a method that constructs feature vectors based on fundamental graph\nstructural properties. We demonstrate that these features, despite their\nsimplicity, are powerful enough to capture the intrinsic characteristics of\ngraphs within the same class. We explore the efficacy of our approach using\nthree distinct machine learning methods, highlighting how our feature-based\nclassification leverages the inherent structural similarities of graphs within\nthe same class to achieve accurate classification. A key advantage of our\napproach is its simplicity, which makes it accessible and adaptable to a broad\nrange of applications, including social network analysis, bioinformatics, and\ncybersecurity. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the\nperformance of our method, showing that it not only reveals a competitive\nperformance but in some cases surpasses the accuracy of more complex,\nstate-of-the-art techniques. Our findings suggest that a focus on fundamental\ngraph features can provide a robust and efficient alternative for graph\nclassification, offering significant potential for both research and practical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4rjeegvWE4TtvR9y_b6Js1Mx1quXgppsxYHoUkr33-s","pdfSize":"3525519"}
