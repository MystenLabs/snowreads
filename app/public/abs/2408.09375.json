Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction\ninvolving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than\nthe mass difference of the two particles, a scenario encountered in a wide\nrange of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering\nobservables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new\nparameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the\nleft-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Pad\\'e approximation but with\nnonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of\nthe effective range expansion. It is ready to be applied to a broad class of\nscatterings and, in particular, should be invaluable in understanding various\nnear-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the\nparameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle\nto the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused\nby the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wkt5tmMJEY4RHOMQBryG6q4F13UWAejylc4tvXsWb88","pdfSize":"507087"}
