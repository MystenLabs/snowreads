For these closed-form solutions to be found, idealized\nwave profiles such as the Dirac delta and Heaviside theta functions must be\nassumed. Although pathological in that future curvature singularities\ngenerically occur, these exact solutions give useful insights into the\nnon-linear features of the scattering process. Only a limited number of exact\nsolutions exist and this leaves many other physically-motivated scattering\nsituations without a non-linear description. The aim of this paper is to shed\nlight on these unexplored cases. This is achieved through numerical solutions\nof the Friedrich-Nagy initial boundary value problem for the Einstein equations\ncoupled to the source-free Maxwell equations in plane symmetry. Interesting\nnon-linear scattering effects are presented for a variety of electromagnetic\nand gravitational wave profiles not currently described by an exact solution.\nImplications for electromagnetic wave observations are investigated through\nanalyzing the time-delay and frequency shift imparted on the electromagnetic\nwave through the non-linear scattering with a gravitational wave of a given\nstrain. Simple arguments supported by the numerical solutions suggest dramatic\neffects on the radiation may be observable.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
