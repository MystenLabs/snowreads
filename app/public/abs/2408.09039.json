We compute this\ndeformed symplectic cohomology, in terms of the ordinary cohomology of the\nmanifold and divisor; and also describe some additional structures that it\ncarries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
