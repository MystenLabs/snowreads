EIT\ncooling of atoms or ions with a complex ground-state level structure is\nchallenging due to the lack of an isolated $\\Lambda$ system, as the population\ncan escape from the $\\Lambda$ system to reduce the cooling efficiency. We\novercome this issue by leveraging an EIT pumping laser to repopulate the\ncooling subspace, ensuring continuous and effective EIT cooling. We cool the\ntwo radial modes of a single $^{137}\\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ ion to average motional\noccupations of 0.08(5) and 0.15(7) respectively. Using the same laser\nparameters, we also cool all the ten radial modes of a five-ion chain to near\ntheir ground states. Our approach can be adapted to atomic species possessing\nsimilar level structures. It allows engineering of the EIT Fano-like spectrum,\nwhich can be useful for simultaneous cooling of modes across a wide frequency\nrange, aiding in large-scale trapped-ion quantum information processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
