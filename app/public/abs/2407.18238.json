We aim\nto investigate the merger-AGN connection using state-of-the-art observations\nand novel methods in detecting mergers and AGNs. We selected stellar\nmass-limited samples at redshift z<1 from KiDS, focusing on the KiDS-N-W2 field\nwith a wide range of multi-wavelength data. Three AGN types, selected in the\nMIR, X-ray, and via SED modelling, were analysed. To identify mergers, we used\nconvolutional neural networks trained on two cosmological simulations. We\ncreated mass and redshift-matched control samples of non-mergers and non-AGNs.\nWe observe a clear AGN excess (a factor of 2-3) in mergers with respect to\nnon-mergers for the MIR AGNs, and a mild excess for the X-ray and SED AGNs,\nindicating that mergers could trigger all 3 types but are more connected with\nthe MIR AGNs. About half of the MIR AGNs are in mergers but it is unclear\nwhether mergers are the main trigger. For the X-ray and SED AGNs, mergers are\nunlikely to be the dominant trigger. We also explore the relation using the\ncontinuous AGN fraction $f_{AGN}$ parameter. Mergers exhibit a clear excess of\nhigh $f_{AGN}$ values relative to non-mergers, for all AGNs. We unveil the\nfirst merger fraction $f_{merg}-f_{AGN}$ relation with two distinct regimes.\nWhen the AGN is not dominant, the relation is only mildly increasing or even\nflat, with the MIR AGNs showing the highest $f_{merg}$. In the regime of very\ndominant AGNs ($f_{AGN}\\geq0.8$), $f_{merg}$ shows a steeply rising trend with\nincreasing $f_{AGN}$ for all AGN types. These trends are also seen when plotted\nagainst AGN bolometric luminosity. We conclude that mergers are most connected\nwith dust-obscured AGNs (linked to a fast-growing phase of the SMBH) and are\nthe main or even the sole fuelling mechanism of the most powerful AGNs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
