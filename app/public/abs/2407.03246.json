We then relate the existence of zeroes of this moment\nmap to the stability of the fibration, where the stability property we consider\nis a version of K-stability that takes into account the fibration structure,\nfirst introduced by Dervan--Sektnan. In particular, we prove that a stable\ndeformation of a fibration admitting an optimal symplectic connection still\nadmits an optimal symplectic connection, through a new approach using the\nfinite-dimensional moment map properties and the moment map flow.\n  We include an appendix with a proof of a result considered by Sz\\'ekelyhidi\nthat a K-polystable deformation of a constant scalar curvature K\\\"ahler\nmanifold still admits a constant scalar curvature metric, using the same\ntechnique.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
