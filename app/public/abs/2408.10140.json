To obtain a constant-rate and linear-distance family,\nwe instantiate this construction with a classical good family of\nalgebraic-geometry codes on a non-binary, but constant-sized, alphabet. We then\nuse a technique from the arithmetic secret sharing literature to reduce the\nalphabet to binary. As a corollary, our code family provides a\nconstant-overhead magic state distillation scheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
