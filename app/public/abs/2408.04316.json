As special applications, the inverse of some matrices\narising from implicit time integration techniques, such as the well-known\nimplicit Runge-Kutta schemes and block implicit methods, can also be explicitly\ndetermined. Adiitionally, we introduce three fast algorithms for computing the\nelements of the inverse of these matrices in $O(n^2)$ arithmetic operations,\ni.e., the first one is based on Traub algorithm for fast inversion of\nVandermonde matrices, while the other two utilize the special structure of the\nmatrices. Finally, some symbolic and numerical results are presented to show\nthat our algorithms are both highly efficient and accurate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
