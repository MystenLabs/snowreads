Such a phenomenon significantly impacts the software\nindustry since it generates knowledge loss, delays in the schedule, and\nincreased costs in the final project. Despite the efforts made by researchers\nand professionals to minimize the turnover, more studies are needed to\nunderstand the motivation that drives Software Engineers to leave their jobs\nand the main strategies CEOs adopt to retain these professionals in software\ndevelopment companies. In this paper, we contribute a mixed methods study\ninvolving semi-structured interviews with Software Engineers and CEOs to obtain\na wider opinion of these professionals about turnover and a subsequent\nvalidation survey with additional software engineers to check and review the\ninsights from interviews. In studying such aspects, we identified 19 different\nreasons for software engineers' turnover and 18 more efficient strategies used\nin the software development industry to reduce it. Our findings provide several\nimplications for industry and academia, which can drive future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
