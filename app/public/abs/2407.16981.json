Initial experimental\nresults suggest that integrating CEViT into k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)\nclassification yields classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\ncomputer vision models, while adding capabilities for illustrating differences\nbetween classes. CEViT explanations can be influenced by prior cases, to\nillustrate aspects of similarity relevant to those cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b671Uq9H8SjQ71yELQlWL4R3ys8JSCG2mqHT5kWDDa8","pdfSize":"785911","objectId":"0x71b2f0213f06be5bea8d2734c36e7b3a36fb33dc918a1f324e416394c434a914","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
