As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a\nnew quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow,\nwhich has many other potential applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OTxmIV1zvIAY4oNbh0s1uWG91WoHPKH53OGZp1LiJs0","pdfSize":"699263"}
