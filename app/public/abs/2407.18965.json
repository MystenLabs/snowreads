It utilizes deep\nlearning techniques to create original and realistic content in terms of text,\nimages, code, music, and video. Researchers have also shown the capabilities of\nmodern Large Language Models (LLMs) used by GenAI models that can be used to\naid hardware development. Formal verification is a mathematical-based proof\nmethod used to exhaustively verify the correctness of a design. In this paper,\nwe demonstrate how GenAI can be used in induction-based formal verification to\nincrease the verification throughput.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
