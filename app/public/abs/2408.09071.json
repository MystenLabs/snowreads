We first present our vision for a\nfuture of semi-automated data governance on the Web, using policy languages to\ndescribe data terms of use, and having browsers act on behalf of users to enact\npolicy-based controls. Then, we present an overview of the technical research\nrequired to {prove} that existing policy languages express a sufficient range\nof concepts for describing cookie policies on the Web today. We view this work\nas a stepping stone towards a future of semi-automated data governance at\nWeb-scale, which in the long term will also be used by next-generation Web\ntechnologies such as Web agents and Solid.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
