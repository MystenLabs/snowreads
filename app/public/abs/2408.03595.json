An odd wheel $W_{2k+1}$ with $k\\geq2$ is a\ngraph obtained from a cycle of order $2k$ by adding a new vertex connecting to\nall the vertices of the cycle. Let ${\\rm SPEX}(n,W_{2k+1})$ be the set of\n$W_{2k+1}$-free graphs of order $n$ with the maximum spectral radius. Very\nrecently, Cioab\\u{a}, Desai and Tait \\cite{CDT2} characterized the graphs in\n${\\rm SPEX}(n,W_{2k+1})$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $k\\geq2$ and\n$k\\neq4,5$. And they left the case $k=4,5$ as a problem. In this paper, we\nsettle this problem. Moreover, we completely characterize the graphs in ${\\rm\nSPEX}(n,W_{2k+1})$ when $k\\geq4$ is even and $n\\equiv2~(\\mod4)$ is sufficiently\nlarge. Consequently, the graphs in ${\\rm SPEX}(n,W_{2k+1})$ are characterized\ncompletely for any $k\\geq2$ and sufficiently large $n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
