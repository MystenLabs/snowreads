[Nature Chemistry 14, 1098, 2022] on\nambient-light-induced intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) in unbound pyridine\nmonomers proposes the formation of a pyridine cation via intermolecular\nCoulombic decay following a three-body association/collision, wherein all the\nthree pyridine molecules are in the excited state. The collision-free\nconditions of the free-jet expansion, an abysmally low probability of finding\nthree independently excited pyridine molecules in the vicinity of each other,\nand extremely low excited state lifetimes negate the possibility of ICD in\nunbound pyridine monomers. An alternate mechanism, wherein the pyridine monomer\ncation originates from the dissociative ionization of pyridine dimers following\na three-photon absorption process, based on the translational energy\nmeasurements of pyridine cation is proposed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"SGP-jPf9_qa9Xgt0VnCWQSKq_jW5x0cn80IyIP58vd4","pdfSize":"901155"}
