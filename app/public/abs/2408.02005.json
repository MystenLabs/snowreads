The primary objectives of the study include the development of a new\nand simple method for calculating the Lyapunov exponent using only two\ntrajectory data points unlike traditional methods that require an averaging\nprocedure, the exploration of phase transition graphs from regular periodic to\nchaotic dynamics to identify \"almost integrable\" trajectories where conserved\nquantities deviate from whole numbers, and the identification of \"integrable\nregions\" within chaotic trajectories. These methods are applied and tested on\ntwo dynamical systems: \"Two objects moving on a rod\" and the \"Henon-Heiles\"\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
