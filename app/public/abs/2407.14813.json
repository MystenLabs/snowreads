We employ\nultraspherical spectral discretization for spatial variables in the disk domain\nand apply the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF) method for\ntemporal discretization. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to\ndevelop a numerical method for diblock and triblock copolymer systems with\nlong-range interactions in disk domains. We show the energy stability of the\nnumerical method in both semi-discrete and fully-discrete discretizations. In\nour numerical experiments, we verify the second-order temporal convergence rate\nand the energy stability of the proposed methods. Our numerical results show\nthat the coarsening dynamics in diblock copolymers lead to bubble assemblies\nboth inside and on the boundary of the disk. Additionally, in the triblock\ncopolymer system, we observe several novel pattern formations, including single\nand double bubble assemblies in the unit disk. These findings are detailed\nthrough extensive numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
