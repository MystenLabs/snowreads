Higher-order traffic flow models consisting of continuum equations\nand velocity dynamics were introduced to address the limitations of the\nLighthill, Whitham, and Richards (LWR) model. However, these models are\nineffective in incorporating road heterogeneity. This paper integrates an\nextended AW-Rascle higher-order model with the source terms in the continuum\nequation to predict the traffic states in heterogeneous road conditions. The\nsystem of the equations was solved numerically with the central dispersion (CD)\nmethod incorporated into the standard McCormack scheme. Smoothing is applied to\ntake care of the numerical oscillation of the higher-order model. Different\ncombinations of initial conditions with source terms showed that the proposed\nmodel with the numerical methods could produce a stable solution and eliminate\noscillation of the McCormack scheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
