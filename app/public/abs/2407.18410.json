Earlier applications of the IDEAL classification of spacetimes\nrelied on the construction of particular scalar polynomial curvature invariants\nas an important step in the procedure.\n  In this paper we investigate the well-known class of vacuum pp-wave\nspacetimes, where all scalar polynomial curvature invariants vanish, and\ndetermine the applicability of an IDEAL classification for these spacetimes. We\nconsider a modification of the IDEAL approach which permits a corresponding\nextension of the Stewart-Walker lemma. With this change, we are able to\nconstruct invariants and IDEAL-ly classify all of the vacuum pp-wave solutions\nwhich admit a two- or higher-dimensional isometry group, with the exception of\none case.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
