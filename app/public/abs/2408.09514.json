The\nevolution system couples the Navier-Stokes equations for the volume-averaged\nfluid velocity $\\bm{v}$, a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation for the\nphase-field variable $\\varphi$, and an advection-diffusion equation for the\ndensity of a chemical substance $\\sigma$. For the initial-boundary value\nproblem with a physically relevant singular potential in three dimensions, we\ndemonstrate that every global weak solution $(\\bm{v}, \\varphi, \\sigma)$\nexhibits a propagation of regularity over time. Specifically, after an\narbitrary positive time, the phase-field $\\varphi$ transitions into a strong\nsolution, whereas the chemical density $\\sigma$ only partially regularizes.\nSubsequently, the velocity field $\\bm{v}$ becomes regular after a sufficiently\nlarge time, followed by a further regularization of the chemical density\n$\\sigma$, which in turn enhances the spatial regularity of $\\varphi$.\nFurthermore, we show that every global weak solution stabilizes towards a\nsingle equilibrium as $t\\to +\\infty$. Our analysis uncovers the influence of\nchemotaxis, active transport, and long-range interactions on the propagation of\nregularity at different stages of time. The proof relies on several key points,\nincluding a novel regularity result for a convective Cahn-Hilliard-diffusion\nsystem with minimal regularity requirements on the velocity field $\\bm{v}$, the\nstrict separation property of $\\varphi$ for large times, as well as two\nconditional uniqueness results pertaining to the full system and its subsystem\nfor $(\\varphi, \\sigma)$ with a given velocity, respectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
