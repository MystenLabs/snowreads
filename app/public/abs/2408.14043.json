Specifically, we prove a splitting theorem,\nanalogous to the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem, for complete K\\\"ahler\nmanifolds with non-negative mixed curvature containing a line, and then\nestablish a structure theorem for compact K\\\"ahler manifolds with non-negative\nmixed curvature. We also show that the Hodge numbers of compact K\\\"ahler\nmanifolds with quasi-positive mixed curvature must vanish. Both results are\nbased on the conformal perturbation method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
