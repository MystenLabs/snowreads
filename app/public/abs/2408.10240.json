Existing accessible drawing tools, which construct images line by\nline, are suitable for simple tasks like math but not for more expressive\nartwork. On the other hand, emerging generative AI-based text-to-image tools\ncan produce expressive illustrations from descriptions in natural language, but\nthey lack precise control over image composition and properties. To address\nthis gap, our work integrates generative AI with a constructive approach that\nprovides users with enhanced control and editing capabilities. Our system,\nAltCanvas, features a tile-based interface enabling users to construct visual\nscenes incrementally, with each tile representing an object within the scene.\nUsers can add, edit, move, and arrange objects while receiving speech and audio\nfeedback. Once completed, the scene can be rendered as a color illustration or\nas a vector for tactile graphic generation. Involving 14 blind or low-vision\nusers in design and evaluation, we found that participants effectively used the\nAltCanvas workflow to create illustrations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
