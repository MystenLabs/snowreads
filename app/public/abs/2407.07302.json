However, real-world\nsuper-resolution (RWSR) faces unknown degradations in the low-resolution\ninputs, all the while lacking paired training data. Existing methods approach\nthis problem by learning blind general models through complex synthetic\naugmentations on training inputs; they sacrifice the performance on specific\ndegradation for broader generalization to many possible ones. We address the\nunsupervised RWSR for a targeted real-world degradation. We study from a\ndistillation perspective and introduce a novel pairwise distance distillation\nframework. Through our framework, a model specialized in synthetic degradation\nadapts to target real-world degradations by distilling intra- and inter-model\ndistances across the specialized model and an auxiliary generalized model.\nExperiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly\nenhances fidelity and perceptual quality, surpassing state-of-the-art\napproaches in RWSR.
