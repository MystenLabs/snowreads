This paper introduces the KAN-RCBEVDepth method, an innovative\napproach aimed at enhancing 3D object detection by fusing multimodal sensor\ndata from cameras, LiDAR, and millimeter-wave radar. Our unique Bird's Eye\nView-based approach significantly improves detection accuracy and efficiency by\nseamlessly integrating diverse sensor inputs, refining spatial relationship\nunderstanding, and optimizing computational procedures. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques across multiple\ndetection metrics, achieving a higher Mean Distance AP (0.389, 23\\%\nimprovement), a better ND Score (0.485, 17.1\\% improvement), and a faster\nEvaluation Time (71.28s, 8\\% faster). Additionally, the KAN-RCBEVDepth method\nsignificantly reduces errors compared to BEVDepth, with lower Transformation\nError (0.6044, 13.8\\% improvement), Scale Error (0.2780, 2.6\\% improvement),\nOrientation Error (0.5830, 7.6\\% improvement), Velocity Error (0.4244, 28.3\\%\nimprovement), and Attribute Error (0.2129, 3.2\\% improvement). These findings\nsuggest that our method offers enhanced accuracy, reliability, and efficiency,\nmaking it well-suited for dynamic and demanding autonomous driving scenarios.\nThe code will be released in \\url{https://github.com/laitiamo/RCBEVDepth-KAN}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
