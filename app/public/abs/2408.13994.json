A graph $G$ is $\\mathscr{F}$-free if\n$G$ does not contain any $F\\in \\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. The Tur\\'an number\n$ex(n, \\mathscr{F})$ is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex\n$\\mathscr{F}$-free graph. Let $M_{s}$ be the matching consisting of $ s $\nindependent edges. Recently, Alon and Frank determined the exact value of\n$ex(n,\\{K_{m},M_{s+1}\\})$. Gerbner obtained several results about\n$ex(n,\\{F,M_{s+1}\\})$ when $F$ satisfies certain proportions. In this paper, we\ndetermine the exact value of $ex(n,\\{K_{l,t},M_{s+1}\\})$ when $s, n$ are large\nenough for every $3\\leq l\\leq t$.
