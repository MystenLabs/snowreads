This approach aims to efficiently build an\napplication-specific ontology tailored to the corrective maintenance of\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The proposed method is divided into three phases.\nIn phase one, ontology requirements are systematically specified, defining the\nrelevant knowledge scope. Accordingly, CPS life cycle data is contextualized in\nphase two using domain-specific ontological artifacts. This formalized domain\nknowledge is then utilized in the CRISP-DM to efficiently extract new insights\nfrom the data. Finally, the newly developed data-driven model is employed to\npopulate and expand the ontology. Thus, information extracted from this model\nis semantically annotated and aligned with the existing ontology in phase\nthree. The applicability of this method has been evaluated in an anomaly\ndetection case study for a modular process plant.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
