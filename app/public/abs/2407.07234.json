We prove new smoothing estimates on the\nnonlinear Duhamel part of the solution and utilize a linear-nonlinear\ndecomposition to take advantage of the gained regularity. We also prove new\n$L^{p+3}_{t,x}$ almost Morawetz estimates for the defocusing $p-$NLS adapted to\nthe low-regularity setting, before specializing to the septic case $p=7$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
