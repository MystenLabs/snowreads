However,\nexisting work that focuses on different time scales of user modeling has\nignored the negative effects of different time-scale noise, which hinders\ncapturing actual user interests and cannot be resolved by conventional\nsequential denoising methods. In this paper, we propose a Long- and Short-term\nInterest Denoising Network (LSIDN), which employs different encoders and\ntailored denoising strategies to extract long- and short-term interests,\nrespectively, achieving both comprehensive and robust user modeling.\nSpecifically, we employ a session-level interest extraction and evolution\nstrategy to avoid introducing inter-session behavioral noise into long-term\ninterest modeling; we also adopt contrastive learning equipped with a\nhomogeneous exchanging augmentation to alleviate the impact of unintentional\nbehavioral noise on short-term interest modeling. Results of experiments on two\npublic datasets show that LSIDN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels and achieves significant robustness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"u6dpR-QLuWjgzPW5c42YhV4k7G3sNTdjcIZ5QR5pZBU","pdfSize":"8840368"}
