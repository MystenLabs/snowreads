We present a geometric interpretation\nof the SW transformation: We prove that it induces a local coordinate chart in\nthe space of Hermitian matrices near a $k$-fold degeneracy submanifold.\nInspired by this result, we establish a `distance theorem': we show that the\nstandard deviation of $k$ neighboring eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian equals the\ndistance of this Hamiltonian from the corresponding $k$-fold degeneracy\nsubmanifold, divided by $\\sqrt{k}$. Furthermore, we investigate one-parameter\nperturbations of a degenerate Hamiltonian, and prove that the standard\ndeviation and the pairwise differences of the eigenvalues lead to the same\norder of splitting of the energy eigenvalues, which in turn is the same as the\norder of distancing from the degeneracy submanifold. As applications, we prove\nthe `protection' of Weyl points using the transversality theorem, and infer\ngeometrical properties of certain degeneracy submanifolds based on results from\nquantum error correction and topological order.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nI_sJAN6WsA_9RNvBkrFd3l0-jWsgP0Fg9XCEkV0ut8","pdfSize":"1196732","objectId":"0xb364abbbd923c0a96a47420b56adc202d11cfdeaf8a67e1abec2fcf0780dbad3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
