This reliance extends to pre-surgery\nplanning and effective communication during the procedure. We introduce a novel\napproach for the formal and automated analysis of surgical procedures, which we\nmodel as security ceremonies, leveraging well-established techniques developed\nfor the analysis of such ceremonies. Mutations of a procedure are used to model\nvariants and mistakes that members of the surgical team might make. Our\napproach allows us to automatically identify violations of the intended\nproperties of a surgical procedure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sJhSHDmPXOvUjnNkJ8KT1R7pcDe4WBHJ7mtcKGbnnYA","pdfSize":"1944745"}
