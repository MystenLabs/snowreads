They arise naturally for\nmodeling the default time of a dealer bank, in the mathematical finance context\nof counterparty credit risk. Assuming an invariance time endowed with an\nintensity and a positive Az{\\'e}ma supermartingale, this work establishes a\ndictionary relating the semimartingale calculi in the original and reduced\nstochastic bases, regarding in particular conditional expectations,\nmartingales, stochastic integrals, random measure stochastic integrals,\nmartingale representation properties, semimartingale characteristics, Markov\nproperties, transition semigroups and infinitesimal generators, and solutions\nof backward stochastic differential equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
