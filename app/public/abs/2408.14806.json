However,\nexisting encoding methods are limited as they are typically customized to\nhandle only specific types of spatial data, which impedes their applicability\nacross different downstream tasks where multiple data types coexist. To address\nthis, we introduce Poly2Vec, an encoding framework that unifies the modeling of\ndifferent geospatial objects, including 2D points, polylines, and polygons,\nirrespective of the downstream task. We leverage the power of the 2D Fourier\ntransform to encode useful spatial properties, such as shape and location, from\ngeospatial objects into fixed-length vectors. These vectors are then inputted\ninto neural network models for spatial reasoning tasks.This unified approach\neliminates the need to develop and train separate models for each distinct\nspatial type. We evaluate Poly2Vec on both synthetic and real datasets of mixed\ngeometry types and verify its consistent performance across several downstream\nspatial reasoning tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
