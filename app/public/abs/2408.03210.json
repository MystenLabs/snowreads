To this end, we establish a version of Riemann-Roch without\ndenominators for the Bott-Chern characteristic classes. In particular, as an\napplication, we study the behaviour of the Bott-Chern characteristic classes of\nthe Iwasawa manifold under a blow-up transformation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
