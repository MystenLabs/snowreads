Existing claims are motivated by model calculations of the band\nstructure. In this study, angle resolved photoemsision spectroscopy and density\nfunctional theory for TiSe$_2$ are directly compared. The substantial\ndiscrepancies found between the two descriptions cast serious doubts on the\nexitonic insulator scenario as the correct physical mechanism underlying the\nperiodic lattice distortion at low temperature. In particular, the formation of\na valence-conduction hybridization gap in the bulk band structure is not\npresent in the experimental data. Therefore, the origin of the structural\ntransition in TiSe$_2$ cannot be fully explained within the existing\ntheoretical models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
