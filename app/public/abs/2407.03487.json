Agreement with the\navailable experimental data for $^6$Li, $^7$Li, $^9$Be and $^{10}$B up to\nvalues of momentum transfer $q\\sim 3$ fm$^{-1}$ is achieved when two-nucleon\ncurrents are accounted for. We present a set of predictions for the magnetic\nform factors of $^7$Be, $^8$Li, $^9$Li, and $^9$C. In these systems, two-body\ncurrents account for $\\sim40-60\\%$ of the total magnetic strength. Measurements\nin any of these radioactive systems would provide valuable insights on the\nnuclear magnetic structure emerging from the underlying many-nucleon dynamics.\nA particularly interesting case is that of $^7$Be, as it would enable\ninvestigations of the magnetic structure of mirror nuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
