Here we\npresent the chemical modeling of AAN and its isomers in hot cores using the\nthree-phase chemical model NAUTILUS with the addition of over 300 chemical\nreactions of the three AAN isomers and related species. Our models predicted a\npeak gas phase abundance of AAN reaching the order of 10-8, which is consistent\nwith observation towards Sgr B2(N). Regarding the reaction pathways of AAN and\nits isomers, we found that AAN is primarily formed via free radical reactions\non grain surfaces during the early evolutionary stages. Subsequently, it is\nthermally desorbed into the gas phase as the temperature rises and is then\ndestroyed by positive ions and radicals in gas phase. The isomers of AAN are\nformed through the hydrogenation reaction of CH3NCN on the grain surface and\nvia electron recombination reactions of ion C2H5N2+ in gas phase. We speculate\nthat there is a possibility for NCCN and AAN to react with each other,\neventually leading to the formation of adenine in hot cores. However, further\ninvestigation is required to understand the efficiency of grain surfaces in\nadenine formation, through theoretical calculations or laboratory experiments\nin future research.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
