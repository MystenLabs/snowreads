The impact of adding a\n{\\Lambda} hyperon in a s or p state is studied, and it is found that in some\ncases the deformation effect facilitates the extension of the drip line by an\nadded p-state hyperon. However, no extension of the drip line is found for\ns-state hypernuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
