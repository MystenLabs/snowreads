They exploit internal dynamics, discretization,\nredundancy/asynchronous actuation and sensing, to construct disruptive attacks\nthat are completely stealthy in the measurement. They work even when the\nsystems are both controllable and observable. This paper presents a novel\nframework to robustly and optimally detect and mitigate ZDAs for networked\nlinear control systems. We utilize controllability, observability, robustness,\nand sensitivity metrics written explicitly in terms of the system topology,\nthereby proposing a robust and optimal switching topology formulation for\nresilient ZDA detection and mitigation. Our main contribution is the\nreformulation of this problem into an equivalent rank-constrained optimization\nproblem (i.e., optimization with a convex objective function subject to convex\nconstraints and rank constraints), which can be solved using convex rank\nminimization approaches. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated using\nnetworked double integrators subject to ZDAs.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
