In this study, we use\namplitude-modulated lock-in detection of optically detected magnetic resonance\nof NV nanodiamonds (NVND) to investigate the link between temperature (T) and\nthe zero-field splitting parameter (D) and also the relationship between\nmagnetic field values and the difference of resonance frequencies. We also\npresent NVNDs' capacity to simultaneously sense both thermal and magnetic\nfields in real time. This dual-sensing approach is beneficial for studying\nmagnetic materials whose magnetization depends on temperature and the applied\nmagnetic field, such as certain ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials.\nIntegrating real-time thermal and magnetic field measurements provides unique\nopportunities for failure analysis in the integrated circuit (IC) industry and\nfor studying thermodynamic processes in cell physiology. The ability to\nconcurrently monitor temperature and magnetic field variations offers a\npowerful toolset for advancing precision diagnostics and monitoring in these\nfields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
