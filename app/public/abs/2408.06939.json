Our\nanalysis covers approximately 14.7 years of data from the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (Fermi-LAT) Pass 8. The position of the source and its spectrum\nmatches those in X-ray and TeV energy bands, so we propose that the GeV\n{\\gamma}-ray source is indicative of PWN G32.64+0.53. We interpret the\nbroadband spectral energy distribution (SED) using a time-dependent one-zone\nmodel, which assumes that the multi-band non-thermal emission of the target\nsource can be generated by synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering\n(ICS) of the electrons/positrons. Our findings demonstrate that the model\nsubstantially elucidates the observed SED. These results lend support to the\nhypothesis that the {\\gamma}-ray source originates from the PWN G32.64+0.53\npowered by PSR J1849-0001. Furthermore, the {\\gamma}-rays in TeV bands are\nlikely generated by electrons/positrons within the nebula through Inverse\nCompton Scattering.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
