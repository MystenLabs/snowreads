We examine in detail how the three energy conditions are\nsatisfied in such models. In particular, we find that the three energy\nconditions are satisfied when $r_{\\text{in}} > 5M/2$, where $M$ denotes the\nmass of the black hole. These solutions expressed explicitly in closed form are\nparticularly valuable for the studies of the gravitational waveforms of\nextreme/intermediate mass ratio inspirals and the nature of dark matter in\ngalaxies.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
