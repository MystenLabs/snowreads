The analysis of the Cauchy\nproblem associated to the peridynamic Sine Gordon equation with local Neumann\nboundary condition is performed in this work through a spectral method on\nChebyshev polynomials nodes joined with the Stormer Verlet scheme for the time\nevolution. The choice for using the spectral method resides in the resulting\nreachable numerical accuracy, while, indeed, Chebyshev polynomials allow\nstraightforward implementation of local boundary conditions. Several numerical\nexperiments are proposed for thoroughly describe the ability of such scheme.\nSpecifically, dispersive effects as well as the ability of preserving the\ninternal energy of the specific peridynamic kernel are demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
