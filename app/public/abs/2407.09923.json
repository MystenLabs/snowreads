This phenomenon is induced by an alternating current of proper\namplitude and frequency and can be tuned by a magnetic field applied\nperpendicular to the Rashba spin-orbit axis. The presence of fractional Shapiro\nsteps can be associated with the creation of Majorana bound states at the\nboundaries of the superconducting leads. Our findings represent a route for the\nidentification of topological superconductivity in non-centrosymmetric\nmaterials and confined systems in the presence of spin--orbit interaction,\noffering also new insights into recently explored frameworks.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
