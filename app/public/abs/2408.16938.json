Accurate suture thread reconstruction and grasping are vital\nprerequisites for suturing, particularly for avoiding entanglement with\nsurgical tools and performing complex thread manipulation. However, such\nmethods must be robust to heavy perceptual degradation resulting from heavy\nnoise and thread feature sparsity from endoscopic images. We develop a\nreconstruction algorithm that utilizes quadratic programming optimization to\nfit smooth splines to thread observations, satisfying reliability bounds\nestimated from measured observation noise. Additionally, we craft a grasping\npolicy that generates gripper trajectories that maximize the probability of a\nsuccessful grasp. Our full image-to-grasp pipeline is rigorously evaluated with\nover 400 grasping trials, exhibiting state-of-the-art accuracy. We show that\nthis strategy can be applied to the various techniques in autonomous suture\nneedle manipulation to achieve autonomous surgery in a generalizable way.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
