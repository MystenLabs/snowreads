It is shown that the marginal\ndistribution is in the domain of attraction of a max-semistable distribution.\nThe main result is that the extreme value law for the autoregressive process is\nobtained by including an extremal index in the law for an i.i.d.\\ process with\nthe same marginal distribution. Connections with extremes in deterministic\ndynamical systems and the relevance of max-semistable distributions in that\ncontext are also pointed out.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
