The aim of this work is twofold: the study of closed magnetic\ntrajectories on Heisenberg nilmanifolds of dimension three and the inverse\nproblem for this system, which consists in proving the existence of a\nLagrangian. The last goal is achieved on $H_3$. By using symmetries coming from\nconvenient actions, we compute the magnetic trajectories through the identity\nin $H_3$. We determine the closed magnetic trajectories on $H_3$ and consider\nthe existence question on compact quotients $\\Lambda\\backslash H_3$ for any\ncocompact lattice $\\Lambda\\subset H_3$. We prove that the existence of closed\nmagnetic geodesics is not guaranteed on every homotopy class. We give examples\nof compact quotients $\\Gamma_k\\backslash H_3$ with infinite many closed\nmagnetic trajectories and compact quotients with no closed non-contractible\nmagnetic trajectory for a given Lorentz force.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
