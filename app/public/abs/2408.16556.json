The main\nidea behind our approach is to employ recently developed parametrices for the\ncurl-operator and the regularity theory of Poisson transmission problems. We\nconclude our work by applying our findings to the heterogeneous time-harmonic\nMaxwell equations with either a) impedance, b) natural or c) essential boundary\nconditions and providing wavenumber-explicit piecewise regularity estimates for\nthese equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
