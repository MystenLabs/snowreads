The profusion of intelligent electronic\ndevices and IOT-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) has helped in the\nefficient use of resources and increased convenience. CPS has enabled real-time\nremote command and control of industrial assets. Unlike the relatively isolated\nlegacy systems, the intertwined nature of Information Technology(IT) and\nOperations Technology(OT) brought by Industry 4.0 has increased the complexity\nof the systems, thereby increasing the attack surface. This work explores the\npossible consequences of these attacks from a more holistic view, focusing on\nhigh-risk assets such as offshore oil rigs, offshore wind farms, and autonomous\nvessels. The attacks have become more aggressive with the proliferation of such\ntechnologies, disrupting the physical process, causing fire and explosion\nhazards, and endangering human life and environmental health. The possible\nattack scenarios, the attack vectors, and their physical consequences have been\ndiscussed from the perspective of personnel safety and health, along with known\nsecurity breaches of such nature. To the best of the authors' knowledge, seldom\nhas any work been done that accentuates the possible human and environmental\nimpacts of such attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
