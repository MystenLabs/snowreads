S. Bergeret and I. V. Tokatly, Phys. Rev. B\n89, 134517 (2014) and Jacobsen et al., Sci. Rep. 6, 23926 (2016)]. In this\nstudy, we experimentally investigate vertical Josephson junctions where the\nweak link is formed from a ferromagnetic layer with perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy sandwiched by two non-magnetic layers with weak or strong spin-orbit\ncoupling. We find that the decay of the Josephson coupling is reduced in the\nlatter case, possibly indicating the presence of $S_z=1$ spin-triplet\ncorrelations. We speculate that the canted magnetization required for these\ncorrelations is provided by the interaction of magnetization with Meissner\neffect in the superconducting layers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
