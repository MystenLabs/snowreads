The crystal structure of tetragonal SrIrO3 was\nevaluated on the basis of single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction. A cubic\nindexing was observed attributed to overlooked superlattice reflections. Weak\nfractional peaks in the H and K dimensions suggest possible structure\nmodulation by oxygen defects. Magnetization study reveals weak paramagnetic\nbehavior down to 2 K, indicative of the interplay between spin-orbit coupling,\nelectron correlations, and crystal electric field. Additionally, measurements\nof electrical resistivity display metallic behavior with an upturn at about 54\nK, ascribed to weak electron localization and possible structural defects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XDZAqwu1tzCqDTBIDWZq4cZpDui113ljUyCio_EUFss","pdfSize":"1949785"}
