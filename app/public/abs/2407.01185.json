Then we\ninclude the SU(3) breaking effect by introducing a factor $g_x$, this quantity\ncan be further constrained by the experimental mass of the $P_{\\psi\ns}^\\Lambda(4338)$ state. We can reproduce the mass of the $T^f_{cc}(3875)$\nstate with the parameters extracted from the observed $P_{\\psi}^N$ states, this\nconsistency indicates a unified description of the di-hadron molecular states\ncomposed of two heavy-light hadrons. With the same parameters, we discuss the\npossible mass spectra of the $\\bar{T}_{cc}^f$/$P_{\\psi\nc}^\\Lambda$/$H_{\\Omega_{ccc}c}^\\Lambda$ systems. Then we proceed to discuss the\nexistences of the $\\bar{T}_{cc\\bar{s}}^\\theta$/$P_{\\psi\ncs}^N$/$H_{\\Omega_{ccc}cs}^N$ states by investigating the SU(3) breaking\neffects. Our results show that the states in the\n$\\bar{T}_{cc\\bar{s}}^\\theta$/$P_{\\psi cs}^N$ systems can hardly form bound\nstates, while the states in the $H_{\\Omega_{ccc}cs}^N$ system can form bound\nstates due to their larger reduced masses.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Hqf3BQL2d3moI9aUwPW477AKiwxNIUFMoIxVRjQ-TBM","pdfSize":"407706"}
