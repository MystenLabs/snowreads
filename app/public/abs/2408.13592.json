For the purpose of demonstration, we choose a\nscenario which can accommodate the recently observed 95 GeV excess in both\nmodels. We further explore the impact of the measurement of the Yukawa\ncouplings, the gauge boson couplings and most importantly the trilinear\nself-couplings of the scalars, in distinguishing the vacuum structure in both\nmodels. We further investigate the constraints from vacuum stability on the\n2HDMS scenario that accommodates a viable dark matter candidate and compare it\nwith the N2HDM case.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rd7ordqp-ZewQmCK78xf5qz4xi_gmV3SU6bhqnaRZXM","pdfSize":"3417620"}
