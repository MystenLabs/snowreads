Furthermore, we show that the\nrefined invariant extends to the case of any genus $g\\ge2$ and either one\ncontact constraint or points in Mikhalkin position, and it again specializes to\nthe corresponding characteristic number at $q=1$. In the appendix we show the\nlimitations of extending this count to a more general setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
