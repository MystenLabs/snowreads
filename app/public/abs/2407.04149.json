The\ngeneral KAN framework uses learnable activation functions on the edges of the\ncomputational graph followed by summation on nodes. The learnable edge\nactivation functions in the original implementation are basis spline functions\n(B-Spline). Here, we present a model in which learnable grids of B-Spline\nactivation functions are replaced by grids of re-weighted sine functions. We\nshow that this leads to better or comparable numerical performance to B-Spline\nKAN models on the MNIST benchmark, while also providing a substantial speed\nincrease on the order of 4-8 times.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WjgTW3NrvRAC39wyhRySq9gbi20gE7GicfSwz3UEYHU","pdfSize":"1110115"}
