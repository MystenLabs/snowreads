Do there exist\n$x,y\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $i\\in\\left\\{1,2,\\ldots,r\\right\\}$ such that\n$\\left\\{x,y,xy,x+y\\right\\}\\subseteq C_{i}$? This is still an unanswered\nquestion asked by N. Hindman. Joel Moreira in [J. Moreira, Monochromatic sums\nand products in N, Annals of Mathematics 185 (2017) 1069-1090] established a\npartial answer to this question and proved that for infinitely many\n$x,y\\in\\mathbb{N}$, $\\left\\{x,xy,x+y\\right\\}\\subseteq C_{i}$ for some\n$i\\in\\left\\{1,2,\\ldots,r\\right\\}$, which is called Moreira's Theorem. Recently,\nH. Hindman and D. Strauss established a refinement of Moreira's Theorem and\nproved that for infinitely many $y$,\n$\\left\\{x\\in\\mathbb{N}:\\left\\{x,xy,x+y\\right\\}\\subseteq C_{i}\\right\\}$ is a\npiecewise syndetic set. In this article, we will prove infinitely many $y\\in\nFP\\left(\\mathbb{P}-1\\right)$ and $FP\\left(\\mathbb{P}+1\\right)$ such that\n$\\left\\{x\\in\\mathbb{N}:\\left\\{xy,x+f(y):f\\in F\\right\\}\\subseteq C_{i}\\right\\}$\nis piecewise syndetic, where $F$ is a finite subset of\n$x\\mathbb{Z}\\left[x\\right]$. $\\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers in\n$\\mathbb{N}$ and $FP\\left(\\mathbb{P}-1\\right)$ is the set of all finite\nproducts of distinct elements of $\\mathbb{P}-1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
