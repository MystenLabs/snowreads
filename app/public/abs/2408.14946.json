We compare the performances of such a network to those of the\ntriangle and of the 2L-underground ET configurations. We then examine the\nperformance of an intercontinental network made by a 40-km CE in the US,\ntogether with any of these European networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
