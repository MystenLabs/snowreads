However, the da Vinci system presents unique\nchallenges which hinder straight-forward implementation of imitation learning.\nNotably, its forward kinematics is inconsistent due to imprecise joint\nmeasurements, and naively training a policy using such approximate kinematics\ndata often leads to task failure. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\nrelative action formulation which enables successful policy training and\ndeployment using its approximate kinematics data. A promising outcome of this\napproach is that the large repository of clinical data, which contains\napproximate kinematics, may be directly utilized for robot learning without\nfurther corrections. We demonstrate our findings through successful execution\nof three fundamental surgical tasks, including tissue manipulation, needle\nhandling, and knot-tying.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0gMtBbZIiMJLlUgvphWRU7RLnGmMT7MdHdEHqLORQe0","pdfSize":"3521957","objectId":"0x9949eb54e226d36e9410b49e5b745cb974c510c92f57b233e1f6feba65b5146c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
