We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within\nthe respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of\nglobal order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these\noscillations, implying non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations. Ghost states\nemerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these\nstates eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium steady\nstates via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive microscopic understanding of collective phenomena in\nnonreciprocal matter without conservation laws, which may be relevant e.g. for\nunderstanding enzyme clustering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Mathematics/Probability","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
