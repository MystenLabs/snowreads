We dualize the previously obtained asymptotic overlap formulas\nfor one of the embeddings to describe the other embedding and apply the results\nto describe the asymptotic expectation values of local operators in the\npresence of a 't Hooft line in N=4 SYM. A peculiar feature of the setting is\nthat in certain gradings only descendant states have non-vanishing overlaps\nwith the boundary state and the overlap formula is not factorized for the Bethe\nroots.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
