They spread\nquickly in private and organizational contexts, including education. Yet,\nresearch lacks a conceptual framing to describe interaction with such agents in\na holistic manner. While focusing on the interaction with a pedagogical agent,\ni.e., a digital agent capable of natural-language interaction with a learner,\nwe propose a model of learning activity based on activity theory. We use this\nmodel and a review of prior research on digital agents in education to analyze\nhow various characteristics of the activity, including features of a\npedagogical agent or learner, influence learning outcomes. The analysis leads\nto identification of IS research directions and guidance for developers of\npedagogical agents and digital agents in general. We conclude by extending the\nactivity theory-based model beyond the context of education and show how it\nhelps designers and researchers ask the right questions when creating a digital\nagent.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
