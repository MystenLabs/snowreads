The origin of this characteristic\nwidth, however, has been a matter of intense discussions during the last\ndecade. We explored a possible variation in this typical width with the EMERGE\nEarly ALMA Survey, which includes seven star-forming regions in Orion\n(OMC-1/-2/-3/-4 South, LDN 1641N, NGC 2023, Flame Nebula). These targets, which\nexhibit different physical conditions, star formation histories, mass, and\ndensity regimes, were homogeneously surveyed at a resolution of $\\sim$ 2000 au\nin N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0) with ALMA+IRAM-30m observations. We characterised the\ncolumn density and temperature radial profiles of the 152 fibers identified in\nthe survey using the automatic fitting routine FilChap. These Orion fibers show\na departure from the isothermal condition with significant outward temperature\ngradients with $\\nabla T_\\mathrm{K} > 30$ K pc$^{-1}$. They also show a median\nfull width at half maximum ($FWHM$) of $\\sim 0.05$ pc, with a corresponding\nmedian aspect ratio of $\\sim2$. More relevantly, we observe a systematic\nvariation in these fiber $FWHM$ between different regions in our sample, and a\ndirect inverse dependence of these $FWHM$ on their central column density,\n$N_0$, above $\\gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. This dependency agrees with the\nexpected $N_0-FWHM$ anti-correlation predicted in previous theoretical studies.\nOur homogeneous analysis returns the first observational evidence of an\nintrinsic and systematic variation in the fiber widths across different\nstar-forming regions. While sharing comparable mass, length, and kinematic\nproperties in all of our targets, fibers appear to adjust their $FWHM$ to their\ndensity and to the pressure in their host environment.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sjNfQM39PHur8VvV0I65an6idY1TC6eOKxtsw_Dgl1U","pdfSize":"1120268"}
