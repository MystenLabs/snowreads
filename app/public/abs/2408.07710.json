For the\nfirst time, uniqueness bias is correlated with forecasting accuracy and\nperformance in real-world project investment decisions. We problematize the\nconventional framing of projects as unique and hypothesize that it leads to\npoor project performance. We test the thesis for a sample of 219 projects and\nfind that perceived uniqueness is indeed highly statistically significantly\nassociated with underperformance. Finally, we identify how decision makers can\nmitigate uniqueness bias in their projects through what Daniel Kahneman aptly\ncalled \"decision hygiene,\" specifically reference class forecasting,\npremortems, similarity-based forecasting, and noise audits.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"db-d2gNFPOcBk8wZOeigJntLLfMA9dxOO0BDyGPTO3s","pdfSize":"781866"}
