However, traditional\nedge computing models still face significant challenges in processing complex\ndriving data, particularly regarding real-time performance and system\nefficiency. To address these challenges, this study introduces EC-Drive, a\nnovel edge-cloud collaborative autonomous driving system with data drift\ndetection capabilities. EC-Drive utilizes drift detection algorithms to\nselectively upload critical data, including new obstacles and traffic pattern\nchanges, to the cloud for processing by GPT-4, while routine data is\nefficiently managed by smaller LLMs on edge devices. This approach not only\nreduces inference latency but also improves system efficiency by optimizing\ncommunication resource use. Experimental validation confirms the system's\nrobust processing capabilities and practical applicability in real-world\ndriving conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of this edge-cloud\ncollaboration framework.
