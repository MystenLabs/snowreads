In particular, nerve membranes become thicker and axons\ncontract. The spatial length of the action potential can be quite large,\nranging from millimeters to many centimeters. This suggests to employ\nmacroscopic thermodynamics methods to understand its properties. The pulse\nlength is several orders of magnitude larger than the synaptic gap, larger than\nthe distance of the nodes of Ranvier, and even larger than the size of many\nneurons such as pyramidal cells or brain stem motor neurons. Here, we review\nthe mechanical changes in nerves, theoretical possibilities to explain them,\nand implications of a mechanical nerve pulse for the neuron and for the brain.\nIn particular, the contraction of nerves gives rise to the possibility of fast\nmechanical synapses.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
