However, these methods are only\naccurate within a range of head angles; exceeding this specific range led to\nsignificant inaccuracies. This is dominantly explained by unclear specificity\nof the coordinate systems and Euler Angles used in the foundational rotation\nmatrix calculations. Here, we addressed these limitations by presenting (1)\nmethods that accurately infer the correct coordinate system and Euler angles in\nthe correct axis-sequence, (2) novel formulae for 2D geometric augmentations of\nthe rotation matrices under the (SPECIFIC) coordinate system, (3) derivations\nfor the correct drawing routines for rotation matrices and poses, and (4)\nmathematical experimentation and verification that allow proper pitch-yaw\ncoverage for full-range head pose dataset generation. Performing our\naugmentation techniques to existing head pose estimation methods demonstrated a\nsignificant improvement to the model performance. Code will be released upon\npaper acceptance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cg2HX3zkLfovceAY0iLqluHBf-fZ54xTqCCywu6z71Y","pdfSize":"6345062","txDigest":"64pyCL2vmJ5xLhuu9wYBG4D4WRFec7PkwsdatPUooChX","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
