Following a pioneering work of Bo Guan and Joel Spruck, we seek the\nsolution as a vertical graph over a bounded domain and solve the corresponding\nDirichlet problem for a fully nonlinear partial differential equation by\nestablishing the crucial second order estimates for admissible solutions.\n  Our proof consists of three main ingredients: (1) a non-standard, special\nchoice for the parameter in the auxiliary function, (2) a so-called\nalmost-Jacobi inequality for the equation operator, and (3) a set of arguments\nwhich reduce the situation to semi-convex case and which keep the coefficient\nof the troublesome negative term within a suitable magnitude.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
