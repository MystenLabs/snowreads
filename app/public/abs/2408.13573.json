That was straightforward in the\nregion outside the toroid, but an affine coordinate transformation had to be\nemployed inside the toroid. The coefficients of the series expansion of the\nperturbation potential in terms of appropriate toroidal basis functions were\nrelated to the coefficients of the series expansion of the source potential in\nterms of appropriate toroidal basis functions by a transition matrix. As a\nresult of the solution of this novel problem, the consequences of material\nanisotropy on perturbing the magnetostatic field are clearly evident in the\nregion near the toroid.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zfr-aV0WHZcQGFUAZ3j5__ux922XotERT3sGOuTm22I","pdfSize":"5329016"}
