The ultralight axion-like\nparticle (UALP) is an appealing dark matter candidate that can be searched for\nin neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work, we examined the interaction\namong neutrinos and a UALP; such interaction might induce violations of the\nLorentz and $CPT$ symmetries. We assessed the sensitivity to both the isotropic\n$CPT-$odd Standard Model Extension (SME) coefficients $(a_{L})^T$ and effective\nneutrino-UALP couplings $\\tilde{g}$ at the next-to-next generation neutrino\noscillation experiment at the European Spallation Source (ESS).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
