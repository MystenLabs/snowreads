We do this by first considering the expansion in the monomial or\nSchur basis and then performing a basis change. Using the former, we make a\nconnection with two fundamental graph theory invariants, the independence and\nclique numbers. This allows us to prove nonnegativity of three-column\ncoefficients for all natural unit interval graphs. The Schur basis permits us\nto give a new interpretation of the coefficient of $e_n$ in terms of tableaux.\nWe are also able to give an explicit formula for that coefficient.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
