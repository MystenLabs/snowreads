Due to the limited resources at body sensors, collecting each unlabeled\nsample in WBAN incurs a nontrivial cost. Moreover, training health monitoring\nmodels typically requires labels indicating the patient's health state that\nneed to be generated by healthcare professionals, which cannot be obtained at\nthe same pace as data collection. These challenges make our problem\nfundamentally different from classical active learning, where unlabeled samples\nare free and labels can be queried in real time. To handle these challenges, we\npropose a two-phased active learning method, consisting of an online phase\nwhere a coreset construction algorithm is proposed to select a subset of\nunlabeled samples based on their noisy predictions, and an offline phase where\nthe selected samples are labeled to train the target model. The samples\nselected by our algorithm are proved to yield a guaranteed error in\napproximating the full dataset in evaluating the loss function. Our evaluation\nbased on real health monitoring data and our own experimentation demonstrates\nthat our solution can drastically save the data curation cost without\nsacrificing the quality of the target model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
