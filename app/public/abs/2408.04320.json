We propose a matrix pencil-based\nmoving port (MPMP) prediction method, which may transform the time-varying\nchannel to a static channel by timely sliding the liquid. Different from the\nexisting channel prediction method, we design a moving port selection method,\nwhich is the first attempt to transform the channel prediction to the port\nprediction by exploiting the movability of FA. Theoretical analysis shows that\nfor the line-ofsight (LoS) channel, the prediction error of our proposed MPMP\nmethod may converge to zero, as the number of BS antennas and the port density\nof the FA are large enough. For a multi-path channel, we also derive the upper\nand lower bounds of the prediction error when the number of paths is large\nenough. When the UEs move at a speed of 60 or 120 km/h, simulation results show\nthat, with the assistance of FA, our proposed MPMP method performs better than\nthe existing channel prediction method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"dIbGHTTRK7hTqPPGQHcsBKj-D6DeiwSW587_eL1gPR0","pdfSize":"898859"}
