Deformation modes that bend the lattice without\nstretching the surface are effective bending modes. For periodic, piecewise\nsmooth, simply connected surfaces, it is shown that the effective membrane\nmodes are, in a sense, orthogonal to effective bending modes. This means that\nif a surface gains a membrane mode, it loses a bending mode, and conversely, in\nsuch a way that the total number of modes, membrane and bending combined, can\nnever exceed 3. Various examples, inspired from curved-crease origami\ntessellations, illustrate the results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
