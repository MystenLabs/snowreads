We simulated a dataset to mimic the\ncorrelation structures commonly found in imaging data and evaluated logistic\nregression, elastic networks, random forests, and XGBoost on their ability to\nhandle multicollinearity and accurately identify predictive features. Our study\naims to guide the selection of appropriate machine learning methods for\nprocessing neuroimaging data, highlighting models that best capture underlying\nsignals in high feature correlations and prioritize clinically relevant\nfeatures associated with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
