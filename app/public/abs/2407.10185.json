The probabilities of necessary causation\n(PN) and sufficient causation (PS) are two of the most common quantities for\nattribution in causal inference. While many works have explored the\nidentification or bounds of PN and PS, efficient estimation remains\nunaddressed. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on obtaining semiparametric\nefficient estimators of PN and PS under two sets of identifiability\nassumptions: strong ignorability and monotonicity, and strong ignorability and\nconditional independence. We derive efficient influence functions and\nsemiparametric efficiency bounds for PN and PS under the two sets of\nidentifiability assumptions, respectively. Based on this, we propose efficient\nestimators for PN and PS, and show their large sample properties. Extensive\nsimulations validate the superiority of our estimators compared to competing\nmethods. We apply our methods to a real-world dataset to assess various risk\nfactors affecting stroke.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
