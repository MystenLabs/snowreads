Despite its utility, this tool has been\npredominantly applied to disordered Hermitian systems. Multifractal statistics\nassociated with the non-Hermitian skin effect remain largely unexplored. Here,\nwe demonstrate that the tree geometry induces multifractal statistics for the\nsingle-particle skin states on the Cayley tree. This sharply contrasts with the\nabsence of multifractal properties for conventional single-particle skin\neffects in crystalline lattices. Our work uncovers the unique feature of the\nskin effect on the Cayley tree and provides a novel mechanism for inducing\nmultifractality in open quantum systems without disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
