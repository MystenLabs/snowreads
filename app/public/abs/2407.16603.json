The aim of this manuscript is\nto determine the location of right eigenvalues of $P(\\lambda)$ relative to\ncertain subsets of the set of quaternions. In particular, we extend the notion\nof (hyper)stability of complex matrix polynomials to quaternion matrix\npolynomials and obtain location of right eigenvalues of $P(\\lambda)$ using the\nfollowing methods: $(1)$ we give a relation between (hyper)stability of a\nquaternion matrix polynomial and its complex adjoint matrix polynomial, $(2)$\nwe prove that $P(\\lambda)$ is stable with respect to an open (closed) ball in\nthe set of quaternions, centered at a complex number if and only if it is\nstable with respect to its intersection with the set of complex numbers and\n$(3)$ as a consequence of $(1)$ and $(2)$, we prove that right eigenvalues of\n$P(\\lambda)$ lie between two concentric balls of specific radii in the set of\nquaternions centered at the origin. We identify classes of quaternion matrix\npolynomials for which stability and hyperstability are equivalent. We finally\ndeduce hyperstability of certain univariate quaternion matrix polynomials via\nstability of certain multivariate quaternion matrix polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
