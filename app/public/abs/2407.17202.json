Generalizing the fact that geometric phases\nacquired by electrons due to evolution of their crystal momentum $\\vec k$ in a\ndirection through out the Brillouin zone(BZ), provide position of their\nlocalization with net minimum spread along the corresponding direction in real\nspace. We find that the total charge can be meaningfully distributed into\ncharge centres simultaneously contributed by triads of electrons with their\ncrystal momentum evolving linearly independently through each unique $\\vec k$\nacross the BZ. The resultant map of charge centres readily renders not only the\nqualitative nature of inter-atomic as well as intra-atomic hybridization of\nelectrons, but also unbiased quantitative estimates of electrons on atoms or\nshared between them, as demonstrated in a select variety of isolated and\nperiodic systems with varying degree of sharing of valence electrons among\natoms, including variants of multi-centered bonds.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
