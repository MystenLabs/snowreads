However, the concept of the temporal receptive field, which refers\nto the temporal context that models use for making predictions, has been\nlargely overlooked and insufficiently analyzed in existing research. In this\nstudy, we present a comprehensive analysis of the temporal receptive field in\ndynamic graph learning. By examining multiple datasets and models, we formalize\nthe role of temporal receptive field and highlight their crucial influence on\npredictive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that appropriately chosen temporal\nreceptive field can significantly enhance model performance, while for some\nmodels, overly large windows may introduce noise and reduce accuracy. We\nconduct extensive benchmarking to validate our findings, ensuring that all\nexperiments are fully reproducible.
