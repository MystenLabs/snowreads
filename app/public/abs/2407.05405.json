Carbon\nfiber reinforced plastic was selected for specimen, and acoustic emission\nsignal were measured using piezoelectric devices. The measured signal was\nwavelet-transformed to obtain scalograms, which were used as training data for\nthe artificial intelligence model. AESLNet(acoustic emission source\nlocalization network), proposed in this study, was constructed convolutional\nlayers in parallel due to anisotropy of the composited materials. It is\nregression model to detect the coordinates of acoustic emission source\nlocation. Hyper-parameter of network has been optimized by Bayesian\noptimization. It has been confirmed that network can detect location of\nacoustic emission source with an average error of 3.02mm and a resolution of\n20mm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
