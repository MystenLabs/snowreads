PM guarantees that the\nactive set of the modified algorithm remains as small as guaranteed by\nCarath\\'eodory's theorem. PM achieves this by reformulating the active set\nexpansion task into an equivalent linear programming problem, which can be\nefficiently solved using a single pivot step akin to the primal simplex\nalgorithm. We establish that PM bounds the cardinality of the active set by the\ndimension of $\\mathcal{C}$ plus one, while preserving the convergence rate\nguarantees of a class of original algorithms, including various variants of the\nFrank-Wolfe algorithm. Furthermore, we establish the connection between PM and\nactive set identification. Specifically, when $\\mathcal{C}$ is a polytope and\nunder mild assumptions, PM applied to the away-step Frank-Wolfe algorithm (AFW)\nor the blended pairwise Frank-Wolfe algorithm (BPFW) ensures that the active\nset size is at most the dimension of the optimal face plus one. To illustrate\nthe practicality of PM, we provide algorithmic implementations for standard\nFrank-Wolfe variants and conduct a comprehensive numerical evaluation,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in inducing sparsity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
