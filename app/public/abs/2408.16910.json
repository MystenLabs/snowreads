We extend a correspondence of Burge between partitions and\nbinary words to give encodings of both $D$ and $D$ as words over a $k$-ary\nalphabet, for any fixed $k\\geq 2$. These are used to prove refinements of two\npartition identities involving $k$-measure that were recently derived\nalgebraically by Andrews, Chern and Li. The relationship between our encoding\nof $D$ and minimum gap-size partition identities (e.g. Schur's Theorem) is also\nbriefly discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
