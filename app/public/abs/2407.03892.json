To shorten the sequence length of speech tokens, acoustic\nbyte-pair encoding (BPE) has emerged in SLM that treats speech tokens from\nself-supervised semantic representations as characters to further compress the\ntoken sequence. But the gain in TTS has not been fully investigated, and the\nproper choice of acoustic BPE remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study on various settings of acoustic BPE to explore its\neffectiveness in decoder-only TTS models with semantic speech tokens.\nExperiments on LibriTTS verify that acoustic BPE uniformly increases the\nintelligibility and diversity of synthesized speech, while showing different\nfeatures across BPE settings. Hence, acoustic BPE is a favorable tool for\ndecoder-only TTS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
