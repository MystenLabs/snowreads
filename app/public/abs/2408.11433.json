Previous unlearning methods tend to\ninduce the model to achieve lowest classification accuracy on the removal data.\nNonetheless, the authentic objective of machine unlearning is to align the\nunlearned model with the gold model, i.e., achieving the same classification\naccuracy as the gold model. For this purpose, we present a Twin Machine\nUnlearning (TMU) approach, where a twin unlearning problem is defined\ncorresponding to the original unlearning problem. As a results, the\ngeneralization-label predictor trained on the twin problem can be transferred\nto the original problem, facilitating aligned data removal. Comprehensive\nempirical experiments illustrate that our approach significantly enhances the\nalignment between the unlearned model and the gold model. Meanwhile, our method\nallows data removal without compromising the model accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
