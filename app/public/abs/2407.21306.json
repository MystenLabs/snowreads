Denote by $X_t^x$ the (unique) solution with\ninitial value $X_0^x = x$, if the driving noise $Z_t$ is a $d$-dimensional\nrotationally symmetric $\\alpha$-stable ($1<\\alpha<2$) L\\'evy process, and by\n$Y_t^y$ the (unique) solution with initial value $Y_0^y=y$, if the driving\nnoise is a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion.\n  We give precise estimates of the total variation distance $\\|{\\rm law}\n(X_{t}^x)-{\\rm law} (Y_{t}^y)\\|_{TV}$ for all $t>0$, and we show that the\nergodic measures $\\mu_\\alpha$ and $\\mu_2$ of $X_t^x$ and $Y_t^y$, respectively,\nsatisfy $\\|\\mu_\\alpha-\\mu_2\\|_{TV} \\leq\n2\\wedge\\left[\\frac{Cd^{3/2}}{\\alpha-1}(2-\\alpha)\\right]$.\n  As an application, we consider the following $d$-dimensional Poisson PDE\n\\begin{gather*}\n  -(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2} f(x) + \\langle b(x), \\nabla f(x)\\rangle\n  = h(x)-\\mu_\\alpha(h), \\end{gather*} where $h \\in\nC_b(\\mathbb{R}^d,\\mathbb{R})$ and $1<\\alpha\\leq 2$. We show that this PDE\nadmits a solution $f_\\alpha$, which is continuous, but may have linear growth.\nFor fixed $\\alpha_0\\in(1,2)$, we show that for any $\\alpha_0\\leq \\alpha <2$\nthere is a constant $C(\\alpha_0)$ such that \\begin{gather*}\n  \\left|f_\\alpha(x)-f_2(x)\\right| \\leq C(\\alpha_0)(1+|x|)\\|h\\|_\\infty\nd^{3/2}(2-\\alpha)\\log\\frac{1}{2-\\alpha}\n  \\quad\\text{for all $x$}. \\end{gather*}\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
