This paper is a companion to \\cite{GLPS}, and together they\nprove the conjecture.\n  To prove the conjecture, we establish the following skew-product theorem. We\nshow that there exists $ c > 0 $ such that for all $ \\epsilon > 0 $ and subsets\n$ A, B \\subseteq G $ of finite simple groups of Lie type, if $ |B| < |G|^{1 -\n\\epsilon} $, then $ |A^{\\sigma} B| > |B||A|^{c \\epsilon} $ for some $ \\sigma\n\\in G $. This result, along with its more involved analogue for alternating\ngroups, constitutes the main contribution of this paper.\n  Our proof leverages deep results from character theory alongside the\nprobabilistic method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Yl64G6-uOFTx7D76KGbsUkuvh5-ACYKLdGg1zoGagM","pdfSize":"343704"}
