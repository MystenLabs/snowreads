The strongly intensive quantities $D$ and\n$\\Sigma$ are used to get rid of the effects related to volume fluctuations of\nthe system. We employ two versions of the HYDJET++ for the analysis. The first\none is the standard or default version, whereas the second one represents its\nfurther modification, which takes into account explicit event-by-event\nconservation of the electric net-charge of produced particles. Inclusion of the\ncanonical net-charge conservation in the model allows one for better\ndescription of the experimental data obtained by the ALICE and the CMS\nCollaborations. Comparison with calculations of other models is also presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
