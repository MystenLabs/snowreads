As a polarizable particle is immersed in a thermal\nenvironment, the momentum impulses imparted by the field fluctuations lead to\nmomentum diffusion and drag for the particle's classical center of mass. When\nconsidering the quantized center-of-mass motion of the particle, these very\nfluctuations gain information about its position, leading to decoherence in the\nposition basis. We derive a position localization master equation for the\nparticle's quantized center of mass, and examine its classical center-of-mass\nmomentum diffusion, elucidating correspondences between classical and quantum\nBrownian motion of polarizable particles near media.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nUyESlqstu7AMl8oIPT0lzYJcHSIDhlfsUz1kWMsxs0","pdfSize":"3908711"}
