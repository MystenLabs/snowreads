By\nequipping the cyclic free magma with a second distributive operation we obtain\na ringoid-like structure with some primitive arithmetical properties. A\nsubmagma is $k$-maximal when there are only $k-1$ submagmas between it and the\nfree magma itself. These two tools, arithmetic and maximality, allow us to\nstudy the lattice of the submagmas of a free magma.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sWf9wpPhcSbHvNGeiVbiEp-gMlAmWBdgHbSGo8GV8b8","pdfSize":"353510","objectId":"0xe07da6cdc1be0f22e8100870c25e8122436d571dcd1aa40b332fede6ce0336cb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
