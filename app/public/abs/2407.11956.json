However, some exceptional systems, such\nas those harboring quantum scars, break thermalization, serving as testbeds for\nfoundational problems of quantum statistical physics. Here, we investigate a\nclass of nonintegrable bond-staggered models that is endowed with a large\nnumber of zero-energy eigenstates and possesses a non-Abelian internal\nsymmetry. We use character theory to give a lower bound on the zero-energy\ndegeneracy, which matches exact diagonalization results, and is found to grow\nexponentially with the system size. We also show that few-magnon zero-energy\nstates have an exact analytical description, allowing us to build a basis of\nlow-entangled fixed-separation states, which is stable to most perturbations\nfound in experiments. This remarkable dynamical stability of special states\nelucidates our understanding of nonequilibrium processes in non-Abelian chaotic\nquantum models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
