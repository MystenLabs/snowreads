We find the\ndetector's response as a function of the energy gap, the Milne spatial\ncircumference parameter, the interaction duration, the age of the universe at\nthe switch-on moment, the detector's peculiar velocity at the switch-on moment,\nand, for the untwisted field, the state of the zero mode. Asymptotic analytic\nresults are obtained at large energy gap and at large circumference parameter,\nin each case recovering the Minkowski vacuum response in the leading order, and\nin the double limit of small circumference parameter and late cosmological\ntime, recovering the response in a static Minkowski cylinder. Numerical results\nare given in the interpolating regimes. The results confirm the detector's\nsensitivity to both classical and quantum properties of its environment.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
