However, these approaches may\nnot effectively detect the precise onset and offset of events within the data\nand suffer from class imbalance problems. This study introduces a generalized\nregression-based approach to reframe the time-interval-defined event detection\nproblem. Inspired by heatmap regression techniques from computer vision, our\napproach aims to predict probability densities at event locations rather than\nclass labels across the entire time series. The primary aim of this approach is\nto improve the accuracy of event detection methods, particularly for\nlong-duration events where identifying the onset and offset is more critical\nthan classifying individual event states. We demonstrate that regression-based\napproaches outperform segmentation-based methods across various\nstate-of-the-art baseline networks and datasets, offering a more effective\nsolution for specific event detection tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
