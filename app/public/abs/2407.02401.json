In the literature, ties are generally considered binary or weighted\nbased on their strength. Nonetheless, when the actors are individuals, these\nrelationships are often imprecise, and identifying them with simple scalars\nleads to information loss. Indeed, social relationships are often vague in real\nlife, and although previous research has proposed the use of fuzzy networks,\nthese are typically characterized by crisp ties. The use of weighted links does\nnot align with the original philosophy of fuzzy logic, which instead aims to\npreserve the vagueness inherent in human language and real life. For this\nreason, this paper proposes a generalization of the so-called Fuzzy Social\nNetwork Analysis (FSNA) to the context of imprecise relationships among actors.\nDealing with imprecise ties and introducing fuzziness in the definition of\nrelationships requires an extension of social network analysis, defining ties\nas fuzzy numbers instead of crisp values and extending classical centrality\nindices to fuzzy centrality indexes. The article presents the theory and\napplication of real data collected through a fascinating mouse-tracking\ntechnique to study the fuzzy relationships in a collaboration network among the\nmembers of a university department.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
