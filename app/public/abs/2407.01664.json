The precise magnitude of this\nextrapolated $T=0$ negative resistivity depends on the temperature regime from\nwhere the extrapolation is carried out, and approaches the correct physical\nresult of zero resistivity at $T=0$ only if the extrapolation starts from $T\\gg\nT_D$, where $T_D$ is the Debye temperature. We establish a theoretical\nrelationship between the negative intercept and the slope of the linear-in-$T$\nresistivity as a function of the temperature $T$ from where the extrapolation\nis carried out. Experimental implications of our finding are discussed for the\nmuch-discussed Planckian behavior of the transport scattering rate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
