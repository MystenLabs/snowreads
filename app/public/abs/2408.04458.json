Hitherto, the interplay\namong the interstellar gas on galactic scales, the propagation of AGN outflows\nand the fundamental AGN parameters during evolution remains elusive. Powerful\nnuclear outflows are found to favorably exist at early AGN stages usually\nassociated with high accretion rates and weak narrow emission lines. In a\nsample of quasars emitting Mg II narrow absorption lines (NALs) from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey, we discover an unprecedented phenomenon where galaxy-scale\ninflow-dominated transforming into outflow-dominated gas accompanied by an\nincreasing strength of the narrow [O III] line, at a confidence level of\n6.7{\\sigma}. The fact that nuclear outflows diminish while galaxy-wide outflows\nintensifies as AGNs evolve implies that early-stage outflows interact with\ninterstellar medium on galactic scales and trigger the gradual transformation\ninto galaxy-wide outflows, providing observational links to the hypothetical\nmulti-stage propagation of AGN outflows that globally regulates galaxy\nevolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
