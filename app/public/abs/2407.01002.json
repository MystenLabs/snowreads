Then, $X$\nbecomes stable and a candidate for the dark matter. The lowest mass dimension\nof interaction is six, and the type is like Higgs portal. Two types of dim-6\noperators are introduced. We consider the freeze-out dark matter scenario. With\nthe limit of null momentum transfer, a parity odd operator is free from the\ndirect detection constraints. Accordingly, the strong constraints on a parity\neven operator indicate turning on this parity odd operator to realize the dark\nmatter relic density of the universe. With the 1 TeV cut-off scale, our dark\nmatter of around 400 GeV mass can explain the dark matter relic density and is\nallowed from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment of the direct detection.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
