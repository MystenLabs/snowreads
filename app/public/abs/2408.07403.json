We provide a simple protocol on quantum measurement to generate\nan arbitrary Fock state and selected superposed Fock states from a coherent\nstate of a target resonator, without any carefully tailored external driving.\nThis conditional protocol can be efficiently constructed by a sequence of joint\nfree-evolution of the resonator and an ancillary qubit, that are coupled via a\nJaynes-Cummings interaction, and projective measurements on the qubit. By\nproperly choosing the duration of each evolution-measurement cycle and the\ninitial state of the resonator, we can generate a desired Fock state\n$|n\\rangle$ and a superposed Fock state $(|0\\rangle+|n\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$,\n$n\\sim10$, with a fidelity over $99\\%$ in less than $30$ measurements.\nMoreover, our protocol can be straightforwardly extended to the generation of a\nmulti-excitation Bell state $(|00\\rangle+|nn\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ in a\ndouble-resonator system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
