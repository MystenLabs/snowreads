The existence of global martingale solutions is proved under a\nframework that is based on the Faedo-Galerkin approximation scheme and\nstochastic compactness method, where the verification of tightness depends\ncrucially on a novel stochastic version of Lyapunov functional inequality and\nproper compactness criteria in Fr\\'{e}chet spaces. A pathwise uniqueness result\nis also established with suitable assumption on the jump noises, which\nindicates that the considered system admits a unique global strong solution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
