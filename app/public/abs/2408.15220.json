We\nhave used a hybrid approach to the nuclear EOS developed recently where the\nmatter around nuclear saturation density is described by a parametric expansion\nin terms of nuclear empirical parameters and represented in an agnostic way at\nhigher density using piecewise polytropes. We have incorporated the inputs\nprovided by the latest neutron skin measurement experiments from PREX-II and\nCREX, simultaneous mass-radius measurements of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR\nJ0740+6620, and the gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425. The main\nresults of the study show the effect of HESS J1731-347 on the nuclear\nparameters and neutron star observables. Our analysis yields the slope of\nsymmetry energy $L=45.71^{+38.18}_{-22.11}$ MeV, the radius of a $1.4 M_\\odot$\nstar, $R_{1.4}=12.18^{+0.71}_{-0.88}$ km, and the maximum mass of a static\nstar, $M_{\\rm max}= 2.14^{+0.26}_{-0.17} M_\\odot$ within $90\\%$ confidence\ninterval, respectively.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
