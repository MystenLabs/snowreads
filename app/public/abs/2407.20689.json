However, it is\nchallenging to control the QPT in few-body systems because of the limited\ncoupling strength and the A^2 terms. Here, we propose a practical scheme to\nmanipulate the QPT of quantum Rabi model in the strong-coupling regime. By\napplying a periodic frequency modulation to the two-level system in a standard\nquantum Rabi model in the strong-coupling regime, an anisotropic quantum Rabi\nmodel with ultrastrong and tunable coupling strengths for rotating and\ncounter-rotating terms is obtained. The ground-state and excitation energy of\nthis model in terms of the modulation parameters are studied. We find that the\nQPT of quantum Rabi model can be observed in the strong-coupling regime and\nexternally controlled by the modulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
