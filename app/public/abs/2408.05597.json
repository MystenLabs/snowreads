By simulating three variants of QW\nwith the conventional, symmetric, and split-step translation operators with or\nwithout classical randomness in the coin operator, we show the entanglement is\nrobust against both time- and spatially- dependent randomness, which can cause\nlocalization transitions of QW. We propose a classical quantity call overlap,\nwhich literally measures the overlap between the probability distributions of\nthe internal states, as a proxy of entanglement. The overlap captures the\ninverse behavior of the entanglement entropy in most cases, which can be\nexplained by analyzing the structure of the total wave function of the walker.\nWe test the limitation of the classical proxy by constructing a special case\nwith high population imbalance between the internal states to blind the\noverlap. Possible implications and experimental measurements are also\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
