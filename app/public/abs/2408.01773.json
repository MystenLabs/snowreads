Nonminimal coupling is\nintroduced so that it enhances friction in the axion's equation of motion and\nthus supports slow-roll inflation. This enhanced friction effectively delays\nthe activation of the gauge field, thereby preventing the overproduction of\ngravitational waves in the CMB scale. We extend previous results by describing\nthe nonminimal coupling in a general and unifying way utilizing Horndeski\ngravity. This allows us to explore systematically and comprehensively possible\nenhanced friction models of chromo-natural inflation consistent with\nobservations. We find a novel enhanced friction model that shows better\nagreement (within 1$\\sigma$) with CMB measurements than the previous\nnonminimally coupled chromo-natural inflation model. The gravitational-wave\nspectrum starts to rise at some wavenumber due to retarded activation of the\ngauge field in the late stage of inflation. We show how one can identify the\nwavenumber at which this occurs based on the background evolution and present a\nuniversal analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum that can be used\nfor any enhanced friction model of chromo-natural inflation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
