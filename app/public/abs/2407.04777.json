This population includes a subset known\nas 'Little Red Dots', characterized by their compact morphology and extremely\nred rest-frame optical colors. If all of these broad H$\\alpha$ emitters were\nattributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a\nsignificantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated\nfrom that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame\nultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of five JWST broad H$\\alpha$ emitters\nusing multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal\nsampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\\sim 400-500$~days$/(1+z)$) is\ncomparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH)\nmasses of $M_{\\text{BH}} \\sim 10^{7}~M_{\\odot}$; thus, the flux variations\nshould be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux\nvariation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\sim\n1,500-9,000$\\AA\\ has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the\nvariability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness\nconfirmed by the ultra-deep {\\it Chandra} data, indicates that, under the AGN\nscenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with\neither ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host\ngalaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission.\nAlternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission\noriginates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven\noutflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral\nhydrogen atoms.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
