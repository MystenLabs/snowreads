In our user study with game\ndevelopers (N=62), majority (67.7%) of the participants believed that\nexergames' popularity will increase if cheap alternatives of body tracking\ndevices are available. Perhaps, custom controllers can be used as an affordable\nalternate input source in exergames but the lack of hardware programming\nknowledge and shortage of experience in the embedded programming attribute to\nthe little involvement of game developers (11.3% of the participants) in the\narea of exergames. This paper presents a library for the integration of Arduino\nbased (open-source and low-cost) tailored controllers to be used as input\nsource in Unity3D (most preferred game development engine by 88.7%\nparticipants) based exergames. The interface to the library proposes a flexible\nand easy structure for programming and serve as a template application for a\nrange of exergames.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
