The CONTUR workflow is modified to account for the fraction of\nlong-lived particles which decay early enough to be reconstructed as prompt,\nmaking it possible to determine how many of signal events would be selected in\nthe Rivet routines which encapsulate the fiducial regions of dozens of\nmeasurements of Standard Model processes by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.\nNew constraints are set on several popular exotic long-lived particle models in\nthe early-decay regime, which is often poorly covered by direct searches. The\nprobed models include feebly-interacting dark matter, hidden sector models\nmediated by a heavy neutral scalar, dark photon models and a model featuring\nphoto-phobic axion-like particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"STEB62O6LXtlu0ZUuUA_3gomg6WPlb_FycihGww5SNw","pdfSize":"1022631"}
