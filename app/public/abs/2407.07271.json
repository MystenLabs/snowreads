DNA\nOrigami, the folding of a long DNA scaffold by hundreds of shorter\noligonucleotide staple strands, allows the construction of nanoscale molecular\nobjects of essentially arbitrary form, flexibility and functionality. We\ndescribe work at the intersection of these two fields and\ntheir-hopefully-bright future together.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
