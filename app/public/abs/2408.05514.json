However, the\nexisting literature on this topic is generally confined to low-dimensional\nsettings, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no established\ngoodness-of-fit tests for elliptical models that are supported by theoretical\nguarantees in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose a new goodness-of-fit\ntest for this problem, and our main result shows that the test is\nasymptotically valid when the dimension and sample size diverge proportionally.\nRemarkably, it also turns out that the asymptotic validity of the test requires\nno assumptions on the population covariance matrix. With regard to numerical\nperformance, we confirm that the empirical level of the test is close to the\nnominal level across a range of conditions, and that the test is able to\nreliably detect non-elliptical distributions. Moreover, when the proposed test\nis specialized to the problem of testing normality in high dimensions, we show\nthat it compares favorably with a state-of-the-art method, and hence, this way\nof using the proposed test is of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WNYFvo5f5GwbNWFBZXRwomL_sYfH5D2WO-sZt3eIPqU","pdfSize":"856487"}
