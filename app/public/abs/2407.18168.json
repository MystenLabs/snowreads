We first present a novel Position Error Bound (PEB) analysis\nfor the spatial parameters of multiple targets in the vicinity of the FD node,\nvia the received backscattered data signals, and devise an optimization\nframework for its metasurface-based precoder and combiner. Then, we formulate\nand solve an optimization problem aiming at the downlink sum-rate maximization,\nwhile simultaneously ensuring a minimum PEB requirement for targets'\nlocalization. Our simulation results for a sub-THz system setup validate the\njoint near-field communications and sensing capability of the proposed FD XL\nMIMO scheme with metasurfaces antennas, showcasing the interplay of its various\ndesign parameters.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
