We prove Kawaguchi-Silverman\nconjecture for $f$ and also any other surjective endomorphism of $X$: the first\ndynamical degree equals the arithmetic degree of any point with Zariski dense\norbit. This generalizes an early result of Kawaguchi and Silverman for the\npolarized $f$ case, i.e., $f^*|_{\\text{NS}(X)}$ is diagonalizable with all\neigenvalues of the same modulus greater than $1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
