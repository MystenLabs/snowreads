HCWs can benefit\nfrom a feedback system during the putting on and removal process because the\nprocess is cognitively demanding and errors are common. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) provided guidelines for correct PPE use which\nshould be followed. A real time object detection along with a unique sequencing\nalgorithms are used to identify and determine the donning and doffing process\nin real time. The purpose of this technical research is two-fold: The user gets\nreal time alert to the step they missed in the sequence if they don't follow\nthe proper procedure during donning or doffing. Secondly, the use of tiny\nmachine learning (yolov4-tiny) in embedded system architecture makes it\nfeasible and cost-effective to deploy in different healthcare settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
