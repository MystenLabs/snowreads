Over the years, several traceability heuristics have been proposed, most\nof which have been rendered ineffective with subsequent protocol upgrades.\nBetween 2019 and 2023, Monero wallet application bugs \"Differ By One\" and \"10\nBlock Decoy Bug\" have been observed and identified and discussed in the Monero\ncommunity. In addition, a decentralized mining pool named P2Pool has\nproliferated, and a controversial UTXO NFT imitation known as Mordinals has\nbeen tried for Monero. In this paper, we systematically describe the\ntraceability heuristics that have emerged from these developments, and evaluate\ntheir quality based on ground truth, and through pairwise comparisons. We also\nexplore the temporal perspective, and show which of these heuristics have been\napplicable over the past years, what fraction of decoys could be eliminated and\nwhat the remaining effective ring size is. Our findings illustrate that most of\nthe heuristics have a high precision, that the \"10 Block Decoy Bug\" and the\nCoinbase decoy identification heuristics have had the most impact between 2019\nand 2023, and that the former could be used to evaluate future heuristics, if\nthey are also applicable during that time frame.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
