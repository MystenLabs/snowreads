Here we examine the quasiperiodic $t_1-t_2$ model\nthat features a mobility edge. With the addition of nearest-neighbor\ninteractions, we demonstrate the potential existence of a MBME. Then we\ninvestigate the impact of a type of bond dissipation on the many-body system by\ncalculating the steady-state density matrix and analyzing the transport\nbehavior, and demonstrate that dissipation can cause the system to\npredominantly occupy either the thermal region or the MBL region, irrespective\nof the initial state. Finally, we discuss the effects of increasing system\nsize. Our results indicate that dissipation can induce transitions between\nthermal and MBL states, providing a new approach for experimentally determining\nthe existence of the MBME.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zpn5wxbwPcS4dw1FCb-wLYA8lObTZ-66tv2zUYwCelM","pdfSize":"573048"}
