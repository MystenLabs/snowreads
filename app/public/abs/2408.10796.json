Unfortunately, cyber\ndeception techniques are often poorly specified. Also, realistically measuring\ntheir effectiveness requires a well-exposed software system together with a\nproduction-ready implementation of these techniques. This makes rapid\nprototyping challenging. Our work translates 13 previously researched and 12\nself-defined techniques into a high-level, machine-readable specification. Our\nopen-source tool, Honeyquest, allows researchers to quickly evaluate the\nenticingness of deception techniques without implementing them. We test the\nenticingness of 25 cyber deception techniques and 19 true security risks in an\nexperiment with 47 humans. We successfully replicate the goals of previous work\nwith many consistent findings, but without a time-consuming implementation of\nthese techniques on real computer systems. We provide valuable insights for the\ndesign of enticing deception and also show that the presence of cyber deception\ncan significantly reduce the risk that adversaries will find a true security\nrisk by about 22% on average.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sTdME5elt7maxnW5W2cLtNDNRrJ0IYWmpU0QI_HCbVI","pdfSize":"1464505"}
