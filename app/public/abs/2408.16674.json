First, we consider the approximation of\nthree massless quark flavors, and then adding the running strange quark mass\ndependence. The resulting pressure displays a sizeably reduced sensitivity to\nvariations of the arbitrary renormalization scale as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art NNLO results. This confirms previous NLO investigations that\nthe RGOPT resummation scheme provides improved convergence properties and\nreduced renormalization scale uncertainties, thus being a promising\nprescription to improve perturbative QCD at high and mid range baryonic\ndensities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CQJDInrM75otLaWsZvSGIuJdusbpYMhZzoZb5BFAUSM","pdfSize":"1444765"}
