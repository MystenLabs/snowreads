Particular attention is devoted to mode conversion, wherein the\nlocal behavior of a global wave changes from one mode to another in passing\nthrough particular atmospheric layers. Exact solutions are explored where\navailable. Eikonal methods -- WKBJ and ray theory -- are described. Although\nour emphasis is on the theoretical underpinning of the subject, the solar\natmospheric heating implications of fast/slow and fast/Alfv\\'en conversions are\ndiscussed in detail.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
