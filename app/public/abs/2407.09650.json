The equation\ninvolves a divergent integral which is regularized and renormalized\nconventionally. Setting the Higgs mass to its observed value, the decay width\nis narrow and within experimental limits. The mass equation has additional\nroots on other sheets in the complex energy plane. The first two are at 186 and\n219 GeV. The lightest excitations are well defined though wider than the 125\nGeV Higgs because decays to $W^{+}W^{-}$ and $ZZ$ are allowed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
