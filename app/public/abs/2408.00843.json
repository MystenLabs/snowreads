By selecting galaxies from over 200 independent\nsight lines, the survey minimizes cosmic variance ensuring a statistically\nrobust sample of the bright-galaxy population during the epoch of reionization.\nThe data is used to constrain, for the first time, the bright end of the UVLF\nat $z=7-9$ from spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies over eight independent\nfields. We find that the bright end of the UVLF is higher than found using\nimaging over $JWST$ legacy fields, suggesting the latter may be significantly\naffected by cosmic variance, and thus reducing the tension with recent findings\nfrom $JWST$ at $z>10$ and comparable to models invoking little dust attenuation\nand bursty star formation. Additionally, we use the galaxies' $JWST$ spectra to\ninfer their stellar masses and M/L ratios relative to other $HST$ and $JWST$\nstudies. We show that the stellar mass scales almost linearly with UV\nluminosity (M$_* \\propto L_{\\rm UV}^{0.85\\pm0.12}$), albeit with large\n($\\sim0.5$ dex) intrinsic scatter, consistent with stochastic bursts of star\nformation in early galaxy formation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
