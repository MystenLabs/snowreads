Despite the advent of spectral\nanalysis tools in the past decade, the identification of spectral lines remains\na tedious task that requires extensive manual intervention, preventing us from\nfully exploiting the vast amounts of data generated by large facilities such as\nALMA. This study aims to address the aforementioned issue by developing a\nframework of automated line identification. We introduce a robust spectral\nfitting technique applicable for spectral line identification with minimal\nhuman supervision. Our method is assessed using published data from five line\nsurveys of hot cores, including W51, Orion-KL, Sgr B2(M), and Sgr B2(N). By\ncomparing the identified lines, our algorithm achieves a recall of ~ 84% - 98%.\nOur code, named Spectuner, is publicly available on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
