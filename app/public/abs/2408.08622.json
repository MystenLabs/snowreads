Inspired by both the probabilistic relaxation of DFAs and\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), our model offers interpretability\npost-training, alongside reduced complexity and enhanced training efficiency\ncompared to traditional RNNs. Moreover, by leveraging gradient-based\noptimization, our method surpasses combinatorial approaches in both scalability\nand noise resilience. Validation experiments conducted on target regular\nlanguages of varying size and complexity demonstrate that our approach is\naccurate, fast, and robust to noise in both the input symbols and the output\nlabels of training data, integrating the strengths of both logical grammar\ninduction and deep learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AYha7iB5p0oDdJw3tv7jZ2cyjSNk3t_9F77hVM1XOCc","pdfSize":"1154526"}
