For the Dead Sea Scrolls, this is\nparticularly important. However, there is an almost complete lack of\ndate-bearing manuscripts evenly distributed across the timeline and written in\nsimilar scripts available for palaeographic comparison. Here, we present Enoch,\na state-of-the-art AI-based date-prediction model, trained on the basis of new\nradiocarbon-dated samples of the scrolls. Enoch uses established\nhandwriting-style descriptors and applies Bayesian ridge regression. The\nchallenge of this study is that the number of radiocarbon-dated manuscripts is\nsmall, while current machine learning requires an abundance of training data.\nWe show that by using combined angular and allographic writing style feature\nvectors and applying Bayesian ridge regression, Enoch could predict the\nradiocarbon-based dates from style, supported by leave-one-out validation, with\nvaried MAEs of 27.9 to 30.7 years relative to the radiocarbon dating. Enoch was\nthen used to estimate the dates of 135 unseen manuscripts, revealing that 79\nper cent of the samples were considered 'realistic' upon palaeographic post-hoc\nevaluation. We present a new chronology of the scrolls. The radiocarbon ranges\nand Enoch's style-based predictions are often older than the traditionally\nassumed palaeographic estimates. In the range of 300-50 BCE, Enoch's date\nprediction provides an improved granularity. The study is in line with current\ndevelopments in multimodal machine-learning techniques, and the methods can be\nused for date prediction in other partially-dated manuscript collections. This\nresearch shows how Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach can be a\ntool for palaeographers and historians, re-dating ancient Jewish key texts and\ncontributing to current debates on Jewish and Christian origins.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
