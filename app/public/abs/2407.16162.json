This can be\ninterpreted as plants acting as actuators with a built-in power source. This\npaper presents a method to create plant robots that move and perform tasks by\nharnessing the actuation output of plants: displacement and force generated\nfrom the growing process. As the target plant, radish sprouts are employed, and\ntheir displacement and force are characterized, followed by the calculation of\npower and energy densities. Based on the characterization, two different plant\nrobots are designed and fabricated: a rotational robot and a gripper. The\nformer demonstrates ground locomotion, achieving a travel distance of 14.6 mm\nwith an average speed of 0.8 mm/h. The latter demonstrates the picking and\nplacing of an object with a 0.1-g mass by the light-controlled open-close\nmotion of plant fingers. A good agreement between the experimental and model\nvalues is observed in the specific data of the mobile robot, suggesting that\nobtaining the actuation characteristics of plants can enable the design and\nprediction of behavior in plant robots. These results pave the way for the\nrealization of novel types of environmentally friendly and sustainable robots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
