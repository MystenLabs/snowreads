In these\nlong-term forecasts, climate data is essential as it allows us to account for\nclimate change. Yet the resolution of climate models is often very coarse. In\nthis paper, we show that by including turbine locations when downscaling with\nGaussian Processes, we can generate valuable aggregate wind power predictions\ndespite the low resolution of the CMIP6 climate models. This work is a first\nstep towards multi-decadal turbine-location-aware wind power forecasting using\nglobal climate model output.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fQMR1y3YNddp-Ac6ggD0c7il9Ymn-jlCq_rYtpkgSuQ","pdfSize":"3175179"}
