We then formulate diagrammatic\ncategories, the cyclotomic Schur categories, with arbitrary parameters at\npositive integral levels. Integral bases consisting of elementary diagrams are\nobtained for affine and cyclotomic Schur categories. A second diagrammatic\nbasis, called a double SST basis, for any such cyclotomic Schur category is\nalso established, leading to a conjectural higher level RSK correspondence. We\nshow that the endomorphism algebras with the double SST bases are isomorphic to\ndegenerate cyclotomic Schur algebras with their cellular bases, providing a\nfirst diagrammatic presentation of the latter. The presentations for the affine\nand cyclotomic Schur categories are much simplified when $\\Bbbk$ is a field of\ncharacteristic zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
