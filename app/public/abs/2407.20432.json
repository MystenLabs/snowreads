In some scientific applications, the\nlikelihood must be computed by numerically solving a partial differential\nequation, which can be prohibitively expensive. We demonstrate that some such\nproblems can be made tractable by amortizing the computation with a surrogate\nlikelihood function implemented by a neural network. We show that this has two\nadditional benefits: reducing noise in the likelihood evaluations and providing\nfast gradient calculations. In experiments, the approach is applied to a model\nof heliospheric transport of galactic cosmic rays, where it enables efficient\nsampling from the posterior of latent parameters in the Parker equation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
