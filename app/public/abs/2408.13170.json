Conventional template-bank approaches\nto the search are impossible due to the prohibitive number of templates that\nwould be required. This paper continues the development of a hierarchical\nsemi-coherent stochastic search, extending it to a full end-to-end pipeline\nthat is then applied to multiple mock LISA data streams which include simulated\nnoise. Particle swarm optimization is used as a stochastic search algorithm,\ntracking multiple maxima of a semi-coherent search statistic defined over\nsource parameter space. The pipeline is accelerated by the use of graphical\nprocessing units (GPUs). No prior information from observations by ground-based\ndetectors is used; this is necessary in order to provide advance warning of the\nmerger. We find that the pipeline is able to detect sources with\nsignal-to-noise ratios as low as $\\rho\\sim 17$, we demonstrate that these\nsearches can directly seed coarse parameter estimation in cases where the\nsearch trigger is loud. An example of how the false-alarm probability can be\nestimated for this type of GW search is also included.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
