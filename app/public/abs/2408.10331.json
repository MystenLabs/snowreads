We\nanswer this question in the case where $n = 2$ and $m$ is a product of three\nprime numbers. We also explore more general questions. We find a method for\ndecomposing two $m$-sided dice into two dice of different sizes and give some\npreliminary results on relabeling two dice of different sizes. Finally, we\nrefine a result of the aforementioned authors in the case where m is a prime\npower.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
