Transient Raman\nmethods have improved the accuracy of steady-state Raman thermometry by\nremoving the need for accurate temperature calibration and laser absorption\nevaluation. However, current methods often resort to finite element analysis\n(FEA) to decipher the measured signals. This step is time-consuming and impedes\nits ubiquitous adaptation. In this work, we replace the FEA by fitting the\ntransient-state Raman signal to a three-dimensional (3D) analytical heat\ntransfer model for measuring the thermal conductivity of two bulk layered\nmaterials [i.e., molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3)\ncrystals] and the interfacial thermal conductance (h) of CVD-grown MoS2 and\nmolybdenum di-selenide (MoSe2) on quartz (SiO2). Our measured results agree\nreasonably well with literature and theoretical calculations. We also performed\na quantitative sensitivity analysis to give insights on how to improve the\nmeasurement sensitivity. Our work provides an efficient way to process the data\nof transient-based Raman thermometry for high throughput measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"mZsezSaVjESD2EeYkJ3JCGBzSAp-Dpwyq9aslm1vpng","pdfSize":"2025766"}
