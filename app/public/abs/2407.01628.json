Based on this study, we explore the convergence in $H^s$ and\n$L^{1}$ spaces for the linear and nonlinear models. This study extends\nclassical results found in the literature given for spaces with weak\ntopologies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
