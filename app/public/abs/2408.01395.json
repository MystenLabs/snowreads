Stanley (1995) gave an expansion\nformula for $X_G$ in terms of the power sum symmetric functions $p_\\lambda$\nusing the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl (2023)\ndefined the Kromatic symmetric function $\\overline{X}_G$ as a $K$-theoretic\nanalogue of $X_G$, constructed in the same way except that each vertex is\nassigned a nonempty set of colors such that adjacent vertices have\nnonoverlapping color sets. They defined a $K$-analogue $\\overline{p}_\\lambda$\nof the power sum basis and computed the first few coefficients of the\n$\\overline{p}$-expansion of $\\overline{X}_G$ for some small graphs $G$. They\nconjectured that the $\\overline{p}$-expansion always has integer coefficients\nand asked whether there is an explicit formula for these coefficients. We give\na formula for the $\\overline{p}$-expansion of $\\overline{X}_G$, and prove that\nthe coefficients are indeed always integers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
