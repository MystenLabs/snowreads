While both are\ncommonly regarded as robust methods, these concepts demonstrate a bias-variance\ntrade-off, indicating that they follow roughly converse strategies.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
