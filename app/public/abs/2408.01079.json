Simultaneously, Breen,\nHonda and Huang gave an all-dimensions proof of the Giroux Correspondence by\ngeneralising convex surface theory to higher dimensions. This paper uses a key\nresult about relations of bypasses to complete the $3$-dimensional proof for\narbitrary (not necessarily tight) contact 3-manifolds. This presentation\nfeatures low-dimensional techniques and further clarifies the relationship\nbetween contact manifolds and their Heegaard splittings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"b-MXw8G2DGXs3PhYAygukpxooxIGU4_IKVZTb8orVvE","pdfSize":"427600"}
