This setup has enabled\nthe study of superradiant decay of highly excited collective spin states of up\nto a thousand atoms, featuring unidirectional coupling mediated by the\nwaveguide mode. The complexity arising from the large, multi-excited ensemble\nand the cascaded interactions between atoms makes conventional simulation\nmethods unsuitable for predicting the correlations of superradiant emission\nbeyond the first order. To address this challenge, we developed a new\nsimulation technique based on the truncated Wigner approximation for spins. Our\nstochastic simulation tool can predict the second-order quantum coherence\nfunction, $g^{(2)}$, along with other correlators of the light field emitted by\na strongly excited cascaded system of two-level emitters. This approach thus\nprovides an effective and scalable method for analyzing cascaded quantum\nsystems with large numbers of particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
