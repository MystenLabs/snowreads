The particle (droplet) periodically\nimprints decaying waves on the liquid surface which in turn guide the particle\nmotion, resulting in a two-way coupling between the particle and its\nself-generated waves. Such WPEs have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs\nof various quantum features. In this work, we theoretically and numerically\nexplore a dynamical analog of tunneling by considering the setup of a\none-dimensional WPE incident on an isolated Gaussian potential barrier. Our\nidealized model takes the form of a perturbed Lorenz system which we use to\nexplore the dynamics and statistics of barrier crossing as a function of\ninitial conditions and system parameters. Our work highlights that velocity\nfluctuations of the WPE at high memories that are rooted in non-equilibrium\nfeatures of the Lorenz system, such as spiraling motion towards equilibrium\npoints and transient chaos, give rise to - (i) sensitivity and unpredictability\nin barrier crossing, (ii) smooth variations in transmission probability as a\nfunction of system parameters, and (iii) wave-like features in the transmitted\nand reflected probability density profiles.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
