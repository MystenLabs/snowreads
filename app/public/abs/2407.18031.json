Our results\nencompass constant-factor approximation algorithms and lower bounds in these\nmodels, as well as hardness results for the bi-criteria approximation setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"81zRqbRuxAdAPbzwkv7XkzvKRoLKznHXPWP0d4A9MYU","pdfSize":"636309","objectId":"0xeeed029ae45d1d3dceaaf6e11a7dfc7001f683daa8bffb2bd549ff56a47b6916","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
