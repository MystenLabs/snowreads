Often only single observables are accessed by\nperforming standard projective measurements. In this work, we implement a\ngeneralized measurement scheme based on controlled outcoupling of atoms. This\ngives us simultaneous access to number imbalance and relative phase in a system\nof two tunnel-coupled 1D Bose gases, which realize a quantum simulator of the\nsine-Gordon field theory. We demonstrate that our measurement is quantum\nlimited by accessing number squeezing and show that we can track Josephson\noscillation dynamics with the generalized measurements. Finally, we show that\nthe scheme allows the extraction of atoms while maintaining the system's\ncoherent dynamics, which opens up the door to accessing multi-time correlation\nfunctions. Our scheme constitutes a step towards accessing quantum properties\nof the sine-Gordon field theory and, in the future, studying spatially extended\nsystems under continuous monitoring.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
