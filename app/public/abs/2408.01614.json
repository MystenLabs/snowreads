Enhanced with\nDSM-5, PHQ-8, detailed data descriptions, and extensive training data, the\nmodel adeptly decodes nuanced linguistic indicators of mental health disorders.\nIt utilizes a dual-task framework that includes binary classification and a\nthree-stage PHQ-8 score computation involving initial assessment, detailed\nbreakdown, and independent assessment, showcasing refined analytic\ncapabilities. Validation with the DAIC-WOZ dataset reveals F1 and Macro-F1\nscores of 0.929 and 0.949, respectively, along with the lowest MAE and RMSE of\n2.89 and 3.69 in PHQ-8 scoring. These results highlight the model's precision\nand transformative potential in enhancing public mental health support,\nimproving accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and serving as a second opinion\nfor professionals.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
