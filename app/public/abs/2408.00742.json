Here, we present an iterative Monte Carlo algorithm to work out\nvery general nonlinear second-order differential equations, with Dirichlet\nboundary conditions. An example of its usage is, also, reported.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
