Let $\\pi_{1}$\nand $\\pi_{2}$ be two unitary cuspidal automorphic representations for\n$\\mathrm{GL(2)}$ that are not twist-equivalent. We find a lower bound for the\nlower Dirichlet density of the set of places for which $\\left\\lvert\na_{v}(\\pi_{1}) \\right\\rvert > \\left\\lvert a_{v}(\\pi_{2}) \\right\\rvert$, where\n$a_{v}(\\pi_{i})$ is the trace of Langlands conjugacy class of $\\pi_{i}$ at $v$.\nOne consequence of this result is an improvement on the existing bound on the\nlower Dirichlet density of the set of places for which $\\left\\lvert\na_{v}(\\pi_{1})\\right\\rvert \\neq \\left\\lvert a_{v}(\\pi_{2}) \\right\\rvert$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
