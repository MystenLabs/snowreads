The theorem is proved by extending a fundamental inequality for\nvolume forms to calibrations and proving a Caccioppoli inequality for\nquasiregular curves.\n  We also establish a qualitatively sharp removability theorem for quasiregular\ncurves whose target is a complete Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature\nbounded from above. As an application, we extend a theorem of Bonk and Heinonen\nfor quasiregular mappings to the setting of quasiregular curves: every\nnon-constant quasiregular $\\omega$-curve from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ into $( N, \\omega\n)$, where the bounded cohomology class of $\\omega$ is in the bounded K\\\"unneth\nideal, has infinite energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
