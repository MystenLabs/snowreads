This study investigates the impact of data preprocessing, with a\nspecific focus on Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), on the fairness\nand performance of probability of default models. Using a comprehensive dataset\nsourced from Kaggle, various preprocessing techniques, including SVD, were\napplied to assess their effect on model accuracy, discriminatory power, and\nfairness.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
