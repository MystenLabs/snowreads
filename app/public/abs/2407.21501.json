Early\ndetection of infection symptoms and contact tracing are playing a vital role in\ncontaining COVID-19 spread. As demonstrated by recent literature, multi-sensor\nand connected wearable devices might enable symptom detection and help tracing\ncontacts, while also acquiring useful epidemiological information. This paper\npresents the design and implementation of a fully open-source wearable platform\ncalled H-Watch. It has been designed to include several sensors for COVID-19\nearly detection, multi-radio for wireless transmission and tracking, a\nmicrocontroller for processing data on-board, and finally, an energy harvester\nto extend the battery lifetime. Experimental results demonstrated only 5.9 mW\nof average power consumption, leading to a lifetime of 9 days on a small watch\nbattery. Finally, all the hardware and the software, including a machine\nlearning on MCU toolkit, are provided open-source, allowing the research\ncommunity to build and use the H-Watch.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
