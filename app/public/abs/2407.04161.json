Here, we first recall how this\nincompatibility arises from the possibility, present in most constructive\nfoundations, to define sets by quantifying over (the exponentiation of)\nfunctional relations. This possibility is not allowed in modern formulations of\nWeyl's logical system. Then, we argue how a possible way out is offered by\nfoundations, such as the Minimalist Foundation, where exponentiation is limited\nto a primitive notion of function defined by $\\lambda$-terms as in dependent\ntype theory. The price to pay is to renounce the so-called rule of unique\nchoice identifying functional relations with $\\lambda$-terms, and to\nnumber-theoretic choice principles, characteristic of foundations aimed to\nformalize Bishop's constructive analysis. This restriction calls for a\npoint-free constructive development of topology as advocated by P. Martin-L\\\"of\nand G. Sambin with the introduction of Formal Topology. Hence, we conclude that\nthe Minimalist Foundation promises to be a natural crossroads between Bishop's\nconstructivism and Weyl's classical predicativity provided that a point-free\nreformulation of classical analysis is viable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
