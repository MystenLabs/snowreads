This\ndetection method involves combining the state of interest with a local\noscillator on an unbalanced beamsplitter, followed by direct detection and\ndigital signal processing. Intensity measurements in the case of spectrally\nengineered fields allow for the \"digital measurement\" of the phase of classical\nand quantum fields. We show that, to the first order of the local oscillator's\namplitude, KK detection is a Gaussian measurement that allows for the\nestimation of both quadratures of the electric field, similar to double\nhomodyne detection. We study in detail how KK detection operates in the case of\nbosonic coherent states, pure single-mode and mixed states, as well as the\nnature of the phase information it measures. Finally, we propose an alternative\nspectral tomography technique for single-photon states inspired by KK\ndetection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZdUtDJkyauYq8RKZCjhkm3PhfH33nRC3OBPI1aGbhKU","pdfSize":"1204859"}
