The resolvent expansion can be\nused to obtain long-time wave asymptotics for the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian\nwith multiple poles. An interesting phenomenon is that if the total flux is an\ninteger then the scattering resembles even-dimensional Euclidean scattering,\nwhile if it is half an odd integer then it resembles odd-dimensional Euclidean\nscattering. The behavior for other values of total flux thus provides an\n`interpolation' between these.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
