There has been a series of insightful findings and\nvaluable applications for various scenarios through the analysis of network\nstructures. However, in dynamic systems, slight changes in the choice of\ndynamic equations and parameters can alter the significance of motifs. The\nknown methods are insufficient to address this issue effectively. In this\npaper, we introduce a concept of perturbation energy based on the system's\nJacobian matrix, and define motif centrality for dynamic systems by seamlessly\nintegrating network topology with dynamic equations. Through simulations, we\nobserve that the key motifs obtained by the proposed energy method present\nbetter effective and accurate than them by integrating network topology\nmethods, without significantly increasing algorithm complexity. The finding of\nkey motifs can be used to apply for system control, such as formulating\ncontainment policies for the spread of epidemics and protecting fragile\necosystems. Additionally, it makes substantial contribution to a deeper\nunderstanding of concepts in physics, such as signal propagation and system's\nstability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
