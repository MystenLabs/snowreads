Data Assimilation (DA) methods\nprovide promising solutions, but their effectiveness hinges heavily on optimal\nmeasurement locations. This paper presents a novel approach for air quality\nmapping where autonomous drones, guided by a collaborative multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) framework, act as airborne detectives. Ditching\nthe limitations of static sensor networks, the drones engage in a synergistic\ninteraction, adapting their flight paths in real time to gather optimal data\nfor Data Assimilation (DA). Our approach employs a tailored reward function\nwith dynamic credit assignment, enabling drones to prioritize informative\nmeasurements without requiring unavailable ground truth data, making it\npractical for real-world deployments. Extensive experiments using a real-world\ndataset demonstrate that our solution achieves significantly improved pollution\nestimates, even with limited drone resources or limited prior knowledge of the\npollution plume. Beyond air quality, this solution unlocks possibilities for\ntackling diverse environmental challenges like wildfire detection and\nmanagement through scalable and autonomous drone cooperation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
