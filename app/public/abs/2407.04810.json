These polynomial families\ngeneralize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new\npolynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these\nfamilies are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show\nthat the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra\nanalog $\\mathsf{T}(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki\n(quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a\nconifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers\nare also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
