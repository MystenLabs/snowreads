Prompt detection of these exudates is pivotal for enabling optometrists\nto arrest or significantly decelerate the disease progression. This paper\nintroduces a novel, lightweight convolutional neural network architecture\ntailored for automated exudate detection, designed to identify these markers\nefficiently and accurately. To address the challenge of limited training data,\nwe have incorporated domain-specific data augmentations to enhance the model's\ngeneralizability. Furthermore, we applied a suite of regularization techniques\nwithin our custom architecture to boost diagnostic accuracy while optimizing\ncomputational efficiency. Remarkably, this streamlined model contains only 4.73\nmillion parameters a reduction of nearly 60% compared to the standard ResNet-18\nmodel, which has 11.69 million parameters. Despite its reduced complexity, our\nmodel achieves an impressive F1 score of 90%, demonstrating its efficacy in the\nearly detection of diabetic retinopathy through fundus imaging.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
