In\nparticular, we study the behaviour of the parametrization of modular abelian\nvarieties by Shimura curves associated to quaternion algebras $D$ over a\ntotally real field $F$, as we vary $D$. As a consequence, we obtain that on\nthese Shimura curves, the cohomological congruence module is equal to the ring\ntheoretic congruence module even in cases where we do not have multiplicity\none, thereby extending results of Manning and B\\\"ockle-Khare-Manning.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-WPMioaybarGJouSv_fvkv7yYmlU82ovrIB_o2Dnum4","pdfSize":"508968"}
