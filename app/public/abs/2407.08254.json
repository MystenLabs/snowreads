However, despite the high frequency of agent\nfailures in realistic large deployment scenarios, current approaches perform\npoorly in the presence of failures, by not converging at all, and/or by making\nvery inefficient use of resources (e.g. energy). In this work, we propose\nAttritable MCTS (A-MCTS), a decentralized MCTS algorithm capable of timely and\nefficient adaptation to changes in the set of active agents. It is based on the\nuse of a global reward function for the estimation of each agent's local\ncontribution, and regret matching for coordination. We evaluate its\neffectiveness in realistic data-harvesting problems under different scenarios.\nWe show both theoretically and experimentally that A-MCTS enables efficient\nadaptation even under high failure rates. Results suggest that, in the presence\nof frequent failures, our solution improves substantially over the best\nexisting approaches in terms of global utility and scalability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lsA3RhpxPGKof4nz-eDsX_vJ4hFnTxGrVuWIciiGPwc","pdfSize":"978990"}
