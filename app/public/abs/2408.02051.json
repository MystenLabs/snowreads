The decoupled field equations are solved via two different mimic\napproaches $\\theta_0^0 = \\rho$ and $\\theta_1^1 = p_r$ through the Karmarkar\ncondition. We conduct physical viability tests on our models and examine how\ndecoupling parameters affect the physical qualities of objects. The obtained\nmodels are compared with the observational constraints for neutron stars PSR\nJ1810+174, PSR J1959+2048, and PSR J2215+5135, including GW190814.\nParticularly, by modifying parameters $\\alpha$ and $n$, we accomplish the\noccurrence of a \"\\textit{mass gap}\" component. The resulting models exhibit\nstable, well-behaved mass profiles, regular behaviour, and no gravitational\ncollapse, as verified by the Buchdahl--Andr\\'{e}asson's limit. Furthermore, we\nprovide a thorough physical analysis that is based on two parameters: $n$\n($f(Q,T)$--coupling parameter) and $\\alpha$ (decoupling parameter). This work\nextends our current understanding of compact star configurations and sheds\nlight on the behaviour of compact objects in the $f(Q,T)$ gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
