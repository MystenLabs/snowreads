A new RC paradigm has\nrecently emerged, showcasing superior performance and delivering more\ninterpretable results with shorter training data sets and training times,\nrepresenting the next generation of RC computing. This work presents the first\nrealization of a high-speed next-generation RC system on an integrated photonic\nchip. Our experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art forecasting and\nclassification performances under various machine learning tasks and achieve\nthe fastest speeds of 60 Gbaud and a computing density of 103 tera\noperations/second/mm$^2$ (TOPS/mm$^2$). The passive system, composed of a\nsimple star coupler with on-chip delay lines, offers several advantages over\ntraditional RC systems, including no speed limitations, compact footprint,\nextremely high fabrication error tolerance, fewer metaparameters, and greater\ninterpretability. This work lays the foundation for ultrafast on-chip photonic\nRC, representing significant progress toward developing next-generation\nhigh-speed photonic computing and signal processing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
