It is a recent development of the well-established Fortran NEMESIS\nlibrary (P. G. J. Irwin et al., 2008), which has been applied to the\natmospheric retrievals of both solar system planets and exoplanets employing\nnumerous different observing geometries. NEMESISPY can be easily interfaced\nwith Bayesian inference algorithms to retrieve atmospheric properties from\nspectroscopic observations. Recently, NEMESISPY has been applied to the\nretrievals of Hubble and Spitzer data of a hot Jupiter (Yang et al., 2023), as\nwell as to JWST/Mid-Infrared Instrument (JWST/MIRI) data of a hot Jupiter (Yang\net al., 2024).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
