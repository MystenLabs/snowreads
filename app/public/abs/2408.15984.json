We show that such\nsolutions evolve uniquely on each interval of monotonicity, but branching\nnon-uniqueness may occur where jumps and monotonicity changes coincide. This\nclassification of minimizing movements solutions allows us to reduce the\nquasi-static evolution to a finite sequence of elliptic problems and establish\n$L^\\infty_tC^{1,1/2-}_x$-regularity of solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iEZv500iiXpX5vjIw4V7CXpZX5Px63umiUxzQk_M7os","pdfSize":"551981"}
