Based on the theory of SPoC, we present a new method\n(deepSPoC) that combines the interacting particle system of SPoC and deep\nlearning. Under the framework of deepSPoC, two classes of frequently used deep\nmodels include fully connected neural networks and normalizing flows are\nconsidered. For high-dimensional problems, spatial adaptive method are designed\nto further improve the accuracy and efficiency of deepSPoC. We analysis the\nconvergence of the framework of deepSPoC under some simplified conditions and\nalso provide a posterior error estimation for the algorithm. Finally, we test\nour methods on a wide range of different types of mean-field equations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
