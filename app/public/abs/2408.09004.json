First, we identify\nthree main errors that occur during the learning process: statistical error due\nto finite sample size, truncation error from finite rank approximation of the\noperator, and discretization error from handling functional data on a finite\ngrid of domain points. Finally, we analyze a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)\nbased least squares estimator, establishing both upper and lower bounds on the\naforementioned errors.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
