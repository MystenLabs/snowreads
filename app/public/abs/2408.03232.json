We demonstrate\nthat by employing different classes of localization-delocalization transition\npotentials one can significantly enhance the precision of parameter estimation.\nSpecifically, we focus on the precision measurement of the Stark strength\nparameter encoded in the ground state of a one-dimensional fermionic lattice\nunder the influence of Aubry-Andr{\\'e}-Harper (AAH) localization-delocalization\ntransition. We consider the single-particle system and the system at\nhalf-filling. Our work reveals that the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) offers\na superior scaling with respect to the system size in comparison to the pure\nstark case, leading to a better parameter estimation. However, experimentally\nmeasuring fidelity-based QFI in a many-body system poses significant\nchallenges. To address this, we suggest experimentally relevant operators that\ncan be utilized to achieve precision surpassing the Heisenberg Limit (HL) or\ncan even saturate the QFI scaling. These operators, relevant for practical\nexperimental setups, provides a feasible pathway to harness the advantages\noffered by the localization-delocalization transition by exploiting two\ndistinct localizing potentials for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
