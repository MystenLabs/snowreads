However, both the mechanisms and\ndynamics of healing remain largely unknown. Here we report an unexplored\nhealing mechanism in microtubule-motor networks by active crosslinking. We\ndirectly generate network cracks using a light-controlled microtubule-motor\nsystem, and observe that the cracks can self-heal. Combining theory and\nexperiment, we find that the networks must overcome internal elastic resistance\nin order to heal cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on\nthe initial opening angle of the crack: the crack heals below a critical angle\nand opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the\nbifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of a boundary layer where free\nmotors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby heal the crack. We\nalso formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the\ncritical angle, which is found to be tunable by two dimensionless geometric\nparameters, the ratio of the boundary layer and network width, and the aspect\nratio of the network. Our results provide a new framework for understanding\nhealing in cytoskeletal networks and designing self-healable biomaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ThEkTdITUHzkd9GH2438ivPbvcxA_oGIyOGOR6vNT8A","pdfSize":"2282041"}
