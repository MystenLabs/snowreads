The weight is a radial function increasing at\ninfinity. Our study partially follows the ideas of the paper by G.P. Galdi and\nP. Maremonti \"On the stability of steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes\nequations in the whole space\", JMFM, 25 (2023). The authors of the quoted paper\nconsider a spatial study of stability of steady fluid motions. The result hold\nin 3D and for small data. Here, relatively to the perturbations of the rest\nstate, we generalize the result. We study the nD Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem,\nn greater than 2. We prove the existence (local) of a unique regular solution.\nMoreover, the solution enjoys a spatial asymptotic decay whose order of decay\nis connected to the weight.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
