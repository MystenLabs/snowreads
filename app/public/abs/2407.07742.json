However, despite its progress, DL also\nreveals several limitations that are becoming increasingly evident. One\nsignificant issue is its lack of interpretability, which is especially critical\nfor safety-sensitive applications. Another significant consideration is that DL\nmay not comply with the constraints set by physics laws or given security\nstandards, which are essential for reliable DL. Additionally, DL models often\nstruggle outside their training data distributions, which is known as poor\ngeneralization. Moreover, there is a scarcity of theoretical guidance on\ndesigning DL algorithms. These challenges have prompted the emergence of a\nburgeoning field known as science-informed DL (ScIDL). ScIDL aims to integrate\nexisting scientific knowledge with DL techniques to develop more powerful\nalgorithms. The core objective of this article is to provide a brief tutorial\non ScIDL that illustrates its building blocks and distinguishes it from\nconventional DL. Furthermore, we discuss both recent applications of ScIDL and\npotential future research directions in the field of wireless communications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
