This approach addresses the demand for\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and seeks to overcome limitations\nimposed by model-based approaches and conservative constraints. We formulate\nour framework within the context of reinforcement learning to pave the way for\nsafety-aware agents. Nevertheless, we assert that our approach could prove\nbeneficial in various contexts, including a safety alert system or analytical\npurposes. A comprehensive examination of our framework is conducted using a\nrealistic autonomous driving simulator, illustrating its high sample efficiency\nand reliable prediction capabilities for previously unseen collision events.\nThe source code is publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
