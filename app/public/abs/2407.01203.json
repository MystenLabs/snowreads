Buan proved in [4]\nthat $F$ is closed if, and only if, $F$ has the $3\\times 3$-lemma property, a\ncertain diagrammatic property satisfied by the class of $F$-exact sequences.\nThe proof of this result relies on the theory of exact categories and on the\nFreyd--Mitchell embedding theorem, a very well-known overpowered result. In\nthis paper we provide a proof of Buan's result only by means of elementary\nmethods in abelian categories. To achieve this we survey the required theory of\nsubfunctors leading us to a self-contained exposition of this topic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jMaAloD0Ci2G58ySUt2A_3IYJhjjPjwbAdBlTuGyeQs","pdfSize":"270919"}
