Whenever one of these properties is missing, standard quantum\nthermodynamics is no longer suitable to treat the thermodynamic properties of\nthe system that result from the interaction with the environment. Using a\nrecently proposed framework for open system quantum thermodynamics which is\nvalid for arbitrary couplings and non-Markovian effects, we show that within\nthe very same model, described by a Fano-Anderson Hamiltonian, the environment\ncan take three different thermodynamic roles: a standard heat bath, exchanging\nonly heat with the system, a work reservoir, exchanging only work, and a hybrid\nenvironment, providing both types of energy exchange. The exact role of the\nenvironment is determined by the strength and structure of the coupling, and by\nits initial state. The latter also dictates the long time behaviour of the open\nsystem, leading to thermal equilibrium for an initial thermal state and to a\nnonequilibrium steady state when there are displaced environmental modes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2SuYblGASh2sFiAyMCIgzOWuASeGCSHa6lU3T-Rz91o","pdfSize":"364248","txDigest":"EUgY1mDvwkA697NoygkcJkgx6hKFenfKDVDuw1gF5vEd","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
