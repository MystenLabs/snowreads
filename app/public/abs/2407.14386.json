This\nreport studies two research papers that represent recent progress on deep\nlearning from two largely different aspects: The first paper applied the\ntransformer networks, which are typically used in language models, to improve\nthe quality of synthetic aperture radar image by effectively reducing the\nspeckle noise. The second paper presents an in-storage computing design\nsolution to enable cost-efficient and high-performance implementations of deep\nlearning recommendation systems. In addition to summarizing each paper in terms\nof motivation, key ideas and techniques, and evaluation results, this report\nalso presents thoughts and discussions about possible future research\ndirections. By carrying out in-depth study on these two representative papers\nand related references, this doctoral candidate has developed better\nunderstanding on the far-reaching impact and efficient implementation of deep\nlearning models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
