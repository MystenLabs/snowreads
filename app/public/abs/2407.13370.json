The suitability of scanning probe methods based on\natomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements is explored to investigate with high\nspatial resolution the elementary cell of 4H-SiC power MOSFETs. The\ntwo-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional maps demonstrated a high spatial\nresolution of about 5 nm using the SSRM capabilities. Furthermore, the SCM\ncapabilities enabled visualizing the fluctuations of charge carrier\nconcentration across the different parts of the MOSFETs elementary cell.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
