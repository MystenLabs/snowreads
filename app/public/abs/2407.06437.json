Less restrictive\nlimiting procedures are required so as to not severely decrease the accuracy.\n  In this paper, we develop an existing slope limiter framework, to achieve\ndifferent local boundedness principles for higher-order schemes on unstructured\nmeshes. Quadrature points contributing to numerical fluxes can be limited based\non face defined maximum principles, and the resulting cell mean at the next\ntimestep can satisfy a cell mean maximum principle but with less limiting. We\ndemonstrate the practical application of the introduced framework to a\nsecond-order finite volume scheme as well as a fourth-order finite volume\nscheme, in the context of the advection equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
