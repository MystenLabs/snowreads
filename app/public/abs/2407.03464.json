We also prove that the corresponding exponent is a\ngenerating function of the canonical transformation between pairs of Darboux\ncoordinates on the monodromy manifold of the Painlev\\'e I and $\\textrm{III}_3$\nequations, respectively. Such pairs of coordinates characterize the asymptotics\nof the tau function of the corresponding Painlev\\'e equation. We conjecture\nthat the other members of the non-polynomial hyperbolic $q$-Askey scheme yield\ngenerating functions associated to the other Painlev\\'e equations in the\nsemiclassical limit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
