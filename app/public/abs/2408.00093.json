It is shown that due to non-perturbative dynamics in the hidden sector,\n$\\phi$ develops a vacuum expectation value (vev) in the form of a mass gap\nwhich triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and dynamically\ngenerates the SM Higgs boson mass. For estimating the non-perturbatively\ngenerated mass scale, we solve the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger Equations in\nform of partial differential equations using the exact solution known via a\nnovel technique developed by Bender, Milton and Savage. We employ Jacobi\nElliptic function as exact background solution and show that the mass gap that\narises in the hidden sector can be transmuted to the EW sector, expressed in\nterms of Higgs-portal mixed quartic coupling $\\beta$ and self interaction\nquartic coupling $\\lambda_{\\phi}$ of $\\phi$. We identify the suitable parameter\nspace where the observed SM Higgs boson can be successfully generated .\nFinally, we discuss how this idea of non-perturbative EW scale generation can\nserve as a new starting point for better realistic model building in the\ncontext of resolving the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
