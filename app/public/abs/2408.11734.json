The\n\\ce{^{37}Ar} is a fast-decaying and low-energy calibration source that provides\na mono-energetic peak of 2.82 keV. Gaseous \\ce{^{37}Ar} source is injected and\nuniformly distributed in argon-(2.5${\\rm \\%}$)isobutane mixtures. Key\nperformance parameters of the detector, such as electron transmission, gain,\nenergy resolution, gain uniformity, and drift field evolution, are effectively\nand quickly calibrated. The maximum attainable gain is up to thousands at\npressures from 0.3 to 10 bar. The gain uniformity, related to the homogeneity\nof the avalanche gap of Micromegas, is calibrated quickly thanks to the\nevent-by-event position reconstruction and quasi-point energy deposition of\n\\ce{^{37}Ar}. The energy resolution is improved with the obtained gain\nuniformity map. The most noticeable improvement in energy resolution from\n44.9\\% to 35.4\\% is observed at 7 bar working pressure. The internal\ncalibration source is also used to characterize the dependence of the\ndetector's electric field distortion on the drift field. An electrostatic field\nsimulation confirms our measured dependence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
