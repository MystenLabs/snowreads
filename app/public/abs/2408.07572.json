In particular, we explain how P-variables\nare related to probability graphons in a similar way in which random variables\nare related to probability measures. We define a metric for P-variables\n(inspired by action convergence in the graph limit theory of sparse graph\nsequences) and show that convergence of P-variables in this metric is\nequivalent to probability graphons convergence. We exploit this equivalence to\ntranslate several results from the theory of probability graphons to\nP-variables. In addition, we prove several properties of P-variables\nconvergence, thus showing new properties also for probability graphons\nconvergence and demonstrating the power of the connection between probability\ngraphons and P-variables. Furthermore, we show how P-variables convergence can\nbe easily modified and generalised to cover other combinatorial structures such\nas bipartite graphs and hypergraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
