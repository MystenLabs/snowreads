While results are great in\nmany applications, the pixel level cycle consistency can potentially be\nproblematic and causes unrealistic images in certain cases. In this project, we\npropose three simple modifications to cycle consistency, and show that such an\napproach achieves better results with fewer artifacts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
