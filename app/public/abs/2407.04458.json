Existing methods tend to address it by\nlearning a common subspace representation for different modality combinations.\nHowever, we reveal that they are sub-optimal due to their implicit constraint\non intra-class representation. Specifically, the sample with different\nmodalities within the same class will be forced to learn representations in the\nsame direction. This hinders the model from capturing modality-specific\ninformation, resulting in insufficient learning. To this end, we propose a\nnovel Decoupled Multimodal Representation Network (DMRNet) to assist robust\nmultimodal learning. Specifically, DMRNet models the input from different\nmodality combinations as a probabilistic distribution instead of a fixed point\nin the latent space, and samples embeddings from the distribution for the\nprediction module to calculate the task loss. As a result, the direction\nconstraint from the loss minimization is blocked by the sampled representation.\nThis relaxes the constraint on the inference representation and enables the\nmodel to capture the specific information for different modality combinations.\nFurthermore, we introduce a hard combination regularizer to prevent DMRNet from\nunbalanced training by guiding it to pay more attention to hard modality\ncombinations. Finally, extensive experiments on multimodal classification and\nsegmentation tasks demonstrate that the proposed DMRNet outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art significantly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
