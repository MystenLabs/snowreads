The combination of\nminimum degree and the corresponding tight bound of isolated toughness variant\nfor fractional factors provide reference standards for network construction.\nHowever, previous advances only focused on how to select the optimal parameter\ncriteria from Pareto front, without any suggestion for the construction of\nspecific networks. To overcome this deficiency, this paper proposes an inverse\nmodel from $(\\delta(G),I'(G))$ to $G$, by means of evolutionary computing\napproach, we propose a novel inverse model to obtain the optimal solutions for\ncandidate graphs. The main procedure is composed of pseudo-greedy acceleration,\ncross-mutation and diversity enhancement modules. The practicality of the\nalgorithm is verified by means of pilot experiments.
