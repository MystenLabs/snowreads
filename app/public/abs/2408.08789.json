These analyses are based on proton$-$proton collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded in 2015$-$2018 with the ATLAS detector at the Large\nHadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$.\nThe $T$-quark decay modes considered in this combination are into a top quark\nand either a Standard Model Higgs boson or a $Z$ boson ($T \\to Ht$ and $T \\to\nZt$). The individual searches used in the combination are differentiated by the\nnumber of leptons ($e$, $\\mu$) in the final state. The observed data are found\nto be in good agreement with the Standard Model background prediction.\nInterpretations are provided for a range of masses and couplings of the\nvector-like top quark for benchmark models and generalized representations in\nterms of 95% confidence level limits. For a benchmark signal prediction of a\nvector-like top quark SU2 singlet with electroweak coupling, $\\kappa$, of 0.5,\nmasses below 2.1 TeV are excluded, resulting in the most restrictive limits to\ndate.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
