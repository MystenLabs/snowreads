We introduce martingales via a class of functions\nthat are concave with respect to the scale function and similar to the\ndensities of quasi-stationary distributions. The conditioning is formulated\nthrough the exit times of the martingale, and its existence is shown. We\ninvestigate its relation to the Yaglom limit and the absolute continuity\nrelations of the limit processes at time infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
