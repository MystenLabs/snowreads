The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime\nto a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric\ninduced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative\nentropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter\nfields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein\nequations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively\nscalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended\nin different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and\ngauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new\ninsights into quantum gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
