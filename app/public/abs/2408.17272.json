The function defined\nby $f_u(x)=ux^{d_{1}}+x^{d_{2}}$ is called the generalized Ness-Helleseth\nfunction over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $u\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. It was\ninitially studied by Ness and Helleseth in the ternary case. In this paper, for\n$p^n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ and $p^n \\ge7$, we provide the necessary and sufficient\ncondition for $f_u(x)$ to be an APN function. In addition, for each $u$\nsatisfying $\\chi(u+1) = \\chi(u-1)$, the differential spectrum of $f_u(x)$ is\ninvestigated, and it is expressed in terms of some quadratic character sums of\ncubic polynomials, where $\\chi(\\cdot)$ denotes the quadratic character of\n$\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
