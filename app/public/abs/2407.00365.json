Among these\ntechnologies, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial\npotential to transform financial services by automating complex tasks,\nenhancing customer service, and providing detailed financial analysis. Firstly,\nwe introduce IDEA-FinBench, an evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for\nassessing financial knowledge in large language models (LLMs). This benchmark\nutilizes questions from two globally respected and authoritative financial\nprofessional exams, aimimg to comprehensively evaluate the capability of LLMs\nto directly address exam questions pertinent to the finance sector. Secondly,\nwe propose IDEA-FinKER, a Financial Knowledge Enhancement framework designed to\nfacilitate the rapid adaptation of general LLMs to the financial domain,\nintroducing a retrieval-based few-shot learning method for real-time\ncontext-level knowledge injection, and a set of high-quality financial\nknowledge instructions for fine-tuning any general LLM. Finally, we present\nIDEA-FinQA, a financial question-answering system powered by LLMs. This system\nis structured around a scheme of real-time knowledge injection and factual\nenhancement using external knowledge. IDEA-FinQA is comprised of three main\nmodules: the data collector, the data querying module, and LLM-based agents\ntasked with specific functions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
