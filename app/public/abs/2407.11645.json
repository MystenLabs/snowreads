We investigate the dissociation rates of red cell aggregates in\nextensional flow using hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis\nby a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our findings reveal that aggregate\ndissociation increases sharply when a critical extension rate is reached which\nfalls within the range of microcirculatory conditions, suggesting that large\nvariations of aggregate sizes should be expected in-vivo. This work contributes\nto a deeper understanding of the behavior of red blood cell aggregates in\nresponse to extensional stress in microcirculatory networks, provides crucial\nexperimental data to validate theoretical and numerical models, and constitutes\nthe basis for improved evaluation of blood aggregability in clinical contexts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"grGuEDVv0aL-plS84KdeLMCq_UoK-BRttwYL7KkhRo0","pdfSize":"3037888","objectId":"0x004962e2b64971404fd9faf7a1c261f6888627c7c32080ad13983b44f516101c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
