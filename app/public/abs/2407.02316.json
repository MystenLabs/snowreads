{"id":"2407.02316","title":"Finding automorphism groups of double coset graphs and Cayley graphs are\n  equivalent","authors":"Rachel Barber and Ted Dobson","authorsParsed":[["Barber","Rachel",""],["Dobson","Ted",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2024 14:49:28 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-03","timestamp":1719931768000,"abstract":"  It has long been known that a vertex-transitive graph $\\Gamma$ is isomorphic\nto a double coset graph $\\text{Cos}(G,H,S)$ of a transitive group\n$G\\le\\text{Aut}(\\Gamma)$, a vertex stabilizer $H\\le G$, and some subset\n$S\\subseteq G$. We show that the automorphism group of the Cayley graph\n$\\text{Cay}(G,S)$ with connection set $S$ can be obtained from the automorphism\ngroup of $\\text{Cos}(G,H,S)$ and vice versa. We also show that the isomorphism\nproblem for double coset graphs is equivalent to the isomorphism problem for\nCayley graphs provided one knows all groups $G$ for which a fixed Cayley graph\nis a Cayley graph of $G$. Our main tool is a \"recognition theorem\", which\nrecognizes when a Cayley graph of a group $G$ is a wreath product of two graphs\nbased upon its connection set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
