Constructing LLM-based agents\nis considered to be one of the most effective tools to achieve this goal.\nAgent, as a kind of human-like intelligent entity with the ability of\nperception, planning, decision-making, and action, has created great production\nvalue in many fields. However, the bridge O\\&M field shows a relatively low\nlevel of intelligence compared to other industries. Nevertheless, the bridge\nO\\&M field has developed numerous intelligent inspection devices, machine\nlearning algorithms, and autonomous evaluation and decision-making methods,\nwhich provide a feasible basis for breakthroughs in artificial intelligence in\nthis field. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of AI bodies based\non large-scale language models on the field of bridge O\\&M and to analyze the\npotential challenges and opportunities it brings to the core tasks of bridge\nO\\&M. Through in-depth research and analysis, this paper expects to provide a\nmore comprehensive perspective for understanding the application of\nintelligentsia in this field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
