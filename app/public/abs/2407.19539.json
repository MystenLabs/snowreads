Among other results,\nwe prove the following curious result for a finite Blaschke product: $$B(z)=e\n^{is}\\prod_{k=1}^d \\frac{z-a_k}{1-z \\overline{a_k}}.$$ The Lebesgue measure of\nthe sublevel set of $B$ satisfies the following sharp inequality for $t \\in\n[0,1]$: $$|\\{z\\in \\mathbb{D}:|B(z)|<t\\}|\\le \\pi t^{2/d},$$ with equality at a\nsingle point $t\\in(0,1)$ if and only if $a_k=0$ for every $k$. In that case the\nequality is attained for every $t$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
