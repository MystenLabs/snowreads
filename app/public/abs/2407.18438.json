In particular, the only spin ancient Ricci flows\nwith groups at infinity in $SU(2)$ and mild decay at infinity are hyperk\\\"ahler\nALE metrics. The main idea of the proof, of independent interest, consists in\nshowing that the large-scale behavior of Perelman's $\\mu$-functional on any ALE\norbifold with non-negative scalar curvature is controlled by a renormalized\n$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{ALE}}$-functional related to a notion of weighted mass.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
