First, a generalized dynamic model\nwas formulated, which takes into account the inherent properties of such a\nmechanical system. This includes rigid-body dynamics, coupling matrix, joint\nviscoelasticity, and tendon friction. Then, we propose a methodology comprising\na series of experiments, for step-wise identification and validation of this\ndynamic model. Moreover, an experimental setup was designed and constructed\nthat features actuation modules and peripheral sensors to facilitate the\nidentification process. To verify the proposed methodology, a 3D-printed\nrobotic finger based on the index finger design of the Dexmart hand was\ndeveloped, and the proposed experiments were executed to identify and validate\nits dynamic model. This study could be extended to explore the identification\nof cadaver hands, aiming for a consistent dataset from a single cadaver\nspecimen to improve the development of musculoskeletal hand models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JPn87OKHX14wxyqpmkvL1Zs50L1o6JXijAtViBuZfe4","pdfSize":"3303197"}
