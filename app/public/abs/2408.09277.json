Our chatbot is\ndesigned to handle the specificities of CI/CD documents at Ericsson, employing\na retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model to enhance accuracy and relevance.\nOur empirical evaluation of the chatbot on industrial CI/CD-related questions\nindicates that an ensemble retriever, combining BM25 and embedding retrievers,\nyields the best performance. When evaluated against a ground truth of 72 CI/CD\nquestions and answers at Ericsson, our most accurate chatbot configuration\nprovides fully correct answers for 61.11% of the questions, partially correct\nanswers for 26.39%, and incorrect answers for 12.50%. Through an error analysis\nof the partially correct and incorrect answers, we discuss the underlying\ncauses of inaccuracies and provide insights for further refinement. We also\nreflect on lessons learned and suggest future directions for further improving\nour chatbot's accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
