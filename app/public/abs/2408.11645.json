We show that these groups can\nbe naturally divided into three types. The first type consists of finite\nabelian groups that are products of two groups that belong to the Cremona group\nof rank 1 and 2, respectively; the second type consists of cyclic extensions of\nfinite abelian groups acting on a K3 surface; the third type consists of groups\nthat act on terminal Fano threefolds with empty anti-canonical linear system.\nWe also establish a boundedness result for the groups of the second type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
