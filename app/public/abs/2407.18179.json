Both of these geometries are\ndescribed by the two-dimensional low-energy effective action of string theory\nand are related to each other by scale-factor duality. Secondly, we demonstrate\nthat these near-horizon/singuglarity geometries, including complete\n$\\alpha^{\\prime}$ corrections, can be described by the two-dimensional\nHohm-Zwiebach action. This approach allows for the derivation of\nnon-perturbative and non-singular solutions. Furthermore, the Hohm-Zwiebach\naction provides a systematic way to investigate the $\\alpha^{\\prime}$-corrected\nnear-horizon/singularity geometries of different kinds of black holes, which\nare difficult to achieve through the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model method.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
