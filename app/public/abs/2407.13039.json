The solid is modeled as a collection of randomly\ndistributed particles connected by harmonic springs with strengths that depend\non the interparticle distances, i.e the Euclidean random matrix model of Mezard\net al. [Nucl. Phys. 559B, 689 (1999)]. The derivation of the theory combines\ntwo exact projection operator steps and a factorization approximation. Within\nour approach the square of the speed of sound is non-negative. The unjamming\ntransition manifests itself through vanishing of the speed of sound.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
