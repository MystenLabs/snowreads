Concentrating on left $R$-modules we show, among\nother things, that the free module of infinite rank $R^{(\\kappa)}$ embeds every\n$\\kappa$-generated flat left $R$-module iff $R$ is left perfect. Using a Bass\nmodule corresponding to a descending chain of principal right ideals, we\nconstruct a model of the theory $T$ of $R^{(\\kappa)}$ whose projectivity is\nequivalent to left perfectness, which allows to add a \"stronger\" equivalent\ncondition: $R^{(\\kappa)}$ embeds every $\\kappa$-generated flat left $R$-module\nwhich is a model of $T$.\n  In addition, we extend the model-theoretic construction of this Bass module\nto arbitrary descending chains of pp formulas, resulting in a `Bass theory' of\npure-projective modules. We put this new theory to use by reproving an old\nresult of Daniel Simson about pure-semisimple rings and Mittag-Leffler modules.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
