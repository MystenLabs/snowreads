In this paper we present an\nanalytical study of the propagation of local errors in this method, and show\nthat the global order of RK3GL2 is expected to be four.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
