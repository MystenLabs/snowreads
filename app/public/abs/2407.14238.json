I argue that Univalent\nFoundations (UF), which feature the axiom that all isomorphic structures are\nidentical, offer such a foundation and are more attractive than other proposed\nstructuralist frameworks. Furthermore, I delve into the significance in the\ncase of the hole argument and, very briefly, the nature of symmetries.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
