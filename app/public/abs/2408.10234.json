The information throughput of a human being is about 10 bits/s. In\ncomparison, our sensory systems gather data at an enormous rate, no less than 1\ngigabits/s. The stark contrast between these numbers remains unexplained.\nResolving this paradox should teach us something fundamental about brain\nfunction: What neural substrate sets this low speed limit on the pace of our\nexistence? Why does the brain need billions of neurons to deal with 10 bits/s?\nWhy can we only think about one thing at a time? We consider plausible\nexplanations for the conundrum and propose new research directions to address\nthe paradox between fast neurons and slow behavior.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
