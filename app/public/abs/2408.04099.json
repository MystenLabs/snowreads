This approach makes use of a lightweight open-source\nsoftware library we developed known as CLDERA-Tools. We describe how\nCLDERA-Tools is linked with the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale\nEarth System Model (E3SM) in a minimally invasive way for in-situ extraction of\nquantities of interested and associated statistics. Subsequently, these\nquantities are used to represent source-impact pathways with time-dependent\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs). The utility of CLDERA-Tools is demonstrated by\nusing the data it extracts in-situ to compute a spatially resolved DAG from an\nidealized configuration of the atmosphere with a parameterized representation\nof a volcanic eruption known as HSW-V.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
