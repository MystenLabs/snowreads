Transcorrelation introduces explicit electron correlation in the\nelectronic Hamiltonian through similarity transformation with a correlation\nfactor. Due to this transformation, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian includes up\nto three-body couplings and becomes non-hermitian. Since conventional coupled\ncluster is solved by projection, it is well suited to harbor non-hermitian\nHamiltonians. The arising three-body operator, however, creates a huge memory\nbottleneck and increases the runtime scaling of the coupled cluster equations.\nAs it has been shown that the three-body operator can be approximated, by\nexpressing the Hamiltonian in the normal-ordered form, we investigate this\napproximation for the perturbative triples correction. Results are compared\nwith code-generation based transcorrelated coupled cluster up to quadruple\nexcitations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
