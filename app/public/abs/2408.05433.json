Via the CI spectrum induced by consistent invertibility property of\noperators, we explore property ($UW${\\scriptsize \\it{E}}) for $T$ and $T^\\ast$\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, the transfer of property ($UW${\\scriptsize\n\\it{E}}) from $T$ to $f(T)$ and $f(T^{\\ast})$ is obtained, where $f$ is a\nfunction which is analytic in a neighborhood of the spectrum of $T$. At last,\nwith the help of the so-called $(A,B)$ entanglement stable spectra, the\nentanglement stability of property ($UW${\\scriptsize \\it{E}}) for $2\\times 2$\nupper triangular operator matrices is investigated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
