A widely\nused simplification is the linearized DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem,\nwhich can be solved to global optimality, but whose optimal solution is always\ninfeasible in the original AC-OPF problem. Recently, neural networks (NN) have\nbeen introduced for solving the AC-OPF problem at significantly faster\ncomputation times. However, these methods necessitate extensive datasets, are\ndifficult to train, and are often viewed as black boxes, leading to resistance\nfrom operators who prefer more transparent and interpretable solutions. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel learning-based approach that merges simplicity and\ninterpretability, providing a bridge between traditional approximation methods\nand black-box learning techniques. Our approach not only provides transparency\nfor operators but also achieves competitive accuracy. Numerical results across\nvarious power networks demonstrate that our method provides accuracy comparable\nto, and often surpassing, that of neural networks, particularly when training\ndatasets are limited.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
