It is well-known that Tao and Vu (Ann Probab 38: 2023-2065,\n2010) resolved the circular law conjecture, establishing that if the $x_{ij}$'s\nare independent and identically distributed random variables with zero mean and\nunit variance, the empirical spectral distribution of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}{\\bf\nX}_n$ converges almost surely to the uniform distribution over the unit disk in\nthe complex plane as $n \\to \\infty$. This paper demonstrates that the circular\nlaw still holds under the more general Lindeberg's condition: $$\n\\frac1{n^2}\\sum_{i,j=1}^n\\mathbb{E}|x_{ij}^2|I(|x_{ij}|>\\eta\\sqrt{n})\\to\n0,\\mbox{as $n \\to \\infty$}. $$\n  This paper is a revisit of the proof procedure of the circular law by Bai in\n(Ann Probab 25: 494-529, 1997). The key breakthroughs in the paper are\nestablishing a general strong law of large numbers under Lindeberg's condition\nand the uniform upper bound for the integral with respect to the smallest\neigenvalues of random matrices. These advancements significantly streamline and\nclarify the proof of the circular law, offering a more direct and simplified\napproach than other existing methodologies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"WZUkH3Pw8_8t31AhF04T_IG2X920Nwotfp5BGUIhZnI","pdfSize":"163240"}
