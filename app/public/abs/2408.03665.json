A\nstrengthened version of the question asks whether there exists a quantum\nbehavior that exhibits maximum non-locality but zero certifiable randomness for\nany arbitrary input. In this paper, we present an affirmative answer to both\nquestions by constructing families of $n$-player non-local games for $n \\geq 2$\nand families of non-local behaviors on the quantum boundary that do not allow\nto certify any randomness against a classical adversary. Our results show the\nexistence of a form of bound randomness against classical adversaries,\nhighlighting that device-independent randomness and quantum non-locality can be\nmaximally inequivalent resources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
