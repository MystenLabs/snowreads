To be able to predict the driver activity, a Deep\nLearning network needs to be trained on a dataset. However, the use of datasets\nbased on simulation for training and the migration to real-world data for\nprediction has proven to be suboptimal. Hence, this paper presents a real-world\ndriver activity dataset, openly accessible on IEEE Dataport, which encompasses\nvarious activities that occur in autonomous driving scenarios under various\nillumination and weather conditions. Results from the training process showed\nthat the dataset provides an excellent benchmark for implementing models for\ndriver activity recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
