Under a mild extra uniformity\ncondition, we prove that Borel amenability of bounded degree Borel graphs is\nequivalent to a randomized version of hyperfiniteness. Our new approach yields\nsimple proofs and generalizations for the Ornstein-Weiss theorem, the\nQuasi-Tiling theorem and the Connes-Feldman-Weiss theorem. One result is that\nthe main conjecture holds up to a compressible set (that is, a set that admits\nno invariant probability measure).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
