In a recent breakthrough, Cheung and Chevallier (Annales scientifiques\nde l'ENS, 2024) extended this theorem to higher dimensions. In this paper, we\nconsider multiple generalizations of the definition of the best approximates of\na matrix and prove analogues of the L\\'{e}vy-Khintchine theorem for all these\ngeneralizations. A special case of our theorem answers a question posed by\nCheung and Chevallier about L\\'{e}vy-Khintchine type theorems for arbitrary\nnorms. Another notable instance of our results resolves a conjecture of Yitwah\nCheung. While our findings are new for higher dimensions, even in the\none-dimensional case our work is a significant improvement over available\nresults. Notably, we extend the results of Cheung and Chevallier by proving\ntheir theorems for any Birkhoff generic point and by permitting the best\napproximates to satisfy additional geometric and arithmetic conditions.\nMoreover, our main theorem, from which the above results follow, also extends\nthe recent work of Shapira and Weiss.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
