The effective\ndegrees of freedom are the mesons (sigma and pions), quarks and diquarks. Some\nof the parameters of the model can be determined by expressing them in terms of\nthe vacuum meson masses and pion decay constant using the on-shell\nrenormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are considered free, although\nthey in principle can be calculated from QCD. The thermodynamic potential is\ncalculated in a mean-field approximation taking only quark loops into account.\nIn this approximation, we derive a set of renormalization group equations for\nthe running masses and couplings. The solutions to these equations are used to\nimprove the thermodynamic potential $\\Omega$ and thereby thermodynamic\nquantities. Four parameter sets are chosen and the phase diagram in the\n$\\bar{\\mu}$--$T$ (with $\\bar{\\mu}={1\\over3}\\mu_B$) plane is obtained. We also\ncalculate the speed of sound $c_s$ as a function of $\\bar{\\mu}$ at vanishing\ntemperature. For large values of $\\bar{\\mu}$, the speed of sound approaches the\nconformal limit $c_s={1\\over\\sqrt{3}}$ from above, in disagreement with\nperturbative calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C14j6r24unBESVfaOCESWdvG4mnJ5jc-dzJb59WqUjs","pdfSize":"1163627"}
