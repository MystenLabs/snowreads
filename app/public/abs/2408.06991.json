In particular, we look at the problem\nof kink-antikink collisions and analyze the windows of capture and escape of\nthe soliton pair as a function of collision velocity and model mass. We observe\na disappearance of the capture cases for intermediary masses between the\n$\\phi^4$ and non-analytic cases. The main features of the kink-antikink\nscattering are reproduced in a collective coordinates model, including the\ndisappearance of the capture cases.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
