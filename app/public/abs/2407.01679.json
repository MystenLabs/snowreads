We present new NOEMA observations of CS $5-4$, SO $7_6-6_5$ and\n$5_6-4_5$, C$_2$H $N=3-2$, HCN $3-2$, HCO$^+$ $3-2$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ $3-2$\nin the DR Tau protoplanetary disk at a resolution of $\\sim0.4''$ (80 au).\nEstimates for the disk-averaged CS/SO ratio range from $\\sim0.4-0.5$, the\nlowest value reported thus far for a T Tauri disk. At a projected separation of\n$\\sim180$ au northeast of the star, the SO moment maps exhibit a clump that has\nno counterpart in the other lines, and the CS/SO value decreases to $<0.2$ at\nits location. Thermochemical models calculated with DALI indicate that DR Tau's\nlow CS/SO ratio and faint C$_2$H emission can be explained by a gas-phase C/O\nratio that is $<1$ at the disk radii traced by NOEMA. Comparisons of DR Tau's\nSO emission to maps of extended structures traced by $^{13}$CO suggest that\nlate infall may contribute to driving down the gas-phase C/O ratio of its disk.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
