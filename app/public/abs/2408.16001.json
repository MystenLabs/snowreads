We analyze stability by studying the\nlinearized system and demonstrate the existence of an exponentially stable\ninvariant manifold. Our focus is on the equilibrium stability under\nsynchronization. We provide a comprehensive analysis of both linear and\nnonlinear cases of the system. Additionally, we prove the existence of stable\nlimit cycles and establish a relation between the dynamics in linear and\nnonlinear frameworks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
