This can\nbe formulated as a hypothesis testing problem where the null hypothesis\ncorresponds to a preferential attachment model with a constant affine\nattachment parameter $\\delta_0$ and the alternative corresponds to a\npreferential attachment model where the affine attachment parameter changes\nfrom $\\delta_0$ to $\\delta_1$ at a time $\\tau_n = n - \\Delta_n$ where $0\\leq\n\\Delta_n \\leq n$ and $n$ is the size of the graph. It was conjectured in Bet et\nal. that when observing only the unlabeled graph, detection of the change is\nnot possible for $\\Delta_n = o(n^{1/2})$. In this work, we make a step towards\nproving the conjecture by proving the impossibility of detecting the change\nwhen $\\Delta_n = o(n^{1/3})$. We also study change-point detection in the case\nwhere the labeled graph is observed and show that change-point detection is\npossible if and only if $\\Delta_n \\to \\infty$, thereby exhibiting a strong\ndifference between the two settings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
