The amplitudes are then written in terms of a\nsingle proper-time integral. The above-mentioned series representation\nterminates when considering a constant crossed field. This allows us to obtain\neven more compact expressions for these particular amplitudes for which the\nresult of the proper-time integral, for fixed parameters, takes the form of a\nfactorial function. In addition, we derive all helicity components of these\namplitudes and express them explicitly in terms of Bernoulli numbers and spinor\nproducts.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
