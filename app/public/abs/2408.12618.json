In analyzing the EADB-UKBB\ndataset to identify genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD),\nhowever, we recognize that both existing marginal association tests and\nconditional independence tests using knockoffs suffer either power loss or lack\nof informativeness, especially when strong correlations exist among variants.\nTo address the limitations of existing knockoff filters, we propose a new\nfeature-versus-group (FVG) filter that is more powerful and precise in\nidentifying important features from a set of strongly correlated features using\ngroup knockoffs. In extensive simulation studies, the FVG filter controls the\nexpected proportion of false discoveries and identifies important features with\nenhanced power and greater precision. Applying the proposed method to the\nEADB-UKBB dataset, we discover important variants from 84 loci (same as the\nmost powerful group knockoff filter) with catching sets of substantially\nsmaller size and higher purity.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
