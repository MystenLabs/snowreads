The wave vector dependence of this spin-orbit coupling can\nvary across materials, exhibiting linear, cubic, or a combination of both\nforms. Notably, cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling induces a distinct triple spin\nwinding on the Fermi surface, differentiating it from linear Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling. In this Letter, we investigate the potential for two-dimensional\ntopological superconductivity in an interacting bilayer Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupled system with local inversion symmetry breaking. We discover an\nintriguing interplay between the unique spin texture induced by cubic Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling and odd-parity Cooper pairing mechanisms. This interplay\nleads to a mirror symmetry-protected topological crystalline superconductor\nhosting three pairs of Majorana edge modes associated with an effective helical\n$f$-wave Cooper pairing. The bulk topology of the helical $f$-wave\nsuperconductor is characterized by a mirror Chern number $n_M=3$, which remains\nstable even in the presence of coexisting linear and cubic Rashba spin-orbit\ncouplings. Our work not only proposes an approach to engineering topological\nmirror superconductors but also uncovers a pathway to realizing rare helical\n$f$-wave pairing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vU-YJHGicT0TAEm_EwTJ1GCx2uNoQW2JPRLmP5N_5gs","pdfSize":"862064"}
