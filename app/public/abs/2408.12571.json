While new types of attacks are regularly developed\nin the literature, they rarely involve the use of weak continuous measurement.\nHere, we design a new attack scheme that exploits continuous measurement\ntogether with the powerful pattern recognition capacities of deep recurrent\nneural networks fed by the measurement. We show that, when applied to the BB84\nprotocol, our attack can be difficult to notice while still allowing the spy to\nextract significant information about the states of the qubits sent in the\nquantum communication channel. Finally, we study how the spy can exploit\nquantum feedback based on the measurement to further cover their tracks. Our\nattack scheme, while still at the early stages of a toy model, constitutes a\npotential threat which is worthwhile to be investigated, as it could also be\napplied to different QKD protocols and generalized in many different ways.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BXcXPdgXb--zmUfDeSv_0syAdQgDLW9wM28AP59vnh8","pdfSize":"1550998"}
