When we say \"heavy\", we mean a\nparticle with a mass density that approaches infinity at an appropriate rate as\nits radius vanishes. We show that the collective effect of heavy particles on\nthe fluid motion is similar to the Brinkman perturbation of the Navier-Stokes\nsystem identified in the homogenization process.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
