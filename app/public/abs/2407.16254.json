Variable autonomy solves two main problems in\nrobotic planning: the first is the problem of humans being unable to keep focus\nin monitoring and intervening during robotic tasks without appropriate human\nfactor indicators, and the second is achieving mission success in unforeseen\nand uncertain environments in the face of static reward structures. An open\nproblem in variable autonomy is developing robust methods to dynamically\nbalance autonomy and human intervention in real-time, ensuring optimal\nperformance and safety in unpredictable and evolving environments. We posit\nthat addressing unpredictable and evolving environments through an addition of\nrule-based symbolic logic has the potential to make autonomy adjustments more\ncontextually reliable and adding feedback to reinforcement learning through\ndata from mixed-initiative control further increases efficacy and safety of\nautonomous behaviour.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
