The closure applies to a\nliquid of neutral polymers at melt densities. It can be considered a molecular\ngeneralization of the mean spherical approximation (MSA) closure of Lebowitz\nand Percus to the atomic Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation, and is similar in some\naspects to the reference \"molecular\" MSA (R-MMSA) closure of Schweizer and\nYethiraj to PRISM. For a model binary blend of freely-jointed chains, the new\nclosure predicts an unmixing critical temperature, Tc, via the susceptibility\nroute that scales linearly with molecular weight, N, in agreement with Flory\ntheory. Predictions for Tc of the new closure differ greatest from those of the\nR-MMSA at intermediate N, the latter being about 40% higher than the former\nthere, but asymptotically at large N both theories give about the same values.\nFor an isotopic blend of polyethylene, the new and R-MMSA closures predict a Tc\nabout 25% higher than the experimental value, which is only moderately less\naccurate than the prediction of atomic OZ-MSA theory for Tc of methane. In this\nway, the derivation and its consequences help to identify the ingredients in a\ntheory needed to model properly the equilibrium properties of a polymeric\nliquid at both short and long lengthscales.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
