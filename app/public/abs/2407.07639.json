While this task has been intensively approached from heuristics to\ngraph embeddings and graph neural networks (GNNs), providing explanations for\nsimilarity has received less attention. In this work we are concerned with\nexplainable similarity search over graphs, by investigating how GNN-based\nmethods for computing node similarities can be augmented with explanations.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the performance of two prominent approaches towards\nexplanations in GNNs, based on the concepts of mutual information (MI), and\ngradient-based explanations (GB). We discuss their suitability and empirically\nvalidate the properties of their explanations over different popular graph\nbenchmarks. We find that unlike MI explanations, gradient-based explanations\nhave three desirable properties. First, they are actionable: selecting inputs\ndepending on them results in predictable changes in similarity scores. Second,\nthey are consistent: the effect of selecting certain inputs overlaps very\nlittle with the effect of discarding them. Third, they can be pruned\nsignificantly to obtain sparse explanations that retain the effect on\nsimilarity scores.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MfykteAWt4O-z9gWm-CQZHz2ODchxH3LtDuCacY7OUI","pdfSize":"8362910"}
