In this paper, we\nstudy an L*-style learning algorithm for weighted automata over the max-plus\nsemiring. The max-plus setting exposes a \"consistency\" issue in the previously\nstudied semiring-generic extension of L*: we show that it can fail to maintain\nconsistency of tables, and can thus make equivalence queries on obviously wrong\nhypothesis automata. We present a theoretical fix by a mathematically clean\nnotion of column-closedness. We also present a nontrivial and reasonably broad\nclass of weighted languages over the max-plus semiring in which our algorithm\nterminates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
