This goal presents many\nchallenges across multiple planning spaces including but not limited to how to\nplan EV routes. In this paper, we address the problem of predicting energy\nconsumption of EVs for Last-Mile delivery routes using deep learning. We\ndemonstrate the need to move away from thinking about range and we propose\nusing energy as the basic unit of analysis. We share a range of deep learning\nsolutions, beginning with a Feed Forward Neural Network (NN) and Recurrent\nNeural Network (RNN) and demonstrate significant accuracy improvements relative\nto pure physics-based and distance-based approaches. Finally, we present Route\nEnergy Transformer (RET) a decoder-only Transformer model sized according to\nChinchilla scaling laws. RET yields a +217 Basis Points (bps) improvement in\nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) relative to the Feed Forward NN and a\n+105 bps improvement relative to the RNN.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
