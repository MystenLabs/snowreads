By measuring devices with increasing characteristic\nsize, we observed the disappearance of the current vortex and thus verify a\nprediction of the hydrodynamic model. We further observed that vortex flow is\npresent for both hole- and electron-dominated transport regimes, while\ndisappearing in the ambipolar regime. We attribute this effect to a reduction\nof the vorticity diffusion length near charge neutrality. Our work showcases\nthe power of local imaging techniques for unveiling exotic mesoscopic transport\nphenomena.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
