A well-performed blockchain sharding\nsystem requires both high performance and high security in both intra- and\ncross-shard perspectives. However, existing protocols either have issues on\nprotecting security or trade off great performance for security. In this paper,\nwe propose SP-Chain, a blockchain sharding system with enhanced Security and\nPerformance for both intra- and cross-shard perspectives. For intra-shard\naspect, we design a two-phase concurrent voting scheme to provide high system\nthroughput and low transaction confirmation latency. Moreover, we propose an\nefficient unbiased leader rotation scheme to ensure high performance under\nmalicious behavior. For cross-shard aspect, a proof-assisted efficient\ncross-shard transaction processing mechanism is proposed to guard the\ncross-shard transactions with low overhead. We implement SP-Chain based on\nHarmony, and evaluate its performance via large-scale deployment. Extensive\nevaluations suggest that SP-Chain can process more than 10,000 tx/sec under\nmalicious behaviors with a confirmation latency of 7.6s in a network of 4,000\nnodes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
