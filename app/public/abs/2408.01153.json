The key\npoints of the approach are filtering data frames used for ghost-image\nreconstruction by the number of per-frame counts and superposing correlation\nimages obtained for different \"bucket\" pixels. The imaging is performed in an\nexperiment with a pseudo-thermal light source where the light intensity is so\nlow that the dark counts have a noticeable effect on imaging. We demonstrate\nthat the approach is capable to significantly reduce the destructive effect of\ndark counts on the ghost image and improve image contrast, spatial resolution,\nand image similarity to a reference image.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"WZgJcb-4S8Sz3DU-VOeSeqVcKird14DTvJZAlc5b-Hw","pdfSize":"4173576"}
