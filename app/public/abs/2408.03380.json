At tree level, an operator of a\ngiven category contributes only to processes of the same category. However,\nwhen the SMEFT Hamiltonian is evolved down from the new-physics scale to low\nenergies using the renormalization-group equations (RGEs), due to operator\nmixing this same SMEFT operator can generate operators of the other category at\none loop. Thus, to search for a SMEFT explanation of a low-energy anomaly, or\ncombination of anomalies, one must: (i) identify the candidate semileptonic and\nhadronic SMEFT operators, (ii) run them down to low energy with the RGEs, (iii)\ngenerate the required low-energy operators with the correct Wilson\ncoefficients, and (iv) check that all other constraints are satisfied. In this\npaper, we illustrate this method by finding all SMEFT operators that, by\nthemselves, provide a combined explanation of the (semileptonic) $\\bar b \\to\n\\bar s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ anomalies and the (hadronic) $B \\to K \\pi$ puzzle.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9wRG8GePZdi8w3r8kl0CUAXE_-mZiqdjJIMtDUfm948","pdfSize":"371151"}
