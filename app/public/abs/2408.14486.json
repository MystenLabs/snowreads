The success of a lightsail mission requires that any motion in\nthe plane transverse to the propagation direction is bounded and damped for the\nentire acceleration phase. Here, we demonstrate that a previously unappreciated\nrelativistic force, which generalizes the Poynting-Robertson effect, can\npassively damp this transverse motion. We show that this purely optical effect\ncan be enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to plane mirror sails by\njudicious design of the scattering response. We thus demonstrate that\nexploiting relativistic effects may be a practical means to control the motion\nof lightsails.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
