The proposed system integrates keyword matching,\nsemantic vector embeddings, and LLM-generated structured queries to deliver\nhighly relevant and contextually appropriate search results. By combining these\ncomplementary methods, the hybrid approach effectively captures both explicit\nand implicit user intent.The paper further explores techniques to optimize\nquery execution for faster response times and demonstrates the effectiveness of\nthis hybrid search model in producing comprehensive and accurate search\noutcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
