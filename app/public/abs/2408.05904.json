We refine the work of Cojocaru\non the asymptotic formulae for the number of primes $p\\le x$ for which the\nreduction modulo $p$ of $E$ is of square-free order. Also, we derive an\nunconditional short interval variant for the asymptotics. Compared to the\nestimate derived from the generalised Riemann hypothesis, the presented result\nis valid for even shorter intervals. Furthermore, we improve the short interval\nvariant of the cyclicity problem for CM elliptic curves obtained by the author.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
