The\nobjective is to minimize the total operational cost of the distribution system\nwhile satisfying the system operating constraints. The method is based on the\ndiscrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. Different\naspects of the operation of the distribution system operation are considered,\nsuch as the possibilities of curtailment of PV generation, managing battery\nstorage, reactive power injection, load shedding, and providing a flexibility\nservice for the transmission system. The model is tested for the IEEE 33-bus\nsystem with two added DERs and the study cases involve various unexpected\nevents. The experimental results show that this method enables the attainment\nof relatively low total cost values compared to the reference deterministic\napproach. The benefits of applying this approach are particularly evident when\nthere is a significant difference between the predicted and actual PV power\ngeneration.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
