Here, to achieve a pure data-driven\nmachine intelligent classification, we introduce a complexity boosted distance\nmeasure that captures the inherent complexity of dynamic evolution series in\ndifferent quantum many-body phases. Significantly, the introduction of\ncomplexity-boosted distance leads to remarkable improvements of unsupervised\nmanifold learning of quantum many-body dynamics, which are exemplified in\ndiscrete time crystal model, Aubry-Andr\\'e model, and quantum east model. Our\nmethod does not require any prior knowledge and exhibits effectiveness even in\nimperfect, disordered, and noisy situations that are challenging for human\nscientists. Successful classification of dynamic phases in many-body systems\nholds the potential to enable crucial applications, including identification of\ntsunamis, earthquakes, catastrophes and future trends in finance.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"hbCuiBLkjhxzv-IesJnnqPM59K3WzFzZ4Blg4gozL3Y","pdfSize":"2497680"}
