Using an inert-gas-free Rb vapor cell as a reference, we\nmeasure frequency shift and line broadening of the EIT spectra in Rb vapor\ncells with argon, neon or nitrogen gases at pressures ranging from a few mTorr\nto 5 Torr. The results qualitatively agree with a pseudo-potential model that\nincludes $s$-wave scattering between the Rydberg electron and the inert-gas\natoms, and the effect of polarization of the inert-gas atoms by the Rydberg\natoms. Our results are important for establishing Rydberg-EIT as an all-optical\nand non-intrusive spectroscopic probe for field diagnostics in low-pressure\nradio-frequency discharges.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6u1QuP0E3zDhpT5XzUrMrt-6P7Goff7VmhSxIx1J5oc","pdfSize":"1016870"}
