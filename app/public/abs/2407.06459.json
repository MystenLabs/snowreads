In this\nwork, we characterize and test a little-used teaching signal:\n\\textit{progress}, designed to represent the completion percentage of a task.\nWe conducted two online studies with 76 crowd-sourced participants and one\npublic space study with 40 non-expert participants to validate the capability\nof this progress signal. We find that progress indicates whether the task is\nsuccessfully performed, reflects the degree of task completion, identifies\nunproductive but harmless behaviors, and is likely to be more consistent across\nparticipants. Furthermore, our results show that giving progress does not\nrequire extra workload and time. An additional contribution of our work is a\ndataset of 40 non-expert demonstrations from the public space study through an\nice cream topping-adding task, which we observe to be multi-policy and\nsub-optimal, with sub-optimality not only from teleoperation errors but also\nfrom exploratory actions and attempts.
