We find that the predicted SGWB is\nmainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor\nmetallicity. For the optimistic cases in which the typical initial explosion\nenergy is low, the SGWB from NDAFs without disk outflows might be detected by\nnext-generation space-based interferometers such as Decihertz Interferometer\nGravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and Big Bang Observer (BBO). In the\nlow-frequency regime $\\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ Hz, this background is comparable to\nthat expected from standard inflationary models. Therefore, the SGWB from NDAFs\nmay become a foreground for searches of the SGWB generated in the inflationary\nepoch. Combining the diffuse NDAF neutrino background and SGWB from NDAFs, one\nmay constrain the properties of the CCSNe and NDAFs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"gBr6IV4JFAn_sMIuVVqbiXEGPQ1ZVNE04c_v-VpCeDM","pdfSize":"433042","txDigest":"9NRq5AaWVPR4d1HMvsj8Q23gfnpq8hbxZZWevXGFVc5e","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
