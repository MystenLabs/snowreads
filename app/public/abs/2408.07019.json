This NP-hard\nproblem is well-studied in terms of approximation algorithms. The current-best\napproximation factor for 2ECSS is $1.3+\\varepsilon$ for any constant\n$\\varepsilon >0$ [Garg, Grandoni, Jabal-Ameli'23; Kobayashi,Noguchi'23]. In\nthis paper we present a much simpler $9/7$ approximation algorithm, and a more\ncomplex $5/4$ one. Our algorithms are also faster: their running time is\n$n^{O(1)}$ instead of $n^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
