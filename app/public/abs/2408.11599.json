Previous works\npredominantly focus on leveraging the speaker's emotional labels, but ignore\nthe importance of emotion cause reasoning in empathetic response generation,\nwhich hinders the model's capacity for further affective understanding and\ncognitive inference. In this paper, we propose a cause-aware empathetic\ngeneration approach by integrating emotions and causes through a well-designed\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach can\ngreatly promote LLMs' performance of empathy by instruction tuning and\nenhancing the role awareness of an empathetic listener in the prompt.\nAdditionally, we propose to incorporate cause-oriented external knowledge from\nCOMET into the prompt, which improves the diversity of generation and\nalleviates conflicts between internal and external knowledge at the same time.\nExperimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach on\nLLaMA-7b achieves state-of-the-art performance in both automatic and human\nevaluations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
