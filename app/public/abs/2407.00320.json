However, they often require more than 10 times the\ncomputational resources of greedy decoding due to wasteful search strategies,\nmaking them difficult to be deployed in practical applications. This study\nintroduces a novel guided tree search algorithm with dynamic node selection and\nnode-level exploration budget (maximum number of children) calculation to\ntackle this issue. By considering the search progress towards the final answer\n(history) and the guidance from a value network (future) trained without any\nstep-wise annotations, our algorithm iteratively selects the most promising\ntree node before expanding it within the boundaries of the allocated\ncomputational budget. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and TabMWP datasets\ndemonstrate that our approach not only offers competitive performance but also\nenjoys significantly lower computational costs compared to baseline methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"73pd-YegCfAYEOajbrwtb2hyy2vtO4C0vY6n8j-fmG4","pdfSize":"767783"}
