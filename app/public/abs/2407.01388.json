In the first part of the paper we prove that two\nfinite-dimensional real normed spaces on a finite Gromov-Hausdorff distance are\nisometric to each other. We then study the properties of finite point sets in\nfinite-dimensional normed spaces whose cardinalities exceed the equilateral\ndimension of an ambient space. By means of the obtained results we prove the\nfollowing enhancement of the aforementioned theorem: every finite-dimensional\nnormed space lies on an infinite Gromov-Hausdorff distance from all other\nnon-isometric normed spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
