In particular, we will overview work over\nthe past decade on understanding certain geometrical properties of a deep\nnetwork's affine spline mapping, in particular how it tessellates its input\nspace. As we will see, the affine spline connection and geometrical viewpoint\nprovide a powerful portal through which to view, analyze, and improve the inner\nworkings of a deep network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
