We argue this can lead to basic processes in parameter space, starting\nwith minimum modelling ingredients: a complex network with a disorder parameter\nand an excitable dynamics (cellular automata) on it.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"n5KzSU21ROFsCC51FB5215tTCiG32ZXzJ09as37C4yo","pdfSize":"12204730"}
