The variables\nchosen for quantization determine the lattice, and each lattice produces\ndistinct effective equations derived from semiclassical states. We show that\nrequiring a bounce at the Planck density uniquely selects the volume lattice\nand gives the same effective Friedmann equation as that obtained in loop\nquantum cosmology. We also present conditions for the validity of the effective\nequations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NdexJYmCn4nfklqOGLAU1HYRzEs7hVvLnU55vzTQTbc","pdfSize":"140488"}
