Our analyses incorporate both numerical simulations and publicly\navailable data from the CMS Collaboration. We focus on Au+Au collisions at 200\nGeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. The differential flows obtained for\nvarious centrality windows and momentum cuts are consistent with conventional\nmethodologies such as multi-particle cumulants and event-plane methods.\nLeveraging these findings, we proceed to undertake further analysis of flow\nfactorization and event-plane correlations. These quantities are relevant\nbecause of their sensitivity to initial-state fluctuations. While higher-order\ncorrelators might provide different implementations of factorization ratio, the\nMLE estimator is readily applied to these scenarios. Moreover, MLE's unique\ncapabilities allow us to compute specific correlators that are typically\ninaccessible by other means. As an asymptotically normal and unbiased\nestimator, MLE provides a valuable alternative tool for flow and correlation\nanalysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
