By modeling each flagellar filament that is both thin and long as\na string of spheres, we show that such hydrodynamic interactions can be\naccurately described through a resistance tensor, which can be efficiently\nevaluated numerically. For the case of close interaction between one bacterium\nand one passive colloidal sphere, we see notable difference between results\nfrom our model and those from the resistive force theory, showing that the\nerror arises from negligence of the width of flagellar filaments in resistive\nforce theory can be strong.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uDzHqjnEGR5IQ4s2n2aUdTrxOUtZNgAP5b0Pzy9VmaU","pdfSize":"1265248"}
