The general\nidea in choosing the metric is that the spacetime contributions are contained\nin an external potential or in an electromagnetic potential which can be\nconsidered as a good basis for future studies on space quantum communication.\nWe also discuss several known generalizations of the Coulomb potential within\nthis formulation in terms of certain Heun functions. The impossibility of\nsolving our equation for the quantum-corrected Coulomb terms using known exact\nor quasi-exact nonperturbative analytical techniques is discussed, and finally\nthe Bethe-ansatz approach is proposed to overcome this challenging problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_941BuGtg1hTSFxIhpFbbzqrv05Zb0FW0BOThVHgnXQ","pdfSize":"244183"}
