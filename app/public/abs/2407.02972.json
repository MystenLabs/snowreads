The ETC is therefore a\ncrucial element in an observatory's data workflow and in particular is key to\noptimise the use of telescope times. This is also true for the La Silla Paranal\nObservatory and ESO has therefore embarked in a project to modernise its ETC,\nbased on a python back-end and an Angular-based front-end, while also providing\na programmatic interface. This ETC 2.0 has now been implemented for all the new\nParanal and La Silla instruments (CRIRES, ERIS, HARPS/NIRPS, and 4MOST) and\nwork is ongoing to implement it for MOONS. All the current ESO La Silla and\nParanal instruments will also be migrated progressively, and the first one has\nbeen FORS2. The new ETC2 is based on the Instrument Packages, which should\nallow in the future a smooth interaction with the Phase 1 and Phase 2\nobservation preparation tools. Moreover, the ETC 2.0 framework has recently\nbeen upgraded and makes now use of the NgRx/Store technology in the front-end.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
