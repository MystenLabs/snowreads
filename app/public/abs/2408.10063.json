The rich and uniquely clean data set of charm mesons\nand baryons at BESIII offers a unique laboratory to study the evolution of\nHeavy Quark Expansion (HQE) parameters across different charm hadron species\nand to shed light on the interplay between heavy quark dynamics and light quark\neffects. The HQE in terms of inverse powers of the heavy meson mass is\nwell-established in beauty decays, however due to the lighter charm mass its\napplicability to charm remains an open question. To date no determination of\nthe HQE parameters, the kinetic energy, chromomagnetic moment and Darwin terms,\nhas been attempted. A particular important role here is given to the Darwin and\nweak annihilation operators, whose values are important to predict lifetimes of\nheavy hadrons. Using a fast simulation for the BESIII detector response and\npredictions for spectral moments, we investigate the sensitivity to HQE\nparameters with today's and possible future data sets. In addition, we discuss\nthe theory challenges for the HQE in charm and the experimental limitations. We\nfurther investigate the sensitivity of determining the CKM matrix element\n$|V_{cs}|$ with inclusive semileptonic charm decays.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
