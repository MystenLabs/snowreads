The application perspectives of these materials in various\nfields further expand when enriching those with liquid crystals (LCs) primarily\ndue to their enhanced tunability and functionality. In this study, we report on\nthe hydrothermal synthesis of hybrid nanocomposites composed of MoS$_2$ and rGO\nand discuss tuning possibilities of their electro-optical properties by\nincorporating thermotropic LCs. In particular, we demonstrate that the\nincorporation of 5CB LC increases the sensitivity and charge storage efficiency\nof the hybrid nanocomposites. In addition, we also present the responsivity,\ndetectivity, and response time properties of the hybrid nanocomposites of\nMoS$_2$/rGO, both with and without the inclusion of nematic LCs. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that the system exhibits a 5CB-induced photocurrent switching\neffect. We believe the findings will open new doors for applications of these\nmaterials in optoelectronics and photonics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
