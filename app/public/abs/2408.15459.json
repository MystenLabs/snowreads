For each circuit, I give the algorithm to construct the\nError propagation space-time graph(\\textbf{EPSTG}) graph as well as the\nbipartite reverse spanning graph (\\textbf{RSG}). Then I prove that the problem\nof finding an error pattern is $\\mathcal{P}$ while calculate the error number\ndistribution is $\\textit{NP-complete}$. I invent the new measure for error\npropagation and show that for widely used transversal $CNOT$ circuit in\nparallel, the shift of distribution is bounded by $\\frac{n}{27}$, where $n$ is\nthe number of physical qubits. The consistency between the result of qiskit\nsimulation and my algorithm justify the correctness of my model. Applying the\nframework to random circuit, I show that there is severe unbounded error\npropagation when circuit has global connection. We also apply my framework on\nparallel transversal logical $CNOT$ gate in surface code, and demonstrate that\nthe error threshold will decrease from $0.231$ to $0.134$ per cycle.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
