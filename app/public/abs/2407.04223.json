Our goal is to understand where exploring new physics\nin the late universe is most relevant. We analyze recent Cosmic Chronometers\n(CC), Type Ia Supernovae (SN), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. By\nexamining reconstructions of the dimensionless parameter $\\delta(z)$, which\nmeasures deviations of the Hubble parameter from the Planck-$\\Lambda$CDM\npredictions, we identify intriguing features at low ($z \\lesssim 0.5$) and high\n($z \\gtrsim 2$) redshifts. Deviations from the Planck-$\\Lambda$CDM model were\nnot significant between $0.5\\lesssim z \\lesssim2$. Using the combined CC+SN+BAO\ndataset, we gain insights into dark energy (DE) dynamics, resembling\ncharacteristics of omnipotent DE, extending beyond quintessence and phantom\nmodels. DE exhibits n-quintessence traits for $z\\gtrsim2$, transitioning with a\nsingularity around $z\\sim2$ to usual phantom traits in $1\\lesssim z\\lesssim2$.\nDE characteristics differ between scenarios ($H_0$-SH0ES and\n$H_0$-$\\Lambda$\\&CMB), with $H_0$-SH0ES leaning towards phantom traits and\n$H_0$-$\\Lambda$\\&CMB towards quintessence. We suggest exploring new physics at\n$z\\lesssim0.5$ and $1.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim2.5$, particularly around $z = 2$, to\nunderstand cosmological tensions such as $H_0$ and $S_8$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
