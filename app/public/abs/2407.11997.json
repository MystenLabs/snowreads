Despite their promise,\nprogress has been slowed by a lack of specialized prototypes and advanced\nanalysis techniques. Addressing this gap, our study introduces, HydroTrack, an\n18-channel spectroscopy sensor, ingeniously embedded in a smart-watch.\nAccompanying this hardware, we present signal processing and data analysis\ntechniques implemented at the edge, designed to maximize the utility of our\nsystem in comprehensive health tracking. A pivotal application of our device is\nthe real-time assessment of hydration levels in physically active individuals.\nWe validated our prototype and analytical approach through experiments on six\nparticipants, focusing on hydration dynamics during physical exercises. Our\nfindings reveal an accuracy of avg. 95% in determining hydration states.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
