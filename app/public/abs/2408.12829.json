However, the unstable performance of MOS prediction models across\ndiverse samples presents ongoing challenges in the practical application of\nthese systems. In this paper, we point out that the absence of uncertainty\nmodeling is a significant limitation hindering MOS prediction systems from\napplying to the real and open world. We analyze the sources of uncertainty in\nthe MOS prediction task and propose to establish an uncertainty-aware MOS\nprediction system that models aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty by\nheteroscedastic regression and Monte Carlo dropout separately. The experimental\nresults show that the system captures uncertainty well and is capable of\nperforming selective prediction and out-of-domain detection. Such capabilities\nsignificantly enhance the practical utility of MOS systems in diverse real and\nopen-world environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
