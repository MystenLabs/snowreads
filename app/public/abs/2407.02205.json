Our results yield commuting representations of the pair of\nDrinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups $(\\mathcal U_{q^2}(\\mathfrak{sl}_2),\\mathcal\nU_{q}(\\mathfrak{sl}_2))$ realized in a suitable algebra of $q$-differential\noperators acting on the space of symplectic polynomial spinors. We obtain\n$q$-analogues for the symplectic Dirac operator, the Fischer decomposition, the\nexpression for the symplectic polynomial monogenics and for the projection\noperators onto the monogenics. We also discuss $q$-analogues of generalized\nsymmetries of the $q$-symplectic Dirac operator raising the homogeneous\npolynomial degree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
