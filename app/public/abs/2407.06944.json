Trivially we have\n$t_n \\leq 3$ and $$ t_n \\geq 3 - \\log_n\\frac{3n^3}{2n^3+n} $$ by considering $A\n= \\{0,1,\\cdots,n-1\\}^d$. In this note, we investigate the behavior of $t_n$ for\nlarge $n$ and obtain the following non-trivial bounds: $$ 3 -\n(1+o_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}(1)) \\log_n \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\leq t_n \\leq 3 -\n\\log_n(1+c), $$ where $c>0$ is an absolute constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
