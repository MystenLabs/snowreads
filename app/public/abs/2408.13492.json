However, AI\nstill faces limitations in mimicking high-level human capabilities, such as\nnovel category discovery, for practical use. While some methods utilizing\noffline continual learning have been proposed for novel category discovery,\nthey neglect the continuity of data streams in real-world settings. In this\nwork, we introduce Online Continuous Generalized Category Discovery (OCGCD),\nwhich considers the dynamic nature of data streams where data can be created\nand deleted in real time. Additionally, we propose a novel method, DEAN,\nDiscovery via Energy guidance and feature AugmentatioN, which can discover\nnovel categories in an online manner through energy-guided discovery and\nfacilitate discriminative learning via energy-based contrastive loss.\nFurthermore, DEAN effectively pseudo-labels unlabeled data through\nvariance-based feature augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed DEAN achieves outstanding performance in proposed OCGCD scenario.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
