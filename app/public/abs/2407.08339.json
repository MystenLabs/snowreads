A celebrated\nTheorem of Procesi and Schwarz gives an explicit description of the orbit space\n$\\mathbb{R}^n /\\!/G$ as a basic closed semi-algebraic set. We give a new proof\nof this statement and another description as a basic closed semi-algebraic set\nusing elementary tools from real algebraic geometry. Br\\\"ocker was able to show\nthat the number of inequalities needed to describe the orbit space generically\ndepends only on the group $G$. Here, we construct such inequalities explicitly\nfor abelian groups and in the case where only one inequality is needed.\nFurthermore, we answer an open question raised by Br\\\"ocker concerning the\ngenericity of his result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
