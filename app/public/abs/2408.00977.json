It is also a\nkey ingredient in the study of vorticity depletion.\n  In this article we locally describe the solutions of Rayleigh equation near\ncritical points of any order of degeneracy, and link their values on the\nboundary with their behaviors at infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
