This study investigates the\neffectiveness of Domain Adaptation (DA) in enhancing imagery prediction using\nprimarily visual data from fMRI scans of 18 subjects. Initially, we train a\nbaseline model on visual stimuli to predict imagined stimuli, utilizing data\nfrom 14 brain regions. We then develop several models to improve imagery\nprediction, comparing different DA methods. Our results demonstrate that DA\nsignificantly enhances imagery prediction, especially with the Regular Transfer\napproach. We then conduct a DA-enhanced searchlight analysis using Regular\nTransfer, followed by permutation-based statistical tests to identify brain\nregions where imagery decoding is consistently above chance across subjects.\nOur DA-enhanced searchlight predicts imagery contents in a highly distributed\nset of brain regions, including the visual cortex and the frontoparietal\ncortex, thereby outperforming standard cross-domain classification methods. The\ncomplete code and data for this paper have been made openly available for the\nuse of the scientific community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"XyGlRYMD114Bf1LiljY-1F3gvLXIDuTKyOuVuuAegMQ","pdfSize":"15213201"}
