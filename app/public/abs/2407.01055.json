RA designs face greater regulatory scrutiny due to potential\ntype I error inflation, which limits their uptake in practice. Existing\napproaches to type I error control either only work for specific designs, have\na risk of Monte Carlo/approximation error, are conservative, or computationally\nintractable. We develop a general and computationally tractable approach for\nexact analysis in two-arm RA designs with binary outcomes. We use the approach\nto construct exact tests applicable to designs that use either randomized or\ndeterministic RA procedures, allowing for complexities such as delayed\noutcomes, early stopping or allocation of participants in blocks. Our efficient\nforward recursion implementation allows for testing of two-arm trials with\n1,000 participants on a standard computer. Through an illustrative\ncomputational study of trials using randomized dynamic programming we show\nthat, contrary to what is known for equal allocation, a conditional exact test\nhas, almost uniformly, higher power than the unconditional test. Two real-world\ntrials with the above-mentioned complexities are re-analyzed to demonstrate the\nvalue of our approach in controlling type I error and/or improving the\nstatistical power.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
