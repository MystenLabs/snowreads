We introduce the concept of extendability for the\npre-element spaces, which encompasses both the superspline space and the finite\nelement space. By examining the extendability condition for both types of\nspaces, we provide an answer to the conditions regarding the construction. A\ncorollary of our results is that constructing $C^r$ conforming elements in $d$\ndimensions should in general require an extra $C^{2^{s}r}$ continuity on\n$s$-codimensional simplices, and the polynomial degree is at least $(2^d r +\n1)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
