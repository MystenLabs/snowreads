Notably, heterostructures\nbased on strained germanium have been extensively studied in recent years, with\nemphasis on their strong and tunable spin-orbit interaction, low effective\nmass, and high hole mobility. However, planar systems are still limited by the\nfact that the shape of the confinement potential is directly related to the\ndensity. In this work, we present the successful implementation of a backgate\nfor a planar germanium heterostructure. The backgate, in combination with a\ntopgate, enables independent control over the density and the electric field,\nwhich determines important state properties such as the effective mass, the\n$g$-factor and the quantum lifetime. This unparalleled degree of control paves\nthe way towards engineering qubit properties and facilitates the targetted\ntuning of bilayer quantum wells, which promise denser qubit packing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"caLptP6AtMpRuJNijP73ByKi13FGWi9jLw4XCHae2Ks","pdfSize":"4087879"}
