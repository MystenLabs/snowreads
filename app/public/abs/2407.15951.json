Despite its\nsignificance, content varies widely among institutions. This study analyzes 167\nmodern physics syllabi from 127 US research intensive institutions, employing\nemergent coding using both human and Natural Language Processing methods from\npublic sources (51.5%) and private correspondence (48.5%). Public course\ncatalogs were consulted to identify pre- and co-requisites, with 37.1% of\nstudents having completed calculus II. Foundational topics like Newtonian\nmechanics (94%), electricity and magnetism (84.4%), and waves or optics (77.2%)\nwere frequently required. Quantum physics (94%), atomic physics (83%), and\nrelativity (70%) were most commonly taught. The study highlights the lack of\nuniformity in modern physics curricula, emphasizing the importance of a\nconsistent and comprehensive education for physics majors across universities.\nThis insight contributes to the ongoing discourse on optimizing physics\neducation in higher education.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
