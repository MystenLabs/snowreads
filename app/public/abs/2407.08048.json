For $4 \\leq d \\leq 90$, we show\nthe number of known equivalence classes of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs in\ndimension $d$ equals the cardinality of the ideal class monoid of (not\nnecessarily invertible) ideal classes in the real quadratic order of\ndiscriminant $(d+1)(d-3)$. Equivalently, this is the number of\n$\\mathbf{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ conjugacy classes in $\\mathbf{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ of\ntrace $d-1$. We conjecture the equality extends to all $d \\geq 4$. We prove\nthat this conjecture implies more that one equivalence class of\nWeyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs for every $d > 22$.\n  Additionally, we refine the \"class field hypothesis\" of Appleby, Flammia,\nMcConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field\ngenerated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a\nWeyl--Heisenberg covariant SIC. The class fields conjecturally associated to\nSICs in dimension $d$ come with a natural partial order under inclusion; we\nshow that the natural inclusions of these fields are strict, except in a small\nfamily of cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
