Many deep learning methods with\npowerful representation learning capability demonstrate advanced performance on\nnon-homogeneous dehazing, however, these methods usually struggle with\nprocessing high-resolution images (e.g., $4000 \\times 6000$) due to their heavy\ncomputational demands. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative\nnon-homogeneous Dehazing method via Deformable Convolutional Transformer-like\narchitecture (DehazeDCT). Specifically, we first design a transformer-like\nnetwork based on deformable convolution v4, which offers long-range dependency\nand adaptive spatial aggregation capabilities and demonstrates faster\nconvergence and forward speed. Furthermore, we leverage a lightweight\nRetinex-inspired transformer to achieve color correction and structure\nrefinement. Extensive experiment results and highly competitive performance of\nour method in NTIRE 2024 Dense and Non-Homogeneous Dehazing Challenge, ranking\nsecond among all 16 submissions, demonstrate the superior capability of our\nproposed method.
