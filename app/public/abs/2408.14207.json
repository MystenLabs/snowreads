Their supposedly vanishing\ntidal Love number is generically thought to help distinguish them from other\nsubsolar and more deformable compact objects, such as neutron stars. We show\nthat a large and detectable Love number of primordial black holes can be\ngenerated in the presence of even small disturbances of the system, thus\npotentially jeopardizing their discovery. However, such small perturbations are\nnot tightly bound and are therefore disrupted before the mergers. We show that\nthey leave a characteristic signature in the gravitational waveform that could\nbe observed with current and future gravitational wave detectors. Thus, they\nmay still hint towards the primordial nature of the black holes in the merger.\nFinally, we demonstrate that disregarding possible environmental effects in the\nmatched-filter search for subsolar gravitational wave events can lead to a\ndecreased sensitivity in the detectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
