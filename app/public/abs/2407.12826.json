Traditional workflows for such tasks involve large\ngroups of domain experts who manually review and synthesize vast amounts of\nliterature. The exponential growth of scientific literature and recent advances\nin LLMs provide an opportunity to complementing these traditional workflows\nwith new age tools. We assess the efficacy of GPT-4o to do these tasks on a\nsample from the dataset created by the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative\n(GAMI) where we check the accuracy of climate change adaptation related feature\nextraction from the scientific literature across three levels of expertise. Our\nresults indicate that while GPT-4o can achieve high accuracy in low-expertise\ntasks like geographic location identification, their performance in\nintermediate and high-expertise tasks, such as stakeholder identification and\nassessment of depth of the adaptation response, is less reliable. The findings\nmotivate the need for designing assessment workflows that utilize the strengths\nof models like GPT-4o while also providing refinements to improve their\nperformance on these tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
