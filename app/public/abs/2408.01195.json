Activity is invoked via the Vicsek rule, while passive interaction\nfollows the Lennard-Jones potential. With the system density near the vapor\nbranch, the evolution morphology features disconnected liquid clusters. In the\npassive limit, coarsening begins with nucleation, followed by an\nevaporation-condensation growth mechanism, leading to a metastable state\nwithout complete phase separation. We aim to understand the impact of\nVicsek-like self-propulsion on the structure and growth of these clusters. Our\nkey finding is that Vicsek activity results in a distinct growth mechanism,\nnotably rapid cluster growth and the breakdown of the metastable state through\nballistic aggregation. Relevant growth laws are analyzed and explained using\nappropriate theoretical models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
