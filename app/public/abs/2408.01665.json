Recent researches show\nthat the EMSG theory can reproduce viable background cosmological evolution\ncomparable to $\\Lambda$CDM, while the matter-dominated era exhibits slight\ndistinctions. In this paper, we mainly focus on the power-law EMSG models and\nderive the equations for the linear cosmological perturbations. We explore the\npropagation of the gravitational wave (GW) and the growth of matter density\nperturbation at the first order, and estimate the model parameters from the\nsimulated GW data and the observed redshift space distortion data. Our analysis\nreveals that the model parameters should be small and positive in $1\\sigma$\nconfidence interval, which indicates that the theory is in good agreement with\nthe observational data and can be regarded as an alternative for the standard\ncosmological model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
