Their discovery has triggered a tsunami of\nscientific interest regarding the physical properties, dynamics and origin of\nthe so-called interstellar interloper population. While it is clear that a deep\nunderstanding of these issues cannot be reached from a sample of just two\nbodies, the emergence of this new field of astronomical study is particularly\nfascinating, with ramifications from planetary science to galactic dynamics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
