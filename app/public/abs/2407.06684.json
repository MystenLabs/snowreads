Our\napproach does not involve the usual variances and covariances, whose use to\ndescribe quantum uncertainties has been questioned by Uffink and Hilgevoord. We\nintroduce instead the geometric notion of \"quasi-states\" which are related in a\nway that will be explained to the notion of \"quantum blob\" we have introduced\nin previous work. Considering the symmetries of the quasi-states leads to the\ndefinition of the canonical group of a quasi-state, which allows to classify\nthem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
