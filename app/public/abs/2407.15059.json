The\noutaged lines form a pattern in the transmission network. We extract these\npatterns from utility outage data, determine some key statistics of these\npatterns, and then show how to generate new patterns consistent with these\nstatistics. The generated patterns provide a new and easily feasible way to\nmodel the overall effect of the protection system at the scale of a large\ntransmission system. This new generative modeling of protection is expected to\ncontribute to simulations of disturbances in large grids so that they can\nbetter quantify the risk of blackouts. Analysis of the pattern sizes suggests\nan index that describes how much outages spread in the transmission network at\nthe fast timescale.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
