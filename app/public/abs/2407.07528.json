However, instability and redundancy in the classifier\npools can impede computational efficiency and accuracy in dynamic ensemble\nselection. This paper introduces a meta-learning recommendation system (MLRS)\nto recommend the optimal pool generation scheme for DES methods tailored to\nindividual datasets. The system employs a meta-model built from dataset\nmeta-features to predict the most suitable pool generation scheme and DES\nmethod for a given dataset. Through an extensive experimental study\nencompassing 288 datasets, we demonstrate that this meta-learning\nrecommendation system outperforms traditional fixed pool or DES method\nselection strategies, highlighting the efficacy of a meta-learning approach in\nrefining DES method selection.
