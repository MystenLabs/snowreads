This relaxed regularity assumption\nleads to conforming finite element methods using spaces common to\ndiscretizations of Maxwell's equations. A drawback of this approach, however,\nis that it is not immediately clear how to enforce Navier-slip boundary\nconditions. By recognizing the slip condition as a Robin boundary condition, we\nshow that the continuous system is well-posed, propose finite element methods,\nand analyze the discrete system by deriving stability and a priori error\nestimates. Numerical experiments in 2D confirm the derived, optimal convergence\nrates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
