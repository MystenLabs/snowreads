Then, we\npropose to use genetic algorithm to optimize the proposed parameters in a way\nto maximize TEG efficiency. To prepare data, physical properties of n- and\np-type materials were computed by coupling Density Functional Theory to\nBoltzmann Transport, and used for Finite Elements simulations. TEG efficiency\nwas evaluated from a finite elements model considering design, radiative heat\nloss, contacts, external load resistance and different combinations of\nmaterials, resulting in 5300 different scenarios. For ML model, physical\nproperties and engineering parameters were used as input features, skipping\ntransport coefficients, while TEG efficiency was a target. Model was built on\ngradient boosting algorithm, its performance was evaluated using the\ncoefficient of determination that reached a value of 0.98 on test dataset.\nFeatures importance analysis revealed the most crucial features for\nHalf-Heusler-based TEG efficiency: carriers density or Fermi level, indicating\nthe predominant role of electrical conductivity and electronic part of\nelectrical conductivity. Features that were less important, but able to\nincrease model performance were: energy gap, lattice thermal conductivity,\ncharge carrier relaxation time and carriers conductivity effective mass.\nFeatures showed no impact were: density of states effective mass, heat\ncapacity, density, relative permittivity and leg width. The proposed approach\ncan be applied for the identification of the most important physical properties\nand their optimal values, the optimization of TEG design and operation\nconditions in a way to maximize TEG efficiency.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
