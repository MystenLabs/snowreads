Our study introduces a novel guidance data augmentation technique\nutilizing abstracted context and sentence structures to produce varied\nsentences while maintaining context-entity relationships, addressing data\nscarcity challenges. By fostering a closer relationship between context,\nsentence structure, and role of entities, our method enhances data\naugmentation's effectiveness. Consequently, by showcasing diversification in\nboth entity-related vocabulary and overall sentence structure, and\nsimultaneously improving the training performance of named entity recognition\ntask.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
