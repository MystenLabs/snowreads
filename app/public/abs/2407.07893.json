In this work\nwe present an efficient quantum search algorithm which produces\nquasi-stationary states, having energies supported within narrow windows of a\ndense many-body spectrum. In time scaling polynomially with system size, the\nalgorithm produces states with inverse polynomial energy width, which can in\nturn be used to analyze many-body dynamics out to polynomial times. The\nalgorithm is based on quantum singular value transformations and quantum signal\nprocessing, and provides a quadratic speedup over measurement-based approaches.\nWe discuss how this algorithm can be used as a primitive to investigate the\nmechanisms underlying thermalization and hydrodynamics in many-body quantum\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
