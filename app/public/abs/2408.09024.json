We find a relatively low level of mixing, $3.1^{+5.0}_{-3.1}\\%$,\nbetween the power-law and Gaussian populations, compared to the percentage of\nmergers containing two Gaussian bump black holes, $5.0^{+3.2}_{-1.7}\\%$. Our\nanalysis indicates that black holes within the Gaussian bump are generally\nseparate from the power-law population, with only a minor fraction engaging in\nmixing and contributing to the $\\mathcal{M} \\sim 14 M_\\odot$ peak in the chirp\nmass. This leads us to identify a distinct population of Binary Gaussian Black\nHoles (BGBHs) that arise from mergers within the Gaussian bump. We suggest that\ncurrent theories for the formation of the massive $35 M_\\odot$ Gaussian bump\npopulation may need to reevaluate the underlying mechanisms that drive the\npreference for BGBHs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
