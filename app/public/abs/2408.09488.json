It is designed to be\naccessible, with no prior familiarity with category theory required. The\nnecessary categorical background is introduced gradually, with a focus on the\nphilosophical and informal aspects of proof. The only prerequisites are a basic\nunderstanding of logic, computability theory, topology, and ordered structures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9HnTg1Rt790VICxAdAVjaS-DpJWxyUL02osBOhZ6BSo","pdfSize":"1148562"}
