This work investigates the use\nof pause-enriched transcripts in transformer-based language models to\ndifferentiate the cognitive states of subjects with no cognitive impairment,\nmild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's dementia based on their speech from\na clinical assessment. We address three binary classification tasks: Onset,\nmonitoring, and dementia exclusion. The performance is evaluated through\nexperiments on a German Verbal Fluency Test and a Picture Description Test,\ncomparing the model's effectiveness across different speech production\ncontexts. Starting from a textual baseline, we investigate the effect of\nincorporation of pause information and acoustic context. We show the test\nshould be chosen depending on the task, and similarly, lexical pause\ninformation and acoustic cross-attention contribute differently.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
