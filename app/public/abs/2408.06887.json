Here $H$ is the\nHamiltonian of the isolated system and ${\\mathcal D}$ is the dissipator. We\nconsider the case where the system consists of two parts, the \"boundary'' $A$\nand the ``bulk'' $B$, and ${\\mathcal D}$ acts only on $A$, so ${\\mathcal\nD}={\\mathcal D}_A\\otimes{\\mathcal I}_B$, where ${\\mathcal D}_A$ acts only on\npart $A$, while ${\\mathcal I}_B$ is the identity superoperator on part $B$. Let\n${\\mathcal D}_A$ be ergodic, so ${\\mathcal D}_A\\hat{\\rho}_A=0$ only for one\nunique density matrix $\\hat{\\rho}_A$. We show that any stationary density\nmatrix $\\bar{\\rho}$ on the full system which commutes with $H$ must be of the\nproduct form $\\bar{\\rho}=\\hat{\\rho}_A\\otimes\\rho_B$ for some $\\rho_B$. This\nrules out finding any ${\\mathcal D}_A$ that has the Gibbs measure\n$\\rho_\\beta\\sim e^{-\\beta H}$ as a stationary state with $\\beta\\neq 0$, unless\nthere is no interaction between parts $A$ and $B$. We give criteria for the\nuniqueness of the stationary state $\\bar{\\rho}$ for systems with interactions\nbetween $A$ and $B$. Related results for non-ergodic cases are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
