Additionally, a tailored\ndecentralized privacy-preserved coordination scheme for blockchain in V2G\nnetworks is needed to ensure user privacy and efficient energy transactions.\nThis paper proposes a V2G trading and coordination scheme tailored to the\ndecentralized nature of blockchain as well as the interests of stakeholders\nutilizing smart charging points (SCPs) and Stackelberg game model. Case studies\nusing real-world data from Southern University of Science and Technology\ndemonstrate the efficacy of proposed scheme in reducing EV charging costs and\nthe potential for supporting auxiliary grid services.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
