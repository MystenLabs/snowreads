Suppose that each\nparticle is labelled by a positive integer $l$ and waits a random time\nexponentially distributed with rate $1$. It then chooses the right direction to\njump with probability $p$ or the left direction with probability $q=1-p$. If\nthe particle chooses the right direction, it jumps to the nearest site occupied\nby a particle $l'<l$ (with the convention that an empty site is considered as a\nparticle with labelled $0$). If the particle chooses the left direction, it\nfollows the rule of the multi-species totally asymmetric simple exclusion\nprocess (mTASEP). We show that this model is integrable and provide the exact\nformula of the transition probability using the Bethe ansatz.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
