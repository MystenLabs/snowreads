The considered geodesic distances are induced by the\none-parameter family of Riemannian metrics introduced by H\\\"uper et al. (2021),\nwhich contains the well-known Euclidean and canonical metrics. First, we give\nthe best Lipschitz constants between the distances induced by any two members\nof the family of metrics. Then, we give a lower and an upper bound on the\ngeodesic distance by the easily computable Frobenius distance. We give explicit\nfamilies of pairs of matrices that depend on the parameter of the metric and\nthe dimensions of the manifold, where the lower and the upper bound are\nattained. These bounds aim at improving the theoretical guarantees and\nperformance of minimal geodesic computation algorithms by reducing the initial\nvelocity search space. In addition, these findings contribute to advancing the\nunderstanding of geodesic distances on the Stiefel manifold and their\napplications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
