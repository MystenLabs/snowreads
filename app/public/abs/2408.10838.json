The neural network is trained with data on adaptively\nrefined finite element meshes, thus reducing data complexity significantly.\nError control is achieved by using a reliable finite element a posteriori error\nestimator, which is also provided as input to the neural network.\n  The proposed U-Net architecture with CNN layers mimics a classical finite\nelement multigrid algorithm. It can be shown that the CNN efficiently\napproximates all operations required by the solver, including the evaluation of\nthe residual-based error estimator. In the CNN, a culling mask set-up according\nto the local corrections due to refinement on each mesh level reduces the\noverall complexity, allowing the network optimization with localized fine-scale\nfinite element data.\n  A complete convergence and complexity analysis is carried out for the\nadaptive multilevel scheme, which differs in several aspects from previous\nnon-adaptive multilevel CNN. Moreover, numerical experiments with common\nbenchmark problems from Uncertainty Quantification illustrate the practical\nperformance of the architecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
