The wiggly\ncomplex is a $(2n-1)$-dimensional pseudomanifold, whose facets are wiggly\npseudotriangulations. We show that wiggly pseudotriangulations are in bijection\nwith wiggly permutations, which are permutations of $[2n]$ avoiding the\npatterns $(2j-1) \\cdots i \\cdots (2j)$ for $i < 2j-1$ and $(2j) \\cdots k \\cdots\n(2j-1)$ for $k > 2j$. These permutations define the wiggly lattice, an induced\nsublattice of the weak order. We then prove that the wiggly complex is\nisomorphic to the boundary complex of the polar of the wigglyhedron, for which\nwe give explicit and simple vertex and facet descriptions. Interestingly, we\nobserve that any Cambrian associahedron is normally equivalent to a well-chosen\nface of the wigglyhedron. Finally, we recall the correspondence of wiggly arcs\nwith objects in a category, and we develop categorical criteria for a subset of\nwiggly arcs to form a face of the wiggly complex.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
