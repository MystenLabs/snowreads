This definition is weaker than global stability [ABLMM22]\nand is related to the notions of replicability [ILPS22] and list replicability\n[CMY23]. We show that if a class of distributions is stable list decodable,\nthen it can be learned privately in the agnostic setting. As the main\napplication of our framework, we prove the first upper bound on the sample\ncomplexity of private density estimation for Gaussian Mixture Models in the\nagnostic setting, extending the realizable result of Afzali et al. [AAL24].\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
