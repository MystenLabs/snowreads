A generalized principal\neigenvalue involving harvesting rate used to identify the spreading and\nvanishing outcomes is firstly defined and the existence of the principal\neigenvalue is given under some conditions. Subsequently, properties of the\ngeneralized principal eigenvalue and the principal eigenvalue related to\nharvesting rate and length of habitat interval are analyzed, respectively. The\ncriteria to governing spreading or vanishing of the species are finally\ninvestigated, with sufficient conditions for spreading-vanishing established.\nOur results indicate that complexities can be induced by the internal long rang\ndispersal and expanding capacities of species, as well as external harvesting\nintervention of human. Specifically, appropriate harvesting rate and expanding\ncapacities can even change the reciprocal outcomes of species from co-existence\nto co-extinction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
