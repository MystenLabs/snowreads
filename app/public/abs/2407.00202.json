A new frontier in ASIs is\ntheir three-dimensional (3D) extension. Here, we numerically explore the\nferromagnetic resonance of square ASIs as each nanomagnet is rotated out of\nplane into 3D ASIs, in which the vertex gap can be either kept constant or\nvarying. We study both remanent and vortex configurations using a\nsemi-analytical dynamic approach and micromagnetic simulations. We find that\nboth methods show qualitative agreement of the main spectral features. However,\nthere are important limitations. On one hand, the semi-analytical approach\nrelies on a minimal model of the demag field, preventing exact predictions. On\nthe other hand, micromagnetic simulations suffer from sufficient resolution,\nmaking the results grid-dependent and extremely slow. Regardless, both methods\ndisplay tunability as a function of the tilt angle. These results showcase\nadvantages and limitations of both methods and are promising to further our\nunderstanding of 3D ASI dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
