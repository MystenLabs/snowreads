We successfully apply this\napproach to (bi)orthogonal polynomials satisfying ordinary orthogonality,\n$(1,m)$-biorthogonality, generalized Laurent biorthogonality, Cauchy\nbiorthogonality and partial-skew orthogonality. As a result, several seemingly\nnovel classes of high order d-P-type equations, along with their particular\nsolutions and respective Lax pairs, are derived. Notably, the d-P-type equation\nrelated to the Cauchy biorthogonality can be viewed as a stationary reduction\nof a nonisospectral generalization involving the first two flows of the Toda\nhierarchy of CKP type. Additionally, the d-P-type equation related to the\npartial-skew orthogonality is associated with the nonisospectral Toda hierarchy\nof BKP type, and this equation is found to admit a solution expressed in terms\nof Pfaffians.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
