This\nresult arises from a general relation among dynamical $ \\alpha $-R\\'enyi\nentropies and Lieb-Robinson bounds. We extend our bound on the dynamical\ngeneration of entropy to systems with exponential decay of interactions, for\nvalues of $\\alpha$ close enough to $ 1 $. We provide a non rigorous argument to\nextend our results to initial pure states with low entanglement of $ O(\\log L)\n$. This class of states includes many examples of spin systems ground states,\nand also critical states. We establish that low entanglement states have an\nefficient MPS representation that persists at least up to times of order $ \\log\nL $. The main technical tools are the Lieb-Robinson bounds, to locally\napproximate the dynamics of the spin chain, a strict upper bound of Audenaert\non $ \\alpha $-R\\'enyi entropies and a bound on their concavity. Such a bound,\nthat we provide in an appendix, can be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
