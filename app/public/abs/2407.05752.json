After 40 years of direct detection\nexperiments, the parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles\n(WIMPs) as dark matter candidates is rapidly approaching the neutrino floor. In\nthis light, we consider a dark sector that is strongly decoupled from the\nvisible sector, interacting exclusively through gravity. In this model,\nproposed by Freese and Winkler (arXiv:2302.11579), dark matter can be produced\nthrough a first-order phase transition in the dark sector dubbed the Dark Big\nBang. In this study we fully determine the allowed region of parameter space\nfor the tunneling potential that leads to the realization of a Dark Big Bang\nand is consistent with all experimental bounds available.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
