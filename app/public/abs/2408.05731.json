We point out an error in the second part of Isbell's\nrefinement theorem, but show that the rest of his results can be extended to\nthe general self-dual context of a noetherian form, which includes in its scope\nall semi-abelian categories as well as all Grandis exact categories.\nFurthermore, we show that Isbell's formulations of the butterfly lemma and the\nrefinement theorem amount to canonicity of isomorphisms established in these\nresults.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
