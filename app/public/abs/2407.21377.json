We present the discovery of a long-period giant\nplanet, HD 118203 c ($m_{c}=11.79^{+0.69}_{-0.63}\\ \\mathrm{M_{J}}$,\n$a_{c}=6.28^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$ AU) exterior to a close-in eccentric hot Jupiter\nHD 118203 b ($P_{b}=6.135\\ \\mathrm{days}$, $m_{b}=2.14\\pm{0.12}\\\n\\mathrm{M_{J}}$, $r_{b}=1.14\\pm{0.029}\\ \\mathrm{R_{J}}$,\n$e_{b}=0.31\\pm{0.007}$) based on twenty-year radial velocities. Using\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we\nmeasured a low sky-projected spin-orbit angle\n$\\lambda_{b}=-11^{\\circ}.7^{+7.6}_{-10.0}$ for HD 118203 b and detected stellar\noscillations in the host star, confirming its evolved status. Combining the RM\nobservation with the stellar inclination measurement, we constrained the true\nspin-orbit angle of HD 118203 b as $\\Psi_{b}<33^{\\circ}.5\\ (2\\sigma)$,\nindicating the orbit normal of the hot Jupiter nearly aligned with the stellar\nspin axis. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia\nastrometric acceleration, we constrained the line-of-sight mutual inclination\nbetween the hot Jupiter and the outer planet to be $9^{\\circ}.8^{+16.2}_{-9.3}$\nat $2\\sigma$ level. HD 118203 is one of first hot Jupiter systems where both\nthe true spin-orbit angle of the hot Jupiter and the mutual inclination between\ninner and outer planets have been determined. Our results are consistent with a\nsystem-wide alignment, with low mutual inclinations between the outer giant\nplanet, the inner hot Jupiter, and the host star. This alignment, along with\nthe moderate eccentricity of HD 118203 c, implies that the system may have\nundergone coplanar high-eccentricity tidal migration. Under this framework, our\ndynamical analysis suggests an initial semi-major axis of 0.3 to 3.2 AU for the\nproto-hot Jupiter.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gm3cf8hZngDHrwxvI-SK6iNjPIsvh4GQaC4f-nL3TQE","pdfSize":"12348459"}
