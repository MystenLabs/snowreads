It aims to reduce the\nprotection issues arising from Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs). Inspired by\nPower Line Communication (PLC), the proposed method utilizes high-frequency\ncarrier waves which are sent from either side of a TL over each phase. As\nfaults disrupt the propagation of carriers, the receiving carrier waves before\nand during faults exhibit differences. Based on this principle, the proposed\nmethod continuously compares the receiving carrier waves with a short history\nof them to detect and classify faults. The performance of the proposed method\nwas evaluated using EMTP-RV and MATLAB, and compared to traditional\nphasor-based distance relays. The simulation results confirm the capability of\nthe proposed method in detection and classification of different faults\nregardless of power sources types.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
