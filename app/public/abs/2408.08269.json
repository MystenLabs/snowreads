It was originally derived using complex\nanalysis and number-theoretic ideas by Hardy and Ramanujan. It was later\nre-derived by Paul Erd\\H{o}s using real analytic methods. Later still,\nD.J.~Newman used just the usual Hayman saddle-point approach, ubiquitous in\nasymptotic analysis. Fristedt introduced a probabilistic approach, which was\nfurther extended by Dan Romik, for restricted partition functions. Our\nperspective is that the Laplace transform changes the essentially algebraic\ngenerating function into an exponential form. Using this, we carry out the\nexercise of deriving the leading order asymptotics, following the\nFristedt-Romik approach. We also give additional examples of the Laplace\ntransform method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
