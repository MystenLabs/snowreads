So far, practical applications have\nbeen limited to second-order calculations due to the lack of a generic\nalgorithm to constrain the average particle number of the symmetry-broken\nstate. This limitation is presently lifted and a general BMBPT formalism is\npresented that allows to constrain the particle-number expectation value at\narbitrary order P. The constraint can be incorporated in closed form by solving\na polynomial equation of degree P-1. The numerical procedure is illustrated\nthrough BMBPT(3) calculations of calcium isotopes using a nuclear Hamiltonian\nderived within chiral effective field theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
