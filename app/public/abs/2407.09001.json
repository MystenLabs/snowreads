While the topologies in\ndifferent spaces are widely studied separately, their coexistence and coupling\nin single phase is seldomly explored. Here, we report a novel phenomenon that\narises from the interaction of topological magnetism and band topology, the\nmulti-space topology, in 2D ferromagnetic lattice. Based on continuum theory\nand tight-binding model, we reveal that the interconnection between\nskyrmion/bimeron and QAH state generates distinctive localized chiral bound\nstates (CBSs). With moderating topological magnetism through magnetic field,\nthe multi-space topologies accompanied with different CBSs can be reversed,\nfacilitating the coupling of multi-space topologies. By performing\nfirstprinciples and atomic spin model simulations, we further demonstrate such\nmulti-space topologies and their coupling in monolayer Cr2NSb. These results\nrepresent an important step towards the development of multispace topological\nphenomena in 2D lattice.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
