The \"plug-in\" estimator obtained by applying\nthe target functional to the empirical distribution of samples is biased.\nResampling methods such as the bootstrap derive artificial datasets from the\noriginal one by resampling. Comparing the outcome of the plug-in estimator in\nthe original and resampled datasets allows estimating and thus correcting the\nbias. In the asymptotic setting, iterations of this procedure attain an\narbitrarily high order of bias correction, but finite sample results are\nscarce. This work develops a new theoretical understanding of bootstrap bias\ncorrection by viewing it as an iterative linear solver for the combinatorial\noperation of M\\\"obius inversion. It sharply characterizes the regime of linear\nconvergence of the bootstrap bias reduction for moment polynomials. It uses\nthese results to show its superalgebraic convergence rate for band-limited\nfunctionals. Finally, it derives a modified bootstrap iteration enabling the\nunbiased estimation of unknown order-$m$ moment polynomials in $m$ bootstrap\niterations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
