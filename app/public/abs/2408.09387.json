For example, the rabbinical school of\nBeit Hillel says that one boy and one girl are necessary, whereas Beit Shammai\nurges for two boys. Surprisingly enough, although the corresponding average\nfamily sizes differ in both cases, the gender ratios remain constant. We show\nmore that for any family planning rule the gender ratio is equal to the birth\nodds. The proof of this result is given by using different mathematical\ntechniques, such as induction principle, Doob's optional-stopping theorem, and\nbrute-force. We conclude that, despite possible asymmetries in the religiously\nmotivated family planning rules, they discriminate neither boys nor girls.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
