We give a\nprecise description of the most likely configurations of the particles under\nthis law for $N$ large and $\\b,\\e$ fixed. Particles spread out over a distance\n$2^{2N/3}$, essentially in finite time, and subsequently arrange themselves so\nthat at time $2N/3$ they cover a grid of width $\\e$ with one particle per site.\nAfter time $2N/3$, the bulk of the particles and their descendants do not move\nanymore, while the particles in a boundary layer of width $2^{N/3}$ form a\n``staircase\" to the particles in the bulk. At time $N$, each site in the\nboundary layer is occupied by $2^{N/3}$ particles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"10PCMI-EDOP-3ynM5O2-rKQvMK5x0CqTf8JW4UQJS20","pdfSize":"1124524"}
