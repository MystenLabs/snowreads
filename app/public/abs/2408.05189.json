As an application, we show that to test\nK-semistability, it suffices to test special test configurations. We also show\nthat special test configurations give rise to lc places of torus equivariant\nbounded complements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
