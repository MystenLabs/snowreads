In order to\nobtain the energy spectrum we resort to the Rayleigh-Ritz method with\npolynomial and Gaussian basis sets. We compare present results with those\nderived recently by other authors. We discuss the limits of large and small box\nradius and also do some calculations with perturbation theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
