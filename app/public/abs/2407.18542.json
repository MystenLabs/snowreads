We show analytically that (open-loop) optimal protocols are not affected\nby activity, but work fluctuations are always increased. For closed-loop\nprotocols, which rely on initial measurements of the self-propulsion, the\naverage work has a minimum for a finite persistence time. Using these insights,\nwe derive an optimal cyclic active information engine, which is found to have a\nhigher precision and information efficiency when operated with a run-and-tumble\nparticle than for an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle and, we argue, than for\nany other type of active particle.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mGRhKlwNwJRZRjo2wsHRnaYdQDih7VXLdD5YHkRuavQ","pdfSize":"673420"}
