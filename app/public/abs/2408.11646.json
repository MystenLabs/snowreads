To help address these challenges,\nresearchers have developed multimodal search engines and mathematical question\nanswering systems. This book begins with a simple framework characterizing the\ninformation tasks that people and systems perform as we work to answer\nmath-related questions. The framework is used to organize and relate the other\ncore topics of the book, including interactions between people and systems,\nrepresenting math formulas in sources, and evaluation. We close with some key\nquestions and concrete directions for future work. This book is intended for\nuse by students, instructors, and researchers, and those who simply wish that\nit was easier to find and use mathematical information\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
