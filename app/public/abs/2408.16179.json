The increased\nquantity, complexity, and variety of astronomical data demand a parallel\nincrease in skill and sophistication in developing, deciding, and deploying\nstatistical methods. Understanding limitations and appreciating nuances in\nstatistical and machine learning methods and the reasoning behind them is\nessential for improving data-analytic proficiency and acumen. Aiming to\nfacilitate such improvement in astronomy, we delineate cautionary tales in\nstatistics via six maxims, with examples drawn from the astronomical\nliterature. Inspired by the significant quality improvement in business and\nmanufacturing processes by the routine adoption of Six Sigma, we hope the\nroutine reflection on these Six Maxims will improve the quality of both data\nanalysis and scientific findings in astronomy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
