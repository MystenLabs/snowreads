The relevant geometry is given by the modified Wasserstein distance\nintroduced by Figalli and Gigli that allows for a change of mass by letting the\nboundary act as a reservoir. We give a dynamic formulation of this distance as\nan action minimisation problem for curves of non-negative measures satisfying a\ncontinuity equation in the spirit of Benamou-Brenier. Then we characterise\nsolutions to non-linear diffusion equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions\nas metric gradient flows of internal energy functionals in the sense of curves\nof maximal slope.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
