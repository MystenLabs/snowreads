The discrete counting of the ticks of these clocks does not depend\non the metric frame. It remains well defined for the beginning epochs of the\nuniverse. The photon clock counts the oscillations of electromagnetic plane\nwaves in the cosmic reference frame. It can be gauged with clocks for other\nmassless or massive particles. These equivalent clocks form a clock system\nwhich defines a common universal continuous physical time. For the photon clock\nthis physical time coincides with conformal time. The universe is eternal\ntowards the past for typical models of inflationary cosmology -- the photon\nclock ticks an infinite number of times. We compare the photon clock system to\ngeodesic physical time, which is a frame invariant generalization of proper\ntime.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
