The obtained\nresults recover the necessary density conditions for coherent frames and Riesz\nsequences for general unimodular amenable groups, while providing more precise\nestimates under additional localization conditions on the coherent system for\ngroups of polynomial growth.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
