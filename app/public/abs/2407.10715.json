We show that the asymptotic size of the largest component restricted\nto a window is the log of the volume of that window. We adopt methods from the\ndiscrete setting, including a sharpness result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vr-4RXWq6DWR4_IHAFgbiWkS2iDJlHFOsou4RDjuBaA","pdfSize":"4492358"}
