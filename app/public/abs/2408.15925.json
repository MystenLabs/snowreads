(2) Any $s$-order\nunivariate multiplicity code over the alphabet $\\mathbb{F}_p^s$ ($p$ is a\nprime) of block length $n$ and rate $R$ with pair-wise distinct evaluation\npoints $\\{\\alpha_i\\}_{i\\in[n]}\\subset\\mathbb{F}_p$ are\n$\\left(\\frac{L}{L+1}\\left(1-\\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\\right),L\\right)$ (average-radius)\nlist-decodable for list size $L\\in[s]$.\n  Choose $s=\\Theta(1/\\epsilon^2)$ and $L=O(1/\\epsilon)$, our results imply that\nboth explicit folded RS codes and explicit univariate multiplicity codes\nachieve list decoding capacity $1-R-\\epsilon$ with evidently optimal list size\n$O(1/\\epsilon)$, which exponentially improves the previous state-of-the-art\n$(1/\\epsilon)^{O(1/\\epsilon)}$ established by Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf, and\nWootters (FOCS 2018 or SICOMP, 2023) and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2024). In particular,\nour results on folded Reed--Solomon codes fully resolve a long-standing open\nproblem originally proposed by Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2006 or IEEE TIT,\n2008). Furthermore, our results imply the first explicit constructions of\n$(1-R-\\epsilon,O(1/\\epsilon))$ (average-radius) list-decodable codes of rate\n$R$ with polynomial-sized alphabets in the literature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
