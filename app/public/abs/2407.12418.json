The goal is to synthesize superheavy\nisotopes at the new DC-280 (Dubna Cyclotron) cyclotron of the Joint Institute\nfor Nuclear Research (JINR). With the 48Ca ion beam intensity of about 5-7 pmcA\n(particle micro ampere) and the Delta-E counter count rate of approximately\n1.0E+4 sec-1, we observe a decrease in the overall registration efficiency of\nthe gas Delta-E counter. The paper proposes a solution to this problem:\nintroduction of an additional negatively biased electrode, which results in the\nstabilization of the Delta-E detector operation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ve-XnB7TLLTbhePDTWubKcUjoYGrptGBFG5YFYoXVP8","pdfSize":"1404471"}
