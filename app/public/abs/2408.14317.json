Several deep learning and transformer-based models have been proposed\nfor this task over the years. With the introduction of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) and their superior performance in several NLP tasks, we have seen a\nsurge of LLM-based approaches to claim verification along with the use of novel\nmethods such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this survey, we\npresent a comprehensive account of recent claim verification frameworks using\nLLMs. We describe the different components of the claim verification pipeline\nused in these frameworks in detail including common approaches to retrieval,\nprompting, and fine-tuning. Finally, we describe publicly available English\ndatasets created for this task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"M-Xz1V4S7-Z2XAN8VZ-8qs886saGy1cqzlEINhzLtyk","pdfSize":"533267"}
