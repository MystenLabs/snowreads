When the given boundary is the\nclosed tubular neighborhood in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ of a smooth Jordan curve (or,\nmore generally, the closed tubular neighborhood in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ of a smooth\nembedding of $\\mathbb{S}^{d-2}$ in a hyperplane), we prove existence and\nuniqueness of classical minimizers, for which the collapsing phenomenon does\nnot occur. We show that the boundary of the unique minimizer is the union of\ntwo symmetric smooth normal graphs over a portion of the plane; the graphs have\npositive constant mean curvature bounded linearly in terms of the volume\nparameter, and meet the boundary of the tubular neighbourhood orthogonally.\nMoreover, we prove uniform bounds on the sectional curvatures in order to show\nthat the boundaries of solutions corresponding to varying volumes are ordered\nmonotonically and produce a foliation of space by constant mean curvature\nhypersurfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
