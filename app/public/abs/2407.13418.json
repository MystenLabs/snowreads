It is a continuation of a previous work by\nthe authors where spatial weights were compared for a steady-state case. A\nhigher-order finite elements approach is compared to a more cost-efficient\nhigher-order reconstruction approach. Numerical examples point out the results\nregarding accuracy, efficiency and stability reasons.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
