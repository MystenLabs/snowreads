However, camera-based sensing technologies introduce\nsignificant privacy concerns. This study investigates the impact of transparent\nuser interface design on user acceptance of these systems. We conducted an\nonline study with 42 participants using prototypes varying in transparency,\nchoice, and deception levels. The prototypes included three onboarding designs:\n(1) a traditional Terms and Conditions text, (2) a Business Nudge design that\nsubtly encouraged users to accept default data-sharing options, and (3) a\nTransparent Walk-Through that provided clear, step-by-step explanations of data\nuse and privacy policies. Our findings indicate that transparent design\nsignificantly affects user experience measures, including perceived creepiness,\ntrust in data use, and trustworthiness of content. Transparent onboarding\nprocesses enhanced user experience and trust without significantly increasing\nonboarding time. These findings offer practical guidance for designing\nuser-friendly and privacy-respecting in-car health monitoring systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
