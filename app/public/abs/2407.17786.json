To our best knowledge, all existing binary image\ndownsampling methods do not have such topology-preserving guarantees. We also\nimplemented a baseline morphological operation (dilation)-based approach that\nalways generates topologically correct results. However, we found the\nsimilarity scores to be much worse. We demonstrate several applications of our\napproach. First, generating smaller versions of medical image segmentation\nmasks for easier human inspection. Second, improving the efficiency of binary\nimage operations, including persistent homology computation and shortest path\ncomputation, by substituting the original images with smaller ones. In\nparticular, the latter is a novel application that is made feasible only by the\nfull topology-preservation guarantee of our method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
