These random\nwords need to be converted into ranged values without statistical bias. We\npresent an efficient algorithm to generate multiple independent\nuniformly-random bounded integers from a single uniformly-random binary word,\nwithout any bias. In the common case, our method uses one multiplication and no\ndivision operations per value produced. In practice, our algorithm can more\nthan double the speed of unbiased random shuffling for small to moderately\nlarge arrays.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JjOSUFQC7s3tCJnZkuSkia4BNptuqSojGPoMWGnI2vA","pdfSize":"597264"}
