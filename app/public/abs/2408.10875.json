Using this equivalence, we relate the (oriented)\nThompson index to several classical topological link invariants, and give both\nthe lower and upper bounds of the maximal Thurston-Bennequin number of a knot\nin terms of the oriented Thompson index. Moreover, we give a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between half grid diagrams and elements in symmetric groups and\ngive a new description of link group using two elements in a symmetric group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
