This is notably the case in the\nCeCo$_{x}$Rh$_{1-x}$In$_{5}$ system where the ground-state wave function can\nprovide the basis for antiferromagnetism and/or unconventional\nsuperconductivity. We develop a methodology to understand the local magnetic\nanisotropy and experimentally investigate with neutron spectroscopy applied to\nantiferromagnetic ($T_{N}$=3.8 K) CeRhIn$_{5}$ which is isostructural to\n$d$-wave superconducting ($T_{c}$=2.3 K) CeCoIn$_{5}$. Through diagonalizing\nthe local crystal field Hamiltonian with discrete tetragonal $\\mathrm{C}_{4}$\npoint group symmetry and coupling these states with the Random Phase\nApproximation (RPA), we find two distinct modes polarized along the\ncrystallographic $c$ and $a-b$ planes, agreeing with experiment. The anisotropy\nand bandwidth, underlying the energy scale of these modes, are tuneable with a\nmagnetic field which we use experimentally to separate in energy single and\nmultiparticle excitations thereby demonstrating the instability of excitations\npolarized within the crystallographic $a-b$ plane in CeRhIn$_{5}$. We compare\nthis approach to a $S_{eff}={1\\over 2}$ parameterizations and argue for the\nneed to extend conventional SU(2) theories of magnetic excitations to utilize\nthe multi-level nature of the underlying crystal-field basis states constrained\nby the local point-group $\\mathrm{C}_{4}$ symmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WZ-F_9a7_O4_L_EslVGdrm4fbTdIjWIbZfqbMGrQHpA","pdfSize":"1561010"}
