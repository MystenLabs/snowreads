Consequently, there is a growing demand for interpretable models in\nsuch contexts. In this study, we introduce Model-based Deep Rule Forests\n(mobDRF), an interpretable representation learning algorithm designed to\nextract transparent models from data. By leveraging IF-THEN rules with\nmulti-level logic expressions, mobDRF enhances the interpretability of existing\nmodels without compromising accuracy. We apply mobDRF to identify key risk\nfactors for cognitive decline in an elderly population, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in subgroup analysis and local model optimization. Our method\noffers a promising solution for developing trustworthy and interpretable\nmachine learning models, particularly valuable in fields like healthcare, where\nunderstanding differential effects across patient subgroups can lead to more\npersonalized and effective treatments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YEFtDEtvF6WyIYKvjyWD0PhBWputojqB-uyiBpWRhec","pdfSize":"552089"}
