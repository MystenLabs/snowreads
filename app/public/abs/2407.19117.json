It focuses on the use of Distributed\nMultiThreaded CheckPointing (DMTCP) in various computational settings,\nincluding both within and outside of containers. The study is grounded in\nreal-world applications running on NERSC Perlmutter, a state-of-the-art\nsupercomputing system. We discuss the advantages of checkpoint-restart (C/R) in\nmanaging complex and lengthy computations in HPC, highlighting its efficiency\nand reliability in such environments. The role of DMTCP in enhancing these\nworkflows, especially in multi-threaded and distributed applications, is\nthoroughly explored. Additionally, the paper delves into the use of HPC\ncontainers, such as Shifter and Podman-HPC, which aid in the management of\ncomputational tasks, ensuring uniform performance across different\nenvironments. The methods, results, and potential future directions of this\nresearch, including its application in various scientific domains, are also\ncovered, showcasing the critical advancements made in computational\nmethodologies through this study.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
