The advantage of the PBW degenerate flags (as opposed to their\nclassical analogues) is the existence of a large group of symmetries for the\ngraph closures. We discuss the combinatorial, algebraic and geometric sides of\nthe picture. In particular, we show that toric degenerations of Borovik,\nSturmfels and Sverrisd\\'ottir are still available in the general settings. We\nalso derive a description of the graph closures for flag varieties in terms of\nquiver representations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
