We show that theories in which a gauge coupling\nincreases through a first-order phase transition naturally result in `axion\nrelic pockets': regions of relic false vacua stabilised by the pressure from a\nkinematically trapped, hot axion gas. Axion relic pockets provide a viable and\nhighly economical theory of dark matter: the macroscopic properties of the\npockets depend only on a single parameter (the phase transition temperature).\nWe describe the formation, evolution and present-day properties of axion relic\npockets, and outline how their phenomenology is distinct from existing dark\nmatter paradigms. We briefly discuss how laboratory experiments and\nastronomical observations can be used to test the theory, and identify\ngamma-ray observations of magnetised, dark-matter-dense environments as\nparticularly promising.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
