Building upon DIN's core principles, DHIN\nintroduces healthcare-specific components to tackle data fragmentation across\nproviders and institutions, establishing a sovereign architecture for\nhealthcare provision. It facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming\nbarriers to accessing diverse health data sources. This comprehensive framework\nleverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal\nhealth record (PHR), extending DIN's personal data stores concept to ensure\nhealth data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol\nimplemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare,\ntailored for medical data; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism\nadapted from DIN to incentivize participation in healthcare AI development.\nDHIN operates on a public blockchain with an immutable record, ensuring that no\nentity can control access to health data or determine financial benefits. It\nsupports effective AI training while allowing patients to maintain control over\ntheir health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized\necosystem. Unique to DHIN, patients receive rewards in digital wallets as an\nincentive to opt into the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to fund\ndecentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel,\nself-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements\nexisting systems, and redefines universal coverage, showcasing how DIN\nprinciples can transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while\nempowering patients.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
