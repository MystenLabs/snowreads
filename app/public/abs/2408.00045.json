This assumption breaks\ndown for complex networks, in which nodes may be extremely diverse, and no\nsingle component can truly represent the state of the entire system. It seems,\ntherefore, that to observe the dynamics of social, biological or technological\nnetworks, one must extract the dynamic states of a large number of nodes -- a\ntask that is often practically prohibitive. To overcome this challenge, we use\nmachine learning techniques to detect the network's sentinel nodes, a set of\nnetwork components whose combined states can help approximate the average\ndynamics of the entire network. The method allows us to assess the state of a\nlarge complex system by tracking just a small number of carefully selected\nnodes. The resulting sentinel node set offers a natural probe by which to\npractically observe complex network dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
