Our analysis is based on experimental observations conducted\non $MoTe_{2}$ planar Josephson junctions (JJ) subjected to out-of-plane\nmagnetic fields. We emphasize the pivotal role of symmetry breaking in current\ndirectionality for the occurrence of the JDE. Specifically, we observe the\nemergence of asymmetric Andreev bound states (ABSs) and $0$-$\\pi$-like\ntransitions with $\\varphi_0$-shifts in the current phase relations (CPRs) in\nsystems with specific symmetry breaking induced by SOC and Zeeman fields,\nleading to different critical current magnitudes in opposite directions.\nAdditionally, we explore the influence of parameters such as the strength of\nSOC, Zeeman field magnitude and orientation, conduction channels with different\ntransverse momenta, and junction lengths on the JDE efficiencies. Our results\nindicate the potential for diverse approaches to modulate efficiencies and\nprovide insights that can aid in the discovery of materials and design of\nJosephson diodes with significantly enhanced efficiency.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
