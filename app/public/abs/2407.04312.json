In this note, we review two kinds of inverse problems: the\nfirst is the estimation of the initial size-distribution from moments\nmeasurements in a depolymerising system, in collaboration with Philippe Moireau\nand inspired by experiments carried out by Human Rezaei's team; the second is\nthe inference of fragmentation characteristics from size distribution samples,\nin collaboration with Miguel Escobedo and Magali Tournus, based on biological\nquestions and experiments of Wei-Feng Xue's team.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
