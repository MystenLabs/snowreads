Aligned nanofibers have emerged as powerful and versatile\ntools, attributable to their structural and biochemical congruence with the\nnatural extracellular matrix (ECM). This review delineates the contemporary\napplications of aligned nanofibers in tissue engineering, spotlighting their\nimplementation across musculoskeletal, neural, and cardiovascular tissue\ndomains. The influence of fiber alignment on critical cellular behaviors - cell\nadhesion, migration, orientation, and differentiation - is reviewed. We also\ndiscuss how nanofibers are improved by adding growth factors, peptides, and\ndrugs to help tissues regenerate better. Comprehensive analyses of in vivo\ntrials and clinical studies corroborate the efficacy and safety of these fibers\nin tissue engineering applications. The review culminates with exploring extant\nchallenges, concurrently charting prospective avenues in aligned\nnanofiber-centric tissue engineering.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
