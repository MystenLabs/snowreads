We consider realistic environmental and technical\nconditions such as frequency and position broadening. Even when considering a\nsignificant frequency broadening in the ensemble (approximately 300 GHz), we\nobserve up to a three-fold increase in directional scattering from the resonant\nlattice in a system. The model can be used to scalably design quantum optical\nelements, e.g. a quantum lens, harnessing atomistic engineering (e.g. via ion\nimplantation) of collective interactions in materials to enhance quantum\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
