I\nargue that there is a notion of gauge transformation, the extended notion,\nwhich is different from the original gauge transformation of electromagnetism,\nbut at the same time not trivial, which allows the making of that claim. I\nfurther argue that one can expect that this claim can be extended to more\ngeneral theories, and that Dirac's conjecture may be true for some physically\nreasonable theories and only in this sense of gauge transformation. Finally, I\nargue that the extended notion of gauge transformation seems unnatural from the\npoint of view of classical theories, but that it nicely fits with the way\nquantum versions of gauge theories are constructed.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7QL7Km57GushKn-haeQWzZrf_yhbp8NRbaTAa0jljAs","pdfSize":"2656127"}
