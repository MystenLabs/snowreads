Extending previous results, we show that a sigma-model with this\ntarget space can be expected to possess a large N=4 superconformal symmetry,\nsupporting speculations that this sigma-model may be dual to Type IIB\nsuperstring theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1. The sigma-model is parametrized\nby three integers -- the rank of the gauge group, the instanton number, and a\n\"level\" (the integer coefficient of a topologically nontrivial B-field,\nanalogous to a WZW level). These integers are expected to correspond to two\nfive-brane charges and a one-brane charge. The sigma-model is weakly coupled\nwhen the level, conjecturally corresponding to one of the five-brane changes,\nbecomes very large, keeping the other parameters fixed. The central charges of\nthe large N=4 algebra agree, at least semiclassically, with expectations from\nthe duality.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
