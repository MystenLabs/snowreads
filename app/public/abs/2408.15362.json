In this\nwork, we present a number of tensor operator norms as a means to approximately\nbound the error associated with linear methods and determine the situations in\nwhich that maximum error is encountered. An emphasis is placed on induced norms\nthat can be computed in terms of matrix or tensor eigenvalues associated with\ncoefficient tensors from higher-order Taylor series. These operator norms can\nbe used to understand the performance and range of applicability of an\nalgorithm exploiting linear approximations in different sets of coordinates. We\nexamine uses of tensor operator norms in the context of linear and higher-order\nrendezvous guidance, coordinate selection for a filtering measurement model,\nand to present a unified treatment of nonlinearity indices for dynamical\nsystems. Tensor norm computations can offer insights into these problems in one\nto two orders of magnitude less time than similarly accurate sampling methods\nwhile providing more general understanding of the error performance of linear\nor higher-order approximations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e5aux9XyBQhcYNc64I_2jbNlI0-is0uFl9oYQecpp4Y","pdfSize":"2151749"}
