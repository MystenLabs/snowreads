In this work we show the nonlinear\nstability of small enough nonsingular solitons. The method of proof involves\nthe use of vector field methods as in a previous work by the second and third\nauthors dealing with the Einstein's field equations under the Belinski-Zakharov\nformalism, extending for all times the size of suitable null weighted norms of\nthe perturbations at time zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
