Despite their significant advancements, these models may be\nused for malicious purposes, such as misinformation, deception, and copyright\nviolation. In this paper, we provide a systematic and timely review of research\nefforts on defenses against AI-generated visual media, covering detection,\ndisruption, and authentication. We review existing methods and summarize the\nmainstream defense-related tasks within a unified passive and proactive\nframework. Moreover, we survey the derivative tasks concerning the\ntrustworthiness of defenses, such as their robustness and fairness. For each\ntask, we formulate its general pipeline and propose a taxonomy based on\nmethodological strategies that are uniformly applicable to the primary\nsubtasks. Additionally, we summarize the commonly used evaluation datasets,\ncriteria, and metrics. Finally, by analyzing the reviewed studies, we provide\ninsights into current research challenges and suggest possible directions for\nfuture research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
