The postulated mechanism of chemophoresis is the\ninteraction of the particle (via an adsorption potential) with the chemical\ninhomogeneities in the surrounding medium. When the range of this interaction\nis much smaller than any other relevant scale in the system, the (translational\nand rotational) phoretic velocities can be described in terms of a phoretic\ncoefficient and a slip fluid velocity at the surface of the particle. Using the\ncase of a spherical particle as a simple and physically insightful example,\nhere we exploit an integral representation of the rigid-body motion to\ncritically re-examine this framework. The systematic analysis highlights two\nsteps in the approximation: first the thin-layer approximation (very large\nparticle size), and subsequently a lubrication approximation (slow variation of\nthe adsorption potential along the tangential direction). We also discuss how\nthese approximations could be relaxed and the effect of this on the particle's\nmotion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
