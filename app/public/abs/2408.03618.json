An important factor\ncontributing to LLMs' suboptimal performance in generating coherent arguments\nis their oversight of logical fallacies. To address this issue, we introduce\nFIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization\nmethods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a\nclassification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy\ncategories. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces\nthe fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results\nindicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method\nsignificantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as prior preference\noptimization methods, such as DPO. These findings highlight the importance of\nensuring models are aware of logical fallacies for effective argument\ngeneration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
