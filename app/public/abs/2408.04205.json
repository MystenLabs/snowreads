However, existing methods\ndesigned for two-dimensional radio maps face challenges of high measurement\ncosts and limited data availability when extended to 3D scenarios. To tackle\nthese challenges, we first build a real-world large-scale 3D radio map dataset,\ncovering over 4.2 million m^3 and over 4 thousand data points in complex urban\nenvironments. We propose a Gaussian Process Regression-based scheme for 3D\nradio map estimation, allowing us to realize more accurate map recovery with a\nlower RMSE than state-of-the-art schemes by over 2.5 dB. To further enhance\ndata efficiency, we propose two methods for training point selection, including\nan offline clustering-based method and an online maximum a posterior\n(MAP)-based method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme\nnot only achieves full-map recovery with only 2% of UAV measurements, but also\nsheds light on future studies on 3D radio maps.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"AGAT0AF_HLyU3t4I_0-hEPv2s6WI6Mtt-mypFwZK8x0","pdfSize":"3125167"}
