Numerous methods exist to mitigate charge noise, including improving\ndevice fabrication, dynamical decoupling, and real-time parameter estimation.\nIn this work, we demonstrate a new class of techniques to mitigate charge noise\nin semiconductor quantum dots by controlling the noise sources themselves.\nUsing two different classical feedback methods, we stabilize an individual\ncharged two-level fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot. These control methods\nreduce the low-frequency component of the noise power spectrum by an order of\nmagnitude. These techniques also enable stabilizing the fluctuator in either of\nits states. In the future, such techniques may enable improved coherence times\nin quantum-dot spin qubits.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
