It was\nobserved that the rotation to this special basis may introduce a Galois\nsymmetry relating different integrals. We argue that the proposed notion of\nself-duality for maximal cuts stems from a very natural notion of self-duality\nfrom twisted cohomology. Our main result is that, if the differential equations\nand their duals are simultaneously brought into canonical form, the cohomology\nintersection matrix is a constant. Furthermore, we show that one can associate\nquite generically a Lie algebra representation to an {\\epsilon}-factorised\nsystem. For maximal cuts, this representation is irreducible and self-dual. The\nconstant intersection matrix can be interpreted as expressing the equivalence\nof this representation and its dual, which in turn results in constraints for\nthe differential equation matrix. Unlike the earlier proposal, the most natural\nsymmetry of the differential equation matrix is defined entirely over the\nrational numbers and is independent of the basis choice.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
