While many BIQA methods employ\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) and incorporate saliency detectors to enhance\nperformance, their large model sizes limit deployment on resource-constrained\ndevices. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel and non-deep-learning\nBIQA method with a lightweight saliency detection module, called Green\nSaliency-guided Blind Image Quality Assessment (GSBIQA). It is characterized by\nits minimal model size, reduced computational demands, and robust performance.\nExperimental results show that the performance of GSBIQA is comparable with\nstate-of-the-art DL-based methods with significantly lower resource\nrequirements.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
