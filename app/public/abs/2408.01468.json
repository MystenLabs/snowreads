Furthermore, our analysis shows that scalar quantities\nrelated to space-time curvature and parameters associated with the\nmatter-energy distribution remain finite at the wormhole throat. Moreover, they\ndiminish as distance extends toward infinity, indicating the asymptotic\nflatness inherent in our model.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FJXV80XI6xFkUKg2udsf0U7BcX_lRrJu8rYujPSkVIA","pdfSize":"188811","txDigest":"EAsYnUXgz4jrzgjtWqYva9sZK3SqhmqYKzzfdPfhbymw","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
