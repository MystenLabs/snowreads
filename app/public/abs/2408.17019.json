There are broadly two types of these companions:\nthe left and the right variable inclusion companions. Another type of\ncompanions of logics induced by Hilbert-style presentations (Hilbert-style\nlogics) were introduced in a recent paper. A sufficient condition for the\nrestricted rules companion of a Hilbert-style logic to coincide with its left\nvariable inclusion companion was proved there, while a necessary condition\nremained elusive. The present article has two parts. In the first part, we give\na necessary and sufficient condition for the left variable inclusion and the\nrestricted rules companions of a Hilbert-style logic to coincide. In the rest\nof the paper, we recognize that the variable inclusion restrictions used to\ndefine variable inclusion companions of a logic\n$\\langle\\mathcal{L},\\vdash\\rangle$ are relations from\n$\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{L})$ to $\\mathcal{L}$. This leads to a more general idea\nof a relational companion of a logical structure, a framework that we borrow\nfrom the field of universal logic. We end by showing that even Hilbert-style\nlogics and the restricted rules companions of these can be brought under the\numbrella of the general notions of logical structures and their relational\ncompanions that are discussed here.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
