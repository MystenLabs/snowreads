In this paper we use data on the geography\nof programming languages used in open-source software projects to extend\neconomic complexity ideas to the digital economy. We estimate a country's\nsoftware economic complexity and show that it complements the ability of\nmeasures of complexity based on trade, patents, and research papers to account\nfor international differences in GDP per capita, income inequality, and\nemissions. We also show that open-source software follows the principle of\nrelatedness, meaning that a country's software entries and exits are explained\nby specialization in related programming languages. We conclude by exploring\nthe diversification and development of countries in open-source software in the\ncontext of large language models. Together, these findings help extend economic\ncomplexity methods and their policy considerations to the digital sector.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8erlow9F5usdRVy3a6J-8c2UULOITrCa53fIv14JRm0","pdfSize":"9449435"}
