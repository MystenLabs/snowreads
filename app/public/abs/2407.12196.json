In this work, we broaden our scope to a practically unbounded set\nof \\textit{affective states}, which includes any terms that humans use to\ndescribe their experiences of feeling. We collect and publish MASIVE, a dataset\nof Reddit posts in English and Spanish containing over 1,000 unique affective\nstates each. We then define the new problem of \\textit{affective state\nidentification} for language generation models framed as a masked span\nprediction task. On this task, we find that smaller finetuned multilingual\nmodels outperform much larger LLMs, even on region-specific Spanish affective\nstates. Additionally, we show that pretraining on MASIVE improves model\nperformance on existing emotion benchmarks. Finally, through machine\ntranslation experiments, we find that native speaker-written data is vital to\ngood performance on this task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
