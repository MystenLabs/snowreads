In this paper, we discuss the impact that the features commonly used\nin multilingual programming have on our capability of specifying and analyzing\nthem. To this end, we first outline a few broad categories of multilingual\nprogramming, according to the mechanisms that are used for inter-language\ncommunication. Based on these categories, we describe several instances of\nmultilingual programs, as well as the intricacies that formally reasoning about\ntheir behavior would entail. We also summarize the state of the art in\nmultilingual program analysis, including the challenges that remain open. These\ncontributions can help understand the lay of the land in multilingual program\nspecification and analysis, and motivate further work in this area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
