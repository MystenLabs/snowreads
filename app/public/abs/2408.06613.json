This\nmethod combines the idea of exponential integrator and energy-preserving\ncollocation methods, effectively preserving the energy dissipation ratio\nintroduced by the damping terms. We demonstrate the conservative properties of\nthese methods and confirm their order of accuracy through numerical experiments\ninvolving the damped Burger's equation and Korteweg-de-Vries equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
