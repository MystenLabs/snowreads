In this work, we propose a Gaussian quantum metrology protocol\nassisted by initial position-momentum correlations (PM). We employ a correlated\nGaussian wave packet as a probe to examine the dynamics of Quantum Fisher\nInformation (QFI) and purity based on PM correlations to demonstrate how to\nestimate the PM correlations and, more importantly, to unlock its potential\napplications such as a resource to enhance quantum thermometry. In the\nlow-temperature regime, we find an improvement in the thermometry of the\nsurrounding environment when the original system exhibits a non-null initial\ncorrelation (correlated Gaussian state). In addition, we explore the connection\nbetween the loss of purity and the gain in QFI during the process of estimating\nthe effective environment coupling and its effective temperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
