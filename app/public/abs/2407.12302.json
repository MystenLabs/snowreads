Although SLSNe\nwere simply defined by their peak luminosity at first, it is currently\nrecognized that they show rich spectroscopic diversities including\nhydrogen-poor (Type I) and hydrogen-rich (Type II) subtypes. The exact\nmechanisms making SLSNe luminous are still not fully understood, but there are\nmainly four major suggested luminosity sources (radioactive decay of 56Ni,\ncircumstellar interaction, magnetar spin-down, and fallback accretion). We\nprovide an overview of observational properties of SLSNe and major theoretical\nmodels for them. Future transient surveys are expected to discover SLSNe at\nhigh redshifts which will provide a critical information in revealing their\nnature.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
