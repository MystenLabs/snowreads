We give a systematic overview on vacuous reduct semantics\nresulting from combining different admissibility-based and conflict-free\nsemantics and present a principle-based analysis of vacuous reduct semantics in\ngeneral. We provide criteria for the inheritance of principle satisfaction by a\nvacuous reduct semantics from its base and vacuity condition for established as\nwell as recently introduced principles in the context of weak argumentation\nsemantics. We also conduct a principle-based analysis for the special case of\nundisputed semantics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
