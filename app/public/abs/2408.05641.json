This paper is an initial attempt to\ncomprehensively investigate coarticulation. We leverage existing\nElectromagnetic Articulography (EMA) datasets to develop and train a\nphoneme-to-articulatory (P2A) model that can generate realistic EMA for novel\nphoneme sequences and replicate known coarticulation patterns. We use\nmodel-generated EMA on 9K minimal word pairs to analyze coarticulation\nmagnitude and extent up to eight phonemes from the coarticulation trigger, and\ncompare coarticulation resistance across different consonants. Our findings\nalign with earlier studies and suggest a longer-range coarticulation effect\nthan previously found. This model-based approach can potentially compare\ncoarticulation between adults and children and across languages, offering new\ninsights into speech production.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fQQNob1u6KGhVzCRIgRS4FbqmBJWjkgOJHajM6M4hCg","pdfSize":"813444"}
