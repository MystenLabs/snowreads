Current accessibility testing tools\ncan identify accessibility issues but may not always provide guidance on how to\naddress them. We introduce FixAlly, an automated tool designed to suggest\nsource code fixes for accessibility issues detected by automated accessibility\nscanners. FixAlly employs a multi-agent LLM architecture to generate fix\nstrategies, localize issues within the source code, and propose code\nmodification suggestions to fix the accessibility issue. Our empirical study\ndemonstrates FixAlly's capability in suggesting fixes that resolve issues found\nby accessibility scanners -- with an effectiveness of 77% in generating\nplausible fix suggestions -- and our survey of 12 iOS developers finds they\nwould be willing to accept 69.4% of evaluated fix suggestions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PpNV079jwXJpxC-5KTRAH77X_M9ApfuJ0Ma-XQIk3vE","pdfSize":"3126907"}
