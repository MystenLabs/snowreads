We mainly focus on the evolution of cooperation\nwith two-order and higher-order game in two-layer network. We introduce a bias\ncoefficient of utility function and study the influence of bias coefficient on\nthe evolution of cooperation in two-layer network. We firstly provide\ntheoretical analysis of fixation probabilities of two-order and higher-order\ngame under weak selection in two-layer network.Secondly,based on the expression\nof fixation probability, we obtain the critical value of the two different\ngames by comparing the size relationship of fixation probability under weak\nselection condition and neutral selection condition. Finally, by comparing the\nrelationship between the critical value of single-layer and two-layer network\nin two-order game and higher-order game, when the nonlinear factor satisfies\ncertain conditions, it is concluded that when the optimal bias coefficient\ntends towards 0 is met, some two-layer networks promote the evolution of\ncooperative behavior more than some single-layer networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
