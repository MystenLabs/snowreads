Let $n,k$ denote\nintegers with $n>2k\\geq 6$. Let $V$ denote a vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$\nthat has dimension $n$. The vertex set of the Grassmann graph $J_q(n,k)$\nconsists of the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Two vertices of $J_q(n,k)$\nare adjacent whenever their intersection has dimension $k-1$. Let $\\partial$\ndenote the path-length distance function of $J_q(n,k)$. Pick vertices $x,y$ of\n$J_q(n,k)$ such that $1<\\partial(x,y)<k$. Let $\\text{Stab}(x,y)$ denote the\nsubgroup of $GL(V)$ that stabilizes both $x$ and $y$. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the orbits of $\\text{Stab}(x,y)$ acting on the local graph\n$\\Gamma(x)$. We show that there are five orbits. By construction, these five\norbits give an equitable partition of $\\Gamma(x)$; we find the corresponding\nstructure constants. In order to describe the five orbits more deeply, we bring\nin a Euclidean representation of $J_q(n,k)$ associated with the second largest\neigenvalue of $J_q(n,k)$. By construction, for each orbit its characteristic\nvector is represented by a vector in the associated Euclidean space. We compute\nmany inner products and linear dependencies involving the five representing\nvectors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
