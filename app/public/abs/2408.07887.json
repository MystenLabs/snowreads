Among these, those with\nsignificant Berry-phase-related transport responses are of particular interest.\nHere, we predict a new type of quasiparticle called topological charge\nquadruple (TCQ), which is analogous to a charge quadrupole but consists of two\nclosely-packed pairs of Weyl points in momentum space, specifically in a\nhalf-Heusler antiferromagnet NdBiPt. Interestingly, the TCQ is protected by the\nspin-orbit $U(1)$ quasi-symmetry, rather than any exact crystallographic\nsymmetries. This quasi-symmetry restricts the energy splitting induced by\nsymmetry-lowering perturbations to a second-order effect. Furthermore, the\nclosely located Berry curvature sources and sinks in the TCQ lead to a large\nBerry curvature dipole, resulting in a significant nonlinear Hall effect. Our\nwork opens an avenue for designing novel quasiparticles using quasi-symmetries\nand developing materials with enhanced nonlinear responses.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ko7ONfUXXIXkkGdQUzWH1I3KEKiy2xsUYglcOohwG80","pdfSize":"1609848"}
