Previous work considered observers with\n  non-negative slope in every location. In this paper we treat\n  observers that have both positive and negative rates. Our\n  main result is an algorithm to decide a gap version of the\n  reachability problem for this variant of MPTA. We translate the\n  gap reachability problem into a gap satisfiability problem for mixed\n  integer-real systems of nonlinear constraints. Our main technical\n  contribution -- a result of independent interest -- is a procedure\n  to solve such contraints via a combination of branch-and-bound\n  and relaxation-and-rounding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mDEhhDZtD49x-j3cKjjb7y3aq1aNqluuF24LCLuCXPs","pdfSize":"640691"}
