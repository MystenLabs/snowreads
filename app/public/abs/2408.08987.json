In the\nfirst study, the Fermilab Booster magnets were held constant at magnetic fields\ncorresponding to the injection energy. The beam loss and emittance growth were\nobserved under varying intensity, tunes, and sextupole resonances. The\ncorresponding beam conditions were also simulated with the MADX-SC\ncode~\\cite{Schmidt:2644660}. In the second study, measurements of the vertical\nhalf-integer resonance and correction methods are conducted for high-intensity\nbeams ramping in the Booster. Finally, syncho-betatron instabilities are\nobserved during transition-crossing in the Booster under strong space-charge\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nUiQtgXD07pvhBeBl88kfFVscePg7fmFgLzYPr7Jz98","pdfSize":"7480105"}
