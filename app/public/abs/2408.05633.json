The computational power of a neuron is hence\nenhanced by subcellular compartmentalization and nonlinear synaptic\nintegration, but the biophysical determinants of these features in human\nneurons are not completely understood. By examining the synaptic input-output\nfunction of human neocortical pyramidal neurons, we found that the nonlinearity\nthreshold at the soma was linearly determined by the shortest path distance\nfrom the synapse to the apical trunk, and the slope of this relationship was\nconsistent throughout the dendritic arbor. Analogous rules were found from both\nsupragranular and infragranular layers of the rodent cortex, suggesting that\nthese represent a fundamental property of pyramidal neurons. Additionally, we\nfound that neurons associated with tumor or epilepsy had distinct membrane\nproperties, but the nonlinearity threshold was shifted in amplitude such that\nthe slope of its relationship with synaptic distance remained consistent.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iBbz8X20y9NQZrzrMlOfJJEN2uCAtug5od8cGsd9bxs","pdfSize":"2491312"}
