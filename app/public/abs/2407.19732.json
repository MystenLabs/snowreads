However, it encounters\nchallenges in managing conflicting transactions that negatively affect\nthroughput and latency. This paper proposes a novel solution to address these\nchallenges and improve performance, especially in applications incorporating\nextensive volumes of highly conflicting transactions. Our solution involves\nreallocating the Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) of the validation\nphase to a preceding stage in the transaction flow to enable early detection of\nconflicting transactions. Specifically, we propose and evaluate two innovative\nmodifications, called Orderer Early MVCC (OEMVCC) and OEMVCC with Execution\nAvoidance (OEMVCC-EA). Our experimental evaluation results demonstrate\nsignificant throughput and latency improvements, providing a practical solution\nfor high-conflict applications that demand high performance and scalability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
