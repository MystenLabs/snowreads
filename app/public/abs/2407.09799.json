Along the bulge minor axis, and close to\nthe Galactic plane, metal-rich stars display a higher line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion compared to metal-poor stars, while at higher latitudes metal-rich\nstars have lower velocity dispersions than metal-poor stars, similar to what is\nfound in the Galactic disc. In this work, we re-examine this issue, by studying\nthe dependence of line-of-sight velocity dispersions on metallicity and\nlatitude in the latest APOGEE Data Release 17, confirming the results of\nprevious works. We then analyse an N-body simulation of a Milky Way-like\ngalaxy, also taking into account observational biases introduced by the APOGEE\nselection function. We show that the inversion in the line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge can be reproduced\nby our model. We show that this inversion is a natural consequence of a\nscenario in which the bulge is a boxy/peanut-shaped structure, whose metal-rich\nand metal-poor stars mainly originate from the thin and thick disc of the Milky\nWay, respectively. Due to their cold kinematics, metal-rich, thin disc stars,\nare efficiently trapped in the boxy/peanut bulge, and, at low latitudes, show a\nstrong barred morphology, which results in high velocity dispersions which are\nlarger than those attained by the metal-poor populations. Extremely metal-rich\nstars in the Galactic bulge, which have received renewed attention in the\nliterature, do follow the same trends as those of the metal-rich populations.\nThe line-of-sight velocity-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge for\nmetal-poor and metal-rich stars are thus both an effect of the intrinsic nature\nof the Galactic bulge and of the angle at which we observe it from the Sun.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
