To ensure that the system state stays in a safe region (e.g., to avoid\ncollisions with obstacles), barrier functions are widely utilized. As the\nsystem dimension increases, deriving suitable barrier functions becomes\nextremely complex. Fortunately, many systems consist of multiple subsystems,\nsuch as different areas where the disease occurs. In this work, we present\nsufficient conditions for interconnected switched impulsive systems to maintain\nsafety by constructing local barrier functions for the individual subsystems\ninstead of a global one, allowing for much easier and more efficient\nderivation. To validate our results, we numerically demonstrate its\neffectiveness using an epidemiological model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
