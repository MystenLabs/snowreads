We provide a probability generating function for the distribution\nof the longest path length, and we use Analytic Combinatorics to perform\nasymptotic analysis of the probability distribution in the case of equal part\nsizes $n = k$ tending toward infinity. We show that the distribution is\nasymptotically Gaussian, and we obtain precise asymptotics for the mean and\nvariance. These results address a question asked by Peter J.
