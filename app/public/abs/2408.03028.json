Disrupting the\northogonality property between subcarriers (SCs) is considered as one of the\njammers targets in OFDM based generations. Focusing on the orthogonality\nproperty, we propose a method to detect the attacked subcarriers, and then\nneutralize the jamming attack using a multiplicative signal. Thanks to studying\nthe frequency aspect of the attacked signal, the proposed method is independent\nof the jammers transmitted power. Simulation results evaluate the detection\nperformance of the proposed method with various numbers of OFDM subcarriers.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
