We use finite automata to give simple algorithmic\nproofs, complete with their time complexity analyses, of two key ingredients in\nthe proof of this result--the first one states that certain linear orders\ncalled hammocks associated with such algebras are \\emph{finite description\nlinear orders}, i.e., they lie in the smallest class of linear orders that\ncontains finite linear orders and $\\omega$, and that is closed under\nisomorphisms, order-reversals, binary sums, co-lexicographic products and\nfinitary shuffles. We also document a complete proof of the result that the\nclass of order types(=order-isomorphism classes) of finite description linear\norders coincides with that of languages of finite automata under inorder.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
