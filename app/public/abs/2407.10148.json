Our theory is based on spatially localized\nlinear combinations of crystalline Gaussian-type orbitals and, as such, capable\nof exposing local features within periodic electronic structures in a more\nintuitive and robust manner than alternatives based on the spatial distribution\nof atomic basis functions alone. Early decomposed cohesive energies of both\nmolecular polymers and different crystalline polymorphs demonstrate how the\natomic properties yielded by our theory convincingly align with the expected\ncharge polarization in these systems, also whenever partial charges and\nMadelung energies may lend themselves somewhat ambiguous to interpretation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
