Ultrafilters, essential in topology and set theory, are\nextended to these systems, with a focus on their relationship to graph width\nparameters, which help analyze graph complexity. We demonstrate theorems for\nultrafilters on connectivity systems and explore related concepts such as\nprefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases. New parameters for width, length,\nand depth are introduced, providing further insight into graph width. The study\nalso includes a comparison of various graph width parameters and their related\nconcepts, offering a foundation for future research in graph theory and\ncomputational complexity. Additionally, we explore connections to other\nmathematical disciplines, including set theory, lattice theory, and matroid\ntheory, expanding the scope of ultrafilters and graph width. (It also includes\ninformation similar to that found in surveys, aiming to promote future research\non graph width parameters.)\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zz0FrxTd1032O5w2nYQu2--fePLMoMIv3KsS8AM2eqs","pdfSize":"2057652"}
