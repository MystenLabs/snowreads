Dynamic decision making is supported by continuous reflection and\nmemory updates, ensuring alignment with user expectations and enhanced\nefficiency. The framework's ability to generate personalized user profiles and\nreal-time decisions offers significant advancements for urban EV charging\nmanagement. Future work could focus on incorporating more intricate scenarios\nand expanding data sources to enhance predictive accuracy and practical\nutility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
