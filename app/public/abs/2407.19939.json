The main new\ningredient is the exponent-tightness of these words, which also allows to\ngeneralize the construction of PBW bases of the untwisted quantum loop algebra\nvia the combinatorics of loop words.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
