Expanding upon this premise, our\npaper introduces an open-source benchmark for multi-modal generative models\ntailored for Verilog synthesis from visual-linguistic inputs, addressing both\nsingular and complex modules. Additionally, we introduce an open-source visual\nand natural language Verilog query language framework to facilitate efficient\nand user-friendly multi-modal queries. To evaluate the performance of the\nproposed multi-modal hardware generative AI in Verilog generation tasks, we\ncompare it with a popular method that relies solely on natural language. Our\nresults demonstrate a significant accuracy improvement in the multi-modal\ngenerated Verilog compared to queries based solely on natural language. We hope\nto reveal a new approach to hardware design in the large-hardware-design-model\nera, thereby fostering a more diversified and productive approach to hardware\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"59o6M-AtGGlQ5I0xF-sguITUCSJ0JCGIvYdiAfv5FCc","pdfSize":"1046607","objectId":"0x9ea569796793d12b95ccfd918bd85f9c2a702c9743c313819ccab98ea327c7f1","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
