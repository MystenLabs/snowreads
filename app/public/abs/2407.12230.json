Padded\ndecompositions have been studied for decades and have found numerous\napplications, including metric embedding, multicommodity flow-cut gap, muticut,\nand zero extension problems, to name a few. In these applications, parameter\n$\\beta$, called the padding parameter, is the most important parameter since it\ndecides either the distortion or the approximation ratios. For general graphs\nwith $n$ vertices, $\\beta = \\Theta(\\log n)$. Klein, Plotkin, and Rao showed\nthat $K_r$-minor-free graphs have padding parameter $\\beta = O(r^3)$, which is\na significant improvement over general graphs when $r$ is a constant. A\nlong-standing conjecture is to construct a padded decomposition for\n$K_r$-minor-free graphs with padding parameter $\\beta = O(\\log r)$. Despite\ndecades of research, the best-known result is $\\beta = O(r)$, even for graphs\nwith treewidth at most $r$. In this work, we make significant progress toward\nthe aforementioned conjecture by showing that graphs with treewidth $\\rm{tw}$\nadmit a padded decomposition with padding parameter $O(\\log \\rm{tw})$, which is\ntight. As corollaries, we obtain an exponential improvement in dependency on\ntreewidth in a host of algorithmic applications: $O(\\sqrt{ \\log n \\cdot\n\\log(\\rm{tw})})$ flow-cut gap, max flow-min multicut ratio of\n$O(\\log(\\rm{tw}))$, an $O(\\log(\\rm{tw}))$ approximation for the 0-extension\nproblem, an $\\ell^{O(\\log n)}_\\infty$ embedding with distortion $O(\\log\n\\rm{tw})$, and an $O(\\log \\rm{tw})$ bound for integrality gap for the uniform\nsparsest cut.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
