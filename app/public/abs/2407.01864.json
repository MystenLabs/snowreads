To solve this problem, this study proposes an improved YOLOv8\ndetection method based on the original YOLOv8 model by integrating the BoTNet\nmodule, GAM attention mechanism and EIoU loss function. By optimising the\nfeature extraction and multi-scale feature fusion strategies, the training and\ninference processes are simplified, and the detection accuracy and efficiency\nare significantly improved. Experimental results show that the improved model\nperforms well in both detection speed and accuracy, with an accuracy rate of\n99.4%, and the model is smaller and easy to deploy, which is able to identify\nand classify distracted driving behaviours in real time, provide timely\nwarnings, and enhance driving safety.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
