This study addresses this by evaluating three models for selling\nelectrolyzer-generated heat to district heating grids: constant, flexible, and\nrenewable-source hydrogen production, with and without heat sales. Using\nagent-based modeling and multi-criteria decision-making methods (VIKOR, TOPSIS,\nPROMETHEE), it finds that selling excess heat can cut hydrogen production costs\nby 5.6%. The optimal model operates flexibly with electricity spot prices,\nincludes heat sales, and maintains a hydrogen price of 3.3 EUR/kg.\nEnvironmentally, hydrogen production from grid electricity could emit up to\n13,783.8 tons of CO2 over four years from 2023. The best economic and\nenvironmental model uses renewable sources and sells heat at 3.5 EUR/kg\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cAqQmWSRICu4Fs9nwS7P2Le86JSxBc1d7BZXFqVKNmY","pdfSize":"599502"}
