In practice, liner shipping companies include block stowage patterns\nthat ensure that containers in above and below deck partitions of bays have the\nsame destination. Despite preventing restows, increasing free space, and\nbenefits for crane makespan and hydrostatics, this practical planning\nrequirement is rarely included in stowage optimization models. In our paper, we\nintroduce a novel 0-1 IP model that searches in the space of valid paired block\nstowage patterns, named template planning, which ensures sufficient vessel\ncapacity and limits to crane makespan, trim, and bending moment. Our results\nshow that template planning outperforms traditional allocation planning\nconcerning optimality and runtime efficiency while preserving a sufficiently\naccurate representation of master planning constraints and objectives.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
