We provide a\nsystematic comparison of different combination procedures, both from a\ntheoretical perspective and through simulation. We show that many prominent\np-value combination methods (e.g. Fisher's method) are not invariant to the\norientation of the underlying one-sided p-values. Only Edgington's method, a\nlesser-known combination method based on the sum of p-values, is\norientation-invariant and provides confidence intervals not restricted to be\nsymmetric around the point estimate. Adjustments for heterogeneity can also be\nmade and results from a simulation study indicate that the approach can compete\nwith more standard meta-analytic methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RwJlD__zWZP7CwMVv3T6tGyjyaPafePoSCXTSXh0jAU","pdfSize":"1844613"}
