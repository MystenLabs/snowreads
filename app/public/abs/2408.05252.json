Using it we present an effective method for computing Weierstrass\nfunctions, their periods, and elliptic integral in Weierstrass form given\nWeierstrass invariants $g_2$ and $g_3$ of an elliptic curve. Similarly to the\nclassical Landen's method our algorithm has quadratic rate of convergence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MXjm_SPCDeSW0um3KVW1m5I-FALBY7omQMAcXq--V9o","pdfSize":"297639"}
