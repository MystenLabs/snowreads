The\nprotocol combines optimal quantum control of continuously measured masses with\ntheir non-equilibrium dynamics, driven by a time-dependent interaction\nstrength. Applied to a pair of optically trapped sub-micron particles coupled\nvia electrostatic interaction, our protocol enables unconditional entanglement\ngeneration at the fundamental limit of the conditional state and with an order\nof magnitude smaller interaction between the masses compared to the existing\nsteady-state approaches.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
