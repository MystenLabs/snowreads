To illustrate the current state of knowledge\nabout the equation, a thorough but concise discussion is made on what can be\nachieved analytically within this framework for well-known phenomenological\ninteractions, including Coulomb, soft-core, Cornell, Kratzer, and exponential\ntype interactions. In the non-exponential cases, the equation, depending on the\nchosen interaction, is studied in relation to the confluent, doubly-confluent,\nand biconfluent Heun functions. Furthermore, to show the need for careful\ntreatment of various parity states, a Kratzer-type potential, such as a\ngeneralized Coulomb interaction, is discussed in depth using the Lie algebraic\napproach, showing the need for careful analysis of abnormal parity states in a\nfairly explicit way. The energies obtained are discussed using some figures to\nexplicitly show the different regimes, as well as the absence of the Klein\nparadox. Finally, some directions for future work that would undoubtedly need\nto be explored in this field are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rPTGUe94sXEAQ8sagLA4zTrQ8B2SagcaU9CI98Kj7Ik","pdfSize":"462624"}
