Sufficient conditions for the usual stochastic order and the\nhazard order are established under chain majorization. We study stochastic\ncomparisons under different settings of T-transform for various values of chain\nmajorization. We establish usual stochastic order and hazard rate order between\ntwo mixture random variables when a matrix of model parameters and mixing\nproportions changes to another matrix in some mathematical sense. Sufficient\nconditions for the star order and Lorenz order are established under weakly\nsupermajorization. The results of this paper are illustrated with numerical\nexamples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
