Flux functions (Hamiltonians)\nare not assumed to be convex in the state (gradient) variable. The proof\nconsists in proving the convergence of two numerical schemes. We rely on the\ntheory developed by B.~Andreianov, K.~H.~Karlsen and N.~H.~Risebro\n(\\textit{Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal.}, 2011) for such scalar conservation laws\nand on the viscosity solution theory developed by the authors (\\textit{arxiv},\n2023) for the corresponding HJ equation. This study allows us to characterise\ncertain germs introduced in the AKR theory (namely maximal and complete ones)\nand relaxation operators introduced in the viscosity solution framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
