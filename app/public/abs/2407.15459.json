Despite the complex process involved in battery\nmanufacturing -- from material synthesis to cell assembly -- there has been no\ncomprehensive study systematically organizing this information. In response, we\npropose a language modeling-based protocol, Text-to-Battery Recipe (T2BR), for\nthe automatic extraction of end-to-end battery recipes, validated using a case\nstudy on batteries containing LiFePO4 cathode material. We report machine\nlearning-based paper filtering models, screening 2,174 relevant papers from the\nkeyword-based search results, and unsupervised topic models to identify 2,876\nparagraphs related to cathode synthesis and 2,958 paragraphs related to cell\nassembly. Then, focusing on the two topics, two deep learning-based named\nentity recognition models are developed to extract a total of 30 entities --\nincluding precursors, active materials, and synthesis methods -- achieving F1\nscores of 88.18% and 94.61%. The accurate extraction of entities enables the\nsystematic generation of 165 end-toend recipes of LiFePO4 batteries. Our\nprotocol and results offer valuable insights into specific trends, such as\nassociations between precursor materials and synthesis methods, or combinations\nbetween different precursor materials. We anticipate that our findings will\nserve as a foundational knowledge base for facilitating battery-recipe\ninformation retrieval. The proposed protocol will significantly accelerate the\nreview of battery material literature and catalyze innovations in battery\ndesign and development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RLlAxQo5ktqN0Dto9YZ3k_pGEGlE3Xw8Fl7uEoKJvjc","pdfSize":"1317665","objectId":"0x031972abfb3e4310c80b6634f09e76b594ae76b5dcccffc76496dba26d6a2e2a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
