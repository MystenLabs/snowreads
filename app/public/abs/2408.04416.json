For this, we numerically study the evolution of the\nmagnon spectrum of rectangular waveguides upon rolling its cross-section up to\na full tube. Magnon spectra are calculated over a wide range of magnetization\nstates using a finite-element dynamic-matrix method, which allows us to trace\nthe evolution of the magnon frequencies and several critical magnetic fields\nwith increasing curvature. By analyzing the parity of the higher-order magnon\nmodes, we find a curvature-induced mode hetero-symmetry that originates from a\nchiral contribution to the exchange interaction and is related to the Berry\nphase of magnons in closed loops. Importantly, this curvature-induced parity\nloss has profound consequences for the linear coupling between different\npropagating magnons, allowing for hybridization between initially orthogonal\nmodes. In this context, we demonstrate the integral role of edge modes in\nforming the magnon spectrum in full tubes. Our findings provide new theoretical\ninsights into curvilinear magnetization dynamics and are relevant for\ninterpreting and designing experiments in the field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
