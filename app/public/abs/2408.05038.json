These events may contain valuable information about the underlying\nfundamental plasma dynamics as they are not described by the standard flare\nmodel. The detection of QPP signals in flare lightcurves is hindered by their\nintrinsically non-stationary nature, contamination by noise, and the\ncontinuously increasing amount of flare observations. Hence, the creation of\nautomated techniques for QPP detection is imperative. We implemented the Fully\nConvolution Network (FCN) architecture to classify the flare lightcurves\nwhether they have exponentially decaying harmonic QPP or not. To train the FCN,\n90,000 synthetic flare lightcurves with and without QPP were generated. After\ntraining, it showed an accuracy of 87.2% on the synthetic test data and did not\nexperience overfitting. To test the FCN performance on real data, we used the\nsubset of stellar flare lightcurves observed by Kepler, with strong evidence of\ndecaying QPP identified hitherto with other methods. Then, the FCN was applied\nto find QPPs in a larger-scale Kepler flare catalogue comprised of 2274 events,\nresulting in a 7% QPP detection rate with a probability above 95%. The FCN,\nimplemented in Python, is accessible through a browser application with a\nuser-friendly graphical interface and detailed installation and usage guide.\nThe obtained results demonstrate that the developed FCN performs well and\nsuccessfully detects exponentially decaying harmonic QPP in real flare data,\nand can be used as a tool for preliminary sifting of the QPP events of this\ntype in future large-scale observational surveys.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
