Our goal is to understand the\nunderlying asymmetric overlapping community structure by analyzing the mixed\nmemberships of nodes. We introduce a new model, the multi-layer mixed\nmembership stochastic co-block model (multi-layer MM-ScBM), to model\nmulti-layer directed networks in which nodes can belong to multiple\ncommunities. We develop a spectral procedure to estimate nodes' memberships in\nboth sending and receiving patterns. Our method uses a successive projection\nalgorithm on a few leading eigenvectors of two debiased aggregation matrices.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first work to detect asymmetric overlapping\ncommunities in multi-layer directed networks. We demonstrate the consistent\nestimation properties of our method by providing per-node error rates under the\nmulti-layer MM-ScBM framework. Our theoretical analysis reveals that increasing\nthe overall sparsity, the number of nodes, or the number of layers can improve\nthe accuracy of overlapping community detection. Extensive numerical\nexperiments are conducted to validate these theoretical findings. We also apply\nour method to one real-world multi-layer directed network, gaining insightful\nresults.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
