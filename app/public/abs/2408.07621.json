We then apply this framework to information set decoding,\nstudy success probabilities and give tools to choose variables. Finally, we use\nthis to attack two cryptosystems based on convolutional codes. In the first,\nour code recovered about 74% of errors in less than 10 hours each, and in the\nsecond case, we give experimental evidence that 80% of the errors can be\nrecovered in times corresponding to about 60 bits of operational security, with\nsome instances being significantly lower.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
