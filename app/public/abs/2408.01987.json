By\nGershgorin, we know that $\\mathbf{M}_{\\sigma}$ can be made stable by making\n$\\sigma$ large enough. We prove a relation which analytically determines when\nand how we are able to find the value of $\\sigma$ such that the maximal\neigenvalue is exactly zero. In so doing, we prove the equivalence of the roots\nof the characteristic polynomial of $\\mathbf{M}_{\\sigma}$ and the eigenvalues\nthat arise from a scaling operation on $\\mathbf{M}$. Further, through the\ncharacteristic polynomial, we are able to isolate the dominant feedback cycles\ncomprising the elements of the matrix which, under the action of $\\sigma$,\nensures the stability of the system. We then explore, using the stabilising and\ndestabilising cycles within the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial,\nan intrinsic spectral signature associated with any matrix based on the size\nand sign (or zero) of its respective elements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
