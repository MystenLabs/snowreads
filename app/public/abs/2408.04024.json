We are\ninvestigating the parity-time symmetric coupled Duffing oscillator system with\nnonlinear dissipation/amplification. In our investigation of the temporal\ndynamics of this system, it is observed that the system exhibits chaotic as\nwell as quasiperiodic dynamics. On further investigation, it is found that the\nchaotic dynamics is distorted anti-phase synchronized, whereas the\nquasiperiodic dynamics is desynchronized. So, on the application of the ICO\nlearning in these two parametric regimes, we observe that the weight associated\nwith the stimulus remains constant when the oscillators are anti-phase\nsynchronized, in spite of there being distortion in the synchronization. But\nwhen the oscillators exhibit quasiperiodic dynamics, there is erratic evolution\nof the weight with time. So, from this, it could be ascertained that the ICO\nlearning could be made use of in the classification of synchronization dynamics\nin nonlinear systems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ggO5iXBmwPvTdRcwva2jw47ZkEo6Xd2jA99qNmHYNBI","pdfSize":"545529"}
