While nonlocal metasurfaces with strong\nchiral responses to the incident light have been reported, these responses are\ntypically limited to a narrow range of incident angles. In this study, we\ndemonstrate a nonlocal metasurface that showcases strong chirality,\ncharacterized by circular dichroism larger than 0.6, over a wide range of\nincident angles $\\pm5^o$. Its quality factor, circular dichroism and resonant\nfrequency can be optimized by design. These findings pave the way to further\nadvance the development of valley-selective optical cavities and augmented\nreality applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
