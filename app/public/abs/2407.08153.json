In this paper,\nwe propose a Lifelong Whole Slide Retrieval (LWSR) framework to address the\nchallenges of catastrophic forgetting by progressive model updating on\ncontinuously growing retrieval database. Our framework aims to achieve the\nbalance between stability and plasticity during continuous learning. To\npreserve system plasticity, we utilize local memory bank with reservoir\nsampling method to save instances, which can comprehensively encompass the\nfeature spaces of both old and new tasks. Furthermore, A distance consistency\nrehearsal (DCR) module is designed to ensure the retrieval queue's consistency\nfor previous tasks, which is regarded as stability within a lifelong CBHIR\nsystem. We evaluated the proposed method on four public WSI datasets from TCGA\nprojects. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed method is\neffective and is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
