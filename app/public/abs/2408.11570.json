Our research aims to enhance cybersecurity measures for a\nwide range of applications for IoT, such as robotic self-driving and several\nuses contexts. Memristor (MR) design optimized for in-memory processing is\nintroduced. Our work highlights the development of a 4-bit state memristor\ndevice tailored for various range of arithmetic functions in a hardware\nprototype of AES system. Additionally, we propose a pipeline AES design aimed\nat harnessing extensive parallelism and ensuring compatibility with MR devices.\nThis approach enhances hardware performance by by managing larger data amounts,\naccelerating computational, and achieving greater precision demands. Compared\nto traditional AES hardware, AES-IMC demonstrates an approximate 30 %\nimprovement in power with a comparable throughput rate. Compared with the\nlatest AES-based NVM engines, AES-IMC achieves an impressive 62 % improvement\nin throughput at similar power dissipation levels. The IMC-developed design\nwill protect against unintentional incidents involving unmanned devices,\nreducing the risks associated with hostile assaults such as hijacking and\nillegal control of robots. This helps to reduce the possible economic and\nfinancial losses caused by incidents\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
