Our method gathers quality feedback through self-play simulations with\nMonte Carlo tree search and LLM-based reflection, which can then be used to\nlearn high-level strategic skills such as how to evaluate states that guide the\nlow-level execution.We showcase how our method can be used in both action\nplanning and dialogue generation in the context of games, achieving good\nperformance on both tasks. Specifically, we demonstrate that our method can\nhelp train agents with better performance than both traditional reinforcement\nlearning-based approaches and other LLM-based skill learning approaches in\ngames including the Game of Pure Strategy (GOPS) and The Resistance: Avalon.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eXT0uJCBo8U1KsgQO_EsUqLm_ZbTvCWTYNWu_dBPp9U","pdfSize":"2789306"}
