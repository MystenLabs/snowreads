First, we consider perfectly\nperiodic electron combs, which do not produce QE-electron entanglement,\npreserving the purity of the QE while inducing Rabi-like dynamics in it. We\nextend our findings to realistic, non-ideally modulated electron wavepackets,\nshowing that the phenomenology persists, and exploring their use to prepare the\nemitter in a desired quantum state. Thus, we establish the balance that\nelectron comb size, emitter radiative decay, and electron-emitter coupling\nstrength must fulfil in order to implement our ideas in experimentally feasible\nplatforms. Finally, moving into the limit of small electron combs, we reveal\nthat these wavefunctions allow for quantum state tomography of their target,\nproviding access not only to the populations, but also the coherences of the QE\ndensity matrix. We believe that our theoretical results showcase modulated\nfree-electrons as very promising tools for quantum technologies based on\nlight-matter coupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
