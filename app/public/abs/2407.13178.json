Symmetric finite\ndifference is often applied in numerical analysis to enhance the accuracy of\napproximations. Then, the paper investigates utilization of the symmetric\nfinite difference in the LBP formulation for face detection and facial\nexpression recognition. It introduces a novel approach that extends the\nstandard LBP, which typically employs eight directional derivatives, to\nincorporate only four directional derivatives. This approach is named symmetric\nLBP. The number of LBP features is reduced to 16 from 256 by the use of the\nsymmetric LBP. The study underscores the significance of the number of\ndirections considered in the new approach. Consequently, the results obtained\nemphasize the importance of the research topic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cBrNJqxlwA_wjnFBjO4t6giBjsFced3iJHwSVdCtf-0","pdfSize":"929748"}
