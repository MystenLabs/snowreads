Historically, scientists have approached this problem by employing\ncomplex physics models to reconstruct the spatial fields. However, these\nmethods are often computationally intensive. With the increase in popularity of\nmachine learning (ML), several researchers have applied ML to the spatial field\nreconstruction task and observed improvements in computational efficiency. One\nsuch method in arXiv:2101.00554 utilizes a sparse mask of sensor locations and\na Voronoi tessellation with sensor measurements as inputs to a convolutional\nneural network for reconstructing the global spatial field. In this work, we\npropose multiple adjustments to the aforementioned approach and show\nimprovements on geoscience and fluid dynamics simulation datasets. We identify\nand discuss scenarios that benefit the most using the proposed ML-based spatial\nfield reconstruction approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
