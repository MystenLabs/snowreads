We suggest adopting the multi-scale structural\ncomplexity (MSSC) measure, an approach that defines structural complexity of an\nobject as the amount of dissimilarities between distinct scales in its\nhierarchical organization. In this work, we apply MSSC to the case of visual\nstimuli, using an open dataset of images with subjective complexity scores\nobtained from human participants (SAVOIAS). We demonstrate that MSSC correlates\nwith subjective complexity on par with other computational complexity measures,\nwhile being more intuitive by definition, consistent across categories of\nimages, and easier to compute. We discuss objective and subjective elements\ninherently present in human perception of complexity and the domains where the\ntwo are more likely to diverge. We show how the multi-scale nature of MSSC\nallows further investigation of complexity as it is perceived by humans.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
