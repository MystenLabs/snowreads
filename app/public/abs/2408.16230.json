The\ndynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first\nprinciples time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic\npartitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating\nmaterials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity\",\nthat is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that\nfor disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense\nplasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization\nstate, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group\nconductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of\narchetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high-\ndensity WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
