In dRGT massive gravity theory, we\nproduce two types of WH solutions in our present paper. Selecting a static and\nspherically symmetric metric for the background geometry, we obtain the field\nequations for exact WH solutions. We derive the WH geometry completely for the\ntwo different choices of redshift functions. All the energy conditions\nincluding the NEC are violated by the obtained WH solutions. Various plots are\nused to illustrate the behavior of the wormhole for a suitable range of\n$m^2c_1$, where $m$ is the graviton mass. It is observed that the photon\ndeflection angle becomes negative for all values of $m^2c_1$ as a result of the\nrepulsive action of gravity. It is also studied that the repulsive impact of\nmassive gravitons pushes the spacetime geometry so strongly that the asymptotic\nflatness is affected. The Volume Integral Quantifier (VIQ) has also been\ncomputed to determine the amounts of matter that violate the null energy\ncondition. The complexity factor of the proposed model is also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
