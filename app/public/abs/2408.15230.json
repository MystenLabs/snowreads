Using high-efficient\ncluster algorithms and the lifted worm algorithm, we present a systematic study\nof the FSS of the four-dimensional Ising model in the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK)\nbond and loop representations. Our numerical results reveal the FSS behaviors\nof various geometric and physical quantities in the three representations,\noffering robust evidence for the logarithmic correction form conjectured by the\nfield theory. In particular, clear evidence is obtained for the existence of\n$\\hat{y}_t=1/6$ in the loop representation, while it is difficult to extract in\nthe spin representations, because of mixing with the Gaussian-fixed-point\nasymptotics. In the FK-bond representation, the multiplicative logarithmic\ncorrection for the second-largest cluster is also numerically observed to be\ngoverned by an exponent $\\hat{y}_{h2} = -1/4$ with its exact value unknown yet.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
