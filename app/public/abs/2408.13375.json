To a representation $\\pi$ of $T$ and an involutive\nsolution of the Yang-Baxter equation (an $R$-matrix) verifying the \"extended\"\nreflection equation, we associate a character and a representation of the\nwreath product $G:=T\\wr \\mathfrak{S}_\\infty$. The set of extremal characters of\n$G$ is in bijection with a continuous set of parameters. In this article, we\ncharacterize exactly what subset of parameters does correspond to an extremal\nYang-Baxter character of $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
