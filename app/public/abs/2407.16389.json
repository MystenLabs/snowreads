The spacecraft equations of motion in the form of\nGauss Variational Equations (GVEs) are used. By shaping the Lyapunov function\nusing barrier functions, we demonstrate that state and control constraints\nduring orbital maneuvers can be enforced. Simulation results from orbital\nmaneuvering scenarios are reported. The synergistic use of the reference\ngovernor in conjunction with the barrier functions is proposed to ensure\nconvergence to the target orbit (liveness) while satisfying the imposed\nconstraints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
