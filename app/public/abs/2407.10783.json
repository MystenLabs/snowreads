We consider any finitely generated Kummer extension\n(possibly, over a cyclotomic extension) of an algebraic function field, and\ndescribe the structure of its Galois group. Our results show in a precise sense\nhow the questions of computing the degrees of these extensions and of computing\nthe group structures of their Galois groups reduce to the corresponding\nquestions for the Kummer extensions of their constant fields.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
