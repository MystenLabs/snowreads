This method is used to quantify uncertainty in\nthe inverse PDE PINN solutions. Recently, the Bayesian PINN (BPINN) method was\nproposed, where the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters was\nformulated using the Bayes' theorem and sampled using approximate inference\nmethods such as the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference\n(VI) methods. In this work, we demonstrate that HMC fails to converge for\nnon-linear inverse PDE problems. As an alternative to HMC, we sample the\ndistribution by solving the stochastic optimization problem obtained by\nrandomizing the PINN loss function. The effectiveness of the rPINN method is\ntested for linear and non-linear Poisson equations, and the diffusion equation\nwith a high-dimensional space-dependent diffusion coefficient. The rPINN method\nprovides informative distributions for all considered problems. For the linear\nPoisson equation, HMC and rPINN produce similar distributions, but rPINN is on\naverage 27 times faster than HMC. For the non-linear Poison and diffusion\nequations, the HMC method fails to converge because a single HMC chain cannot\nsample multiple modes of the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters in a\nreasonable amount of time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"7grgg7i-YT7w6uLEU_Xnm1Pl50XPGWoO2N6LPr-MFR0","pdfSize":"9981262"}
