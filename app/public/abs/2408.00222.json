Here we propose a\nmachine-learning-based universal solver for the hierarchical equations of\nmotion, one of the most widely used approaches which takes into account\nnon-markovian effects and nonperturbative system-environment interactions in a\nnumerically exact manner. We develop a neural quantum propagator model by\nutilizing the neural network architecture, which avoids time-consuming\niterations and can be used to evolve any initial quantum state for arbitrarily\nlong times. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model, we apply it to the\nsimulation of population dynamics and linear and two-dimensional spectra of the\nFenna-Matthews-Olson complex.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
