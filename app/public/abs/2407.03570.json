Sensing heterogeneity, which refers to varying data quality due to\nfactors such as device differences and user behaviors, presents a significant\nchallenge. In this research, we perform an extensive analysis of 3-axis\naccelerometer data from the MyShake system, a global seismic network utilizing\nsmartphones. We systematically evaluate the quality of approximately 22 million\n3-axis acceleration waveforms from over 81 thousand smartphone devices\nworldwide, using metrics that represent sampling rate and noise level. We\nexplore a broad range of factors influencing accelerometer data quality,\nincluding smartphone and accelerometer manufacturers, phone specifications\n(release year, RAM, battery), geolocation, and time. Our findings indicate that\nmultiple factors affect data quality, with accelerometer model and smartphone\nspecifications being the most critical. Additionally, we examine the influence\nof data quality on earthquake parameter estimation and show that removing\nlow-quality accelerometer data enhances the accuracy of earthquake magnitude\nestimation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
