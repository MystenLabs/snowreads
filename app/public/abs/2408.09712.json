We give a classification theorem of the\nfinite-dimensional irreducible representations of\n$U_{q,p}(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$ in terms of the theta function analogue of\nthe Drinfeld polynomial for the quantum affine algebra\n$U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$. We also construct the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases\nfor the level-0 $U_{q,p}(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$-modules following the work\nby Nazarov-Tarasov for the Yangian $Y(\\mathfrak{gl}_N)$-modules. This is a\nconstruction in terms of the Drinfeld generators. For the case of tensor\nproduct of the vector representations, we give another construction of the\nGelfand-Tsetlin bases in terms of the $L$-operators and make a connection\nbetween the two constructions. We also compare them with those obtained by the\nfirst author by using the $\\mathfrak{S}_n$-action realized by the elliptic\ndynamical $R$-matrix on the standard bases. As a byproduct, we obtain an\nexplicit formula for the partition functions of the corresponding 2-dimensional\nsquare lattice model in terms of the elliptic weight functions of type\n$A_{N-1}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
