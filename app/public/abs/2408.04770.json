We analyzed a\nlinear $f(Q, L_m)$ model of the form $f(Q, L_m) = -\\alpha Q + 2 L_{m} + \\beta$.\nUsing MCMC methods, we constrained the model parameters $H_0$, $\\alpha$, and\n$\\beta$ with various datasets, including $H(z)$, Pantheon+SH0ES, and BAO data.\nFor the $H(z)$ dataset, we found $H_0 = 67.90 \\pm 0.66$, $\\alpha =\n0.1072_{-0.0069}^{+0.0054}$, and $\\beta = -1988.2 \\pm 1.0$. For the\nPantheon+SH0ES dataset, $H_0 = 70.05 \\pm 0.68$, $\\alpha =\n0.0916_{-0.0033}^{+0.0028}$, and $\\beta = -1988.3 \\pm 1.0$. For the BAO\ndataset, $H_0 = 68.1 \\pm 1.0$, $\\alpha = 0.1029_{-0.0052}^{+0.0041}$, and\n$\\beta = -1988.24 \\pm 0.99$. Moreover, the energy density remains positive and\napproaches zero in the distant future, and the deceleration parameter indicates\na transition from deceleration to acceleration, with transition redshifts of\n$z_t = 0.60$, $z_t = 0.78$, and $z_t = 0.66$ for the respective datasets. These\nfindings align with previous observational studies and contribute to our\nunderstanding of the universe's expansion dynamics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
