Recently, mamba-based methods have achieved\npromising results in image enhancement tasks. However, these methods commonly\nrely on Vmamba, which focuses only on spatial information modeling and\nstruggles to deal with the cross-color channel dependency problem in underwater\nimages caused by the differential attenuation of light wavelengths, limiting\nthe effective use of deep networks. In this paper, we propose a novel UIE\nframework called O-mamba. O-mamba employs an O-shaped dual-branch network to\nseparately model spatial and cross-channel information, utilizing the efficient\nglobal receptive field of state-space models optimized for underwater images.\nTo enhance information interaction between the two branches and effectively\nutilize multi-scale information, we design a Multi-scale Bi-mutual Promotion\nModule. This branch includes MS-MoE for fusing multi-scale information within\nbranches, Mutual Promotion module for interaction between spatial and channel\ninformation across branches, and Cyclic Multi-scale optimization strategy to\nmaximize the use of multi-scale information. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.The code is available\nat https://github.com/chenydong/O-Mamba.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
