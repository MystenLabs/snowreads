In this study, we tackle this problem by applying\nthe Quantum-Train (QT) technique to a forecasting Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nmodel trained by Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with significant parameter\nreduction. The QT technique, originally successful in the A Matter of Taste\nchallenge at QHack 2024, leverages QML to reduce the number of trainable\nparameters to a polylogarithmic function of the number of parameters in a\nclassical neural network (NN). This innovative framework maps classical NN\nweights to a Hilbert space, altering quantum state probability distributions to\nadjust NN parameters. Our approach directly processes classical data without\nthe need for quantum embedding and operates independently of quantum computing\nresources post-training, making it highly practical and accessible for\nreal-world flood prediction applications. This model aims to improve the\nefficiency of flood forecasts, ultimately contributing to better disaster\npreparedness and response.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"eztl9Bk082ep-TN9Zey3iHC15GO7fOnt6-8SXhqt7-M","pdfSize":"3386435"}
