(2016). In this way we couple the spherically\nsymmetric mass distribution of the dark matter (DM) to the mass distribution of\nthe baryonic matter (BM). A commonly used model of the dark matter distribution\ncan be understood as an approximation of our model. Creation of a new Galactic\nmass model for orbit computations based on the coupling of the DM with an\nimproved BM model respecting the theoretical fit of the Galactic rotation\ncurve. The theoretical approach is based on a slight improvement of the BM\nmodel by Pouliasis et al. (2017) and on replacement of their DM model by the\nmodel based on the interpolating function by McGaugh et al. (2016). The\ntheoretical results are validated by the comparison with observational data.\nNew Galactic mass model for orbit computations is created. DM distribution is\ngiven and the rotation curve for the MW is consistent with observational data.\nThe Tully-Fisher relation holds and the values of several characteristics of\nthe MW for the region of the Sun are given, e.g., rotation speed $v_0$ =\n($228.8 \\pm 0.2$) ~ \\mbox{km} \\mbox{s}$^{-1}$, Oort constants $A=(+14.73 \\pm\n0.03) ~\\mbox{km} ~\\mbox{s}^{-1} ~\\mbox{kpc}^{-1} $, $B=(-13.01 \\pm 0.03)\n~\\mbox{km} ~\\mbox{s}^{-1} ~\\mbox{kpc}^{-1}$ and the mass density of the\nbaryonic matter $(0.087 \\pm 0.001) ~\\mbox{M}_{\\odot} ~\\mbox{pc}^{-3} $.\nImportant MW characteristics are the total BM mass $M_{BM}$ $=$ (8.43 $\\pm$\n0.01) $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ $\\mbox{M}_{\\odot}$, the total DM mass $M_{DM}$\n$\\doteq$ (1.34 $\\pm$ 0.01) $\\times$ 10$^{12}$ $\\mbox{M}_{\\odot}$, virial radius\nand virial mass of the MW, $M_{vir}$ $\\doteq$ $M_{DM}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
