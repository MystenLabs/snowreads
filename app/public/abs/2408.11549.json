To fully account for quantum\neffects, in particular in the regime of strong boson-boson interactions, we\nemploy numerical simulations based on the density-matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) and analytic approximations exploiting the mapping to weakly interacting\nfermions. Mobile impurities in a box potential undergo a phase transition\nbetween a delocalized state and a solution localized at one of the potential\nedges upon increasing the impurity-boson interaction. While a mean-field ansatz\nbased on coupled Gross-Pitaevski -- Schr\\\"odinger equations gives reasonable\npredictions of this transition, it also predicts the existence of a\nself-localized polaron solution, which we show to be an artifact of the\nunderlying decoupling approximation. This demonstrates that impurity-boson\ncorrelations are important even in the limit of weak boson-boson interactions,\nwhere mean-field approaches are expected to work well. Furthermore we calculate\nthe energy of a single polaron formed by a heavy impurity for arbitrary\ninteraction strengths and give analytical approximations for large but finite\nboson-boson couplings. Finally we numerically determine the polaron-polaron\ninteraction potential in Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which in the Tonks gas\nlimit is oscillatory due to Friedel oscillations in the Bose gas.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
