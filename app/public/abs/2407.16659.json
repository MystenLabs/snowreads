Understanding such particles from first principles\nQCD requires input from lattice QCD with one-, two-, and three-meson\ninterpolators as well as a reliable three-body formalism relating finite-volume\nspectra at unphysical pion masses to the scattering amplitudes at the physical\npoint. In this work, we provide the first-ever calculation of the resonance\nparameters of the $\\omega$-meson from lattice QCD to the physical point,\nincluding an update of the formalism through matching to effective field\ntheories. The main result of this pioneering study, the pole position of the\n$\\omega$-meson at $\\sqrt{s_\\omega}= (778.0(11.2)-i\\,3.0(5) )\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$,\nagrees reasonably well with experiment providing a pathway to study heavier\nthree-hadron resonances. In addition we provide an estimate of the\n$\\omega-\\rho$ mass difference as $29(15)\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
