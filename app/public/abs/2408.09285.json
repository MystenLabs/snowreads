Our study compares the effectiveness of LLM-based chatbots with\npre-defined scripted chatbots, evaluating key criteria such as usability, user\nengagement, and learning outcomes. The results show that LLM-based chatbots\nsignificantly improve interactivity and engagement, creating a more dynamic and\nimmersive learning environment. This integration helps document and preserve\ncultural heritage and enhances dissemination processes, which are crucial for\nsafeguarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH) amid environmental changes.\nFurthermore, the study highlights the potential of novel technologies in\neducation to provide immersive experiences that foster a deeper appreciation of\ncultural heritage. These findings support the wider application of LLMs and VR\nin cultural education to address global challenges and promote sustainable\npractices to preserve and enhance cultural heritage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
