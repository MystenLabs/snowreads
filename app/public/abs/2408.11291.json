However, as of now, only four classes of power functions are known to\nhave explicit values for all entries in their $\\rm{FBCT}$. In this paper, we\nfocus on studying the FBCT of the power function $F(x)=x^{2^{n-2}-1}$ over\n$\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Through certain refined\nmanipulations to solve specific equations over $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ and employing\nbinary Kloosterman sums, we determine explicit values for all entries in the\n$\\rm{FBCT}$ of $F(x)$ and further analyze its Feistel boomerang spectrum.\nFinally, we demonstrate that this power function exhibits the lowest Feistel\nboomerang uniformity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
