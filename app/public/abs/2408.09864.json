The AlN films were deposited on 6\" silicon\nsubstrates with a 3 $\\mu$m buried silicon oxide layer using reactive DC\nmagnetron sputtering at a temperature of 700{\\deg}C. The resulting uncladded\npolycrystalline waveguides exhibit propagation losses of 0.137 $\\pm$ 0.005\ndB/cm at wavelengths of 1310 nm and 0.154 $\\pm$ 0.008 dB/cm at a wavelength of\n1550 nm in the TE polarization. These results are the best reported for\nsputtered AlN waveguides in the C-band and the first report in the O-band.\nThese performances are comparable to those of the best-reported AlN waveguides,\nwhich are epitaxially grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)\non sapphire substrates. Our findings highlight the potential of sputtered AlN\nfor photonic platforms working in the telecom spectrum.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
