These in situ overlays not only save\nscreen space but also minimize the amount of time and effort needed to access\nthe same information from elsewhere in the UI. In this paper, we discuss how we\ndesign modular UI control elements to track how often and how recently a user\ninteracts with them and design visual overlays showing an aggregated summary as\nwell as a detailed temporal history. We demonstrate the capability of\nProvenanceWidgets by recreating three prior widget libraries: (1) Scented\nWidgets, (2) Phosphor objects, and (3) Dynamic Query Widgets. We also evaluated\nits expressiveness and conducted case studies with visualization developers to\nevaluate its effectiveness. We find that ProvenanceWidgets enables developers\nto implement custom provenance-tracking applications effectively.\nProvenanceWidgets is available as open-source software at\nhttps://github.com/ProvenanceWidgets to help application developers build\ncustom provenance-based systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
