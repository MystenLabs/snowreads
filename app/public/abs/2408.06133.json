The central role of these hosts in the\ndistribution of clickbait PDFs remains understudied, and it is unclear whether\nattackers differentiate the types of hosting for PDF uploads, how long they\nrely on hosts, and how affected parties respond to abuse.\n  To address this, we conducted real-time analyses on hosts, collecting data on\n4,648,939 clickbait PDFs served by 177,835 hosts over 17 months. Our results\nrevealed a diverse infrastructure, with hosts falling into three main hosting\ntypes. We also identified at scale the presence of eight software components\nwhich facilitate file uploads and which are likely exploited for clickbait PDF\ndistribution. We contact affected parties to report the misuse of their\nresources via a large-scale vulnerability notification. While we observed some\neffectiveness in terms of number of cleaned-up PDFs following the notification,\nlong-term improvement in this infrastructure remained insignificant. This\nfinding raises questions about the hosting providers' role in combating abuse\nand the actual impact of vulnerability notifications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
