Comparing Trust Responses of Different Age Groups to\n  Errors Made by Physically Assistive Robots","authors":"Sasha Wald, Kavya Puthuveetil, and Zackory Erickson","authorsParsed":[["Wald","Sasha",""],["Puthuveetil","Kavya",""],["Erickson","Zackory",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 15:23:56 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-26","timestamp":1724426636000,"abstract":"  Trust is a key factor in ensuring acceptable human-robot interaction,\nespecially in settings where robots may be assisting with critical activities\nof daily living. When practically deployed, robots are bound to make occasional\nmistakes, yet the degree to which these errors will impact a care recipient's\ntrust in the robot, especially in performing physically assistive tasks,\nremains an open question. To investigate this, we conducted experiments where\nparticipants interacted with physically assistive robots which would\noccasionally make intentional mistakes while performing two different tasks:\nbathing and feeding. Our study considered the error response of two\npopulations: younger adults at a university (median age 26) and older adults at\nan independent living facility (median age 83). We observed that the impact of\nerrors on a users' trust in the robot depends on both their age and the task\nthat the robot is performing. We also found that older adults tend to evaluate\nthe robot on factors unrelated to the robot's performance, making their trust\nin the system more resilient to errors when compared to younger adults.
