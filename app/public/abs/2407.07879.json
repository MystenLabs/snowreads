This paper\nfocuses on devices that utilize non-homogeneous thin patterned laminae. The\nproperties, design principles, and behavior of BICs for this class of devices\nare frequently explained through a variety of models, ranging from numerical or\nsemi-analytical solutions for the Maxwell equations to heuristic approaches\nthat rely on fitting functions to provide phenomenological descriptions. The\nfield of devices under study has given less attention to approaches that\nintegrate exact analytical solutions of the transfer matrix with numerical\ndata. In this vein, this paper aims to adopt an approach where exact analytical\nformulas, detailed in our previous manuscript arXiv:2303.06765 (2023), are\ntranslated into equations to explore the origins and properties of the bound\nstates in continuum, as well as their practical implementation. The geometric\nparameters of the device and its operating frequency band emerge from the null\nspace of the transfer matrix.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
