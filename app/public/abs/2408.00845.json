This system\nalso presents interesting mathematical challenges for modeling. We consider a\nnonlinear delay differential equation model and calculate pseudospectra of\nthree different linearizations: a time-dependent Jacobian, linearization around\nthe limit cycle, and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis of Koopman\noperators (global linearization). The time-dependent Jacobian provided insight\ninto experimental phenomena, explaining why rats respond differently to\nperturbations during corticosterone secretion's upward versus downward slopes.\nWe developed new mathematical techniques for the other two linearizations to\ncalculate pseudospectra on Banach spaces and apply DMD to delay differential\nequations, respectively. These methods helped establish local and global limit\ncycle stability and study transients. Additionally, we discuss using\npseudospectra to substantiate the model in experimental contexts and establish\nbio-variability via data-driven methods. This work is the first to utilize\npseudospectra to explore the HPA axis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Quantitative Biology/Subcellular Processes"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
