To this end, using a reformulation of Tannaka duality we construct for\na projective variety X a (non-commutative) universal affine pro-algebraic group\nLu(X), such that for any given affine subvariety U of X any finite and \\'etale\nGalois covering of U over F is a pull-back of a Galois covering of a quotient\nLu(X,U) of Lu(X). Then the geometric fundamental group of U is a completion of\nthe k-points of Lu(X,U), where k is an algebraic closure of F. We obtain\nexplicit descriptions of the universal affine groups Lu(X,U) for U the affine\nline and the punctured affine line over F.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
