However, physical examinations are subjective, while radiographic\nexaminations expose patients to harmful radiation. Consequently, we propose a\npipeline that can accurately determine scoliosis severity. This pipeline\nutilizes posteroanterior (PA) and lateral (LAT) RGB images as input to generate\nspine curve maps, which are then used to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D)\nspine curve for AIS severity grading. To generate the 2D spine curves\naccurately and efficiently, we further propose an Efficient U-shape transFormer\n(EUFormer) as the generator. It can efficiently utilize the learned feature\nacross channels, therefore producing consecutive spine curves from both PA and\nLAT views. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of EUFormer on\nspine curve generation against other classical U-shape models. This finding\ndemonstrates that the proposed method for grading the severity of AIS, based on\na 3D spine curve, is more accurate when compared to using a 2D spine curve.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_1Tj14-EUebxaAcEiLk1oVMk3sdZipqiIY4FWDksros","pdfSize":"481592"}
