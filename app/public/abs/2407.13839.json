Thus, it is crucial to\nconsider Return On Investment (ROI) when performing data analytics. Decisions\non \"How much analytics is needed\"? are hard to answer. ROI could guide decision\nsupport on the What?, How?, and How Much? Analytics for a given problem. This\nwork details a comprehensive tool that provides conventional and advanced ML\napproaches for demonstration using requirements dependency extraction and their\nROI analysis as use case. Utilizing advanced ML techniques such as Active\nLearning, Transfer Learning and primitive Large language model: BERT\n(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as its various\ncomponents for automating dependency extraction, the tool outcomes demonstrate\na mechanism to compute the ROI of ML algorithms to present a clear picture of\ntrade-offs between the cost and benefits of a technology investment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KaS_GPEYyMb3XbPo2rdfuiG07k95F2piaCUI-w0rG1s","pdfSize":"1381499"}
