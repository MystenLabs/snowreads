This Maslov-type index is a\ngeneralization of the Conley-Zehnder-Long index and the method of constructing\nthe index is consistent no matter whether the starting point of the path is\nidentity or not, which is different from the ones for Long's Maslov-type index\nand Liu's $L_0$-index. Some natural properties for the index still hold. We\nreview other versions of Maslov indices and compare them with our definition.\nIn particular, this Maslov-type index can be looked as a realization of\nCappell-Lee-Miller's index for a pair of Lagrangian paths from the point of\nview of index for symplectic paths.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
