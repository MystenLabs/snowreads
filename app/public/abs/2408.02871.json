In this work, we introduce a novel black-box approach for\nfingerprinting LLMs, achieving an impressive 72% accuracy in identifying the\ncorrect family of models (Such as Llama, Mistral, Gemma, etc) among a lineup of\nLLMs. We present an evolutionary strategy that leverages the capabilities of\none LLM to discover the most salient features for identifying other LLMs. Our\nmethod employs a unique \"Hide and Seek\" algorithm, where an Auditor LLM\ngenerates discriminative prompts, and a Detective LLM analyzes the responses to\nfingerprint the target models. This approach not only demonstrates the\nfeasibility of LLM-driven model identification but also reveals insights into\nthe semantic manifolds of different LLM families. By iteratively refining\nprompts through in-context learning, our system uncovers subtle distinctions\nbetween model outputs, providing a powerful tool for LLM analysis and\nverification. This research opens new avenues for understanding LLM behavior\nand has significant implications for model attribution, security, and the\nbroader field of AI transparency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
