We propose a rapid\nadiabatic passage (RAP) scheme for achieving a high-fidelity controlled-Z (CZ)\ngate on a neutral atom Rydberg platform. Utilizing only global laser dressing,\nour scheme involves echoing two identical RAP pulses within the Rydberg\nblockade regime to realize a CZ gate and can be readily extended to a C$^k$Z\ngate with additional qubits. We predict a CZ gate with fidelity over 0.9995\nusing akali-atom parameters, and a CCZ gate with fidelity exceeding 0.999.\nMoreover, the direct utilization of echoing RAP pulses enables the\nimplementation of a four-bit CCCZ gate at fidelity over 0.996 without further\noptimization. The proposed scheme, remarkably robust to variations in driving\nfields and realistic decoherence effects, holds promise for future quantum\ninformation processing applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
