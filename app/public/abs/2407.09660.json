In the context of the\nmultilinear tensor-product finite element discretization of\nreaction-drift-diffusion equations, our quadrature rule generalizes the\nmass-lump rule, retaining its most useful properties; for a nonnegative\nreaction coefficient, it gives an $O(h^2)$-accurate, nonnegative\ndiagonalization of the reaction operator. The major advantage of our scheme in\ncomparison with the standard mass lumping scheme is that, under mild\nconditions, it produces an $O(h^2)$ consistency error even when the integrand\nhas a jump discontinuity. The finite-volume-type quadrature rule has been\nstated in a less general form and applied to systems of reaction-diffusion\nequations related to particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations\n(PBSRD); in this context, the reaction operator is \\textit{required} to be an\n$M$-matrix and a standard model for bimolecular reactions has a discontinuous\nreaction coefficient. We apply our convergence results to a finite element\ndiscretization of scalar drift-diffusion-reaction model problem related to\nPBSRD systems, and provide new numerical convergence studies confirming the\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
