The\nnumerical results show that the blue-shift of the maximum peaks in the photon\nenergy range is less than 60 meV. The height of maximum peaks increases\naccording to an exponential rule, depending nonlinearly on the structural\nparameters of the asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells. In the photon energy\nrange greater than 100 meV, the saturated radio-electric field increases with\ntemperature and geometric parameters of the quantum well. Temperature also\nstrongly affects full-width at half-maximum with rules consistent with previous\ntheoretical calculations and experimental observations. The results show the\ndifferences between symmetric and asymmetric semi-parabolic quantum wells,\nhighlighting the influence of asymmetric structures on radio-electric effects\nin two-dimensional quantum well systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
