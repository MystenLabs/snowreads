Few researchers have investigated the\nimpact of three-dimensional road geometries on the state estimation and, thus,\nneglect road inclination and banking. Especially considering high velocities\nand accelerations, the literature does not address these effects. Therefore, we\ncompare two- and three-dimensional state estimation schemes to outline the\nimpact of road geometries. We use an Extended Kalman Filter with a point-mass\nmotion model and extend it by an additional formulation of reference angles.\nFurthermore, virtual velocity measurements significantly improve the estimation\nof road angles and the vehicle's side slip angle. We highlight the importance\nof steady estimations for vehicle motion control algorithms and demonstrate the\nchallenges of degraded signal quality and Global Navigation Satellite System\ndropouts. The proposed adaptive covariance facilitates a smooth estimation and\nenables stable controller behavior. The developed state estimation has been\ndeployed on a high-speed autonomous race car at various racetracks. Our\nfindings indicate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art vehicle\ndynamics state estimators and an industry-grade Inertial Navigation System.\nFurther studies are needed to investigate the performance under varying track\nconditions and on other vehicle types.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
