Using a systematic literature review and expert interviews, we\nassess the role of IPRs on three sources of climate technology: (1)\ninternational technology transfer, (2) adaptive innovation, and (3) indigenous\ninnovation. Our contributions are threefold. First, patents have limited impact\nin any of these channels, suggesting that current debates over IPRs may be\ndirected towards the wrong targets. Second, trademarks and utility models\nprovide incentives for climate innovation in the countries studied. Third,\ndrawing from the results, we develop a framework to guide policy on how IPRs\ncan work better in the broader context of climate and trade policies, outlining\ndistinct mechanisms to support mitigation and adaptation. Our results indicate\nthat market mechanisms, especially trade and demand-pull policies, should be\nprioritised for mitigation solutions. Adaptation differs, relying more on\nindigenous innovation due to local needs and low demand. Institutional\nmechanisms, such as finance and co-development, should be prioritised to build\ninnovation capacities for adaptation.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
