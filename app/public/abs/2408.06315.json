It underpins a quantum phenomenon called measurement incompatibility\n-- two physical observables of a single quantum system may not always be\nmeasured simultaneously. Apart from being fundamentally important, measurement\nincompatibility is also a powerful resource in the broad quantum science and\ntechnologies, with wide applications to cryptography, communication, random\nnumber generation, and device-independent tasks. Since every physical system is\nunavoidably subject to noise, an important, yet still open, question is how to\ncharacterise the ability of noisy quantum dynamics to preserve measurement\nincompatibility. This work fills this gap by providing the first resource\ntheory of this ability, termed incompatibility preservability. We quantify\nincompatibility preservability by a robustness measure. Then, we introduce an\noperational task, entanglement-assisted filter game, to completely characterise\nboth the robustness measure and the conversion of incompatibility\npreservability. Our results provide a general framework to describe how noisy\ndynamics affect the uncertainty principle's signature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
