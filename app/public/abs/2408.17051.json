The Age of Information (AoI), a critical performance\nmetric for assessing the freshness of data in information update systems, has\ngained significant importance in this context. However, existing modeling and\nanalysis work on AoI mainly focuses on terrestrial networks, and the\ndistribution characteristics of ground nodes and the high dynamics of\nsatellites have not been fully considered, which poses challenges for more\naccurate evaluation. Against this background, we model the ground nodes as a\nhybrid distribution of Poisson point process (PPP) and Poisson cluster process\n(PCP) to capture the impact of ground node distribution on the AoI of status\nupdate packet transmission supported by UAVs and satellites in NTN, and the\nvisibility and cross-traffic characteristics of satellites are additionally\nconsidered. We derived the average AoI for the system in these two different\nsituations and examined the impact of various network parameters on AoI\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
