To\nincorporate such information into the analysis, we develop a non-linear\nfunctional shrinkage (NLFS) approach that uniformly shrinks the non-parametric\nfitted function into a non-linear function space while allowing for fits\noutside of this space when the data suggest alternative shapes. This approach\nextends existing functional shrinkage approaches into linear subspaces to\nshrinkage into non-linear function spaces using a Taylor series expansion and\ncorresponding updating of non-linear parameters. We demonstrate this general\napproach on the Hill model, a popular, biologically motivated model, and show\nthat shrinkage into combined function spaces, i.e., where one has two or more\nnon-linear functions a priori, is straightforward. We demonstrate this approach\nthrough synthetic and real data. Computational details on the underlying MCMC\nsampling are provided with data and analysis available in an online supplement.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fv-3ScPjjxdrmcBgplwtFN6XQWEzcJphH7GXG6f5aDk","pdfSize":"1949484"}
