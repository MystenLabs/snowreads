As GPU architectures evolve, optimizing GEMM performance\nbecomes increasingly important. This paper introduces Stream-K++, an\nenhancement to the promising Stream-K GEMM scheduling algorithm. We expand\nStream-K's scheduling policies from three to seven and implement an efficient\nsolution selection mechanism using Bloom filters. Our approach rapidly\neliminates up to 95.8% of unsuitable configurations while maintaining a 100%\ntrue-negative rate. Implemented using the AMD Composable Kernel library and\nevaluated on AMD Instinct MI250X GPUs, Stream-K++ demonstrates significant\nperformance gains (up to 43%) in select scenarios. It remains competitive\n(within 20% of optimal) for 60-97.6% of problem sizes. Our flexible framework,\nimplemented in the Opensieve C++ library, allows for easy adaptation to new\nproblem sizes, scheduling policies, or additional tuning parameters, paving the\nway for future optimizations in GPU-based GEMM operations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xVf-0LzU9e4fulkeBCrAhAVJadlG2o95BlsXGpw9-sk","pdfSize":"478914"}
