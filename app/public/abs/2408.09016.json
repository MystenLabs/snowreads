This results is reminiscent of work of Batyrev and\nBorisov, and in fact recovers results of Batyrev-Borisov and results of\nKrawitz, and proves a generalization of a conjecture of\nKatzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev for orbifold toric complete intersections with nef\nanticanonical divisors. Finally we show that one can extract versions of Hodge\nnumber duality for orbifold log Calabi-Yau complete intersections, and certain\nsingular mirror pairs, including geometric transitions, and for some toric\ndegenerations appearing in the Fanosearch programme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
