However, many typical choices of localized orbitals tend to be\nrelated by selected, near-exact symmetry operations whenever a molecule belongs\nto a point group, a feature which remains largely unexploited in most local\ncorrelation methods. The present Letter demonstrates how to leverage a recent\nunitary protocol for enforcing symmetry properties among localized orbitals to\nyield a high-accuracy estimate of the exact ground-state correlation energy of\nbenzene ($D_{6h}$) in correlation-consistent polarized basis sets of both\ndouble- and triple-$\\zeta$ quality. Through an initial application to many-body\nexpanded full configuration interaction (MBE-FCI) theory, we show how molecular\npoint-group symmetry can lead to computational savings that are inversely\nproportional to the order of the point group in a manner generally applicable\nto the acceleration of modern local correlation methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
