Since then it has also been used to approximately solve sequential\nstochastic optimization problems, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. To\nelaborate, one first writes a tractable linear programming relaxation that\nprescribes probabilities with which actions should be taken. Rounding then\ndesigns a (randomized) online policy that approximately preserves all of these\nprobabilities, with the challenge being that the online policy faces hard\nconstraints, whereas the prescribed probabilities only have to satisfy these\nconstraints in expectation. Moreover, unlike classical randomized rounding for\noffline problems, the online policy's actions unfold sequentially over time,\ninterspersed by uncontrollable stochastic realizations that affect the\nfeasibility of future actions. This tutorial provides an introduction for using\nrandomized rounding to design online policies, through four self-contained\nexamples representing fundamental problems in the area: online contention\nresolution, stochastic probing, stochastic knapsack, and stochastic matching.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wUZZDuVg4XLjSHvyUeOce-5-a_44uWZh8YNTKxL0oqk","pdfSize":"543757"}
