Most previous work is\nbased on optimizing the hyperparameters of a heuristic function. We propose to\nmodel the problem directly as a slate optimization problem with the objective\nof maximizing long-term user satisfaction. We also develop a novel constraint\noptimization algorithm that stabilizes objective trade-offs for multi-objective\noptimization. We evaluate our approach with live experiments and describe its\ndeployment on YouTube.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fiJlVT-lz9wuIqCfGr0yyycXLlXwFWN8tR1xfH5XFhc","pdfSize":"1130290"}
