The embedded geometry can represent a\ntraversable wormhole (TWH), a one-way wormhole (OOWH), or a regular black hole\n(RBH). The resulting geometry is regular everywhere, eliminating any\nsingularity or local de-Sitter core at the origin and on the brane location,\nwhere the regular geometry is given by the SV geometry. The throat of TWHs or\nOOWHs can extend into the extra dimension. The event horizon of RBH extends\nalong the extra dimension, prompting speculation on the extension of entropy\ninto this dimension. Although the induced geometry is characterized by tension,\nacting akin to a positive cosmological constant (thus potentially representing\nempty space), the induced four-dimensional geometry remains regular. There is\nno need to introduce additional energy sources on the brane to achieve this\nregularity. Hence, the brane's geometry, which may depict an RBH, TWH, or OWWH,\nis influenced by the geometric properties of the bulk\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
