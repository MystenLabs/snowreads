Various notions of sensitivities are introduced and\nbenchmarked numerically. We identify the sensitivities representing the best\npractical trade-offs in downstream tasks including CVA hedging and risk\nassessment.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
