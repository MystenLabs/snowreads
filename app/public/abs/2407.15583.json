Adding an energy\nbooster stage to the linear accelerator of an operational X-ray FEL is\nrecognised as a realistic near-term application of plasma accelerators, with a\nsignificant impact on the scientific reach of these facilities. Here, we\ndiscuss potential use cases of such a plasma-based energy booster and apply\nparticle-in-cell simulations to estimate its ability to enhance the performance\nof existing X-ray FEL facilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NmPy8hIC1Pt98BVzuDo9o4MKQmni4KfWmA-GMWesOlU","pdfSize":"756047"}
