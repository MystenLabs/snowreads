Using the rough existence theory, we show the preservation and\nimprovement of distributional scalar curvature lower bounds provided the\nsingular set for such metrics is not too large. As an application, we use the\nRicci flow smoothing to study the removable singularity for scalar curvature\nrigidity in the compact case under Morrey regularity conditions. Our result\nsupplements those of Jiang-Sheng-Zhang.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
