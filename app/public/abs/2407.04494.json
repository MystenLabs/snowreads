As a light wave becomes nonstatic, an additional phase, the\nso-called geometric phase, takes place in its evolution. Then, due to this\nphase, the overall phase of the quantum wave function varies in a nonlinear way\nwith time. Interestingly, the phase exhibits a step-like evolution if the\nmeasure of nonstaticity is extremely high. Such an abnormal phase variation is\nanalyzed in detail for better understanding of wave nonstaticity in this work.\nAs the wave becomes highly nonstatic, the phase factor of the electromagnetic\nwave evolves in a rectangular manner. However, the shape of the electromagnetic\nfield is still a sinusoidal form on account of the compensational variation of\nthe wave amplitude. The electromagnetic field in this case very much resembles\nthat of a standing wave. The effects accompanying the step-phase evolution,\nsuch as modification of the probability distribution and alteration of the\nwave-interference profile, are analyzed and their implications are illustrated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
