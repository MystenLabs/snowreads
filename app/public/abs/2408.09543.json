In topological materials, the QM has been so far\nrevealed in thin films of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ where\nit provides a direct contribution to longitudinal currents quadratic in the\ndriving electric field. Here we show that the Dirac surface states of strong\nthree-dimensional topological insulators have a QM that can be accessed from\nthe nonlinear transport characteristics in the presence of an externally\napplied planar magnetic field. A previously unknown intrinsic part of the\nlongitudinal magnetoconductivity carries the signature of the QM while\ncoexisting with the extrinsic part generating the so-called bilinear\nmagnetoelectric resistance. We prove that the QM-induced nonlinear transport\narise both in topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ materials class and in\nthe series of cubic mercury chalcogenides as a result of the combined action of\nthe Zeeman coupling with hexagonal warping and particle-hole symmetry breaking\neffects respectively.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
