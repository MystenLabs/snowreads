Characterizing\nthe seated upper body human poses using mmWave radars is an important, yet\nunder-studied topic with many applications in human-machine interaction,\ntransportation and road safety. In this work, we devise SUPER, a framework for\nseated upper body human pose estimation that utilizes dual-mmWave radars in\nclose proximity. A novel masking algorithm is proposed to coherently fuse data\nfrom the radars to generate intensity and Doppler point clouds with\ncomplementary information for high-motion but small radar cross section areas\n(e.g., upper extremities) and low-motion but large RCS areas (e.g. torso). A\nlightweight neural network extracts both global and local features of upper\nbody and output pose parameters for the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL)\nmodel. Extensive leave-one-subject-out experiments on various motion sequences\nfrom multiple subjects show that SUPER outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline\nmethod by 30 -- 184%. We also demonstrate its utility in a simple downstream\ntask for hand-object interaction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
