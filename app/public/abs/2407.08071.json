This paper\npresents a novel approach to this problem using infrared time of flight\nsensors. The use of infrared time of flight sensors is not common as a tracking\napproach, typically used for simple motion detectors. However, with the\napproach highlighted in this paper they can be used to accurately track the\nposition of a moving subject. Traditional approaches to the tracking problem\noften include cameras, or ultrasonic sensors. These approaches can be expensive\nand overcompensating in some use cases. The method focused on in this paper can\nbe superior in terms of cost and simplicity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
