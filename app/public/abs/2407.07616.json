In this paper, we tackle semantic change detection with\nsatellite image time series (SITS-SCD) which encompasses both change detection\nand semantic segmentation tasks. We propose a new architecture that improves\nover the state of the art, scales better with the number of parameters, and\nleverages long-term temporal information. However, for practical use cases,\nmodels need to adapt to spatial and temporal shifts, which remains a challenge.\nWe investigate the impact of temporal and spatial shifts separately on global,\nmulti-year SITS datasets using DynamicEarthNet and MUDS. We show that the\nspatial domain shift represents the most complex setting and that the impact of\ntemporal shift on performance is more pronounced on change detection than on\nsemantic segmentation, highlighting that it is a specific issue deserving\nfurther attention.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4PgBJiNxaejbI5ZVx8cWM98ftFY4o1N5Q3wVwM19rHI","pdfSize":"6913499","objectId":"0xd39b4b516776c3ba6ce21b4a1e767a7f95512e75d8f466eee4a6ea9dfe77f2aa","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
