It discusses Weyl's early view\non axiomatics, which is part of his criticism of Dedekind and Hilbert, as\nmotivated by Weyl's acquiescence to a phenomenological epistemology of\ncorrectness, then it describes Noether's work in algebra, emphasizing in\nparticular its ancestral relation to Dedekind's and Hilbert's works, as well as\nher mathematical methods, characterized by non-elementary reasoning, i.e.,\nreasoning detached from mathematical objects. The paper turns then to Weyl's\nremarks on Noether's work, and argues against assimilating her use of the\naxiomatic method in algebra to his late view on axiomatics, on the ground of\nthe latter's resistance to Noether's principle of detachment.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
