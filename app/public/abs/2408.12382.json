We show that this\nclass includes all Banach spaces of density not bigger than the continuum which\ndo not admit $\\ell_\\infty$ as a quotient (equivalently do not admit a subspace\nisomorphic to $\\ell_1(\\mathfrak{c})$). This includes all Asplund spaces and all\nweakly Lindel\\\"of determined Banach spaces of density not bigger than the\ncontinuum. However, we also show that this class includes some Banach spaces\nadmitting $\\ell_\\infty$ as a quotient. Our method of constructing\nindecomposable Banach spaces above a given Banach space is a considerable\nmodification of the method of constructing Banach spaces of continuous\nfunctions with few$^*$ operators developed before by the first-named author.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
