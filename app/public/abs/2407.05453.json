This process requires\nmultiple robots to cooperatively explore and map an unknown environment by\nintelligently coordinating their movements and sensor data acquisition. In this\narticle, we present an efficient visual AC-SLAM method using aerial and ground\nrobots for environment exploration and mapping. We propose an efficient\nfrontiers filtering method that takes into account the common IoU map frontiers\nand reduces the frontiers for each robot. Additionally, we also present an\napproach to guide robots to previously visited goal positions to promote loop\nclosure to reduce SLAM uncertainty. The proposed method is implemented in ROS\nand evaluated through simulations on publicly available datasets and similar\nmethods, achieving an accumulative average of 59% of increase in area coverage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
