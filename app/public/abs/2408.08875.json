Understanding surface-induced relaxation is\nnecessary for the development of both large- and small-volume cells that have a\nlong and stable nuclear spin lifetime. Such cells are critical to several\nongoing experiments, including the measurement of the neutron electric dipole\nmoment, zero or otherwise. $^{199}$Hg, due to its large mass, has a multitude\nof bound surface states that affect the interaction time with the surface and\nare an important factor in the interpretation of previously acquired data. It\nis shown that the inclusion of these states brings consistency to the derived\nsurface interaction properties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
