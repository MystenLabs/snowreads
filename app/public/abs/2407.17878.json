Various experiments have\nindirectly evidenced that this transition is neither a cubic tetragonal nor the\nonly one occurring in ETO. Here, we show new results demonstrating two further\ninstabilities below TS based on lattice dynamics and spin-phonon interactions\ncombined with a Landau free energy model with coupled order parameters. The new\ntransition temperatures perfectly agree with available experimental data where\nfurther instabilities have been anticipated.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
