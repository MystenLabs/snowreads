In this work, the impacts of baffling on a\nhydrogenic plasma are studied in isolation, through artificial fixed-fraction\nimpurity SOLPS-ITER simulations. These simulations are of the connected double\nnull Super-X divertor on the MAST-U tokamak, with extreme cases of a closed and\nopen divertor. Simulations show a divertor with a tightly baffled entrance can\nlead to better access to detachment on the outer targets, likely caused by\nreduced convection upstream. Adding tight baffling at the throat also leads to\ntwo orders of magnitude increase in neutral compression, and an order of\nmagnitude more efficient pumping, with more peaked core density profiles.\nFinally, in contrast to the localised radiation of the closed divertor, the\nopen divertor shows radiation along the entire plasma edge which moves upstream\nand inward into the core as detachment evolves; leading to sub-10eV\ntemperatures in the near SOL at x-point.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q9AlFmkWr6nCFEbbU4nVE-y3k-b3GIq8izaRgUD8L-s","pdfSize":"39292465"}
