This\npopulation acts as a unique comparative sample to the directly imaged exoplanet\nand brown dwarf populations, of which a range of JWST characterisation\nobservations are planned. In contrast, only two observations of transiting\nexoplanets in this mass regime were performed in Cycle 1, and none are planned\nfor Cycle 2. Such observations will: improve our understanding of how\nirradiation influences high gravity atmospheres, provide insights towards\nplanetary formation and evolution across this mass regime, and exploit JWST's\nunique potential to characterise exoplanets across the known population.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LnwG02IrUKEXU58Mgz982O1dKP_rvi4GX2CZ4bEzvJ8","pdfSize":"1107939"}
