However, their error-correcting\nperformance has not been studied in depth so far and whether this code\nconstruction can be generalized to higher dimension is an open question. In\nthis paper, we first study the error-correcting performance of the 3D Chamon\ncode, which is an instance of 3D XYZ product of three repetition codes. Next,\nwe show that 3D XYZ product can be generalized to four dimension and propose\nfour-dimensional (4D) XYZ product code construction, which constructs a class\nof non-CSS codes by using either four classical codes or two CSS codes.\nCompared with 4D homological product, we show that 4D XYZ product can construct\nnon-CSS codes with higher code dimension or code distance. Finally, we consider\ntwo instances of 4D XYZ product, to which we refer as 4D Chamon code and 4D XYZ\nproduct concatenated code, respectively. Our simulation results show that, 4D\nXYZ product can construct non-CSS codes with better error-correcting\nperformance for $Z$-biased noise than CSS codes constructed by 4D homological\nproduct.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
