However, their unstructured format presents\nsignificant challenges for extracting relevant features into a structured\nformat. This paper introduces GEOBERTje: a domain adapted large language model\ntrained on geological borehole descriptions from Flanders (Belgium) in the\nDutch language. This model effectively extracts relevant information from the\nborehole descriptions and represents it into a numeric vector space. Showcasing\njust one potential application of GEOBERTje, we finetune a classifier model on\na limited number of manually labeled observations. This classifier categorizes\nborehole descriptions into a main, second and third lithology class. We show\nthat our classifier outperforms both a rule-based approach and GPT-4 of OpenAI.\nThis study exemplifies how domain adapted large language models enhance the\nefficiency and accuracy of extracting information from complex, unstructured\ngeological descriptions. This offers new opportunities for geological analysis\nand modeling using vast amounts of data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
