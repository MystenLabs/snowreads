In particular, the review\ncontains the results known so far concerning the best, best $n$-term\napproximations and widths of classes of functions of one and many variables\ndefined by means of $\\psi$-derivatives and generalized moduli of smoothness in\nthe spaces ${\\mathcal S}^p$ and $B{\\mathcal S}^p$. Particular attention is paid\nto the development of studies related to the derivation of direct and inverse\napproximation theorems in these spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
