Here, we combine hybrid density functional theory calculations\nincluding spin orbit coupling (SOC) with the experimental relationship between\nthe inorganic band gap and exciton binding energy to predict the inorganic\nexciton energy. For this purpose, we determine a universal exchange parameter\nfor the HSE06 hybrid functional with SOC for lead-based 2D hybrid\norganic-inorganic perovskites. We further identify a relationship that connects\nPBE calculations to experiment-quality optical gaps and allows us to generalize\nthe exchange mixing parameter other SOC approximations. Our approach opens the\npath to screen for 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with optimized\nspectra, e.g., for new solar cell or light emitting materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
