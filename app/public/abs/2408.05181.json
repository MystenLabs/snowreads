We introduce, also inspired by partial matched pairs\n\\cite{matchedpair}, the notion of weak matched pairs and establish conditions\nfor a subspace of the smash product be a weak bialgebra/Hopf algebra. Further,\nsome new examples of (co)actions of weak bialgebras over algebras and some\nresults about integral elements are presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6p0ErYHYRRFnQQLXEH7w-L9ODGfXiQVIO8xwo8h-n_o","pdfSize":"328131"}
