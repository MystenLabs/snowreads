Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods\nallows one to access the uncertainties of PDFs without making use of quadratic\napproximations in a statistically sound procedure while at the same time\npreserving the correspondence between the sample and $\\chi^2$-value. Rooted in\nBayesian statistics the $\\chi^2$-function is repeatedly sampled to obtain a set\nof PDFs that serves as a representation of the statistical distribution of the\nPDFs in their function space. After removing the dependence between the samples\n(the so-called autocorrelation) the set can be used to propagate the\nuncertainties to physical observables. The final result is an independent\nprocedure to obtain PDF uncertainties that can be confronted by the\nstate-of-the-art in order to ultimately arrive at a better understanding of the\nproton's structure.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"u3sqfgRdHJLFwkJJ4OIkfOH4xX80XicAOvwgIq-eqsc","pdfSize":"1049674"}
