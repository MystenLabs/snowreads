In the near-term, hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithms, which efficiently embed quantum hardware in\nclassical frameworks, are crucial in bridging the vast divide in the\nperformance of the purely-quantum algorithms and their classical counterparts.\nHere, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is presented for the computation of\nnon-perturbative characteristics of quantum field theories. The presented\nalgorithm relies on a universal parametrized quantum circuit ansatz based on\nEuler and Cartan's decompositions of single and two-qubit operators. It is\nbenchmarked by computing the energy spectra of lattice realizations of quantum\nfield theories with both short and long range interactions. Low depth circuits\nare provided for false vacua as well as highly excited states corresponding to\nmesonic and baryonic excitations occurring in the analyzed models. The\ndescribed algorithm opens a hitherto-unexplored avenue for the investigation of\nmass-ratios, scattering amplitudes and false-vacuum decays in quantum field\ntheories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-GRg4QIqFcf3VkAmndF6dZo0vNY9OC1lpKd03IGuEOE","pdfSize":"760133"}
