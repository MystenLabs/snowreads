In this work, we\nstudy magic in a measurement-only quantum circuit with competing types of\nClifford and non-Clifford measurements, where magic is injected through the\nnon-Clifford measurements. This circuit can be mapped to a classical model that\ncan be simulated efficiently, and the magic can be characterized using any\nmagic measure that is additive for tensor product of single-qubit states.\nLeveraging this observation, we study the magic transition in this circuit in\nboth one- and two-dimensional lattices using large-scale numerical simulations.\nOur results demonstrate the presence of a magic transition between two\ndifferent phases with extensive magic scaling, separated by a critical point in\nwhich the mutual magic exhibits scaling behavior analogous to entanglement. We\nfurther show that these two distinct phases can be distinguished by the\ntopological magic. In a different regime, with a vanishing rate of non-Clifford\nmeasurements, we find that the magic saturates in both phases. Our work sheds\nlight on the behavior of magic and its linear combinations in quantum circuits,\nemploying genuine magic measures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
