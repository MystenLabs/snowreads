The first\nmethod is based on intersections of conic hulls, while the second one, which is\nmore recent, relies on triangulations of a set of points. We demonstrate that,\nonce automatized, the triangulation approach is computationally more efficient\nthan the conic hull approach. As an application of this triangulation approach,\nwe describe how one can derive simpler hypergeometric solutions of the\nconformal off-shell massless two-loop double box and one-loop hexagon Feynman\nintegrals than those previously obtained from the conic hull approach. Lastly,\nby applying the above techniques on the MB representation of multiple\npolylogarithms, we show how to obtain new convergent series representations for\nthese functions. These new analytic expressions were numerically cross-checked\nwith GINAC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
