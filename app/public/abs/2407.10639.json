However, reducing the risk of accidents requires prior knowledge of\nwhere potential collisions may occur and how. Therefore, we propose to gain\nthis information by analyzing locations and speeds that commonly correspond to\nhigh-risk interactions within the dataset, and use it within training to\ngenerate better predictions in high risk situations. Through these\nlocation-based and speed-based re-weighting techniques, we achieve improved\noverall performance, as measured by most-likely FDE and KDE, as well as\nimproved performance on high-speed vehicles, and vehicles within high-risk\nlocations.\n  2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
