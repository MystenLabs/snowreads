We\nformalize ethical or structural properties as axioms of allocation rules. We\nshow that several combinations of these axioms characterize focal rules\nimplementing the principle of Territorial Integration of all Basin States in\nvarious forms. One of them connects to the Shapley value, the long-standing\ncenterpiece of cooperative game theory. The others offer natural compromises\nbetween the polar principles of Absolute Territorial Sovereignty and Unlimited\nTerritorial Integrity. We complete our study with an empirical application to\nthe allocation of riparian water rights in the Nile River.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RIEGi9ncUN68lhpd9mZ8ieQBrGOAxYTeRa3NKMdw4bc","pdfSize":"859486"}
