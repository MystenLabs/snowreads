We show that, for two-terminal networks,\nthere are cases in which the fleet must reach a minimum share before actually\naffecting the PoA, which otherwise remains unchanged. Moreover, for parallel\nnetworks, we prove that the PoA is monotonically non-increasing in the fleet\nshare.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
