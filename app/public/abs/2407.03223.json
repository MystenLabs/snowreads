The analysis is based on a proton-lead\n(pPb) data sample recorded at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 8.16\nTeV by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 174.6 nb$^{-1}$. The two J/$\\psi$ mesons are reconstructed in\ntheir $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay channels with transverse momenta $p_\\mathrm{T}$ $\\gt$\n6.5 GeV and rapidity $\\lvert y \\rvert$ $\\lt$ 2.4. Events where one of the\nJ/$\\psi$ mesons is reconstructed in the dielectron channel are also considered\nin the search. The pPb $\\to$ J/$\\psi$J/$\\psi$+X process is observed with a\nsignificance of 5.3 standard deviations. The measured inclusive fiducial cross\nsection, using the four-muon channel alone, is $\\sigma$(pPb$\\to$\nJ/$\\psi$J/$\\psi$+X)= 22.0 $\\pm$ 8.9 (stat) $\\pm$ 1.5 (syst) nb. A fit of the\ndata to the expected rapidity separation for pairs of J/$\\psi$ mesons produced\nin single (SPS) and double (DPS) parton scatterings yields\n$\\sigma^{\\mathrm{pPb}\\to\\mathrm{J}/\\psi\\mathrm{J}/\\psi+\\mathrm{X}}_\\text{SPS}$\n= 16.5 $\\pm$ 10.8 (stat) $\\pm$ 0.1 (syst) nb and $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{pPb}\\to\n\\mathrm{J}/\\psi\\mathrm{J}/\\psi+\\mathrm{X}}_\\text{DPS}$ = 5.4 $\\pm$ 6.2 (stat)\n$\\pm$ 0.4 (syst) nb, respectively. This latter result can be transformed into a\nlower bound on the effective DPS cross section, closely related to the squared\naverage interparton transverse separation in the collision, of\n$\\sigma_\\text{eff}$ $\\gt$ 1.0 mb at 95% confidence level.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
