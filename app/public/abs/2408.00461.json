One great challenge in\nsuch experiments is to establish matter-wave beam splitting mechanisms that are\nefficient and applicable to a wide range of particles. In the past, continuous\nstanding light waves in the visible spectral range were used predominantly as\nphase gratings, while pulsed vacuum ultraviolet light found applications in\nphoto-ionisation gratings. Here, we explore the regime of continuous, intense\ndeep-ultraviolet ($\\rm >1 MW/cm^2$, $\\rm 266\\,nm$) light masks, where a rich\nvariety of photo-physical and photo-chemical phenomena and relaxation pathways\nmust be considered. The improved understanding of the mechanisms in this\ninteraction opens new potential pathways to protein interferometry and to\nmatter-wave enhanced sensing of molecular properties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z4aVqtfHjXIlwc60aErEkSuKR39M0FS-8_-J_UM-7hk","pdfSize":"4886323","txDigest":"314ab5xyCaFpkWS9BfcXZPuGrdMZvzFEGUZJ7zhpSxL4","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
