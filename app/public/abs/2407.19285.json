Alternative end-of-season\nleague tables are generated by re-ranking the teams based on five different\ndescriptors - total expenditure, total funds spent on players, total funds\nspent on foreign players, the ratio of foreign to British players and the\noverall profit. The unequal distribution of resources and expenditure between\nthe clubs is analyzed through Lorenz curves. A comparative analysis of the\ndifferences between the alternative tables and the conventional end-of-season\nleague table establishes the most likely factors to influence the performances\nof the teams that we also rank using Principal Component Analysis. We find that\nthe top teams in the league are also those that tend to have the highest\nexpenditure overall, for all players, including foreign players; they also have\nthe highest ratios of foreign to British players. Our statistical and machine\nlearning study also indicates that successful performance on the field may not\nguarantee healthy profits at the end of the season.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
