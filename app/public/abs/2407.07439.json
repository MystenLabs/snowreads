ELA is used for\nproblem comprehension, algorithm design, and applications such as automated\nalgorithm selection and configuration. Until recently, however, ELA was limited\nto search spaces with either continuous or discrete variables, neglecting\nproblems with mixed variable types. This gap was addressed in a recent study\nthat uses an approach based on target-encoding to compute exploratory landscape\nfeatures for mixedvariable problems. In this work, we investigate an\nalternative encoding scheme based on SHAP values. While these features do not\nlead to better results in the algorithm selection setting considered in\nprevious work, the two different encoding mechanisms exhibit complementary\nperformance. Combining both feature sets into a hybrid approach outperforms\neach encoding mechanism individually. Finally, we experiment with two different\nways of meta-selecting between the two feature sets. Both approaches are\ncapable of taking advantage of the performance complementarity of the models\ntrained on target-encoded and SHAP-encoded feature sets, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
