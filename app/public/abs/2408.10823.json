A critical\nprecondition for recognition is the availability of sufficient biometric\ninformation in images. It is visually apparent that strong JPEG compression\nremoves such details. However, latest AI-based image compression seemingly\npreserves many image details even for very strong compression factors. Yet,\nthese perceived details are not necessarily grounded in measurements, which\nraises the question whether these images can still be used for biometric\nrecognition. In this work, we investigate how AI compression impacts iris,\nfingerprint and soft-biometric (fabrics and tattoo) images. We also investigate\nthe recognition performance for iris and fingerprint images after AI\ncompression. It turns out that iris recognition can be strongly affected, while\nfingerprint recognition is quite robust. The loss of detail is qualitatively\nbest seen in fabrics and tattoos images. Overall, our results show that\nAI-compression still permits many biometric tasks, but attention to strong\ncompression factors in sensitive tasks is advisable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
