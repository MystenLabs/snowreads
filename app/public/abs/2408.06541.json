We show how to convert any adaptive\nprotocol $\\Pi$ into a protocol $\\Pi'$ that is robust to an $\\epsilon$-fraction\nof adversarial corruptions, not too much longer than $\\Pi$, and which uses\nsmall space. More precisely, if $\\Pi$ requires space $\\log(s)$ and has $|\\Pi|$\nrounds of communication, then $\\Pi'$ requires $O_\\epsilon(\\log s \\log |\\Pi|)$\nmemory, and has $$|\\Pi'| = |\\Pi|\\cdot\\left( 1 + O\\left( \\sqrt{ \\epsilon \\log\n\\log 1/\\epsilon } \\right)\\right)$$ rounds of communication. The above matches\nthe best known communication rate, even for protocols with no space\nrestrictions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qCcS9snq8_4nBCfBI2gvo5jGbKrPvM779mFSOEC7NVE","pdfSize":"1137230"}
