Synchronization strongly depends on the interaction\nnetwork, and the network plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics. To\nunderstand and control synchronization dynamics in the real world, it is\nessential to identify the network from the observed data. While previous\nstudies have developed the methods for inferring the network of asynchronous\nsystems, it remains challenging to infer the network of well-synchronized\noscillators. In this study, we develop a method for non-invasively inferring\nthe network of synchronized and desynchronized oscillators. This method is\nbased on the circle map, which describes the phase change in an oscillatory\ncycle. Our method discards a large part of data used for inference, which may\nseem counterintuitive. However, the effectiveness of the method is supported by\nthe phase reduction theory, a well-established theory for analyzing weakly\ncoupled oscillators. We verify the proposed method by applying it to simulated\ndata of the limit-cycle oscillators. This study provides an important step\ntowards understanding synchronization in real-world systems from a network\nperspective.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
