We take a step\ntowards this direction and propose Characteristic Interventional Sum-Product\nNetwork ($\\chi$SPN) that is capable of estimating interventional distributions\nin presence of random variables drawn from mixed distributions. $\\chi$SPN uses\ncharacteristic functions in the leaves of an interventional SPN (iSPN) thereby\nproviding a unified view for discrete and continuous random variables through\nthe Fourier-Stieltjes transform of the probability measures. A neural network\nis used to estimate the parameters of the learned iSPN using the intervened\ndata. Our experiments on 3 synthetic heterogeneous datasets suggest that\n$\\chi$SPN can effectively capture the interventional distributions for both\ndiscrete and continuous variables while being expressive and causally adequate.\nWe also show that $\\chi$SPN generalize to multiple interventions while being\ntrained only on a single intervention data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y1BbEybpSbX-V020CW0fs52UTxocl3fk6LgsoaFTCAk","pdfSize":"2702752"}
