The theory\nencompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral\nisothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients\nand natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local\nanalysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations\nand linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral\nCouette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general\ncriterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both\ncentrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking\ninto account viscosity and thermal diffusion and guiding experimental and\nnumerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
