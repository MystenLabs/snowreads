The axion, based on the Peccei-Quinn mechanism,\nis the most popular solution to the problem. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative solution based on the three-zero texture of quark mass matrices\nwithout additional heavy quark states, which has been shown to fit data well.\nWe show that the required three-zero texture is naturally constructed in a\nsix-dimensional spacetime with a $\\mathbf{T}^2/\\mathbb{Z}_3$ orbifold\ncompactification.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y-oXPeOERrZVSIfEg-5Bzpx2eFLtq-qhr_maDw-fbik","pdfSize":"215134"}
