Many approaches are adopted, depending on different physical\nassumptions (e.g. the light profile, chemical composition, and kinematical\ndifferences) and on whether the full six-dimensional phase-space information is\nknown (much like in simulations) or whether one analyses projected quantities\n(i.e. observations). This paper paves the way for a new approach to bridge the\ngap between observational and simulation methods. We propose the use of\nprojected kinematical information from stars in simulations in combination with\ndeep learning to create a robust method for identifying intrahalo light in\nobservational data to enhance understanding and consistency in studying the\nprocess of galaxy formation. Using a U-Net, we developed a methodology for\npredicting these contributions from a sample of mock images from hydrodynamical\nsimulations to train, validate and test the network. Reinforced training\n(Attention U-Net) was used to improve the first results, as the innermost\ncentral regions of the mock images consistently overestimate the stellar\nintrahalo contribution. Our work shows that adequate training over a\nrepresentative sample of mock images can lead to good predictions of the\nintrahalo light distribution. The model is mildly dependent on the training\nsize and its predictions are less accurate when applied to mock images from\ndifferent simulations. However, the main features (spatial scales and gradients\nof the stellar fractions) are recovered for all tests. While the method\npresented here should be considered as a proof of concept, future work is\nrequired to enable the application of the proposed model to observational data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
