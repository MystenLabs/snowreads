We show\nthat there is a duality between its faces and totally real effective divisors\non $X$. This allows us to fully describe the face lattice in case $X$ has genus\n$1$. The dual cone $\\pos^\\vee$ is known as the moment cone, and it plays an\nimportant role in real analysis. We compute the Carath\\'{e}odory number of\n$\\pos^\\vee$ for an elliptic normal curve $X$, which measures the complexity of\nquadrature rules of measures supported on $X$. This number can also be\ninterpreted as a maximal typical Waring rank with nonnegative coefficients.\nInterestingly, the topology of the real locus of $X$ influences the\nCarath\\'{e}odory number of $\\pos^\\vee$. We apply our results to truncated\nmoment problems on affine cubic curves, where we deduce sharp bounds on the\nflat extension degree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
