In this paper, we measure and track the entanglement and fidelity\nof two-qubit states prepared on a 127-qubit IBM Quantum device, as one of the\nqubits is teleported across 19 qubits. We design, evaluate and compare two\ndistinct approaches to teleportation: post-selected measurement categorisation\nand dynamic circuit corrections based on mid-circuit measurements, and compare\nwith direct state transportation using SWAP gates. By optimally choosing the\nteleportation path which exhibits the highest total negativity entanglement\nmeasure across nearest-neighbour pairs, we show the entanglement of a two-qubit\ngraph state is sustained after at least 19 hops in teleportation using the\npost-selection approach and 17 hops using the dynamic circuit approach. We\nobserve a higher level of teleported entanglement in paths determined from\ntwo-qubit negativities compared to those obtained from gate errors,\ndemonstrating an advantage in using the negativity map over the gate error map\nfor compiling quantum circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
