Prime graphs of\nsolvable groups as well as groups whose noncyclic composition factors have\norder divisible by exactly three distinct primes have been classified in\ngraph-theoretic terms. In this paper, we begin to develop a general theory on\nthe existence of edges in the prime graph of an arbitrary $T$-solvable group,\nthat is, a group whose composition factors are cyclic or isomorphic to a fixed\nnonabelian simple group $T$. We then apply these results to classify the prime\ngraphs of $T$-solvable groups for, in a suitable sense, most $T$ such that\n$|T|$ has exactly four prime divisors. We find that these groups almost always\nhave a 3-colorable prime graph complement containing few possible triangles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
