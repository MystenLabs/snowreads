For all quasi-split type excluding the even rank case\nin type AIII, we show that the twisted Yangians can be realized via a\ndegeneration on the Drinfeld type presentation of affine $\\imath$quantum\ngroups. For both even and odd rank cases in type AIII, we use the Gauss\ndecomposition method to show that these new algebras are isomorphic to\nMolev-Ragoucy's reflection algebras defined in the R-matrix presentation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
