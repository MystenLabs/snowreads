The hot carrier injection mechanism and the reaction\nrate are highly impacted by the metal/molecule interaction. However,\ndetermining the primary type of the reaction and thus the injection mechanism\nof the hot carriers has remained elusive. In this work, we reveal an electron\ninjection mechanism deviating from a purely outersphere process for the\nreduction of ferricyanide redox molecule in a gold/p-type gallium nitride\n(Au/p- GaN) photocathode system. Combining our experimental approach with ab\ninitio simulations, we discover that the efficient inner-sphere transfer of\nlow-energy electrons leads to a continuous enhancement in the photocathode\ndevice performance in the interband regime. These findings provide important\nmechanistic insights, showing our methodology as a powerful tool for analyzing\nand engineering hot-carrier-driven processes in plasmonic photocatalytic\nsystems and optoelectronic devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mnC9lc8JiPF5R41rcV8lqPB_s0qqwm5zxu89yautaP4","pdfSize":"4737912","objectId":"0xa937af7a76a1bf2e22693a49834127d0eda6a3ab8d8573512b7e5a1c623dca9a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
