These agents interact\nto define production, consumption, and monetary flow. Each agent type has\ndistinct objectives, such as households seeking utility from consumption and\nthe central bank targeting inflation and production. We define this multi-agent\neconomic system using an OpenAI Gym-style environment, enabling agents to\noptimize their objectives through reinforcement learning. Standard multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) schemes, like independent learning, enable agents\nto learn concurrently but do not address whether the resulting strategies are\nat equilibrium. This study integrates the Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO)\nalgorithm, which has shown superior performance over independent MARL in games\nwith homogeneous agents, with economic agent-based modeling. We use PSRO to\ndevelop agent policies approximating Nash equilibria of the empirical economic\ngame, thereby linking to economic equilibria. Our results demonstrate that PSRO\nstrategies achieve lower regret values than independent MARL strategies in our\neconomic system with four agent types. This work aims to bridge artificial\nintelligence, economics, and empirical game theory towards future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
