On a high level, our\nargument utilises the idea of iteratively taking vertices of largest degree\nfrom an independent set and constructing a hypergraph of lower uniformity which\npreserves independent sets and inherits edge distribution. The original\nalgorithms for constructing containers also remove in each step vertices of\nhigh degree which are not in the independent set. Our modified algorithm\npostpones this until the end, which surprisingly results in a significantly\nsimplified analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
