The\nobserved responses can be recorded in multiple response matrices over time,\nnamed multi-layer categorical data. Assuming that each subject has a common\nmixed membership shared across all layers, enabling it to be affiliated with\nmultiple latent classes with varying weights, the objective of the grade of\nmembership (GoM) analysis is to estimate these mixed memberships from the data.\nWhen the test is conducted only once, the data becomes traditional single-layer\ncategorical data. The GoM model is a popular choice for describing single-layer\ncategorical data with a latent mixed membership structure. However, GoM cannot\nhandle multi-layer categorical data. In this work, we propose a new model,\nmulti-layer GoM, which extends GoM to multi-layer categorical data. To estimate\nthe common mixed memberships, we propose a new approach, GoM-DSoG, based on a\ndebiased sum of Gram matrices. We establish GoM-DSoG's per-subject convergence\nrate under the multi-layer GoM model. Our theoretical results suggest that\nfewer no-responses, more subjects, more items, and more layers are beneficial\nfor GoM analysis. We also propose an approach to select the number of latent\nclasses. Extensive experimental studies verify the theoretical findings and\nshow GoM-DSoG's superiority over its competitors, as well as the accuracy of\nour method in determining the number of latent classes.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
