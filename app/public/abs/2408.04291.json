We provide a sufficient condition for the existence and\nuniqueness of the individual optimal strategies used to minimize the social\ncost. According to the definition of social optimum and the derived properties\nof social optimal cost, the existence and uniqueness conditions of equilibrium\nsolutions under initial-terminal value constraints in the finite horizon and\nthe existence and uniqueness conditions of stable solutions in the infinite\nhorizon are given. Finally, two examples that satisfy the conditions for the\nabove solutions are provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
