In this paper we study the\ninvertibility problem under the novel geometric condition on the image of the\nsymbols, which relaxes the standard positivity condition. We show that under\nour geometric assumption, the Toeplitz operator $T_\\varphi$ is invertible if\nand only if the Berezin transform of $|\\varphi|$ is invertible in $L^{\\infty}$.\nIt is well known that the Douglas problem is still open for harmonic functions.\nWe study a class of rather general harmonic polynomials and characterize the\ninvertibility of the corresponding Toeplitz operators. We also give a number of\nrelated results and examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cMskMPElwC9INYxk9U3RmN9gvbTQgIyItAKDLA_7Ijo","pdfSize":"228086"}
