Following MapTR\nparadigm, recent works have made noteworthy achievements. However, reference\npoints are randomly initialized in mainstream methods, leading to unstable\nmatching between predictions and ground truth. To address this issue, we\nintroduce PriorMapNet to enhance online vectorized HD map construction with\npriors. We propose the PPS-Decoder, which provides reference points with\nposition and structure priors. Fitted from the map elements in the dataset,\nprior reference points lower the learning difficulty and achieve stable\nmatching. Furthermore, we propose the PF-Encoder to enhance the image-to-BEV\ntransformation with BEV feature priors. Besides, we propose the DMD\ncross-attention, which decouples cross-attention along multi-scale and\nmulti-sample respectively to achieve efficiency. Our proposed PriorMapNet\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in the online vectorized HD map\nconstruction task on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. The code will be\nreleased publicly soon.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
