The black holes are exact solutions to an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton\ntheory and include the well-known Gubser-Rocha model. After reviewing the\nsetup, we scrutinize the geometry beyond the horizon, finding that these\nbackgrounds can exhibit timelike or Kasner singularities. We generalize the no\ninner-horizon theorem for hairy black holes to accommodate these findings. We\nthen consider observables sensitive to the geometry behind the horizon, such as\nComplexity = Anything and the thermal $a$-function. In the Kasner case, we\npropose a new variant of complexity that characterizes the late-time rate by\nthe Kasner exponents, extending previous work by J{\\o}rstad, Myers and Ruan.\nAdditionally, we elucidate the power-law behavior of the thermal $a$-function\nnear the singularity, directly relating it to the Kasner exponents. Finally, we\nintroduce axion-like fields in the Gubser-Rocha model to study the impact of\ntranslational symmetry breaking on the black hole interior. We show that Kasner\nsingularities occur for both explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, with\nthe Kasner exponents depending on the strength of broken translations only in\nthe latter case.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
