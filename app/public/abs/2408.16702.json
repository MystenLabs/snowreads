However, the design space of model check visualizations is not well\nunderstood, making it difficult for authors to explore and specify effective\ngraphical model checks. VMC defines a model check visualization using four\ncomponents: (1) samples of distributions of checkable quantities generated from\nthe model, including predictive distributions for new data and distributions of\nmodel parameters; (2) transformations on observed data to facilitate\ncomparison; (3) visual representations of distributions; and (4) layouts to\nfacilitate comparing model samples and observed data. We contribute an\nimplementation of VMC as an R package. We validate VMC by reproducing a set of\ncanonical model check examples, and show how using VMC to generate model checks\nreduces the edit distance between visualizations relative to existing\nvisualization toolkits. The findings of an interview study with three expert\nmodelers who used VMC highlight challenges and opportunities for encouraging\nexploration of correct, effective model check visualizations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
