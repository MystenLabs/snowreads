In this work, we look at another clinically useful\nfeature, skin lesion elevation, and investigate the feasibility of predicting\nand leveraging skin lesion elevation labels. Specifically, we use a deep\nlearning model to predict image-level lesion elevation labels from 2D skin\nlesion images. We test the elevation prediction accuracy on the derm7pt\ndataset, and use the elevation prediction model to estimate elevation labels\nfor images from five other datasets: ISIC 2016, 2017, and 2018 Challenge\ndatasets, MSK, and DermoFit. We evaluate cross-domain generalization by using\nthese estimated elevation labels as auxiliary inputs to diagnosis models, and\nshow that these improve the classification performance, with AUROC improvements\nof up to 6.29% and 2.69% for dermoscopic and clinical images, respectively.
