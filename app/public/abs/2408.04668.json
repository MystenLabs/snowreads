In this paper, we propose\nthe problem of predicting user intent from browsing history and address it\nthrough a two-stage approach. The first stage classifies a user's browsing\nhistory into high-level intent categories. Here, we represent each browsing\nhistory as a text sequence of page attributes and use the ground-truth class\nlabels to fine-tune pretrained Transformers. The second stage provides a large\nlanguage model (LLM) with the browsing history and predicted intent class to\ngenerate fine-grained intents. For automatic evaluation, we use a separate LLM\nto judge the similarity between generated and ground-truth intents, which\nclosely aligns with human judgments. Our two-stage approach yields significant\nperformance gains compared to generating intents without the classification\nstage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_JvNicSHf0AhbUvQPgMjg3vrCtWIfgQTEEDbd0DGAYY","pdfSize":"719383"}
