In general, algorithms which\nare simpler and easier for humans to comprehend tend to show worse performance\nthan more complex, less transparent algorithms. For example, a random forest\nclassifier is likely to be more accurate than a simple decision tree, but at\nthe expense of interpretability. In this paper, we present an ensemble\nclassifier design which classifies easier inputs using a highly-interpretable\nclassifier (i.e., white box model), and more difficult inputs using a more\npowerful, but less interpretable classifier (i.e., black box model).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gIN7Ac4wUS1TOXKb4_a8AoGJqoDW_Q3WCdfanSiNTbY","pdfSize":"558712"}
