Previously,\nitems in the dynamics operate independently of one another, and each is assumed\nto belong to a different seller. In this paper, we show how it can be\ngeneralized to the setting where each seller brings multiple items and buyers\nallocate budgets at the granularity of sellers rather than individual items.\nThe generalized dynamics consistently converges to the competitive equilibrium,\nand interestingly relates to the auto-bidding paradigm currently popular in\nonline advertising auction markets. In contrast to peer-to-peer networks, the\nproportional rule is not imposed as a protocol in auto-bidding markets.\nRegarding this incentive concern, we show that buyers have a strong tendency to\nfollow the rule, but it is easy for sellers to profitably deviate (given\nbuyers' commitment to the rule). Based on this observation, we further study\nthe seller-side deviation game and show that it admits a unique pure Nash\nequilibrium. Though it is generally different from the competitive equilibrium,\nwe show that it attains a good fairness guarantee as long as the market is\ncompetitive enough and not severely monopolized.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
