When two sessile drops undergo freezing in close vicinity over a\nsubstrate, they interact with each other through the gaseous phase and the\nsimultaneous presence of evaporation/condensation. In an unsaturated\nenvironment, the evaporation flux over the two volatile sessile drops is\nasymmetric, with lower evaporation in the region between the two drops. This\nasymmetry in the evaporation flux generates an asymmetric curvature in each\ndrop, which results in a capillary flow that drives the drops closer to each\nother, eventually leading to their coalescence. This capillary flow, driven by\nevaporation, competes with the upward movement of the freezing front, depending\non the relative humidity in the surrounding environment. We found that higher\nrelative humidity reduces the evaporative flux, delaying capillary flow and\nimpeding coalescence by restricting contact line motion. For a constant\nrelative humidity, the substrate temperature governs the coalescence\nphenomenon, and resulting condensation can accelerate this process.\nInterestingly, lower substrate temperatures are observed to facilitate faster\npropagation of the freezing front, which, in turn, restricts coalescence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
