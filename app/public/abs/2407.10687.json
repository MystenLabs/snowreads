Existing methods typically rely on corner\nregression or box regression, which lack consideration for the global shapes of\nrooms. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach using a room-wise\nimplicit representation with structural regularization to characterize the\nshapes of rooms in floorplans. By incorporating geometric priors of room\nlayouts in floorplans into our training strategy, the generated room polygons\nare more geometrically regular. We have conducted experiments on two\nchallenging datasets, Structured3D and SceneCAD. Our method demonstrates\nimproved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, validating the\neffectiveness of our proposed representation for floorplan reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
