We establish\nprecise criteria for when this ring is well-defined, and for an appropriate\ncompletion $Q$ of $Q(R)$, we prove that if $Q$ has characteristic $p$, $\\delta$\nis an inner $\\sigma$-derivation and no positive power of $\\sigma$ is inner as\nan automorphism of $Q$, then $Q^+[[x;\\sigma,\\delta]]$ is often prime, and even\nsimple under certain mild restrictions on $\\delta$. It follows from this result\nthat $R^+[[x;\\sigma,\\delta]]$ is itself prime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
