Our setup relies on Rydberg\nexcitations hopping through the lattice by dipolar exchange interactions. The\nmagnetic flux arises from complex hopping via ancilla atoms. Remarkably, the\ntotal flux within a magnetic unit cell directly depends on the ratio of the\nnumber of lattice sites to ancilla atoms, making it topologically protected to\nsmall changes in the positions of the atoms. This allows us to optimize the\npositions of the ancilla atoms to make the flux through the magnetic unit cell\nhomogeneous. With this homogeneous flux, we get a topological flat band in the\nsingle-particle regime. In the many-body regime, we obtain indications of a\nbosonic fractional Chern insulator state at $\\nu = 1/2$ filling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KdpIXFLZ8__Io6E2r0UYcGUAYSsVqCtMsrO0u__j_PU","pdfSize":"2210421"}
