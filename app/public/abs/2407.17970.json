The\nclassical result due to Helson and Lowdenslager divides a two-parametric\nweak-stationary stochastic process into three parts. In this paper we describe\nthe most untouchable one - the evanescent part. Moreover, we point out how this\npart depends on the shape of the past.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
