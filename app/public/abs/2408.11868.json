It\nfocuses on enhancing semantic textual similarity tasks and addressing text\nretrieval problems. The proposed method uses soft labels derived from\nexpert-augmented scores to fine-tune embedding models, preserving their\nversatility and ensuring retrieval capability is improved. The paper evaluates\nthe method using a Q\\&A dataset from an online shopping website and eight\nexpert models. Results show improved performance over a benchmark model across\nmultiple metrics on various retrieval tasks from the massive text embedding\nbenchmark (MTEB). The method is cost-effective and practical for real-world\napplications, especially when labeled data is scarce.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
