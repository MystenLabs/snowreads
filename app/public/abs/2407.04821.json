These devices typically utilize a transverse interaction\nmechanism between acoustic and optical waves, resulting in a fundamental\ntrade-off between the input aperture and the modulation frequency. Commercially\navailable modulators with centimeter square apertures have operating\nfrequencies in the vicinity of 50 kHz. In this work, we experimentally\ndemonstrate a birefringence-free photoelastic modulator operating at\napproximately 2.7 MHz with a centimeter square aperture, increasing the\noperating frequency substantially compared to existing approaches. Using the\nmodulator and polarizers, we demonstrate close to $\\pi$ radians polarization\nmodulation amplitude with sub-watt drive power, translating to nearly 100%\nintensity modulation efficiency at the fundamental (2.7 MHz) and second\nharmonic (5.4 MHz) frequencies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
