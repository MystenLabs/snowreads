This problem is notoriously\nchallenging for classical optimization methods due to computational\nconstraints. First, we show that state-of-the-art deep learning methods suffer\nfrom huge performance degradation when the point clouds are arbitrarily placed\nin space. We propose that equivariant deep learning should be utilized for\nsolving this task and we characterize the specific type of bi-equivariance of\nPCR. Then, we design BiEquiformer a novel and scalable bi-equivariant pipeline\ni.e. equivariant to the independent transformations of the input point clouds.\nWhile a naive approach would process the point clouds independently we design\nexpressive bi-equivariant layers that fuse the information from both point\nclouds. This allows us to extract high-quality superpoint correspondences and\nin turn, robust point-cloud registration. Extensive comparisons against\nstate-of-the-art methods show that our method achieves comparable performance\nin the canonical setting and superior performance in the robust setting in both\nthe 3DMatch and the challenging low-overlap 3DLoMatch dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
