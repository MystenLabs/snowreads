We\nprovide a recipe for the computation of $K_1(M_R)$, where $M_R$ is a free\nmodule over a PID $R$, subject to the knowledge of the abelianizations of the\ngeneral linear groups $GL_n(R)$. As a consequence, we provide explicit\ncomputations of $K_1(M_R)$ when $R$ belongs to a large class of Euclidean\ndomains that includes fields with at least $3$ elements and polynomial rings\nover fields with characteristic $0$. We also show that the algebraic $K_1$ of a\nPID $R$ embeds into $K_1(R_R)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
