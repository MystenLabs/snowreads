The existence and uniqueness of the\nPDWG solution are established. Optimal order of error estimates are derived in\nboth a discrete norm and the $L^2$ norm. The convergence analysis is conducted\nfor domain decompositions into individual elements associated with the PDWG\nmethods, which can be extended to larger subdomains without any difficulty.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
