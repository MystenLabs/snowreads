Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream\ntechnique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on\nabundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt\nlearning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt\nmethods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of\nreal-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic,\nnot strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic\npatterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and\nnodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt\nlearning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing\ngraph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of\npre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique\nnon-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to\ncharacterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we\nthoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten\npublic datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
