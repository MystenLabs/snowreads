In our models a combination of the N\\'{e}el order and\nthe charge-density wave order results in spin splitting of the conducting\nfermions. In addition, spin-orbit coupling is required to drive the anomalous\nHall effect. In the first model we analyzed the effects of the Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling, and of the intrinsic $d-$wave spin-orbit coupling in the\nsecond model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
