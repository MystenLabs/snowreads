Unlike the Euclidean setting, these graph classes are different for\ndifferent values of $r$, where very small $r$ corresponds to an\nalmost-Euclidean setting and $r \\in \\Omega(\\log n)$ corresponds to a firmly\nhyperbolic setting. We observe that larger values of $r$ create simpler graph\nclasses, at least in terms of separators and the computational complexity of\nthe \\textsc{Independent Set} problem.\n  First, we show that intersection graphs of disks of radius $r$ in the\nhyperbolic plane can be separated with $\\mathcal{O}((1+1/r)\\log n)$ cliques in\na balanced manner. Our second structural insight concerns Delaunay complexes in\nthe hyperbolic plane and may be of independent interest. We show that for any\nset $S$ of $n$ points with pairwise distance at least $2r$ in the hyperbolic\nplane the corresponding Delaunay complex has outerplanarity\n$1+\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\log n}{r})$, which implies a similar bound on the\nbalanced separators and treewidth of such Delaunay complexes.\n  Using this outerplanarity (and treewidth) bound we prove that\n\\textsc{Independent Set} can be solved in $n^{\\mathcal{O}(1+\\frac{\\log n}{r})}$\ntime. The algorithm is based on dynamic programming on some unknown sphere cut\ndecomposition that is based on the solution. The resulting algorithm is a\nfar-reaching generalization of a result of Kisfaludi-Bak (SODA 2020), and it is\ntight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. In particular, \\textsc{Independent\nSet} is polynomial-time solvable in the firmly hyperbolic setting of $r\\in\n\\Omega(\\log n)$. Finally, in the case when the disks have ply (depth) at most\n$\\ell$, we give a PTAS for \\textsc{Maximum Independent Set} that has only\nquasi-polynomial dependence on $1/\\varepsilon$ and $\\ell$. Our PTAS is a\nfurther generalization of our exact algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"18TILZoJvaGvrQ16entTGV_q6whiiyvFcdUvbRn1IsU","pdfSize":"1898083"}
