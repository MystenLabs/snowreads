Two configurations of bilayer\nsystems were analyzed: gold on silver and silver on gold. According to\ncalculations, the best sensitivity values were achieved with a total thickness\nof approximately 55 nm for the gold on silver system and approximately 65 nm\nfor the silver on gold system. These calculations were supported by\nexperimental results in a Kretschmann configuration for ethanol gas sensing.\nThe bilayer systems showed a huge advantage compared to the widely used single\ngold thin film, however, special attention should be paid to the silver on gold\nconfiguration, as corrosion plays an important role in decreasing sensitivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"87Nhj-vNJRLZBqru6aHIYEw56VrvcFAEvCB65URUnCk","pdfSize":"711868"}
