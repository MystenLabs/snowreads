While biological systems naturally exhibit robustness, there is no\ncomprehensive understanding of how to achieve similar robustness in robotic\nsystems. In this work, we draw inspirations from biological systems and propose\na design principle that advocates active interconnections among system\ncomponents to enhance robustness to environmental variations. We evaluate this\ndesign principle in a challenging long-horizon manipulation task: solving\nlockboxes. Our extensive simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that\nwe could enhance robustness against environmental changes by establishing\nactive interconnections among system components without substantial changes in\nindividual components. Our findings suggest that a systematic investigation of\ndesign principles in system building is necessary. It also advocates for\ninterdisciplinary collaborations to explore and evaluate additional principles\nof biological robustness to advance the development of intelligent and\nadaptable robotic systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
