It is the\nfirst open-source C program tailored for geometrical multigrid (GMG) CSEM\nsimulation. An volumetric anisotropic averaging scheme has been employed to\ncompute effective medium for modelling over uniform and nonuniform grid. The\ncomputing coordinate is aligned with acquisition geometry by rotation with the\nazimuth and dip angles, facilitating the injection of the source and the\nextraction of data with arbitrary orientations. Efficient nonlinear\noptimization is achieved using quasi-Newton scheme assisted with bisection\nbacktracking line search. In constructing the modularized Maxwell solver and\nevaluating the misfit and gradient for 3D CSEM inversion, the reverse\ncommunication technique is the key to the compaction of the software while\nmaintaining the computational performance. A number of numeric tests\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the modelling while preserving the solution\naccuracy. A 3D marine CSEM inversion example has been examined for resistivity\nimaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"mbNjNQDKVWaR8SDBUkyPU9dd7GmJtmR-9wDbN5gl6os","pdfSize":"1763556"}
