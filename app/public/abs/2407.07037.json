Our findings suggest that the heterotrinuclear molecular\nnanomagnet\n$[\\{\\text{Cu}^\\text{II}\\text{L}\\}_2\\text{Ni}^\\text{II}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_2](\\text{ClO}_4)_23\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$,\nwhich represents an experimental realization of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2)\nHeisenberg trimer, exhibits a significant bipartite entanglement between\n$\\text{Cu}^\\text{II}$ and $\\text{Ni}^\\text{II}$ magnetic ions along with robust\ntripartite entanglement among all three constituent magnetic ions. The\nsignificant bipartite and tripartite entanglement persists even at relatively\nhigh temperatures up to $37\\,\\text{K}$ and magnetic fields up to\n$50\\,\\text{T}$, whereby the coherence is maintained even at elevated\ntemperatures. In addition, we investigate the spin squeezing parameter within\nthermal states of the spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer. Our exact results\nreveal optimal conditions for achieving the highest degree of the spin\nsqueezing, which are achieved at zero magnetic field around $T \\approx\n30\\,\\text{K}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
