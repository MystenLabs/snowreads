Polujan, L. Mariot and S. Picek\nexhibited the first example of a non-normal but weakly normal bent function in\ndimension 8. In this note, we present numerical approaches based on the\nclassification of Boolean spaces to explore in detail the normality of bent\nfunctions of 8 variables and we complete S. Dubuc s results for dimensions less\nor equal to 7. Based on our investigations, we show that all bent functions in\n8 variables are normal or weakly normal. Finally, we conjecture that more\ngenerally all Boolean functions of degree at most 4 in 8 variables are normal\nor weakly normal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oNi_xvGBujIU5xMpGs63MZyoAWv8SpEkusSeozub_Nk","pdfSize":"127378"}
