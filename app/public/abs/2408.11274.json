In the Anosov setting, there is a natural compact metric space\n$\\mathcal{X}$ equipped with a family of translation flows\n$\\{a^{\\mathsf{v}}_t\\}_{t \\in \\mathbb R}$, parameterized by vectors $\\mathsf{v}$\nin the interior of the $\\Theta$-limit cone $\\mathcal{L}_\\Theta$ of $\\Gamma$,\nand they are H\\\"{o}lder conjugate to H\\\"{o}lder reparametrizations of the\nGromov geodesic flow. We prove that for all $\\mathsf{v}$ outside an exceptional\ncone $\\mathscr{E} \\subset \\operatorname{int}\\mathcal{L}_\\Theta$, which is a\nsmooth image of the walls of the Weyl chamber, the translation flow is\nexponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure\nassociated to $\\mathsf{v}$. Moreover, the exponential rate is uniform for a\ncompact set of such $\\mathsf{v}$. We also obtain an essential spectral gap\nformulated in terms of the Selberg zeta function and a prime orbit theorem with\na power saving error term. Our proof relies on Lie theoretic techniques to\nprove the crucial local non-integrability condition (LNIC) for the translation\nflows and thereby implement Dolgopyat's method in a uniform fashion. The\nexceptional cone $\\mathscr{E}$ arises from the failure of LNIC for those\nvectors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
