The ability of LLMs to understand and\ngenerate human-like text makes them particularly useful for analysing social\nmedia data to detect and evaluate sentiments. We present a sentiment analysis\nframework utilising LLMs for longitudinal sentiment analysis of the Sinophobic\nsentiments expressed in X (Twitter) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results\nshow a significant correlation between the spikes in Sinophobic tweets,\nSinophobic sentiments and surges in COVID-19 cases, revealing that the\nevolution of the pandemic influenced public sentiment and the prevalence of\nSinophobic discourse. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis revealed a\npredominant presence of negative sentiments, such as annoyance and denial,\nwhich underscores the impact of political narratives and misinformation shaping\npublic opinion. The lack of empathetic sentiment which was present in previous\nstudies related to COVID-19 highlights the way the political narratives in\nmedia viewed the pandemic and how it blamed the Chinese community. Our study\nhighlights the importance of transparent communication in mitigating xenophobic\nsentiments during global crises.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
