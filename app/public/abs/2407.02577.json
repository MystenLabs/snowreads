We show how a `duality' relating\n$\\ell$ to $h$ implies that $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{H}$ are related by a\nsimple map between appropriate pairs of variables. We also discuss Born's\n\"Legendre self-duality\" and implications of a new \"$\\Phi$-parity\" duality. Our\nresults are illustrated with many examples.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
