The package is also\nmodular, providing researchers an easy way to implement their own triggering\nstrategy for classification, regression or any machine learning task. As of\nnow, many Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS) state-of-the-art\nalgorithms, are efficiently implemented in the library leveraging parallel\ncomputation. The syntax follows the one introduce in \\texttt{scikit-learn},\nmaking estimators and pipelines compatible with \\texttt{ml\\_edm}.
