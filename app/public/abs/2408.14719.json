In this letter, we expand\nthe model from previous works on testing the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LV)\nwith the observed GRB data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We\nreanalyze the previous data with the full Bayesian parameter estimation method\nand get consistent results by assuming that the time delays are due to an LV\nterm and a constant intrinsic time delay term. Subsequently, we neglect the LV\neffect and only consider the intrinsic time delay effect. We assume a common\nintrinsic time delay term along with a source energy correlated time delay of\nhigh-energy photons. We find that the energy-dependent emission times can also\nexplain the observed GRB data of high-energy photon events. Finally, we\nintegrate these two physical mechanisms into a unified model to distinguish and\nevaluate their respective contributions using the observed GRB data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
