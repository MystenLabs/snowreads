This is an essential basis for humans' ability to\ncooperate and communicate. However, what are the neuronal properties that\nunderlie these inter-subject commonalities of our visual world? Finding out\nwhat aspects of neuronal coding remain invariant across individuals' brains\nwill shed light not only on this fundamental question but will also point to\nthe neuronal coding scheme as the basis of visual perception. Here, we address\nthis question by obtaining intracranial recordings from three cohorts of\npatients taking part in a different visual recognition task (overall 19\npatients and 244 high-order visual contacts included in the analyses) and\nexamining the neuronal coding scheme most consistent across individuals' visual\ncortex. Our results highlight relational coding - expressed by the set of\nsimilarity distances between profiles of pattern activations - as the most\nconsistent representation across individuals. Alternative coding schemes, such\nas population vector coding or linear coding, failed to achieve similar\ninter-subject consistency. Our results thus support relational coding as the\ncentral neuronal code underlying individuals' shared perceptual content in the\nhuman brain.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
