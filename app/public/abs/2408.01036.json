While much research has explored the relationship between\nexpressibility and learning performance, as well as the number of layers in\nPQCs, the connection between expressibility and PQC structure has received\ncomparatively less attention. In this paper, we analyze the connection between\nexpressibility and the types of quantum gates within PQCs using a Gradient\nBoosting Tree model and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Our\nanalysis is performed on 1,615 instances of PQC derived from 19 PQC topologies,\neach with 2-18 qubits and 1-5 layers. The findings of our analysis provide\nguidance for designing highly expressible PQCs, suggesting the integration of\nmore RX or RY gates while maintaining a careful balance with the number of CNOT\ngates. Furthermore, our evaluation offers an additional evidence of\nexpressibility saturation, as observed by previous studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yYU844kihT_dfJxvXXfXQp61H9YC1ZyljS11-8ojzDw","pdfSize":"4292836"}
