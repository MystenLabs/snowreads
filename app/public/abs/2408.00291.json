SCM assumes the\nstable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), which posits that potential\noutcomes are unaffected by the treatment status of other units. However,\ninterventions often impact not only treated units but also untreated units,\nknown as spillover effects. This study introduces a novel panel data method\nthat extends SCM to allow for spillover effects and estimate both treatment and\nspillover effects. This method leverages a spatial autoregressive panel data\nmodel to account for spillover effects. We also propose Bayesian inference\nmethods using Bayesian horseshoe priors for regularization. We apply the\nproposed method to two empirical studies: evaluating the effect of the\nCalifornia tobacco tax on consumption and estimating the economic impact of the\n2011 division of Sudan on GDP per capita.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4prWYuTA0k8dx_fSFwqQD3BSEbOMiQiCGz0Lyn0-fgU","pdfSize":"672473","txDigest":"HHrs8Vbwk6R8yf863YnYs25598d1ZZUXZgpiDyS5mA1h","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
