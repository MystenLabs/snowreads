These descriptions help\nreviewers and fellow developers quickly understand the updates. Despite their\nimportance, some developers omit these descriptions. To tackle this problem, we\npropose an automated method for generating PR descriptions based on commit\nmessages and source code comments. This method frames the task as a text\nsummarization problem, for which we utilized the T5 text-to-text transfer\nmodel. We fine-tuned a pre-trained T5 model using a dataset containing 33,466\nPRs. The model's effectiveness was assessed using ROUGE metrics, which are\nrecognized for their strong alignment with human evaluations. Our findings\nreveal that the T5 model significantly outperforms LexRank, which served as our\nbaseline for comparison.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eVLm8StRhDJvcsBjrWPJb8UsbY7vJiFv2BlK02hTK3M","pdfSize":"361204"}
