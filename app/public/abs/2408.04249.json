By inputting a\ntarget-style image, it quickly generates new 3D GS scenes. Our method operates\non pre-reconstructed GS scenes, combining diffusion models with an improved\niterative dataset update strategy. It utilizes diffusion models to generate\ntarget style images, adds these new images to the training dataset, and uses\nthis dataset to iteratively update and optimize the GS scenes, significantly\naccelerating the style editing process while ensuring the quality of the\ngenerated scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method\nensures high-quality stylized scenes while offering significant advantages in\nstyle transfer speed and consistency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
