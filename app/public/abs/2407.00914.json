We\nfirst study the multifractal spectrum of the convergence exponent defined by\nthe sequence of the digits $\\{a_n(x)\\}_{n\\geq1}$ and the weighted products of\ndistinct digits with finite numbers respectively, and then calculate the\nHausdorff dimensions of the intersection of sets defined by the convergence\nexponent of the weighted product of distinct digits with finite numbers and\nsets of points whose digits are non-decreasing in such iterated function\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
