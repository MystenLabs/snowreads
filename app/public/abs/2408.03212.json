First we derive a cut-and-join\ntype representation for the generalized dessin partition function using the\nactions of $W$-type operators on Schur functions. Then we study the polynomial\nstructures of the generalized dessin partition function. We prove a polynomial\nstructure for the disconnected correlators which generalizes a result of\nStanley, and then propose a conjectural polynomial structure for the connected\ncorrelators. We prove the $1$-point case of this conjecture using the KP\nintegrability of this partition function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
