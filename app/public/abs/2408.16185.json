{"id":"2408.16185","title":"The Briggs inequality for partitions and overpartitions","authors":"Xin-Bei Liu, Zhong-Xue Zhang","authorsParsed":[["Liu","Xin-Bei",""],["Zhang","Zhong-Xue",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 00:49:36 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-30","timestamp":1724892576000,"abstract":"  A sequence of $\\{a_n\\}_{n\\ge 0}$ satisfies the Briggs inequality if\n\\begin{align*} a_n^2(a_n^2-a_{n-1}a_{n+1})>a_{n-1}^2(a_{n+1}^2-a_na_{n+2})\n\\end{align*} holds for any $n\\ge 1$. In this paper we show that both the\npartition function $\\{p(n+N_0)\\}_{n\\geq 0}$ and the overpartition function\n$\\{\\overline{p}(n+\\overline{N}_0)\\}_{n\\ge 0}$ satisfy the Briggs inequality for\nsome $N_0$ and $\\overline{N}_{0}$. Based on Chern's formula for\n$\\eta$-quotients, we further prove that the $k$-regular partition function\n$\\{p_k(n+N_{k})\\}_{n\\geq 0}$ and the $k$-regular overpartition function\n$\\{\\overline{p}_k(n+\\overline{N}_k)\\}_{n\\ge 0}$ also satisfy the Briggs\ninequality for $2\\le k\\le 9$ and some $N_k,\\overline{N}_{k}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
