While runtime verification techniques seem ideal for\nensuring the correctness of such highly dynamic and large-scale networks,\nintegrating runtime monitors seamlessly into real-world industrial use cases\npresents significant challenges. This paper studies modern containerization\ntechnology to deploy runtime verification tools to monitor publish/subscribe\nnetworks with a performance focus. Runtime verification containers are\nlightweight and deployable alongside other containerized publisher and\nsubscriber participants. Each runtime verification container monitors message\nflow, enabling runtime verification of network behavior. We comprehensively\nbenchmark the container-based approach using several experiments and a\nreal-world case study from the software-defined vehicle domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
