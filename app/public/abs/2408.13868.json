In this paper, we introduce a particle-filtering-based framework for\na nonlinear exploration of the solution space in the initial stages of reverse\nSDE methods. Our proposed particle-filtering-based latent diffusion (PFLD)\nmethod and proposed problem formulation and framework can be applied to any\ndiffusion-based solution for linear or nonlinear inverse problems. Our\nexperimental results show that PFLD outperforms the SoTA solver PSLD on the\nFFHQ-1K and ImageNet-1K datasets on inverse problem tasks of super resolution,\nGaussian debluring and inpainting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"TU97oPAWtwBcDMzBiSGp7t1P4QzGTw5QiNAdHai7xeY","pdfSize":"25702082"}
