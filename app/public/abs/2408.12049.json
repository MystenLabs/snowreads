Generalized\nReed-Solomon (GRS) codes are the most prominent MDS codes. Twisted generalized\nReed-Solomon (TGRS) codes may not necessarily be MDS. It is meaningful to study\nthe conditions under which TGRS codes are MDS. In this paper, we study a\ngeneral class of TGRS (A-TGRS) codes which include all the known special ones.\nFirst, we obtain a new explicit expression of the inverse of the Vandermonde\nmatrix. Based on this, we further derive an equivalent condition under which an\nA-TGRS code is MDS. According to this, the A-TGRS MDS codes include nearly all\nthe known related results in the previous literatures. More importantly, we\nalso obtain many other classes of MDS TGRS codes with new parameter matrices.\nIn addition, we present a new method to compute the inverse of the lower\ntriangular Toplitz matrix by a linear feedback shift register, which will be\nvery useful in many research fields.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
