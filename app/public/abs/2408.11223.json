By simulating the soft glassy rheology model in a form\nextended to allow steady state shear banding, we show that the presence of\nshear bands prior to flow cessation can give rise to this phenomenon. We give a\nmechanistic understanding of the basic physics involved, in terms of (i) the\ndecay of the shear bands after flow cessation, and (ii) the evolution of\nfrustrated local stresses, governed by different time scales for plastic\nrelaxation in each band. In particular, an elastic recoil in the unsheared band\ngives rise to negative local frustrated stresses, the slow release of which can\ncause an increase in macroscopic stress. Given that shear banding and\nfrustrated local stresses arise widely across disordered soft solids, we argue\nthat non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation may occur in many\ndifferent materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XjeB3HBPhhM4Hx4LFKmxWAsZHBi5LhicladIOdUER-U","pdfSize":"482486"}
