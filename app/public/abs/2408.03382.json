The\npolynomials within this family are referred to as $e$-Klenian polynomials.\nFurthermore, they have shown the existence of companions for the $e$-Klenian\npolynomials when the characteristic of the finite field is odd. Here, we\npresent three new families of local permutation polynomials over finite fields\nof even characteristic. We also consider the problem of the existence of\ncompanions for the $e$-Klenian polynomials over finite fields of even\ncharacteristic. More precisely, we prove that over finite fields of even\ncharacteristic, the $0$-Klenian polynomials do not have any companions.\nHowever, for $e \\geq 1$, we explicitly provide a companion for the $e$-Klenian\npolynomials. Moreover, we provide a companion for each of the new families of\nlocal permutation polynomials that we introduce.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
