Here we show that, in some of\nthose applications, the use of the Ogden model leads to non-convexity of the\nstrain-energy function and mis-prediction of the correct concavity of the\nexperimental stress-stretch curves over a range of the deformation domain. By\ncontrast, we propose a family of models which provides a favourable fit to the\nconsidered datasets while remaining free from the highlighted shortcomings of\nthe Ogden model. While, as we discuss, those shortcomings might be due to the\nartefacts of the testing protocols, the proposed family of models proves\nimpervious to such artefacts.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
