More precisely, we show that if $\\{\\tau_j\\}_{j=1}^n$ is p-adic\n$\\gamma$-equiangular lines in $\\mathbb{Q}^d_p$, then \\begin{align*} (1)\n\\quad\\quad \\quad \\quad |n|^2\\leq |d|\\max\\{|n|, \\gamma^2 \\}. \\end{align*} We\ncall Inequality (1) as the p-adic van Lint-Seidel relative bound. We believe\nthat this complements fundamental van Lint-Seidel \\textit{[Indag.
