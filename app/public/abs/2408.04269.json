The whole\nprocedure is kept as simple as possible by presenting all the logical steps\ninvolved in the application of the energy method and leading to the\nEuler-Lagrange equations. Then, the eigenvalue problems needed for the\nevaluation of the nonlinear energy threshold of the Reynolds number for\nstability are formulated for transverse modes and for longitudinal modes. Such\nformulations involve the streamfunction and, in the case of longitudinal modes,\nalso the streamwise component of velocity. An accurate numerical solution of\nthe eigenvalue problems, based on Galerkin's method of weighted residuals with\nthe test functions expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials, is discussed in\ndetails. The numerical codes developed for the software Mathematica 14\n(\\copyright{} Wolfram Research, Inc.) are also presented. A critical analysis\nof the obtained results is finally proposed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
