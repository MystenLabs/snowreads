The algorithm consists of repeatedly\nstandardizing and applying an element-wise folding operation on the one-class\ntraining data. Equivalent mappings are performed on unknown test items and the\nclassification prediction is based on the item's distance to the origin of the\nfinal distribution. As all the included operations have linear time complexity,\nthe proposed algorithm provides a linear-time alternative for the commonly used\ncomputationally much more demanding approaches. Furthermore, REF can avoid the\nchallenges of hyperparameter setting in one-class classification by providing\nrobust default settings. The experiments show that the proposed method can\nproduce similar classification performance or even outperform the more complex\nalgorithms on various benchmark datasets.
