More precisely, we\ncharacterize the convergence in distribution of Feller processes by examining\nthe convergence of their generators. The main novelty lies in providing\nquantitative estimates in the vague topology at any fixed time. As important\napplications, we deduce functional central limit theorems for random walks on\nthe positive integers with boundary conditions, which converge to Brownian\nmotions on the positive half-line with boundary conditions at zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
