The nature of the outburst\nprofiles of both sources are examined using long-term MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT\nlightcurves, and failed as well as successful outbursts are classified.\nWide-band (0.5-60 keV) spectral modelling with disc (diskbb) and Comptonized\n(Nthcomp) components indicates that GX 339-4 transits from hard\n($kT_{bb}=0.12-0.77$ keV, $\\Gamma_{nth}=1.54-1.74$ and $L_{bol}=0.91-11.56$\\%\n$L_{Edd}$) to soft state ($kT_{in}~[\\approx{kT}_{bb}]=0.82-0.88$ keV,\n$\\Gamma_{nth}=1.46-3.26$, $L_{bol}=19.59-30.06\\%L_{Edd}$) via intermediate\nstate ($kT_{in}~[\\approx{kT}_{bb}]=0.56-0.88$ keV, $\\Gamma_{nth}=1.76-2.66$,\n$L_{bol}=2.90-16.09\\%L_{Edd}$), whereas H 1743-322 transits from quiescent to\nhard state ($\\Gamma_{nth}=1.57-1.71$, $L_{bol}=2.08-3.48\\%L_{Edd}$). We observe\ntype-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in GX 339-4 with\nincreasing frequencies ($0.10-5.37$ Hz) along with harmonics. For H 1743-322,\nprominent type-C QPOs are observed in frequency range 0.22-1.01 Hz along with\ndistinct harmonics. Energy-dependent power spectral studies reveal that\nfundamental QPO and harmonics disappear beyond 20 keV in GX 339-4, whereas\nfundamental QPO in H 1743-322 persists up to 40 keV. We also observe that\ntype-C $QPO_{rms}\\%$ decreases with energy for both sources although such\nvariations appear marginal for type-B QPOs. Additionally, we report\nnon-monotonic behavior of photon index with plasma temperature and detection of\nannihilation line. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the observational\nfindings in the context of accretion dynamics around black hole binaries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
