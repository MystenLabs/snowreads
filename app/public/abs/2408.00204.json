We prove\nthe existence of matings of generic (anti-)polynomials, such as periodically\nrepelling, or geometrically finite (anti-)polynomials, with circle maps arising\nfrom the corresponding groups. These matings emerge naturally as degenerate\n(anti-)polynomial-like maps, and we show that the corresponding parameter space\nslices for such matings bear strong resemblance with parameter spaces of\npolynomial maps. Furthermore, we provide algebraic descriptions for these\nmatings, and construct algebraic correspondences that combine generic\n(anti-)polynomials and genus zero orbifolds in a common dynamical plane,\nproviding a new concrete evidence to Fatou's vision of a unified theory of\ngroups and maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
