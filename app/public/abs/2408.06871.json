This form factor is expressed in terms of the perturbatively\ncalculable hard-scattering amplitudes (HSAs) and the light-front wave functions\n(LFWFs) of the pion. We obtain the pion LFWFs by diagonalizing the light-front\nQCD Hamiltonian, which is determined for its constituent quark-antiquark and\nquark-antiquark-gluon Fock sectors with a three-dimensional confinement. We\nemploy the HSAs up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the quark-antiquark Fock\nsector and leading order (LO) in the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sector. The NLO\ncorrection to the TFF in the quark-antiquark Fock sector is of the same order\nas the LO contribution to the TFF in the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sector. We\nfind that while the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sector has minimal effect in the\nlarge momentum transfer ($Q^2$) region, it has a noteworthy impact in the\nlow-$Q^2$ region. Our results show that, after accounting for both Fock\nsectors, the TFF within the BLFQ framework aligns well with existing\nexperimental data, particularly in the low $Q^2$ region.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
