In warm dense matter, which is opaque to visible light,\nx-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) enables a detailed probe of the electron\ndistribution and has been used as a diagnostic for electron temperature,\ndensity, and plasma ionization. In this work, we examine the sensitivities of\ninelastic XRTS signatures to modeling details including the dynamic collision\nfrequency and the electronic density of states. Applying verified Monte Carlo\ninversion methods to dynamic structure factors obtained from time-dependent\ndensity functional theory, we assess the utility of XRTS signals as a way to\ninform the dynamic collision frequency, especially its direct-current (DC)\nlimit, which is directly related to the electrical conductivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
