On smaller scales\ninhomogeneities and anisotropies become increasingly prominent, reflecting the\norigin, emergence and formation of structure in the Universe and its\ncosmological impact. Also, a range of tensions between various cosmological\nobservations may suggest it to be necessary to explore the consequences of such\ndeviations from the ideal uniform universe. In this study, we restrict this to\nan investigation of anisotropies on the nature of the Universe. This motivates\na more thorough understanding of the manifestation of anisotropy in\ncosmological applications. When letting go of the assumption of isotropy,\nspacetime metrics become homogeneous and completely anisotropic. As such, the\nLie algebras of Killing vector fields will be 3D, and fit into the so-called\n9-part Bianchi classification. This work strives to, given a suitable 3D Lie\nalgebra of vector fields $\\{\\xi_a\\}_{a=1,2,3}$ reconstruct the basis for a\nmetric on which this Lie algebra is Killing. Through finding a determining\nequation for the frame invariant under $\\{\\xi_a\\}$ and using the method of\ncharacteristics to solve it, expressions for said invariant frame in terms of\nthe $\\{\\xi_a\\}$ are obtained. This leads to general equations for the invariant\nframe in terms of the $\\{\\xi_a\\}$, organized by Bianchi class. Some examples\ndemonstrating this method are worked out.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
