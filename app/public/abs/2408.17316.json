Automated process\ndiscovery methods often overlook valuable domain knowledge. This knowledge,\nincluding insights from domain experts and detailed process documentation,\nremains largely untapped during process discovery. This paper leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to integrate such knowledge directly into process\ndiscovery. We use rules derived from LLMs to guide model construction, ensuring\nalignment with both domain knowledge and actual process executions. By\nintegrating LLMs, we create a bridge between process knowledge expressed in\nnatural language and the discovery of robust process models, advancing process\ndiscovery methodologies significantly. To showcase the usability of our\nframework, we conducted a case study with the UWV employee insurance agency,\ndemonstrating its practical benefits and effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
