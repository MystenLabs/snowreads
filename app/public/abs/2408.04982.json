We establish lower- and upper bounds for the size of these sets.\nThese bounds are sharp for $n$ sufficiently large. We also develop bounds on\nthe growth order of the terms of Lucas sequences that are independent of the\nparameters of the sequence, which is a new feature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
