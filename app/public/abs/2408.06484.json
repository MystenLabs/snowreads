While transcriptions exist for a number\nof languages, translated conversational speech is rare and datasets containing\nsummaries are non-existent. We build upon the existing Fisher and Callhome\nSpanish-English Speech Translation corpus by supplementing the translations\nwith summaries. The summaries are generated using GPT-4 from the reference\ntranslations and are treated as ground truth. The task is to generate similar\nsummaries in the presence of transcription and translation errors. We build a\nbaseline cascade-based system using open-source speech recognition and machine\ntranslation models. We test a range of LLMs for summarization and analyze the\nimpact of transcription and translation errors. Adapting the Mistral-7B model\nfor this task performs significantly better than off-the-shelf models and\nmatches the performance of GPT-4.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
