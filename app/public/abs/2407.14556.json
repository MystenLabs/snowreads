The model decomposes self-replication into core\ncomponents, each of which is executed by a single machine constructed from a\nset of basic block types. Key functionalities such as sorting, copying, and\nbuilding, are demonstrated. The model provides valuable insights into the\nconstraints of self-replicating systems. The discussion also addresses the\nspatial and timing behavior of the system, as well as its efficiency and\ncomplexity. This work provides a foundational framework for future studies on\nself-replicating mechanisms and their information-processing applications.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
