To perform\nsimulations outside the reach of classical computers, accurate and reliable\nimplementations of the anticipated Hamiltonians are required. To achieve those,\ncharacterization and benchmarking tools are a necessity. For digital quantum\ndevices, randomized benchmarking can provide a benchmark on the average quality\nof the implementation of a gate set. In this work, we introduce a versatile\nframework for randomized analog benchmarking of bosonic and fermionic quantum\ndevices implementing particle number preserving dynamics. The scheme makes use\nof the restricted operations which are native to analog simulators and other\ncontinuous variable systems. Importantly, like randomized benchmarking, it is\nrobust against state preparation and measurement errors. We discuss the\nscheme's efficiency, derive theoretical performance guarantees and showcase the\nprotocol with numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
