Rather than input\ntokens being known or unknown, a Superposed Language Model takes priors over\nthe sequence as input, enabling us to apply various constraints to the\ngeneration at inference time. After detailing our approach, we demonstrate our\nmodel across various editing tasks in the domain of multi-instrument MIDI\nloops. We end by highlighting some limitations of the approach and avenues for\nfuture work. We provides examples from the SLM across multiple generation and\nediting tasks at https://erl-j.github.io/slm-mml-demo/.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
