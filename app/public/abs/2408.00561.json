We study\ntheir different versions depending on the types of functors and higher\ntransforms. We construct Gray type products by generators and relations and\nprove that Gray skew-multicategories are closed and representable on one side,\nand that the Gray multicaticategories taken with the strict type of functors\nare representable. We conclude that the categories of double and\nGray-categories with strict functors underlying Gray (skew) multicategories are\nskew monoidal, respectively monoidal, depending on the type of the inner-hom\nand product considered. The described Gray (skew) multicategories we see as\nprototypes of general Gray (skew) multicategories, which correspond to (higher)\ncategories of higher dimensional internal and enriched categories.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
