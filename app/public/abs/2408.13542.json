While X-ray imaging\nremains a prevalent diagnostic tool, the increasing misinterpretation rates\nhighlight the need for more accurate analysis, especially considering the lack\nof specialized training among many surgeons and physicians. Recent advancements\nin deep convolutional neural networks offer promise in automating pathology\ndetection in trauma X-rays. However, distinguishing subtle variations between\n{pediatric} wrist pathologies in X-rays remains challenging. Traditional manual\nannotation, though effective, is laborious, costly, and requires specialized\nexpertise. {In this paper, we address the challenge of pediatric wrist\npathology recognition with a fine-grained approach, aimed at automatically\nidentifying discriminative regions in X-rays without manual intervention. We\nrefine our fine-grained architecture through ablation analysis and the\nintegration of LION.} Leveraging Grad-CAM, an explainable AI technique, we\nhighlight these regions. Despite using limited data, reflective of real-world\nmedical study constraints, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nimage recognition models on both augmented and original (challenging) test\nsets. {Our proposed refined architecture achieves an increase in accuracy of\n1.06% and 1.25% compared to the baseline method, resulting in accuracies of 86%\nand 84%, respectively. Moreover, our approach demonstrates the highest fracture\nsensitivity of 97%, highlighting its potential to enhance wrist pathology\nrecognition.
