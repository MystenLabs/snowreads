In real-world applications,\nVAD models must effectively operate in cross-domain settings, identifying rare\nanomalies and scenarios not well-represented in the training data. However,\nexisting cross-domain VAD methods focus on unsupervised learning, resulting in\nperformance that falls short of real-world expectations. Since acquiring weak\nsupervision, i.e., video-level labels, for the source domain is cost-effective,\nwe conjecture that combining it with external unlabeled data has notable\npotential to enhance cross-domain performance. To this end, we introduce a\nnovel weakly-supervised framework for Cross-Domain Learning (CDL) in VAD that\nincorporates external data during training by estimating its prediction bias\nand adaptively minimizing that using the predicted uncertainty. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed CDL framework through comprehensive\nexperiments conducted in various configurations on two large-scale VAD\ndatasets: UCF-Crime and XD-Violence. Our method significantly surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art works in cross-domain evaluations, achieving an average\nabsolute improvement of 19.6% on UCF-Crime and 12.87% on XD-Violence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
