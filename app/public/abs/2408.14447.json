We gathered photometric\nand astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and\ntangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class\ndistribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T\nsubdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young\nultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any\nestimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were\ncollected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5)\nand T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning\ntools as a new large-scale discovery technique.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
