We note that the optimal constant of the latter inequality\ndiffers from the former. Moreover, by iterating these inequalities we derive\nthe sequence of power-weighted Birman-Hardy-Rellich-type inequalities in\nintegral form on finite intervals and then also prove the analogous sequence of\ninequalities in differential form.\n  We use the one-dimensional Hardy-type result in differential form to derive\nan optimal multi-dimensional version of the power-weighted Hardy inequality in\ndifferential form on annuli (i.e., spherical shell domains), and once more\nemploy an iteration procedure to derive the Birman-Hardy-Rellich-type sequence\nof power-weighted higher-order Hardy-type inequalities for annuli.\n  In the limit as the annulus approaches $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we recover well-known\nprior results on Rellich-type inequalities on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vF9LMakP75uxRsxYswIl9CDTRkhrzVJZyqYKjQYLAZk","pdfSize":"168036"}
