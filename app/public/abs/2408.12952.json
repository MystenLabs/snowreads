We obtain strong\nasymptotics and the limiting normalized zero counting measure (mother body) of\nthe orthogonal polynomials of degree $n$ in the scaling limit $n,N\\to \\infty$\nsuch that $\\frac{n}{N}\\to t$. We restrict ourselves to the case $a^2\\geq 2c$,\n$cN$ integer, and $t<t^{*}$ where $t^{*}$ is a constant depending only on\n$a,c$. Due to this restriction, the mother body is supported on an interval. We\nalso find the two dimensional equilibrium measure (droplet) associated with the\neigenvalues in the corresponding normal matrix model.\n  Our method relies on the recent result that the planar orthogonal polynomials\nare a part of a vector of type I multiple orthogonal polynomials, and this\nenables us to apply the steepest descent method to the associated\nRiemann-Hilbert problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
