To tackle this issue widely\nexisting in real-world scenarios, we propose VTON-HandFit, leveraging the power\nof hand priors to reconstruct the appearance and structure for hand occlusion\ncases. Firstly, we tailor a Handpose Aggregation Net using the ControlNet-based\nstructure explicitly and adaptively encoding the global hand and pose priors.\nBesides, to fully exploit the hand-related structure and appearance\ninformation, we propose Hand-feature Disentanglement Embedding module to\ndisentangle the hand priors into the hand structure-parametric and\nvisual-appearance features, and customize a masked cross attention for further\ndecoupled feature embedding. Lastly, we customize a hand-canny constraint loss\nto better learn the structure edge knowledge from the hand template of model\nimage. VTON-HandFit outperforms the baselines in qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations on the public dataset and our self-collected hand-occlusion\nHandfit-3K dataset particularly for the arbitrary hand pose occlusion cases in\nreal-world scenarios.
