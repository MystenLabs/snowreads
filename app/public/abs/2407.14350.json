These models are essential in\nnuclear astrophysics and applications. In this work, we have for the first time\nsimultaneously measured the gamma-ray and neutron emission probabilities of\n208Pb. The measurement was performed in inverse kinematics at the Experimental\nStorage Ring (ESR) of the GSI/FAIR facility, where a 208Pb beam interacted\nthrough the 208Pb(p,p') reaction with a hydrogen gas jet target. Instead of\ndetecting the gamma-rays and neutrons emitted by 208Pb, we detected the heavy\nbeam-like residues produced after gamma and neutron emission. These heavy\nresidues were fully separated by a dipole magnet of the ESR and were detected\nwith outstanding efficiencies. The comparison of the measured probabilities\nwith model calculations has allowed us to test different descriptions of the\ngamma-ray strength function and the nuclear level density available in the\nliterature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
