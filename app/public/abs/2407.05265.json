Our attention is on input states that are a\nstatistical mixture of displaced and squeezed number states, a superset of\nGaussian states. In particular, we derive the quantum Fisher information matrix\n(QFIM) for estimating the expansion coefficients of the wavefront in an\northonormal basis, finding that it is diagonal. Moreover, we show that a\nmeasurement saturating the QFIM always exists, and point to an adaptive\nstrategy capable of implementing it. We then construct the optimal measurements\nfor three particular states: mixtures of photon number, coherent, and\nsingle-mode squeezed vacuum states. Sensitivity of the measurements to nuisance\nparameters is explored.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
