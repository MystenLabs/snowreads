{"id":"2408.03755","title":"Geographical Isolation as a Driver of Political Violence in African\n  Cities","authors":"Rafael Prieto-Curiel and Ronaldo Menezes","authorsParsed":[["Prieto-Curiel","Rafael",""],["Menezes","Ronaldo",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2024 13:14:55 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-08","timestamp":1723036495000,"abstract":"  Violence is commonly linked with large urban areas, and as a social\nphenomenon, it is presumed to scale super-linearly with population size. This\nstudy explores the hypothesis that smaller, isolated cities in Africa may\nexperience a heightened intensity of violence against civilians. It aims to\ninvestigate the correlation between the risk of experiencing violence with a\ncity's size and its geographical isolation. Over a 20-year period, the\nincidence of civilian casualties has been analysed to assess lethality in\nrelation to varying degrees of isolation and city sizes. African cities are\ncategorised by isolation (number of highway connections) and centrality (the\nestimated frequency of journeys). Findings suggest that violence against\ncivilians exhibits a sub-linear pattern, with larger cities witnessing fewer\ncasualties per 100,000 inhabitants. Remarkably, individuals in isolated cities\nface a quadrupled risk of a casualty compared to those in more connected\ncities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
