Due to the complexity in many-electron\nwavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental\nmany-body physics remain limited. Here, we present a deep learning framework\ntargeting the many-body Green's function, which unifies predictions of\nelectronic properties in ground and excited states, while offering deep\nphysical insights into electron correlation effects. By learning the $GW$ or\ncoupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network\nachieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle\nexcitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix. We\ndemonstrate its high data efficiency and good transferability across chemical\nspecies, system sizes, molecular conformations, and correlation strengths in\nbond breaking, through multiple molecular and nanomaterial benchmarks. This\nwork opens up new opportunities for utilizing machine learning to solve\nmany-electron problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
