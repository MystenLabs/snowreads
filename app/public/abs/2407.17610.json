We calculate its low-lying energy levels by combining the\nconfiguration interaction and the coupled cluster method, achieving\nuncertainties as low as 0.1%, and improving previous work. We benchmark these\nresults by comparing our calculations for the (5s^2 5p 2P_1/2) - (5s^2 5p\n2P_3/2) transition in Pr10+ with a dedicated measurement and for Pr9+ with a\nrecent experiment, respectively. In addition, we report calculated\nhyperfine-structure constants for the clock and logic states in Pr10+.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
