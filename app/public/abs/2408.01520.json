Lorentz invariance violation represents a potential physics factor\nthat could influence the experiment's ability to achieve these precise\ndeterminations. This study investigates the influence of Lorentz invariance\nviolation (LIV) on oscillation dynamics, particularly through non-isotropic\nCPT-violating ($a^{X}_{e\\mu}$, $a^{X}_{e\\tau}$, $a^{X}_{\\mu\\tau}$) and\nCPT-conserving ($c^{XY}_{e\\mu}$, $c^{XY}_{e \\tau}$, $c^{XY}_{\\mu \\tau}$)\nparameters within the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). We analyze\nthe impact of these parameters on the mass hierarchy (MH) and Dirac CP phase\nsensitivity measurements. Our findings indicate that while MH sensitivity\nremains relatively unaffected, only the presence of $c^{XY}_{\\mu \\tau}$\nsignificantly deteriorates MH sensitivity, albeit remaining above the $5\n\\sigma$ threshold. Additionally, we observe a substantial compromise in CP\nsensitivity due to the $c^{XY}_{e \\mu}$ and $c^{XY}_{e \\tau}$ parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b1nFsxWuggeWwY0yVbHLzJ9QjX_XrPF9ZEumNZCgZ4Y","pdfSize":"990991"}
