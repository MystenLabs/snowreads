Under the non-uniform multi-singularity assumption of\nexact solution in time, the local truncation errors of the L1 scheme with\nuniform mesh is investigated. Then we introduce a fully discrete finite element\nscheme of the considered problem. Next, a novel discrete fractional Gr\\\"onwall\ninequality with constant delay term is proposed, which does not include the\nincreasing Mittag-Leffler function comparing with some popular other cases. By\napplying this Gr\\\"onwall inequality, we obtain the pointwise-in-time and\npiecewise-in-time error estimates of the finite element scheme without the\nMittag-Leffler function. In particular, the latter shows that, for the\nconsidered interval $((i-1)\\tau,i\\tau]$, although the convergence in time is\nlow for $i=1$, it will be improved as the increasing $i$, which is consistent\nwith the factual assumption that the smoothness of the solution will be\nimproved as the increasing $i$. Finally, we present some numerical tests to\nverify the developed theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
