Alternatively,\nharnessing flows from active fluids, which are usually chaotic, has been\nproposed as a paradigm for the development of micro-machines. Here, by\ncombining experimental realizations and simulations, we demonstrate that the\naddition of triangular-shaped inclusions into an active nematic gel can locally\nbreak the fore-aft symmetry of active turbulence and stabilize flow fields with\nself-pumping capabilities. The proposed strategy has enabled us to generate\nwall-free and self-powered microfluidic systems capable of both cargo transport\nand mixing along with the downstream flow. We analyze the performance of these\nactive pumps, both isolated and within cooperative ensembles in terms of their\noutput velocity and hydrostatic pressure buildup. Finally, we demonstrate\nstrategies to incorporate them into specifically designed microfluidic\nplatforms to advantageously tailor the geometry of active flows. Our results\nreveal new possibilities for leveraging the self-organized mechanodynamics of\nactive fluids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B8PXourWUMBHekMnJkQG_M9nH3SWqGQCbFZdyC8pVtY","pdfSize":"22709605"}
