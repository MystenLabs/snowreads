To this end,\nwe explore the interaction between a swift electron and twisted hyperbolic Van\nder Waals crystals, and observe enhanced Cherenkov radiation at the flatband\nresonance frequency. We show that, at the photonic magic angle of the twisted\ncrystals, the electron momentum, once matching with that of the flatband\nphoton, gives rise to a maximum energy loss (corresponding to the surface\nphonon generation), one-order of magnitude higher than that in conventional\nhyperbolic materials. Such a significant enhancement is attributed to the\nexcitation of flatband surface phonon polaritons over a broad momentum range.\nOur findings provide a feasible route to highly directional free-electron\nradiation and radiation shaping.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
