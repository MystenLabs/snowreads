Compared to walking on rough terrains, dynamic\nlocomotion on abrupt surfaces requires fusing proprioceptive and exteroceptive\nperception for explosive movements. In this paper, we propose SF-TIM (Simple\nFramework combining Terrain Imagination and Measurement), a single-policy\nmethod that enhances quadrupedal robot jumping agility, while preserving their\nfundamental blind walking capabilities. In addition, we introduce a\nterrain-guided reward design specifically to assist quadrupedal robots in high\njumping, improving their performance in this task. To narrow the\nsimulation-to-reality gap in quadrupedal robot learning, we introduce a stable\nand high-speed elevation map generation framework, enabling zero-shot\nsimulation-to-reality transfer of locomotion ability. Our algorithm has been\ndeployed and validated on both the small-/large-size quadrupedal robots,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications: the robot has\nsuccessfully traversed various high platforms and gaps, showing the robustness\nof our proposed approach.
