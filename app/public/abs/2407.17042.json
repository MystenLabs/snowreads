By exploiting this\nresult, we investigate a family of functional graphs -- called Hessian graphs\n-- defined by the Hessian transformation. We show that, over arbitrary fields\nof characteristics different from $2$ and $3$, the Hessian graphs inherit\ndistinctive features from the arithmetic of the model curve. We then specialize\nour analysis to the finite-field case, proving several regularities of Hessian\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
