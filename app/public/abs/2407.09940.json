Sambin in 2005, and fully formalized in 2009, as a common core among\nthe most relevant constructive and classical foundations for mathematics.\n  To better accomplish its minimality, MF was designed as a two-level type\ntheory, with an intensional level mTT, an extensional one emTT, and an\ninterpretation of the latter into the first.\n  Here, we first show that the two levels of MF are indeed equiconsistent by\ninterpreting mTT into emTT. Then, we show that the classical extension emTT^c\nis equiconsistent with emTT by suitably extending the G\\\"odel-Gentzen\ndouble-negation translation of classical logic in the intuitionistic one. As a\nconsequence, MF turns out to be compatible with classical predicative\nmathematics \\`a la Weyl, contrary to the most relevant foundations for\nconstructive mathematics.\n  Finally, we show that the chain of equiconsistency results for MF can be\nstraightforwardly extended to its impredicative version to deduce that\nCoquand-Huet's Calculus of Constructions equipped with basic inductive types is\nequiconsistent with its extensional and classical versions too.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VQRq0mbpQYGaG2n5TwObd7rzLhBXa7g4nZw6FDYXlqI","pdfSize":"292270"}
