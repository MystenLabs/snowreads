GenAI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have\nemerged as powerful tools capable of driving innovation, improving efficiency,\nand delivering superior customer services in telecom. This paper provides an\noverview of GenAI for telecom from theory to practice. We review GenAI models\nand discuss their practical applications in telecom. Furthermore, we describe\nthe key technology enablers and best practices for applying GenAI to telecom\neffectively. We highlight the importance of retrieval augmented generation\n(RAG) in connecting LLMs to telecom domain specific data sources to enhance the\naccuracy of the LLMs' responses. We present a real-world use case on RAG-based\nchatbot that can answer open radio access network (O-RAN) specific questions.\nThe demonstration of the chatbot to the O-RAN Alliance has triggered immense\ninterest in the industry. We have made the O-RAN RAG chatbot publicly\naccessible on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
