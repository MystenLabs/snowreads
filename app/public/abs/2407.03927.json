Heuristic solvers address the demand for finding high-quality\nsolutions efficiently. Among these solvers, the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH)\nheuristic stands out, as it complements the performance of genetic algorithms\nacross a diverse range of problem instances. However, frequent timeouts on\nchallenging instances hinder the practical applicability of the solver.\n  Within this work, we investigate a previously overlooked factor contributing\nto many timeouts: The use of a fixed candidate set based on a tree structure.\nOur investigations reveal that candidate sets based on Hamiltonian circuits\ncontain more optimal edges. We thus propose to integrate this promising\ninitialization strategy, in the form of POPMUSIC, within an efficient restart\nversion of LKH. As confirmed by our experimental studies, this refined TSP\nheuristic is much more efficient - causing fewer timeouts and improving the\nperformance (in terms of penalized average runtime) by an order of magnitude -\nand thereby challenges the state of the art in TSP solving.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
