We present a novel algorithm that generates real-time\ntranslations by predicting speaker utterances and expanding multiple\npossibilities in a tree-like structure. This method demonstrates unprecedented\nflexibility and adaptability, potentially overcoming the structural differences\nbetween languages more effectively than existing systems. Our theoretical\nanalysis, supported by illustrative examples, suggests that this approach could\nlead to more natural and fluent translations with minimal latency. The primary\npurpose of this paper is to share this innovative concept with the academic\ncommunity, stimulating further research and development in this field. We\ndiscuss the theoretical foundations, potential advantages, and implementation\nchallenges of this technique, positioning it as a significant step towards\ndemocratizing multilingual communication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"znb4K8DWeP-h06ZpQ-Jm6bC8BiQoRaUluoF0-Nj3Vy0","pdfSize":"158341"}
