It can be\nperformed using linear-optical circuits with the success probabilities of\n$1-d^{-1}$ without ancilla photons and $1-d^{-(k+1)}$ with $2(2^{k}-1)$ ancilla\nphotons. It allows us to entangle two independently-prepared high-dimensional\nentangled states two-dimensionally with higher probabilities than ones of\nlinear-optical fusion gates on qubits. As an application, we propose a fast\nquantum repeater protocol with three-qudit GHZ states and quantum memories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
