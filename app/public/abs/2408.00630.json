However, when dealing with the direct sum of $q$-matroids many\ndifferences arise. Most notably, it has recently been shown that the direct sum\nof representable $q$-matroids is not necessarily representable. In this work,\nwe focus on the direct sum of uniform $q$-matroids. Using algebraic and\ngeometric tools, together with the notion of cyclic flats of $q$-matroids, we\nshow that this is always representable, by providing a representation over a\nsufficiently large field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
