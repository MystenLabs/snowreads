Recent advances have discussed CW-complexes as ideal learning\nrepresentations for problems in cheminformatics. However, there is a lack of\navailable machine learning methods suitable for learning on CW-complexes. In\nthis paper we develop notions of convolution and attention that are well\ndefined for CW-complexes. These notions enable us to create the first Hodge\ninformed neural network that can receive a CW-complex as input. We illustrate\nand interpret this framework in the context of supervised prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gqcx6g8JXw4UpTNf66D0Lgi9fDCKGIm64urTi7SyQw8","pdfSize":"462969"}
