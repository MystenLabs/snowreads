We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep\nsymbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection\n(VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and\nparsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two\npenalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity\npenalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be\nparsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the\nexpression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe\nthe data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several\ncar-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research\ndirections.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
