In\nthis device the instantaneous flowrate of the incoming breath from a person\ngets transformed to a specific acoustic frequency. In this manner, the time\ncourse of the persons breath profile is mapped to a time varying acoustic\nsignal. The captured acoustic signal can be converted to standard spirometry\ncurves and relevant parameters can be extracted as we describe in this paper.\nWe compared our device with commercially available devices and showed that\nthese paper based devices provide similar performance. These devices have\nadvantage of low cost and simplicity of operation compared to currently\navailable commercial products.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
