Most operator-splitting methods are not\ngeneralizable to problems with $N$ operators for arbitrary $N$. In fact, there\nare only two known methods that can be applied to general $N$-split problems:\nthe first-order Lie--Trotter (or Godunov) method and the second-order Strang\n(or Strang--Marchuk) method. In this paper, we derive two second-order\noperator-splitting methods that also generalize to $N$-split problems. These\nmethods are complex valued but have positive real parts, giving them favorable\nstability properties, and require few sub-integrations per stage, making them\ncomputationally inexpensive. They can also be used as base methods from which\nto construct higher-order $N$-split operator-splitting methods with positive\nreal parts. We verify the orders of accuracy of these new $N$-split methods and\ndemonstrate their favorable efficiency properties against well-known\nreal-valued operator-splitting methods on both real-valued and complex-valued\ndifferential equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
