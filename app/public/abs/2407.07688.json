We derive the more\ngeneral analytical expressions for N-partite coherence, encompassing both\nphysically accessible and inaccessible coherences in the context of the dilaton\nblack hole. It has been found that the coherence of the bosonic field is\ngreater than that of the fermionic field, while the entanglement of the\nfermionic field is greater than that of the bosonic field in dilaton spacetime.\nAdditionally, the coherence of the W state is greater than that of the GHZ\nstate, whereas the entanglement of the GHZ state is greater than that of the W\nstate in curved spacetime. These results suggest that we should utilize\nsuitable quantum resources and different types of particles for relativistic\nquantum information tasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
