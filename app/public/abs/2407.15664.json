Moreover, a\nconjecture put forward by Qiu et al. in [17] is proved to be true. As\napplications, several inequalities and identities are deduced. These results\nobtained in this paper may be helpful for the study of certain special\nfunctions. Finally, an interesting infinite series similar to Riemann zeta\nfunctions is observed initially.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
