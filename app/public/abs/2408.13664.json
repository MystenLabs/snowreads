We compare the detection capability of both\ntarget elements for interactions due to a pseudoscalar mediator including\nloop-level contributions to the cross section. At tree-level this type of\ninteraction depends on the nuclear spin and would thus not be detectable in\nargon-based detectors, since Ar has spin zero. However, at the loop-level the\nsame interaction yields spin-independent contributions that would be detectable\nin an argon target and are not negligible with respect to the tree-level\ninteractions in xenon, because these are momentum suppressed. In fact, the\nloop-level contributions are also important for xenon-based experiments at low\nrecoil energies, which could change their discovery reach for this interaction.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
