These attacks typically require\nre-clustering the entire dataset multiple times to generate predictions and\nassess the attacker's objectives, significantly hindering their scalability.\nThis paper addresses these limitations by proposing Sonic, a novel genetic data\npoisoning attack that leverages incremental and scalable clustering algorithms,\ne.g., FISHDBC, as surrogates to accelerate poisoning attacks against\ngraph-based and density-based clustering methods, such as HDBSCAN. We\nempirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Sonic in poisoning\nthe target clustering algorithms. We then conduct a comprehensive analysis of\nthe factors affecting the scalability and transferability of poisoning attacks\nagainst clustering algorithms, and we conclude by examining the robustness of\nhyperparameters in our attack strategy Sonic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
