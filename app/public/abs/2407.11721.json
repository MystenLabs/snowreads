In this study, we apply the axis-symmetric Jeans\nAnisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion JAM modeling to satellite galaxies in 28\ngalaxy clusters selected from the TNG300-1 simulation with halo mass of\n$\\log_{10}M_{200}/M_\\odot>14.3$. If using true bound satellites as tracers, the\nbest constrained total mass within the half-mass radius of satellites,\n$M(<r_\\mathrm{half})$, and the virial mass, $M_{200}$, have average biases of\n-0.01 and $0.03$~dex, with average scatters of 0.11~dex and 0.15~dex. If\nselecting companions in redshift space with line-of-sight depth of 2,000~km/s,\nthe biases are -0.06 and $0.01$~dex, while the scatters are 0.12 and 0.18~dex\nfor $M(<r_\\mathrm{half})$ and $M_{200}$. By comparing the best-fitting and\nactual density profiles, we find $\\sim$29% of best-fitting density profiles\nshow very good agreement with the truth, $\\sim$32% display over or under\nestimates at most of the radial range with biased $M(<r_\\mathrm{half})$, and\n39% show under/over estimates in central regions and over/under estimates in\nthe outskirts, with good constraints on $M(<r_\\mathrm{half})$, yet most of the\nbest constraints are still consistent with the true profiles within 1-$\\sigma$\nstatistical uncertainties for the three circumstances. Using a mock DESI Bright\nGalaxy Survey catalog with the effect of fiber incompleteness, we find DESI\nfiber assignments and the choice of flux limits barely modify the velocity\ndispersion profiles and are thus unlikely to affect the dynamical modeling\noutcomes. Our results show that with current and future deep spectroscopic\nsurveys, JAM can be a powerful tool to constrain the underlying density\nprofiles of individual massive galaxy clusters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
