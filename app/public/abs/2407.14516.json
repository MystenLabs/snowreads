Many benchmarks\nare focused on video or board games, and a large number of robotics benchmarks\nlack diversity and real-world applicability. In this paper, we aim to simplify\nthe process of applying reinforcement learning in the 3D simulation league of\nRobocup, a robotic football competition. To this end, we introduce a\nRobocup-based RL environment based on the open source rcssserver3d soccer\nserver, simple pre-defined tasks, and integration with a popular RL library,\nStable Baselines 3. Our environment enables the creation of high-dimensional\ncontinuous control tasks within a robotics football simulation. In each task,\nan RL agent controls a simulated Nao robot, and can interact with the ball or\nother agents. We open-source our environment and training code at\nhttps://github.com/Michael-Beukman/RobocupGym.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
