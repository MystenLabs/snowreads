The models are switching,\nlinear ordinary differential equations $x'(t)=A(\\sigma(\\omega t))x(t)$ where\n$x(t)=(x_1(t),\\dots,x_d(t))$ corresponds to the population densities in the $d$\nindividual states, $\\sigma(t)$ is a piece-wise constant function representing\nthe fluctuations in the environmental states $1,\\dots,N$, $\\omega$ is the\nfrequency of the environmental fluctuations, and $A(1),\\dots,A(n)$ are Metzler\nmatrices. $\\sigma(t)$ can either be a periodic function or correspond to a\ncontinuous-time Markov chain. Under suitable conditions, there is a Lyapunov\nexponent $\\Lambda(\\omega)$ such that $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{t}\\log\\sum_i\nx_i(t)=\\Lambda(\\omega)$ for all non-negative, non-zero initial conditions\n$x(0)$ (with probability one in the random case). For both forms of switching,\nwe derive analytical first-order and second-order approximations of\n$\\Lambda(\\omega)$ in the limits of slow ($\\omega\\to 0$) and fast\n($\\omega\\to\\infty$) environmental fluctuations. When the order of switching and\nthe average switching times are equal, we show that the first-order\napproximations of $\\Lambda(\\omega)$ are equivalent in the slow-switching limit,\nbut not in the fast-switching limit. We illustrate our results with\napplications to stage-structured and spatially-structured models. When\ndispersal rates are symmetric, the first order approximations suggest that\npopulation growth rates increase with the frequency of switching -- consistent\nwith earlier work on periodic switching. In the absence of dispersal symmetry,\nwe demonstrate that $\\Lambda(\\omega)$ can be non-monotonic in $\\omega$. In\nconclusion, our results show how population growth rates depend on the tempo\n($\\omega$) and mode (random versus deterministic) of the environmental\nfluctuations.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QCcvASQeMUTAH3ibZ2qn9BfSRVXEjEHPnaIsxKiwOMk","pdfSize":"2730003"}
