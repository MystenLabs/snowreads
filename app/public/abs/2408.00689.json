We study a double layer SC in the presence of a parallel\nmagnetic field $B$ within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. We find that for\nlow $B$ the system remains in the ``Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase\" with\na spatially uniform gap, but with increasing $B$, a transition occurs into a\nphase which contains stripes of the BCS phase separated by regions where the\ninterlayer phase difference rotates by $2\\pi$ due to the presence of\ninter-layer vortices. This stripe phase is predicted to manifest through\noscillations in the amplitude of the SC gap and an alternating pattern of\nsupercurrents. We will comment on the relation to previous works based on the\nLandau-Ginzburg formalism as well as on the possible experimental realization\nand signature of this phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZfZ-wR5ku1p-wDjQhN0S-u7FbBEML8T-VuUmf0kKxaw","pdfSize":"999292"}
