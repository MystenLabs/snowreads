They are transformed\ninto high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) tensors which include abundant\ntemporal pattern information. Latent factorization of tensors (LFT) is an\nextremely efficient and typical approach for extracting such patterns from an\nHDI tensor. However, current LFT models require the QoS data to be maintained\nin a central place (e.g., a central server), which is impossible for\nincreasingly privacy-sensitive users. To address this problem, this article\ncreatively designs a federated learning based on latent factorization of\ntensors (FL-LFT). It builds a data-density -oriented federated learning model\nto enable isolated users to collaboratively train a global LFT model while\nprotecting user's privacy. Extensive experiments on a QoS dataset collected\nfrom the real world verify that FL-LFT shows a remarkable increase in\nprediction accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art federated learning (FL)\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
