Two partial words of\n$a=a_0 \\dots a_n$ and $b=b_0 \\dots b_n$ are $\\textit{compatible}$ if for all\n$i$, $a_i = b_i$ or at least one of $a_i, b_i$ is a hole. A partial word is\n$\\textit{unbordered}$ if it does not have a nonempty proper prefix and a suffix\nthat are compatible. Otherwise the partial word is $\\textit{bordered}$.\n  A set $R \\subseteq \\{0, \\dots, n\\}$ is called a $\\textit{complete sparse\nruler of length $n$}$ if for all $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n\\}$ there exists $r, s \\in\nR$ such that $k = r - s$. These are also known as $\\textit{restricted\ndifference bases}$.\n  From the definitions it follows that the more holes a partial word has, the\nmore likely it is to be bordered. By introducing a connection between\nunbordered partial words and sparse rulers, we improve bounds on the maximum\nnumber of holes an unbordered partial word can have over alphabets of sizes $4$\nor greater. We also provide a counterexample for a previously reported theorem.\n  We then study a two-dimensional generalization of these results. We adapt\nmethods from one-dimensional case to solve the correct asymptotic for the\nnumber of holes an unbordered two-dimensional binary partial word can have.\nThis generalization might invoke further research questions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
