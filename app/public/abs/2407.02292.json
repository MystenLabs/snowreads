This synergy is particularly evident in the\ndevelopment of the sixth-generation technology standard for mobile networks\n(6G), envisioned to be AI-native. Generative-AI (GenAI), a novel technology\ncapable of producing various types of outputs, including text, images, and\nvideos, offers significant potential for wireless communications, with its\ndistinctive features. Traditionally, conventional AI techniques have been\nemployed for predictions, classifications, and optimization, while GenAI has\nmore to offer. This article introduces the concept of strategic demand-planning\nthrough demand-labeling, demand-shaping, and demand-rescheduling. Accordingly,\nGenAI is proposed as a powerful tool to facilitate demand-shaping in wireless\nnetworks. More specifically, GenAI is used to compress and convert the content\nof various kind (e.g., from a higher bandwidth mode to a lower one, such as\nfrom a video to text), which subsequently enhances performance of wireless\nnetworks in various usage scenarios such as cell-switching, user association\nand load balancing, interference management, and disaster scenarios management.\nTherefore, GenAI can serve a function in saving energy and spectrum in wireless\nnetworks. With recent advancements in AI, including sophisticated algorithms\nlike large-language-models and the development of more powerful hardware built\nexclusively for AI tasks, such as AI accelerators, the concept of\ndemand-planning, particularly demand-shaping through GenAI, becomes\nincreasingly relevant. Furthermore, recent efforts to make GenAI accessible on\ndevices, such as user terminals, make the implementation of this concept even\nmore straightforward and feasible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
