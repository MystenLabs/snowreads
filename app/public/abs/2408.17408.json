This focused review investigates the\ncurrent state of literature on technostress and resistance to change among\nseafarers as they adapt to new digital technologies. By critically reviewing a\nfocused selection of peer-reviewed articles, we identify the main themes and\ntrends within maritime research on DT. Findings indicate that while mental\nhealth issues are a predominant concern, this is yet to also be investigated in\nthe context of new technology introduction in an industry that is already\nsetting seafarers under pressure. Additionally, change management is not\naddressed, and DT is limited to specific functionalities rather than embracing\nbroad work practice transformations\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
