We present an analysis of archive Very\nLarge Array observations at epochs from 2012 to 2022 that indicates a total\nproper motion of 23.9$\\pm$5.5 mas yr$^{-1}$ toward the southwest. After\ncorrection for the proper motions produced by galactic rotation, we find a\npeculiar transverse velocity of $\\simeq$740 km s$^{-1}$. We searched\nunsuccessfully along the past trajectory of the pulsar for an associated\nsupernova remnant. In particular, W44 is in this trajectory but its distance is\ndifferent to that of PSR B1849+00.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hnNb2P3spWlcYHS5k8nlvMsX9OxnAODdsplc5HNx3c4","pdfSize":"550654"}
