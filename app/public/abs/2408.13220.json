For\nperiods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence\nof observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended\ntime periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns,\nand hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for\nmodeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this\npaper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and\nBrownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology\nwill be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration\npatterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic\nreceivers.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
