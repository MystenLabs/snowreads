We define a topology on the\nspace of isomorphism classes of indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules\nand investigate the topological structure. We also calculate the\nCantor-Bendixson rank for a ring which is of CM_+-finite representation type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
