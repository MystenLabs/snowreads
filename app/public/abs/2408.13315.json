In the last ten years, computer-aided pneumonia detection\nmethods have been developed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the\ndiagnosis process. Among those methods, the effects of deep learning approaches\nsurpassed that of other traditional machine learning methods. This review paper\nsearched and examined existing mainstream deep-learning approaches in the\ndetection of pneumonia regions. This paper focuses on key aspects of the\ncollected research, including their datasets, data processing techniques,\ngeneral workflow, outcomes, advantages, and limitations. This paper also\ndiscusses current challenges in the field and proposes future work that can be\ndone to enhance research procedures and the overall performance of deep\nlearning models in detecting, classifying, and localizing infected regions.\nThis review aims to offer an insightful summary and analysis of current\nresearch, facilitating the development of deep learning approaches in\naddressing treatable diseases.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
