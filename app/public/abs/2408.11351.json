We\npropose a hypergraph neural network(HgNN) backbone architecture, a conceptually\nalternative approach, to better model the complex relationships in electron\nmicrographs and improve material characterization accuracy. By utilizing\ncost-effective GPU hardware, our proposed framework outperforms popular\nbaselines. The results of the ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed\nframework is effective in achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark\ndatasets and efficient in terms of computational and memory requirements for\nhandling large-scale electron micrograph-based datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
