Hence, a\nrich variety of possible RG flows arises. The first example is already given by\nthe standard non-relativistic limit, which can be viewed as the flow from a\n$z=1$ UV fixed point to a $z=2$ IR fixed point. In strongly coupled theories,\nthere are good arguments suggesting that Lorentz invariance can emerge\ndynamically in the IR from a Lorentz violating UV. In this work, we perform a\ngeneric study of fixed points and the possible RG flows among them in a minimal\nbottom-up holographic model without Lorentz invariance, aiming to shed light on\nthe possible options and the related phenomenology. We find: i) A minor\ngeneralization of previous models involving a massive vector field with allowed\nself-couplings leads to a much more efficient emergence of Lorentz invariance\nthan in the previous attempts. Moreover, we find that generically the larger is\nthe UV dynamical exponent $z_{UV}$ the faster is the recovery of Lorentz\nsymmetry in the IR. ii) We construct explicitly a holographic model with a line\nof fixed points, realizing different Lifshitz scaling along the line. iii) We\nalso confirm the monotonicity of a recently proposed a-function along all our\nLorentz violating RG flows.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
