We show that $\\delta\nV(\\sigma_{\\rm cl})$ at $\\sigma_{\\rm cl}\\to \\infty$, where $\\sigma_{\\rm cl}$ is\na classical value of $\\sigma$, is positive, implying the stability of $\\delta\nV(\\sigma_{\\rm cl})$ by the HD 1-loop radiative corrections at high energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
