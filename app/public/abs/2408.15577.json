We\nperform particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements to visualize the air jet\nproduced by wing clapping under the ventral side of the body when wing folding\nis at the extreme. The results show that this jet can be directed by\ncontrolling the wing twist at the moment of clapping, which leads to greatly\nenhanced cycle-averaged thrust, especially at high St or low flight speeds.\nAdditional benefits of more thrust and less negative lift are gained during\nupstroke using wing twist. Remarkably, less total actuating force, or less\ntotal power, is required during upstroke with wing twist. These findings\nemphasize the benefits of critical wing articulation for the future flapping\nwing/fin robots and for an accurate test platform to study natural flapping\nwing flight or underwater vehicles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
