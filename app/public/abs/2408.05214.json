Nevertheless, the focus is often on deterministic\ncombinatorial optimization problems, mainly because they are already\nchallenging enough without stochasticity. To make it easier to address\nstochasticity in combinatorial optimization, Simheuristics have been developed\nthat allow solving stochastic combinatorial optimization problems. We propose a\nnew Simheuristic procedure that dynamically changes the optimization focus\nbetween a deterministic and stochastic perspective based upon a statistical\nmodel. By doing so, an adequate trade-off is made between exploration and\nexploitation of the solution space during the optimization. We numerically show\nthat the new Simheuristic procedure solves real-life stochastic scheduling\nproblems more efficiently than standard Simheuristics strategies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
