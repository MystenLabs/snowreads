In the background where fermions occupy the states,\nthe decay of dark matter to those final states is not allowed, as a result, DM\nbecomes stable. We derive the evolution equations of the distribution function\nin the quantum field theory and compare it with the Boltzmann equation. We\napply this mechanism to a realistic model of neutrino and dark matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
