We use the numerical many-body configuration interaction (CI)\nmethod to investigate the dispersions of charge and spin gaps along with the\nmomentum resolved spin-density profile over the full Brillouin zone. While the\nspin sector retains its topological nature at all values of spin-orbit coupling\nand Hubbard term, we report a new signature of the topological phase transition\nin the charge sector. This phase transition from a topological band insulating\nphase to a antiferromagnetically ordered Mott insulating phase is characterized\nby a shift of the many-body charge gap minima from Brillouin zone boundary to\nDirac point. Our results provide a better understanding of the shifting of the\ngap-closing point in the momentum space which was reported in an earlier\nmean-field study of the same model and suggests an alternative numerical route\nto detect topological phase transition in strongly-correlated systems in terms\nof their momentum space behaviors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
