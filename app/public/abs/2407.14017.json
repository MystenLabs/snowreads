The large subsequent rational\nbubble literature has identified attaching bubbles to dividend-paying assets in\na natural way as an important but challenging question. Miao and Wang (2018)\nclaim to \"provide a theory of rational stock price bubbles\". Contrary to their\nclaim, the present comment proves the nonexistence of rational bubbles in the\nmodel of Miao and Wang (2018). We also clarify the precise mathematical\ndefinition and the economic meaning of \"rational bubble\" in an accessible way\nto the general audience.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
