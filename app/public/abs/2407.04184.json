This architecture not only predicts verbs and nouns likely to\noccur based on historical data but also considers their joint occurrence to\nimprove forecast accuracy. The efficacy of this approach is substantiated by\nexperimental results, with the method achieving second place in the Ego4D LTA\nchallenge and ranking first in noun prediction accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
