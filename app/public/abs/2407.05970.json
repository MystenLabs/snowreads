Molecular dynamics\nsimulations using the reactive force field are carried out for 10 cases for the\ntelomeric DNA consisting of 16 base pairs (32 nucleotides). It results in\ndouble-strand breaks (DSBs) being observed for structures with more than 24\nscars. For 16 scar cases, only single-strand breaks (SSB) are observed.\nMoreover, in the case of $\\left\\{16, 0 \\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{ 0, 16 \\right\\},$\nwhere only one of the strands had scars, SSB occurs only in the scarred strand.\nSecondly, in the $\\left\\{16, 8 \\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{ 8, 16 \\right\\}$ cases,\nDSBs occurs. Therefore, we conclude that the following conditions are necessary\nfor DSBs:(i) Scars must occur on both the L and R strands. (ii) A large number\nof scars (24 or more) must occur in close proximity to each other.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
