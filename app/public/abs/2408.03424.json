Using AI tools in such analyses risks reifying and exacerbating\nbiases, as well as untenable computational and cost limitations. As such, we\nturn to adopting geometric computer graphics and vision methods towards\nanalyzing a large set of images from a problematic information campaign, in\nconjunction with human-in-the-loop qualitative analysis. We illustrate an\neffective case of this approach with the implementation of color quantization\ntowards analyzing online hate image at the US-Mexico border, along with a\nhistoricist trace of the history of color quantization and skin tone scales, to\ninform our usage and reclamation of these methodologies from their racist\norigins. To that end, we scaffold motivations and the need for more researchers\nto consider the advantages and risks of reclaiming such methodologies in their\nown work, situated in our case study.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
