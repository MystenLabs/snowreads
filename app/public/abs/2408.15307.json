This chapter traces the history of research on CBPs and provides\nan overview over the current knowledge about CBPs and their detection methods.\nAfter early speculations about CBPs, inspired by binary star systems and\npopularized by fictional works, their scientific exploration began with the\nidentification of circumbinary dust disks and progressed to the detection and\ncharacterization of the current sample of CBPs. The major part of this review\npresents the detection methods for CBPs: eclipse timing variations from the\nlight-travel-time effect and from dynamical interactions, transits, radial\nvelocities, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing and astrometry. Each of\nthese methods is described with its strengths and limitations and the main\ncharaceristics of the CBP systems found by them are outlined. The potential\nhabitability of CBPs is considered, taking into account the unique\nenvironmental conditions created by orbiting a stellar binary. The importance\nof multi-method detection strategies is underscored, and future advancements\nfrom upcoming missions like PLATO are anticipated, promising to expand the\nunderstanding of these intriguing celestial bodies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
