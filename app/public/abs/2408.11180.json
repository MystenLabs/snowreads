We investigate an inverse problem for the Mapper\nalgorithm: Given a dataset $X$ and a graph $G$, does there exist a set of\nMapper parameters such that the output Mapper graph of $X$ is isomorphic to\n$G$? We provide constructions that affirmatively answer this question. Our\nresults demonstrate that it is possible to engineer Mapper parameters to\ngenerate a desired graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
