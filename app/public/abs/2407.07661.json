We coalesce\nthe $\\rm X(2370)$ glueball state with two gluons in the simulated partonic\nfinal state by the Dynamically Constrained Phase-space Coalescence\n({\\footnotesize DCPC}) model. Alternative configuration of $\\rm X(2370)$\nmolecular state is recombined in the simulated hadronic final state with\n$\\pi^{+},\\pi^{-},K^{+}, K^{-},K_{S}^{0},K_{S}^{0}$ and $\\eta'$ by\n{\\footnotesize DCPC} model. The resulted particle transverse momentum spectrum\nand rapidity distribution, etc. show a significant discrepancy between the two\nstates. They are not only serving as criteria to distinguish the $\\rm X(2370)$\nglueball state or molecular state, but also confirming the BESIII observation\nof glueball-like particle $\\rm X(2370)$ productions in $e^+e^-$ collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
