Various properties of this function including recurrence relations,\nintegral representations and differential relations are established.\nFurthermore, the bicomplex holomorphicity and Taylor series representation of\nthis function are discussed, along with the derivation of a differential\nequation. Finally, as applications some relations of fractional order\nderivatives and solutions for the bicomplex extension of the generalized\nfractional kinetic equation involving the bicomplex Miller Ross function are\nderived.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
