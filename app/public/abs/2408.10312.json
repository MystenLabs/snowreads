The traditional way to find the fixed point\ntensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to\ncriticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which\nsolves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due\nto the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the\ncoordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points.\nWe address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map.\nThis flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the\nfixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the\npower of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using\nthe Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\\chi=30$, we find the fixed point\ntensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
