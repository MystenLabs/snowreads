We report the high-angular resolution\n($\\sim0.3^{\\prime\\prime}$, 870 au) map of the magnetic field projected on the\nplane of the sky (B$_\\mathrm{POS}$) towards the high-mass star forming region\nG333.46$-$0.16 (G333), obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) at 1.2 mm as part of the Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming\nRegions (MagMaR) survey. The B$_\\mathrm{POS}$ morphology found in this region\nis consistent with a canonical ``hourglass'' which suggest a dynamically\nimportant field. This region is fragmented into two protostars separated by\n$\\sim1740$ au. Interestingly, by analysing H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ ($J=3-2$) line\nemission, we find no velocity gradient over the extend of the continuum which\nis consistent with a strong field. We model the B$_\\mathrm{POS}$, obtaining a\nmarginally supercritical mass-to-flux ratio of 1.43, suggesting an initially\nstrongly magnetized environment. Based on the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method,\nthe magnetic field strength towards G333 is estimated to be 5.7 mG. The absence\nof strong rotation and outflows towards the central region of G333 suggests\nstrong magnetic braking, consistent with a highly magnetized environment. Our\nstudy shows that despite being a strong regulator, the magnetic energy fails to\nprevent the process of fragmentation, as revealed by the formation of the two\nprotostars in the central region.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
