Two recent\nadvances are crucial to performing the calculations and interpreting the\nresult: the understanding of generalized anomalies involving $1$-form center\nsymmetry and the construction of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted\n$\\mathbb T^4$. These self-dual classical configurations have topological charge\n$k/N$ and can be described as a sum over $k$ closely packed lumps in an\ninstanton liquid. Using the path integral formalism, we perform the condensate\ncalculations in the semi-classical limit and find, assuming gcd$(k,N)=1$,\n$\\left\\langle \\prod_{i=1}^k \\text{tr}(\\lambda\\lambda)(x_i) \\right\\rangle = {\\bf\nn}^{-1} \\; N^2\\left(16\\pi^2 \\Lambda^3\\right)^k$, where $\\Lambda$ is the\nstrong-coupling scale and ${\\bf n}$ is a normalization constant. We determine\nthe normalization constant, using path integral, as ${\\bf n} = N^2$, which is\n$N$ times larger than the normalization used in our earlier publication\narXiv:2210.13568. This finding resolves the extra-factor-of-$N$ discrepancy\nencountered there, aligning our results with those obtained through direct\nsupersymmetric methods on $\\mathbb R^4$. The normalization constant ${\\bf n}$\ncan be interpreted within the Euclidean path-integral formulation as the Witten\nindex $I_W$. It is well-established that a Hamiltonian calculation of $I_W$\nyields $I_W=N$, suggesting that while ${\\bf n}=N^2$ correctly reproduces the\ncondensate result, it presents a puzzle in reconciling the Witten index\ncomputation via the path integral formalism, an issue warranting further\ninvestigation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
