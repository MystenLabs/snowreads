Moreover, fermionic trimers made of\natoms with two internal spin components are found for $L^{\\Pi}=1^{\\pm}$, when\nthe $p$-wave interaction between spin-up and spin-down fermions is close to\nunitarity and/or when the interaction between two spin-up fermions is close to\nthe $p$-wave unitary limit. The universality of these $p$-wave universal\ntrimers is tested here by considering van der Waals interactions in a\nLennard-Jones potential with different numbers of two-body bound states; our\ncalculations also determine the value of the scattering volume or length where\nthe trimer state hits zero energy and can be observed as a recombination\nresonance. The faux-Efimov effect appears with trimer symmetry $L^{\\Pi}=1^{-}$\nwhen the two fermion interactions are close to $p$-wave unitarity and the\nlowest $1/R^2$ coefficient gets modified, thereby altering the usual Wigner\nthreshold law for inelastic processes involving 3-body continuum channels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RncSmo3_HtIAdCIxD2iL3KtvS1S6AUfWZJPAd5unYME","pdfSize":"2656546"}
