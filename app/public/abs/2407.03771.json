However, 3DGS heavily relies on the sharp images.\nFulfilling this requirement can be challenging in real-world scenarios\nespecially when the camera moves fast, which severely limits the application of\n3DGS. To address these challenges, we proposed Spike Gausian Splatting\n(SpikeGS), the first framework that integrates the spike streams into 3DGS\npipeline to reconstruct 3D scenes via a fast-moving bio-inspired camera. With\naccumulation rasterization, interval supervision, and a specially designed\npipeline, SpikeGS extracts detailed geometry and texture from high temporal\nresolution but texture lacking spike stream, reconstructs 3D scenes captured in\n1 second. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of SpikeGS compared with existing spike-based and\ndeblur 3D scene reconstruction methods. Codes and data will be released soon.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
