Key\ncomponents, including the Cross Stage Partial backbone and Path\nAggregation-Network, are explored in detail. The paper reviews the model's\nperformance across various metrics and hardware platforms. Additionally, the\nstudy discusses the transition from Darknet to PyTorch and its impact on model\ndevelopment. Overall, this research provides insights into YOLOv5's\ncapabilities and its position within the broader landscape of object detection\nand why it is a popular choice for constrained edge deployment scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
