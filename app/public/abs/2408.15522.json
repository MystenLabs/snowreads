Despite its widespread use, the\nprecise relationship between these scatter signals and corresponding\nmicroscopic images remains underexplored. Here, we investigate this intrinsic\nrelationship by utilizing scattering theory and holotomography, a\nthree-dimensional quantitative phase imaging (QPI) technique. We demonstrate\nthe extraction of FSC and SSC signals from individual, unlabeled cells by\nanalyzing their three-dimensional refractive index distributions obtained\nthrough holotomography. Additionally, we introduce a method for digitally\nwindowing SSC signals to facilitate effective segmentation and morphology-based\ncell type classification. Our approach bridges the gap between flow cytometry\nand microscopic imaging, offering a new perspective on analyzing cellular\ncharacteristics with high accuracy and without the need for labeling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
