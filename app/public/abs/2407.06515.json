In that context, Cockett and Cruttwell\ndevelop the notion of differential bundle which, by work of MacAdam,\ngeneralizes the notion of smooth vector bundle to the abstract setting. Here we\nprovide a new characterization of differential bundles and show that, up to\nisomorphism, a differential bundle is determined by its projection map and zero\nsection. We show how these results can be used to quickly identify differential\nbundles in various tangent categories.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
