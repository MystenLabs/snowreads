We\nintroduce a new normal form method, termed the triangular\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-style, to categorize this normal form. We aim to establish a\ncomprehensive normal form theory, extending to quadratic terms across all\ndimensions. To accomplish this, we leverage mathematical tools including\nHermite reciprocity, transvectants, and insights derived from the well-known\n$3$-dimensional normal form related to Sylvester's work on generating functions\nfor quadratic covariants. Furthermore, we formulate the orbital normal form in\na general Lie algebraic context as the result of an outer transformation and\nexpand it into block-triangular outer normal form. This extended framework is\nsubsequently employed in both $2$D and $3$D scenarios, leading to noteworthy\nsimplifications that prepare these systems for the study of bifurcations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
