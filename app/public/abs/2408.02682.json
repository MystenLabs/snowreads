It is known that there are several groups $G$ such that $(G, L)$\nis non-null framed bordant. Previously we gave an alternative proof of these\nresults using the decomposition formula of its bordism class into a Kronecker\nproduct by E. Ossa. In this note we propose a verification formula by\nreconsidering it, through a little more ingenious in the use of this product\nformula, and try to apply it to the non-null bordantness results above.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
