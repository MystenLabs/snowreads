Here, we look at modifications of\nthe equation and show that the blow-up phenomenon still occurs. First, we study\nanother equation with the same characteristics but a different underlying ODE.\nLater, we study an equation where a $x_2$ dependency is introduced. The latter\ncase constitutes the main contribution of this paper, as we are able to show\nthat the solution still behaves pathologically without having an explicit\nformula for either the characteristics or the values of the solution. Finally,\nwe study the case where a perturbation of the initial data is introduced.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
