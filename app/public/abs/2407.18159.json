Continuum idealizations of large-scale swarms are used\nwhere the dynamics describe the evolution of the spatially-distributed\ndensities of each agent class. The problem formulation we adopt is motivated by\napplications where agents of one class are assigned to agents of the other\nclass, which we refer to as demand and resource agents respectively.\nAssignments have costs related to the distances between mutually assigned\nagents, and the overall cost of an assignment is quantified by a Wasserstein\ndistance between the densities of the two agent classes. When agents can move,\nthe assignment cost can decrease at the expense of a physical motion cost, and\nthis tradeoff sets up a nonlinear, infinite-dimensional optimal control\nproblem. We show that in one spatial dimension, this problem can be converted\nto an infinite-dimensional, but decoupled, linear-quadratic (LQ) tracking\nproblem when expressed in terms of the respective quantile functions. Solutions\nare given in the general one-dimensional case, as well as in the special cases\nof constant and periodically time-varying demands.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
