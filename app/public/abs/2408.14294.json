Key controversies concern\ninterlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a\nkey role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification\nis difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques\nunder high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev\nreflection on a normal metal-superconductor junction may provide a feasible way\nto distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano\nline shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$\nmetallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle\nbands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should\nbe greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small\ninterlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions\nand help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
