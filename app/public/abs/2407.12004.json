However,\nits recent evolution, engineered by technological transformation, big data\nanalytics, and quantum computing, produces conversational and generative AI\n(CGAI/GenAI) and human-like chatbots that disrupt conventional operations and\nmethods in different fields. This study investigates the scientific landscape\nof CGAI and human-chatbot interaction/collaboration and evaluates use cases,\nbenefits, challenges, and policy implications for multidisciplinary education\nand allied industry operations. The publications trend showed that just 4%\n(n=75) occurred during 2006-2018, while 2019-2023 experienced astronomical\ngrowth (n=1763 or 96%). The prominent use cases of CGAI (e.g., ChatGPT) for\nteaching, learning, and research activities occurred in computer science\n[multidisciplinary and AI] (32%), medical/healthcare (17%), engineering (7%),\nand business fields (6%). The intellectual structure shows strong collaboration\namong eminent multidisciplinary sources in business, Information Systems, and\nother areas. The thematic structure of SLP highlights prominent CGAI use cases,\nincluding improved user experience in human-computer interaction, computer\nprograms/code generation, and systems creation. Widespread CGAI usefulness for\nteachers, researchers, and learners includes syllabi/course content generation,\ntesting aids, and academic writing. The concerns about abuse and misuse\n(plagiarism, academic integrity, privacy violations) and issues about\nmisinformation, danger of self-diagnoses, and patient privacy in\nmedical/healthcare applications are prominent. Formulating strategies and\npolicies to address potential CGAI challenges in teaching/learning and practice\nare priorities. Developing discipline-based automatic detection of GenAI\ncontents to check abuse is proposed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
