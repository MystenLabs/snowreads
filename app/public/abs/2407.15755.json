However, the short-run and long-run relationships\nbetween these variables have been interpreted in different ways, and many\ncontroversies are still open. Some authors have claimed that the causal\nrelationships between population health and income can be discovered using\ncointegration models. We show, however, that empirically testing a\ncointegration relation between LEB and GDP per capita is not a sound method to\ninfer a causal link between health and income. For a given country it is easy\nto find computer-generated data or time series of real observations, related or\nunrelated to the country, that according to standard methods are also\ncointegrated with the country's LEB. More generally, given a trending time\nseries, it is easy to find other series, observational or artificial, that\nappear cointegrated with it. Thus, standard cointegration methodology cannot\ndistinguish whether cointegration relationships are spurious or causal.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
