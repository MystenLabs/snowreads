At the end, each contributor identifies their contribution, often\nverbally. The reward, however, is very frequently financial. It leads to the\nquestion of what (percentage) share in the creation of the paper is due to\nindividual authors. Different authors may have various opinions on the matter;\neven worse, their opinions may have different relevance. In this paper, we\npresent simple models that allow aggregation of experts' views, linking the\npriority of his preference directly to the assessment made by other experts. In\nthis approach, the more significant the contribution of a given expert, the\ngreater the importance of his opinion. The presented method can be considered\nan attempt to find consensus among peers involved in the same project. Hence,\nits applications may go beyond the proposed study example of writing a\nscientific paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VztCe9mXJhdD4VH4iDS_yp5anzpQIP_yU5UVnwx42FE","pdfSize":"241322"}
