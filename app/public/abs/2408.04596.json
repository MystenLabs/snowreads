Code-switching occurs when a speaker alternates\nbetween one language variety (the primary language) and another (the secondary\nlanguage), and is widely observed in multilingual contexts. Recent work has\nshown that code-switching is often correlated with areas of high information\nload in the primary language, but it is unclear whether high primary language\nload only makes the secondary language relatively easier to produce at\ncode-switching points (speaker-driven code-switching), or whether\ncode-switching is additionally used by speakers to signal the need for greater\nattention on the part of listeners (audience-driven code-switching). In this\npaper, we use bilingual Chinese-English online forum posts and transcripts of\nspontaneous Chinese-English speech to replicate prior findings that high\nprimary language (Chinese) information load is correlated with switches to the\nsecondary language (English). We then demonstrate that the information load of\nthe English productions is even higher than that of meaning equivalent Chinese\nalternatives, and these are therefore not easier to produce, providing evidence\nof audience-driven influences in code-switching at the level of the\ncommunication channel, not just at the sociolinguistic level, in both writing\nand speech.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
