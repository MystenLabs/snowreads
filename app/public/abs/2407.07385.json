However, the spatial distributions of CO and HCN, two of these\nlong-lived species, had never been jointly observed at high latitudinal\nresolution. Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array observations of HCN\nand CO in March 2017 show that CO was meridionally uniform and restricted to\npressures lower than 3 $\\pm$ 1 mbar. HCN shared a similar vertical distribution\nin the low- to mid-latitudes, but was depleted at pressures between 2$^{+2}_\n{-1}$ and 0.04$^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ mbar in the aurora and surrounding regions,\nresulting in a drop by two orders of magnitude in column density. We propose\nthat heterogeneous chemistry bonds HCN on large aurora-produced aerosols at\nthese pressures in the Jovian auroral regions causing the observed depletion.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
