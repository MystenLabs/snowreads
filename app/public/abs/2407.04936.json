However, the SDR-based metrics require a reference signal, which is\noften difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. In addition, with the\nSDR-based metrics, the content information of the text query is not considered\neffectively in LASS. This paper introduces a reference-free evaluation metric\nusing a contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) module, termed CLAPScore,\nwhich measures the semantic similarity between the separated audio and the text\nquery. Unlike SDR, the proposed CLAPScore metric evaluates the quality of the\nseparated audio based on the content information of the text query, without\nneeding a reference signal. Experimental results show that the CLAPScore metric\nprovides an effective evaluation of the semantic relevance of the separated\naudio to the text query, as compared to the SDR metric, offering an alternative\nfor the performance evaluation of LASS systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
