This study investigates the use of RPA for structured data extraction\nand evaluates its advantages over manual processes. By comparing\nhuman-performed tasks with those executed by RPA software bots, we assess\nefficiency and accuracy in data extraction from invoices, focusing on the\neffectiveness of the RPA system. Through four distinct scenarios involving\nvarying numbers of invoices, we measure efficiency in terms of time and effort\nrequired for task completion, as well as accuracy by comparing error rates\nbetween manual and RPA processes. Our findings highlight the significant\nefficiency gains achieved by RPA, with bots completing tasks in significantly\nless time compared to manual efforts across all cases. Moreover, the RPA system\nconsistently achieves perfect accuracy, mitigating the risk of errors and\nenhancing process reliability. These results underscore the transformative\npotential of RPA in optimizing operational efficiency, reducing human labor\ncosts, and improving overall business performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
