Tilting\nthe feet on two axes yields in forward, backward and sideways motion. In\naddition, a separate rotary joint allows for rotation around the vertical axis.\nAttached springs on all joints self-center the controller. The HTC Vive tracker\nis used to translate the trackers' orientation into locomotion commands. The\nproposed self-centering feet controller was used successfully for the ANA\nAvatar XPRIZE competition, where a naive operator traversed the robot through a\nlonger distance, surpassing obstacles while solving various interaction and\nmanipulation tasks in between. We publicly provide the models of the mostly\n3D-printed feet controller for reproduction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sjN29OySSF4QxfxA53RVcd3ezM6BnK9oz-tcaRmylos","pdfSize":"3830946","txDigest":"Hk5soG8zcgCS9c2FrAiFEQaPTkWPi1SCVggvgFb4NPEU","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
