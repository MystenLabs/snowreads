We establish the\ncorrespondence between three different sets of parameters, namely, those\narising from representing the Reeb vector field as an automorphism of the\nHeisenberg sphere, the parameters used in Stanton's description of rigid\nspheres, and the parameters arising from the rigid normal forms. We also\ngeometrically describe the moduli space for rigid spheres, and provide\ngeometric distinction between Stanton's hypersurfaces and those found by Ezhov\nand Schmalz. Finally, we determine the Sasakian automorphism groups of the\nrigid spheres and detect the homogeneous Sasakian manifolds among them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
