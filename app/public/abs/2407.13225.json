All the solutions are analytically found for the $N=2$ case. Two types\nof solitons have been determined: (a) Simple solutions formed by a topological\nkink with or without the presence of a $Q$-ball. (b) Composite solutions. They\nare constituted by some one-parameter families of solutions which can be\nunderstood as a non-linear combination of simple solutions. The properties of\nall of those solutions and the analysis of their linear stability, as well as\ndecay channels, are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
