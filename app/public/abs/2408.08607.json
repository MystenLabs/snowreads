So far, various topology\ncontrol and routing solutions have been proposed for these networks. However,\nas technology expands and applications grow, so does the need for a stable\nunderwater communication platform. On the other hand, underwater communication\nis associated with challenges such as node mobility, long propagation delays,\nlow bandwidth, limited resources, and high error rates. In this research, for\nthe first time, a topology control platform based on the RPL tree is modelled\nby applying its structural changes underwater. The proposed RPLUW methods in\nthe case of RPLUWM fixed nodes are introduced to support the mobility of nodes\nunderwater. Flexible objective functions, utilisation of decision-making\nsystems, and application of control schedules in these methods have increased\nnetwork life, reduced overhead, and increased node efficiency. The simulation\nresults of the proposed method, in comparison with recent methods in this\nfield, show an increase in network efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"gaDYpSJAt_G7cy0D9bAlVNBO7NmPeq9dawRUApWNJM0","pdfSize":"1843084"}
