With respect to\nassumptions, design-based direct estimators are generally preferable because of\ntheir consistency and asymptotic normality. However, when data are sparse at\nthe desired area level, as is often the case when measuring rare events for\nexample, these direct estimators can have extremely large uncertainty, making a\nmodel-based approach preferable. A model-based approach with a random spatial\neffect borrows information from surrounding areas at the cost of inducing\nshrinkage towards the local average. As a result, estimates may be\nover-smoothed and inconsistent with design-based estimates at higher area\nlevels when aggregated. We propose a unit-level Bayesian model for small area\nestimation of rare event prevalence which uses design-based direct estimates at\na higher area level to increase accuracy, precision, and consistency in\naggregation. After introducing the model and its implementation, we conduct a\nsimulation study to compare its properties to alternative models and apply it\nto the estimation of the neonatal mortality rate in Zambia, using 2014 DHS\ndata.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
