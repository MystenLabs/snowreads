Its use has contributed significantly to the prevention of\ncardiovascular diseases including infarctions. Although physicians need to see\nthe printed curves for a diagnosis, nowadays there exist automated tools based\non machine learning that can help diagnosis of arrhythmias and other\npathologies, these tools operate on digitalized ECG data that are merely\none-dimensional discrete signals (a kind of information that is much similar to\ndigitized audio). Thus, it is interesting to have both the graphical\ninformation and the digitized data. This is possible with modern, digital\nequipment. Nevertheless, there still exist many analog electrocardiogram\nmachines that plot results on paper with a printed gris measured in\nmillimeters. This paper presents a novel image analysis method that is capable\nof reading a printed ECG and converting it into a sampled digital signal.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
