We\npresent NegotiaToR, a simple network architecture for optical reconfigurable\nDCNs that utilizes on-demand scheduling to handle dynamic traffic. In\nNegotiaToR, racks exchange scheduling messages through an in-band control plane\nand distributedly calculate non-conflicting paths from binary traffic demand\ninformation. Optimized for incasts, it also provides opportunities to bypass\nscheduling delays. NegotiaToR is compatible with prevalent flat topologies, and\nis tailored towards a minimalist design for on-demand reconfigurable DCNs,\nenhancing practicality. Through large-scale simulations, we show that\nNegotiaToR achieves both small mice flow completion time (FCT) and high goodput\non two representative flat topologies, especially under heavy loads.\nParticularly, the FCT of mice flows is one to two orders of magnitude better\nthan the state-of-the-art traffic-oblivious reconfigurable DCN design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
