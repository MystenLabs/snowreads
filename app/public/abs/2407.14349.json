As a special case, a copula is called tail symmetric if it\nis tail equivalent to the associated survival copula. We propose a novel\nmeasure and statistical test for tail equivalence. The proposed measure takes\nthe value of zero if and only if the two copulas share a pair of tail order and\ntail order parameter in common. Moreover, taking the nature of these tail\nquantities into account, we design the proposed measure so that it takes a\nlarge value when tail orders are different, and a small value when tail order\nparameters are non-identical. We derive asymptotic properties of the proposed\nmeasure, and then propose a novel statistical test for tail equivalence.\nPerformance of the proposed test is demonstrated in a series of simulation\nstudies and empirical analyses of financial stock returns in the periods of the\nworld financial crisis and the COVID-19 recession. Our empirical analysis\nreveals non-identical tail behaviors in different pairs of stocks, different\nparts of tails, and the two periods of recessions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
