Although several works\nsuccessfully validate its accuracy and fairness, more research must be done on\nhow students' pre-existing social relationships affect the grades they give\ntheir peers in an e-learning course. We developed a Moodle plugin to provide\nthe platform with peer assessment capabilities in forums and used it on an MSc\ncourse. The plugin curated the reviewer set for a post based on the author's\nrelationships and included rubrics to counter the possible interpersonal\neffects of peer assessment. Results confirm that peer assessment is reliable\nand accurate for works with at least three peer assessments, although students'\ngrades are slightly higher. The impact of social relationships is noticeable\nwhen students who do not like another peer grade their work consistently lower\nthan students who have a positive connection. However, this has little\ninfluence on the final aggregate peer grade. Our findings show that peer\nassessment can replace traditional evaluation in an e-learning environment\nwhere students are familiar with each other.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
