This leads to a potentially singular linear\nsystem, which is handled by a Krylov linear solver. The framework may offer\ncomputational advantages in dealing with spaces like Hierarchical B-splines,\nT-splines, and LR-splines.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
