Our analysis indicates that a variety of new phases can be\nrealized as a function of chemical doping and twist angle. In particular, we\nfind a non-magnetic excitonic insulating phase that breaks the translational\nsymmetry of the underlying moir\\'e pattern. This phase results from the\ninterplay of strong Coulomb interactions and the twist angle. In addition, we\nshow that the features of the renormalized dispersion such as the magic angles\ndepend significantly on the interactions. Our results highlight the rich\nphysics arising in doped moir\\'e superlattices of Mott insulators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
