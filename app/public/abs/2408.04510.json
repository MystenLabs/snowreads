This invariant was motivated by using Kirchhoff's laws for\nthe dual graph of the knot diagram. Later, in 2020, Anastasiya Galkina\ngeneralised this invariant and defined the electric group for non-oriented\nknots. Both works were never written and published. In the present paper we\ndescribe a simple and general approach to the electric group for oriented knots\nand links. Each homomorphism from the electric group to an arbitrary finite\ngroup can be described by a proper colouring of the diagram. This colouring\nassigns an element of the group to each crossing of the diagram, and the proper\nconditions correspond to the areas of the diagram. In the second part of the\npaper we introduce tensor network invariants for coloured links. The idea of\nthese invariants is very close to quantum invariants for classical links.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7vmlFajld5UeEA962IeDkyIHkDFgwG-wZi1S_uLg9fs","pdfSize":"234887"}
