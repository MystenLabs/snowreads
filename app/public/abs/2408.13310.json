With the aim of performing a dynamical study, we\nlaunched an optical spectroscopy campaign with the GTC telescope. We detect the\ncompanion star and construct its radial velocity curve, yielding a binary\norbital period of Porb = 10.8041 +- 0.0010 h and a radial velocity\nsemi-amplitude of K2 = 390 +- 4 km/s. This results in a mass function of\nf(M1)=2.77 +- 0.09 Msun. Combined with constraints on the binary inclination,\nit sets a lower limit to the compact object mass of M1 > 3.12 +- 0.10 Msun,\ndynamically confirming the black hole nature of the accretor. Comparison of the\naverage spectrum in the rest frame of the companion with synthetic stellar\ntemplates supports a K4V donor partially veiled (74%) by the accretion disc. A\nrefined distance measurement of 3.7+- 0.3 kpc, together with the astrometric\nproper motion and the systemic velocity derived from the radial velocity curve\n(181 +-4 km/s), supports a natal kick velocity of 220 +30 -40 km/s, at the\nupper end of the observed distribution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
