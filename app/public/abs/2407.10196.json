Conventional\napproaches with semi-supervised clustering schemes encounter high query costs\nwhen applied to large datasets with numerous classes. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel Adaptive Active Aggregation and Splitting (A3S)\nframework, falling within the cluster-adjustment scheme in active clustering.\nA3S features strategic active clustering adjustment on the initial cluster\nresult, which is obtained by an adaptive clustering algorithm. In particular,\nour cluster adjustment is inspired by the quantitative analysis of Normalized\nmutual information gain under the information theory framework and can provably\nimprove the clustering quality. The proposed A3S framework significantly\nelevates the performance and scalability of active clustering. In extensive\nexperiments across diverse real-world datasets, A3S achieves desired results\nwith significantly fewer human queries compared with existing methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
