As a result,\nlight propagation in a vacuum is typically modeled by rays that follow null\ngeodesics. However, general relativity predicts that polarization-dependent\ndeviations from these geodesics occur in an inhomogeneous gravitational field.\nIn this article, we evaluate the corrections for the deflection and emission of\nlight by a massive gravitating body. Additionally, we derive the scaling\nbehavior of the physical parameters characterizing the trajectories. The\ncalculations are performed in the leading order in frequency. We use these\nresults to assess the significance of the birefringence effect in various\nastrophysical observations. We find that the effect cannot be measured with\ncurrent instruments but may be detectable in the near future.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
