These methods allow us to formulate the coupled system as a\nspace-time interface problem and apply iterative algorithms directly to the\nevolutionary problem. Each time-dependent subdomain problem is solved\nindependently, which enables the use of different time discretization schemes\nand time step sizes in the subsystems. This leads to an efficient way of\nsimulating time-dependent phenomena. We present numerical tests for both\nnon-physical and physical problems, with various mesh sizes and time step sizes\nto demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
