Due to the temporal constraints, it is assumed that\ndeep learning methods are not the optimal solution for application in this\nfield. However, excluding the entire -- and prevalent -- group of methods seems\nrather rash given the progress that has been made in recent years in its\ndevelopment. For this reason, the following paper is the first to present an\napproach to natural language data stream classification using the sentence\nspace method, which allows for encoding text into the form of a discrete\ndigital signal. This allows the use of convolutional deep networks dedicated to\nimage classification to solve the task of recognizing fake news based on text\ndata. Based on the real-life Fakeddit dataset, the proposed approach was\ncompared with state-of-the-art algorithms for data stream classification based\non generalization ability and time complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nw1jhuN6aLohb-mwZLhFPTxsXfqWJp_VcyA_Rx1wckg","pdfSize":"934117"}
