Using the light-cone spectator diquark model, we have\ninvestigated the electromagnetic form factors of the octet baryons and have\ncompared them with the available data. Model scale has been estimated by\ncomparing the valence $u$ quark's parton distribution function (PDF) of proton\nwith the result of CTEQ5L parameterization. A comparative analysis of PDFs and\ngeneralized parton distributions (GPDs) for non-zero skewness among octet\nbaryons has also been demonstrated. Fourier transform of the deeply virtual\nCompton scattering amplitude with respect to skewness has been further applied\nto study the diffraction patterns in the boost-invariant longitudinal position\nspace.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
