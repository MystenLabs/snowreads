The renormalization of the metric\ntensor, driven by the Ricci Flow, and the breaking of conformal and chiral\nsymmetries -- thanks to introducing a double dilaton model and large-$N_c$\ncorrections -- allow us to relate the existence of an infrared fixed point in\nthe coupling constant with a smooth matching to pQCD well above 2 GeV. The\nproposed dilaton model yields linear Regge trajectories and vector decay\nconstants similar to their experimental counterparts.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t-DnLMQvQWCvmHD0MjXdemgvJZbXFGEzKj3glyS-GKI","pdfSize":"497033","txDigest":"C1HAy2gothAzESeqXsEm6YBpkhxf48iz54LoidZVYtsp","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
