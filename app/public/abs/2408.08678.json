Such an assumption\nmay not be completely innocent, and it may fail for datasets with heavy tails\n(e.g., catastrophic losses), relevant to financial risk management. In this\npaper, we discuss the importance of infinite-mean models in economics, finance,\nand related fields, with recent results and examples. We emphasize that many\nresults or intuitions that hold for finite-mean models turn out to fail or even\nflip for infinite-mean models. Due to the breakdown of standard thinking for\ninfinite-mean models, we argue that if the possibility of using infinite-mean\nmodels cannot be excluded, great caution should be taken when applying classic\nmethods that are usually designed for finite-mean cases in finance and\ninsurance.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
