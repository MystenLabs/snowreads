A modified\nRitz projection operator defined on $H^2_0(\\Omega)$ ensures error estimates\nunder appropriate regularity assumptions on the solution. Stability results and\nerror estimates of optimal order are established in suitable norms for the\nsemidiscrete and explicit/implicit fully-discrete versions of the proposed\nschemes. Finally, we report on numerical experiments using explicit and\nimplicit schemes for time discretization and Morley, discontinuous Galerkin,\nand {C$^0$ interior} penalty schemes for space discretization, that validate\nthe theoretical error estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
