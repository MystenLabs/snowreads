The vorticity blowup occurs at the time of the first singularity, and is\naccompanied by an axisymmetric implosion in which the swirl velocity enjoys\nfull stability, as opposed to finite co-dimension stability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
