A mobility edge that separates\ndiffusive transport and Anderson localization is identified, revealing a sharp\ntransition from diffusion to localization for light. Critical behavior in the\nvicinity of the mobility edge is well described by a single-parameter scaling\nlaw. The critical exponent is found to be consistent with the value known for\nthe Anderson transition of the orthogonal universality class. Statistical\ndistribution of total transmission at the mobility edge is described without\nany fit parameter by the diagrammatic perturbation theory originally developed\nfor scalar wave diffusion, but notable deviation from the theory is found when\nAnderson localization sets in.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"IBaUnguLVJdvRHtv64h5FuemXCP3hGHb7P0abAeUBTE","pdfSize":"3355460"}
