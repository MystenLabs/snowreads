New phenomena concerning geodesics arise due to\ninhomogeneity. These include novel Busemann functions associated with flat\nregions of the limit shape and thin rectangles, undirected semi-infinite\ngeodesics, non-trivial axis-directed geodesics, intervals with no geodesic\ndirections, and isolated geodesic directions. We further observe a new\ndichotomy for competition interfaces and second-class customers in a series of\nmemoryless continuous-time queues with inhomogeneous service rates: a second\nclass customer either becomes trapped or proceeds through the queue at strictly\npositive speed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
