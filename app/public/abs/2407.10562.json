In this work, we generalise\nthis result to the case of $d$-term silting objects for arbitrary $d\\geq 2$ by\nintroducing the notion of torsion classes for extriangulated categories. In\nparticular, we show that the poset of $d$-term silting objects in\n$\\mathrm{K}^b(\\operatorname{proj}\\Lambda)$ is isomorphic to the poset of\ncomplete and hereditary cotorsion classes in\n$\\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\\operatorname{proj}\\Lambda)$, and to that of positive\nand functorially finite torsion classes in\n$D^{[-d+2,0]}(\\operatorname{mod}\\Lambda)$, an extension-closed subcategory of\n$D^b(\\operatorname{mod}\\Lambda)$. We further show that the posets\n$\\operatorname{cotors}\\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\\operatorname{proj}\\Lambda)$ and\n$\\operatorname{tors} D^{[-d+2,0]}(\\operatorname{mod}\\Lambda)$ are lattices, and\nthat the truncation functor $\\tau_{\\geq -d+2}$ gives an isomorphism between the\ntwo.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2zPx3qQexwaOdB9tYX-rtCQq9mR3A3zjuLpkoyuwAmk","pdfSize":"351404"}
