We then prove the disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich\nmetrics are complete, separable (except an endpoint case), geodesic spaces,\nwith a dual representation. Additionally, we prove existence and duality for an\nassociated barycenter problem, and provide conditions for uniqueness of a\nbarycenter. These results on barycenter problems for the disintegrated\nMonge--Kantorovich metrics also yield the corresponding existence, duality, and\nuniqueness results for classical Monge--Kantorovich barycenters in a wide\nvariety of spaces, including a uniqueness result on any connected, complete\nRiemannian manifold, with or without boundary, with no restriction on the\ngeometry of any kind.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
