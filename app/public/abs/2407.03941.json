NT-Java-1.1B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing its\nbase model and majority of other models of similar size on MultiPL-E Java code\nbenchmark. While there have been studies on extending large, generic\npre-trained models to improve proficiency in specific programming languages\nlike Python, similar investigations on small code models for other programming\nlanguages are lacking. Large code models require specialized hardware like GPUs\nfor inference, highlighting the need for research into building small code\nmodels that can be deployed on developer desktops. This paper addresses this\nresearch gap by focusing on the development of a small Java code model,\nNT-Java-1.1B, and its quantized versions, which performs comparably to open\nmodels around 1.1B on MultiPL-E Java code benchmarks, making them ideal for\ndesktop deployment. This paper establishes the foundation for specialized\nmodels across languages and sizes for a family of NT Models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
