Conventional cryptographic algorithms\nsuch as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) are\nvulnerable to quantum computing attacks, which could jeopardize the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data transmitted by\nUEs. This demo paper proposes the integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography\n(PQC) in TLS for UE Communication to mitigate the risks of quantum attacks. We\npresent our setup and explain each of the components used. We also provide the\nentire workflow of the demo for other researchers to replicate the same setup.\nBy addressing the implementation of PQC within a 5G network to secure UE-to-UE\ncommunication, this research aims to pave the way for developing\nquantum-resistant mobile devices and securing the future of wireless\ncommunications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ctChjVpgokHxCUmYx3Ip7rvBw4ZWqCTmFhMIsQ4fZkY","pdfSize":"220455"}
