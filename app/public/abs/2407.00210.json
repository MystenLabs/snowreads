Sebens","authorsParsed":[["Sebens","Charles T.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 19:33:07 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-02","timestamp":1719603187000,"abstract":"  The view that the laws of nature produce later states of the universe from\nearlier ones (prominently defended by Maudlin) faces difficult questions as to\nhow the laws produce the future and whether that production is compatible with\nspecial relativity. This article grapples with those questions, arguing that\nthe concerns can be overcome through a close analysis of the laws of classical\nmechanics and electromagnetism. The view that laws produce the future seems to\nrequire that the laws of nature take a certain form, fitting what Adlam has\ncalled \"the time evolution paradigm.\" Making that paradigm precise, we might\ndemand that there be temporally local dynamical laws that take properties of\nthe present and the arbitrarily-short past as input, returning as output\nchanges in such properties into the arbitrarily-short future. In classical\nmechanics, Newton's second law can be fit into this form if we follow a\nproposal from Easwaran and understand the acceleration that appears in the law\nto capture how velocity (taken to be a property of the present and the\narbitrarily-short past) changes into the arbitrarily-short future. The\ndynamical laws of electromagnetism can be fit into this form as well, though\nbecause electromagnetism is a special relativistic theory we might require that\nthe laws meet a higher standard: linking past light-cone to future light-cone.\nWith some work, the laws governing the evolution of the vector and scalar\npotentials, as well as the evolution of charged matter, can be put in a form\nthat meets this higher standard.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
