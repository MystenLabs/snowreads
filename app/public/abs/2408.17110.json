We show that, for $\\bm{a} \\in \\mathbb{N}^m_+$,\nthe generic $\\mathbb{N}^m$-graded Artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner\nring of an $\\bm{a}$-balanced homology sphere over a field of characteristic $2$\nsatisfies the multigraded strong Lefschetz property. A corollary is the\ninequality $h_{\\bm{b}} \\leq h_{\\bm{c}}$ for $\\bm{b} \\leq \\bm{c} \\leq\n\\bm{a}-\\bm{b}$ among the flag $h$-numbers of an $\\bm{a}$-balanced simplicial\nsphere. This can be seen as a common generalization of the unimodality of the\n$h$-vector of a simplicial sphere by Adiprasito and the balanced generalized\nlower bound inequality by Juhnke-Kubitzke and Murai. We further generalize\nthese results to $\\bm{a}$-balanced homology manifolds and $\\bm{a}$-balanced\nsimplicial cycles over a field of characteristic $2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
