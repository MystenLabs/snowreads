This\nrepresentation has useful practical and theoretical properties. We summarize\nsome previous results for block matrix inversion and present some results on\ntriangular decomposition of block matrices. The case of inverting matrices over\na ring that is neither formally real nor formally complex was inspired by\nGonzalez-Vega et al.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
