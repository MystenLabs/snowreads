We reinterpret a search for displaced showers in the CMS\nmuon system and we find that it is sensitive to parameter space at and below\nthe canonical seesaw floor, $|V_{\\ell N}|^2 \\approx 10^{-12}$ ($\\ell = e$,\n$\\tau$) for $m_N \\approx 40$ GeV. With existing data constraining such a\nwell-motivated scenario of neutrino mass generation, we determine the projected\nsensitivity at the HL-LHC, motivating dedicated searches for long-lived RHNs\nwith decay lengths $\\approx 10$ m.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
