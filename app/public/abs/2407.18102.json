As a\nspecific model, we consider a thermal $y$-distortion, which alters the\ndistribution function of the neutrino background by depleting the population of\nlow-energy neutrinos and enhancing the high-energy tail. We constrain the\nthermal $y$-parameter of the cosmic neutrino background using Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and place\na $95\\%$-confidence upper bound of $y \\leq 0.043$. The $y$-parameter increases\nthe number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom, reducing the sound\nhorizon radius and increasing the best-fit value for the Hubble constant $H_0$.\nWe obtain an upper bound on the Hubble constant of $H_0 = 71.12\\\n\\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ at $95\\%$ confidence, substantially reducing the tension\nbetween CMB/BAO constraints and direct measurement of the expansion rate from\nType-Ia supernovae. Including a spectral distortion also allows for a higher\nvalue of the spectral index of scalar fluctuations, with a best-fit of\n$n_{\\mathrm{S}} = 0.9720 \\pm 0.0063$, and a $95\\%$-confidence upper bound of\n$n_{\\mathrm{S}} \\leq 0.9842$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
