More\nprecisely, away from $\\mathcal{C}$ one has $g_\\epsilon\\to g$ as $\\epsilon\\to\n0$, while the $\\epsilon^{-1}$-rescaling of $g_\\epsilon$ around every point of\n$\\mathcal{C}$ tends to a fixed subextremal Kerr metric. Our result applies on\nall spacetimes with noncompact Cauchy hypersurfaces, and also on spacetimes\nwhich do not admit nontrivial Killing vector fields in a neighborhood of a\npoint on the geodesic. As an application, we construct spacetimes which model\nthe merger of a very light subextremal Kerr black hole with a slowly rotating\nunit mass Kerr(-de Sitter) black hole, followed by the relaxation of the\nresulting black hole to its final Kerr(-de Sitter) state.\n  In Part I, we constructed approximate solutions $g_{0,\\epsilon}$ of the\ngluing problem which satisfy the Einstein equations only modulo\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^\\infty)$ errors. Part II introduces a framework for\nobtaining uniform control of solutions of linear wave equations on\n$\\epsilon$-independent precompact subsets of the original spacetime $(M,g)$. In\nthis final part, we show how to correct $g_{0,\\epsilon}$ to a true solution\n$g_\\epsilon$ by adding a metric perturbation of size\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^\\infty)$ which solves a carefully chosen gauge-fixed\nversion of the Einstein vacuum equations. The main novel ingredient is the\nproof of suitable mapping properties for the linearized gauge-fixed Einstein\nequations on subextremal Kerr spacetimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
