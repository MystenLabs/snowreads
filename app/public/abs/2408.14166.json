This model introduces\nvector-like leptons and a real scalar singlet. Based on this framework, we\ngenerate Dirac neutrino masses and explain the neutrino normal mass ordering.\nThe model also aligns well with current oscillation data regarding theoretical\nvalues of the leptonic mixing angles and the Dirac CP-violating phase.\nFurthermore, it predicts that the atmospheric mixing angle falls in the higher\noctant and proposes a viable dark matter candidate. We discuss the\nphenomenological aspects and future testability of the model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
