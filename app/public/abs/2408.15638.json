We show that these\ngeometries consist of three invariantly defined subfamilies, namely\n(generalized) Kundt, pp- and Siklos waves, for each of which we obtain a\nconvenient canonical form. As a byproduct, this also demonstrates that all such\nmetrics belong to the (A)dS-Kerr-Schild class. The role of these spacetimes in\nEinstein's gravity (including minimally coupled $p$-forms and non-linear\nelectrodynamics) as non-expanding gravitational waves in an (anti)-de Sitter\nbackground is discussed. Furthermore, applications to extended theories such as\nGauss-Bonnet, Lovelock, quadratic and $f(R)$ gravity are also briefly\nillustrated, as well as the overlap of the obtained metrics with universal and\nalmost-universal spacetimes. In the appendices we additionally settle the issue\nof the redundancy of certain field equations for all Kundt spacetimes in a\ntheory-independent way, and present various alternative coordinates for the\nspacetimes studied in the paper.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
