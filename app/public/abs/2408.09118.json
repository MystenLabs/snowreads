In this regime, the solution of the equation exhibits high-frequency\noscillations. We design an efficient numerical method combining the spectral\nGalerkin approximation and the midpoint scheme. This accurately approximates\nthe solution, or at least of the associated physical observables. Furthermore,\nthe strong convergence rate for the proposed scheme is derived, which\nexplicitly depends on the Planck constant. This conclusion implies the\nsemiclassical regime's admissible meshing strategies for obtaining \"correct\"\nphysical observables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
