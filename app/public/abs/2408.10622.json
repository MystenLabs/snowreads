Instead, a novel approach retains valid trajectory\nsegments, minimizing the need for complete replanning and reducing changes to\nthe original plan. This work introduces a trajectory repairing framework that\ncalculates a feasible evasive trajectory while computing the Feasible\nTime-to-React (F-TTR), balancing the maintenance of the original plan with\nsafety assurance. The framework employs a binary search algorithm to\niteratively create repaired trajectories, guaranteeing both the safety and\nfeasibility of the trajectory repairing result. In contrast to earlier\napproaches that separated the calculation of safety metrics from trajectory\nrepairing, which resulted in unsuccessful plans for evasive maneuvers, our work\nhas the anytime capability to provide both a Feasible Time-to-React and an\nevasive trajectory for further execution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
