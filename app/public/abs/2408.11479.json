By analytically\nproving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP)\nlemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we\npropose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by\nneural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed\ndynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly\nguarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained\ndynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against\nout-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.\nCode here https://github.com/kojima-r/DeepDissipativeModel\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
