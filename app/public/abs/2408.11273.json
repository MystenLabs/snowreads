We show that this plot is invariant under a scale transformation\nof the finite but not zero interval of the time. Second, we numerically\nevaluate values of the time when the absolute value of the $z$-component of the\nBloch vector is nearly equal to zero. We demonstrate that some values of the\ntime can be derived with denominators of fractions of the Diophantine\napproximation for irrational numbers. The origin of those phenomena is that the\ncomponents of the Bloch vector for thermal multi-photon JCM cannot be described\nwith the Fourier series.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
