However, its application to deep neural networks\n(DNNs), known for their highly nonconvex nature, still poses challenges. To\nbridge the gap between certified unlearning and DNNs, we propose several simple\ntechniques to extend certified unlearning methods to nonconvex objectives. To\nreduce the time complexity, we develop an efficient computation method by\ninverse Hessian approximation without compromising certification guarantees. In\naddition, we extend our discussion of certification to nonconvergence training\nand sequential unlearning, considering that real-world users can send\nunlearning requests at different time points. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and the advantages\nof certified unlearning in DNNs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PQoiPxEw22HDWHa-FQR_LlI47VoIZIuD2f8g4BQ3NGQ","pdfSize":"900464","txDigest":"9kxVEVjQUERtApqUPVdBMTrURUW8J5bpo4XM6uy2oyAC","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
