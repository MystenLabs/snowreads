Calvin accommodated Epicurean chance with Stoic determinism and\nsynthesised \\emph{phronesis/prudentia}, founded personal experience and\nemployed to deal with \\emph{tyche/fortuna}, and \\emph{episteme/scientia},\nuniversal knowledge. This meant that matters of chance, which had previously\nbeen considered too particular for mathematical treatment, became part of\n\\emph{episteme/scientia}. Clear evidence of the significance of Calvin in\nmathematics is in the facts that Huygens considered using the word 'hope' to\ndescribe mathematical expectation and French mathematics still uses\n\\emph{esp\\'erance} for mathematical expectation. Calvin asserted that Hope\nrepresented a universal, objective and indubitable idea making it\ncharacteristic of mathematics. The argument is built on a review of how the\nideas of Hope, Faith and Prudence have evolved in European thought that\nhighlights Calvin's innovations. The conclusion identifies contemporary issues\nin the application of mathematics in society that are illuminated in light of\nCalvin's doctrine.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
