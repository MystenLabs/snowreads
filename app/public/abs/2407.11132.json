This result\nstems from the ultralocal nature of null physics and is derived through a\ncanonical analysis of the Raychaudhuri equation, interpreted as a constraint\ngenerating null time reparametrizations. The CFT exhibits a non-zero central\ncharge, providing a mechanism for the quantum emergence of time in\ngravitational systems and an associated choice of vacuum state. Our analysis\nreveals that the central charge quantifies the degrees of freedom along each\nnull ray. Throughout our investigation, the area element of a cut plays a\ncrucial role, necessitating its treatment as a quantum operator due to its\ndynamic nature in phase space or because of quantum backreaction. Furthermore,\nwe show that the total central charge diverges in a perturbative analysis due\nto the infinite number of null generators. This divergence is resolved if there\nis a discrete spectrum for the area form operator. We introduce the concept of\n`embadons' to denote these localized geometric units of area, the fundamental\nbuilding blocks of geometry at a mesoscopic quantum gravity scale.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
