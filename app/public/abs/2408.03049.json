The averages are performed on the spatial\nhypersurfaces of the simulation setup which, at least initially, represent the\nhypersurfaces of statistical homogeneity and isotropy. We find only negligible\ncosmic backreaction on these hypersurfaces even on very small scales, but find\nsignificant curvature fluctuations of up to $10\\%$ in $\\Omega_R$ for\nsub-volumes with radius $\\sim200$ Mpc and even larger fluctuations in smaller\nsub-volumes. In addition, we quantify fluid flow in and out of these\nsub-volumes. We find this to be significant, up to a $5\\%$ change in the\ndensity between redshift $z=1$ and $z=0$ of a single sphere of radius $\\sim200$\nMpc (and larger for smaller spheres). We suggest this may be important for\nstudies basing averages on volumes co-moving with the simulation hypersurfaces.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f5p7WG-q1WWVYM3Zq9BXGdq7v-JdaX0Y_M-f30sGBqE","pdfSize":"3568064"}
