The accreted gas forms an accretion disk around the\nblack hole and emits x-ray radiation in two distinct modes: hard and soft\nstate. The origin of the states is unknown. We perform radiative plasma\nsimulations of the electron-positron-photon corona around the inner accretion\nflow. Our simulations extend previous efforts by self-consistently including\nall the prevalent quantum electrodynamic processes. We demonstrate that when\nthe plasma is turbulent, it naturally generates the observed hard-state\nemission. In addition, we show that when soft x-ray photons irradiate the\nsystem -- mimicking radiation from an accretion disk -- the turbulent plasma\ntransitions into a new equilibrium state that generates the observed soft-state\nemission. Our findings demonstrate that turbulent motions of magnetized plasma\ncan power black-hole accretion flow coronae and that quantum electrodynamic\nprocesses control the underlying state of the plasma.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
