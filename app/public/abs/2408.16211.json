These labellings indicate the lengths of the longest\nincreasing and decreasing chains of the largest rectangular region below and to\nthe left of the corners. Our results provide an alternative proof of Guo and\nPoznanovi\\'c's theorem on the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing\nchains have a symmetric joint distribution over $01$-fillings of stack\npolyomino. Moreover, our results offer new perspective to Chen, Guo and Pang's\nresult on the crossing number and the nesting number have a symmetric joint\ndistribution over linked partitions. In particular, our construction\ngeneralizes the growth diagram techniques of Rubey for the $01$-fillings of\nstack polyominoes with at most one $1$ per column and row.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
