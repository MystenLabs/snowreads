The first scenario has emerged from density-functional theory plus\ndynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Comparing the previous\nDFT+DMFT spectra to recent angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nexperiments, we find excellent agreement for both the Fermi surface and the\nstrongly renormalized quasi-particle bands, supporting the first scenario. Our\nkey findings further suggest that the \"waterfalls\" observed in ARPES might\nemerge from the quasi-particle--to--Hubbard-band crossover, and that additional\nspectral weight close to the $A$-pocket likely originates from the Ni-3$d_{xy}$\norbital.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
