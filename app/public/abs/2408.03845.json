Through interaction, users specify a set of pairwise relationships that\nthe DR should aim to capture. Existing methods for images incorporate feedback\ninto the DR through feature weights on abstract embedding features. However, if\nthe original embedding features do not suitably capture the users' task then\nthe DR cannot either. We propose ImageSI, an SI method for image DR that\nincorporates user feedback directly into the image model to update the\nunderlying embeddings, rather than weighting them. In doing so, ImageSI ensures\nthat the embeddings suitably capture the features necessary for the task so\nthat the DR can subsequently organize images using those features. We present\ntwo variations of ImageSI using different loss functions - ImageSI_MDS_Inverse,\nwhich prioritizes the explicit pairwise relationships from the interaction and\nImageSI_Triplet, which prioritizes clustering, using the interaction to define\ngroups of images. Finally, we present a usage scenario and a simulation based\nevaluation to demonstrate the utility of ImageSI and compare it to current\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CYRDp7nNGO-wqzVicocKRgQy6mwjDJbxc0HR7Sqctcc","pdfSize":"895332"}
