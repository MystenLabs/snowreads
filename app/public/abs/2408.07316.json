Explicitly, we demonstrate that $(X,Y;g)$ has the CP if and\nonly if 2 is the minimal cardinality of open covers $\\{U_i\\}$ of $X$ such that\neach $U_i$ admits a local lifting for $g$ with respect to $\\pi_{2,1}^Y$. This\ncharacterisation connects a standard problem in coincidence theory to current\nresearch trends in sectional category and topological robotics. Motivated by\nthis connection, we introduce the notion of relative topological complexity of\na map.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
