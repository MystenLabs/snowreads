Therefore hackers\ncan exploit them by adding code vulnerabilities to their sources and using\nthese vulnerabilities for performing malicious transactions. This paper\npresents two successful approaches for detecting malicious contracts: one uses\nopcode and relies on GPT2 and the other uses the Solidity source and a LORA\nfine-tuned CodeLlama. Finally, we present an XGBOOST model that combines gas\nproperties and Hexa-decimal signatures for detecting malicious transactions.\nThis approach relies on early assumptions that maliciousness is manifested by\nthe uncommon usage of the contracts' functions and the effort to pursue the\ntransaction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
