We employ different\ngraphical measures to explore similarities and differences using the results of\nboth pre- and post-test data from the Force Concept Inventory assessment tool,\nfrom which we calculate dominant misconceptions (DMs) and gains. We also use\nalluvial diagrams to track the choices made by these two groups of students\nfrom pre- to post-test stages. In our analysis, we find that DMs results\nindicate that participating Engineering students outperformed Physical Science\nstudents on average. However, the same types of normalised DMs persist at the\npost-test level. This is very useful when tracking persistent misconceptions,\nwhere when using repeated measures and alluvial diagrams with smaller groups of\nstudents, we find that Physical Science students tend to make more chaotic\nchoices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uDTps_SBaan9VF87n4XDZdVmnvBvPpzm4grs5wIeIWA","pdfSize":"998438"}
