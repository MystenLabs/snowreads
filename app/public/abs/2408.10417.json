The system is designed to identify\ncoordinated bullying attacks via social media and other mechanisms,\ncharacterize them and propose remediation and response activities to them. In\nparticular, a large language model (LLM) is used to populate an enhanced expert\nsystem-based network model of a bullying attack. This facilitates analysis and\nremediation activity - such as generating report messages to social media\ncompanies - determination. The system is described and the efficacy of the LLM\nfor populating the model is analyzed herein.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
