The emergence of linguistic properties is often\ninvestigated through simulations of emergent communication in referential\ngames. However, these experiments have yielded mixed results compared to\nsimilar experiments addressing linguistic properties of human language. Here we\naddress representational alignment as a potential contributing factor to these\nresults. Specifically, we assess the representational alignment between agent\nimage representations and between agent representations and input images. Doing\nso, we confirm that the emergent language does not appear to encode human-like\nconceptual visual features, since agent image representations drift away from\ninputs whilst inter-agent alignment increases. We moreover identify a strong\nrelationship between inter-agent alignment and topographic similarity, a common\nmetric for compositionality, and address its consequences. To address these\nissues, we introduce an alignment penalty that prevents representational drift\nbut interestingly does not improve performance on a compositional\ndiscrimination task. Together, our findings emphasise the key role\nrepresentational alignment plays in simulations of language emergence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"04F0lOLsSAkPb_w1oyLckfyMGnzoJoc7wih0z_rBDww","pdfSize":"2283907"}
