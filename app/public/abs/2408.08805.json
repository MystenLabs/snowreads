By leveraging a\nDual-Encoder ranking system that incorporates both BERT and SBERT model, we\nhave designed CIKMar to deliver highly relevant and accurate responses, even\nwith the constraints of a smaller language model size. Our evaluation reveals\nthat CIKMar achieves a robust recall and F1-score of 0.70 using BERTScore\nmetrics. However, we have identified a significant challenge: the Dual-Encoder\ntends to prioritize theoretical responses over practical ones. These findings\nunderscore the potential of compact and efficient models like Gemma in\ndemocratizing access to advanced educational AI systems, ensuring effective and\ncontextually appropriate responses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
