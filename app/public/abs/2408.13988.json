Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly in\nautomatic medical report generation (AMRG), offer a promising solution to this\ndilemma. This review comprehensively examines AMRG methods from 2021 to 2024.\nIt (i) presents solutions to primary challenges in this field, (ii) explores\nAMRG applications across various imaging modalities, (iii) introduces publicly\navailable datasets, (iv) outlines evaluation metrics, (v) identifies techniques\nthat significantly enhance model performance, and (vi) discusses unresolved\nissues and potential future research directions. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive understanding of the existing literature and inspire valuable\nfuture research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gXdlSDV5xgVlkEtcTGXzVLERkh1fEEnB-wkHt4kBrDI","pdfSize":"4864649"}
