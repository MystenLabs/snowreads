Specifically, we analyze which characteristics\nof the balance sheet are critical in order for banking system regulators to\nadequately assess run risk and resilience. By bringing a time series of SVB's\nbalance sheet data to our model, we are able to demonstrate how changes in the\nfunding and respective asset composition made SVB prone to run risk, as they\nwere increasingly relying on held-to-maturity, aka hidden-to-maturity,\naccounting standards, masking revaluation losses in securities portfolios.\nFinally, we formulate a tractable optimisation problem to address the\ndesignation of held-to-maturity assets and quantify banks' ability to hold\nthese assets without resorting to remarking. By calibrating this to SVB's\nbalance sheet data, we shed light on the bank's funding risk and implied risk\ntolerance in the years 2020--22 leading up to its collapse.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
