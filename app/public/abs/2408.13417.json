This\nfluctuation theorem bears experimental relevance, as it enables the\ndetermination of the free energy difference through the measurement of\nexternally applied work in a nonequilibrium process. In the quantum case, the\nJarzynski equality only holds if the measurement procedure of the stochastic\nwork is drastically changed: it is replaced by a so-called two-point\nmeasurement (TPM) scheme that requires the knowledge of the initial and final\nHamiltonian and therefore lacks the predictive power for the free energy\ndifference that the classical Jarzynski equation is known for. Here, we propose\na quantum {{fluctuation theorem}} that is valid for externally measurable\nquantum work determined during the driving protocol. In contrast to the TPM\ncase, the theorem also applies to open quantum systems and the scenario can be\nrealized without knowing the system Hamiltonian. Our fluctuation theorem comes\nin the form of an inequality and therefore only yields bounds to the true free\nenergy difference. The inequality is saturated in the quasiclassical case of\nvanishing energy coherences at the beginning and at the end of the protocol.\nThus, there is a clear quantum disadvantage.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
