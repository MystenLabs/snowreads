Its main task is to estimate treatment effects and make intervention\npolicies. Traditionally, most of the previous works typically focus on the\nbinary treatment setting that there is only one treatment for a unit to adopt\nor not. However, in practice, the treatment can be much more complex,\nencompassing multi-valued, continuous, or bundle options. In this paper, we\nrefer to these as complex treatments and systematically and comprehensively\nreview the causal inference methods for addressing them. First, we formally\nrevisit the problem definition, the basic assumptions, and their possible\nvariations under specific conditions. Second, we sequentially review the\nrelated methods for multi-valued, continuous, and bundled treatment settings.\nIn each situation, we tentatively divide the methods into two categories: those\nconforming to the unconfoundedness assumption and those violating it.\nSubsequently, we discuss the available datasets and open-source codes. Finally,\nwe provide a brief summary of these works and suggest potential directions for\nfuture research.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
