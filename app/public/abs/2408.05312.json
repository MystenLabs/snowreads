An extensive study of Ricci soliton\ninequalities is given in this review article, which also summarizes their\nhistorical evolution, core ideas, important findings, and applications. We\ninvestigate the complex interactions between curvature conditions and geometric\ninequalities as well as the several kinds of Ricci solitons, such as expanding,\nsteady, and shrinking solitons. We also go over current developments,\nunresolved issues, and possible paths for further study in this fascinating\narea.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
