When $k= 2$, efficient algorithms are known to\nconstruct binary orientable sequences, with asymptotically optimal length, by\napplying the classic cycle-joining technique. The key to the construction is\nthe definition of a parent rule to construct a cycle-joining tree of asymmetric\nbracelets. Unfortunately, the parent rule does not generalize to larger\nalphabets. Furthermore, unlike the binary case, a cycle-joining tree does not\nimmediately lead to a simple successor-rule when $k \\geq 3$ unless the tree has\ncertain properties. In this paper, we derive a parent rule to derive a\ncycle-joining tree of $k$-ary asymmetric bracelets. This leads to a successor\nrule that constructs asymptotically optimal $k$-ary orientable sequences in\n$O(n)$ time per symbol using $O(n)$ space. In the special case when $n=2$, we\nprovide a simple construction of $k$-ary orientable sequences of maximal\nlength.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
