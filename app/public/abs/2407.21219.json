The\nstochastic hybrid system (SHS) model is designed to capture the dynamics of the\ninternal states of individual nodes, considering their structural properties,\nand coupling variables under various local and network-level contingencies.\nHidden contingencies are identified using a probing approach that measures\nchanges in the eigenvalues of the SHS model and detects deviations from normal\noperation. Next, contingencies are categorized into three distinct groups\naccording to their impact on MPS: physical contingencies, control network\ncontingencies, and sensing and measurement network contingencies. This\nclassification enables a proactive evaluation of contingencies. The\npracticality and efficacy of the proposed methodology are validated through\nsimulation experiments on the electrical network of two real-world systems.\nThese simulations underscore the approach's capacity to enhance the resilience\nof power systems against a spectrum of hidden contingencies.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nvlRvsamEWoV-GVMb6_MOwXY2hRuMwt1OOBRpEXxu1s","pdfSize":"1719999"}
