Furthermore,\nit characterizes several topological properties of ultrametrizable spaces\nthrough the features of their representing trees. This approach suggests that\ntopological properties of ultrametrizable spaces should be studies via the\nstudy of naturally ordered pruned trees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
