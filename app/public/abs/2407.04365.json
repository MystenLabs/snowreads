This is an extension of our previous work [G. Wang and Z. Cai,\nJ. Chem. Theory Comput., 19, 8523--8540, 2023] by generalizing the application\nof the inchworm method and the technique of modular path integrals from\ndiagonally coupled cases to off-diagonally coupled cases. Additionally, to\nreduce computational and memory cost in long time simulation, we apply\ntensor-train representation to efficiently represent the reduced density matrix\nof the spin chains, and employ the transfer tensor method (TTM) to avoid\nexponential growth of computational cost with respect to time. Abundant\nnumerical experiments are performed to validate our method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
