Although deep learning techniques for image retrieval have\nadvanced significantly, their imperfect real-world performance often\nnecessitates including human expertise. Human-in-the-loop approaches typically\nrely on humans completing the task independently and then combining their\nopinions with an AI model in various ways, as these models offer very little\ninterpretability or \\textit{correctability}. To allow humans to intervene in\nthe AI model instead, thereby saving human time and effort, we adapt the\nConcept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and propose \\texttt{CHAIR}. \\texttt{CHAIR} (a)\nenables humans to correct intermediate concepts, which helps \\textit{improve}\nembeddings generated, and (b) allows for flexible levels of intervention that\naccommodate varying levels of human expertise for better retrieval. To show the\nefficacy of \\texttt{CHAIR}, we demonstrate that our method performs better than\nsimilar models on image retrieval metrics without any external intervention.\nFurthermore, we also showcase how human intervention helps further improve\nretrieval performance, thereby achieving human-AI complementarity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5WIIdq4spU6B_cO9OL3BNRAc_gOKbeQT6eqree8ISMk","pdfSize":"1098478","objectId":"0xe9fffc2f89816efc18f9bc5f845d4858dda31d406afa7a7f48aa40ae21766662","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
