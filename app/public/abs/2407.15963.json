Using this approximation, we numerically investigate the\ninfluence of finite Larmor radius effects on the chaotic transport and the\nformation of transport barriers. For non-monotonic plasma profiles, we show\nthat the twist condition of the system is violated along a curve, usually\ncalled shearless transport barrier, which, under non-equilibrium conditions,\nexhibits significant resilience to destruction, thereby inhibiting chaotic\ntransport. We analyze bifurcation diagrams of the shearless barriers and escape\nrates to explore the impact of the Larmor radius on controlling chaotic\ntransport while varying the amplitude of electrostatic perturbations. Our\nfindings show that increasing the Larmor radius enhances the robustness of\ntransport barriers, as a larger electrostatic perturbation amplitude is\nrequired to disrupt them. Additionally, even in the absence of transport\nbarriers, we observe a decrease in chaotic transport with an increase in the\nLarmor radius.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
