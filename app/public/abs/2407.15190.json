Starting from the Dirac\naction for a spin-$1/2$ fermion in a five-dimensional spacetime governed by\ntorsional $f(T, B)$ gravity, we derive the Dirac equation and we explore its\nsolutions under various non-minimal coupling functions. We examine two\nrealistic forms of the torsional non-minimal coupling and reveal distinct\nbehaviors that impact the localization of both massless and massive fermionic\nmodes on the brane. Additionally, we employ probabilistic measurements,\nincluding Shannon entropy theory, Fisher information theory, and relative\nprobability, to analyze the localization of these fermionic modes. The observed\neffects offer potential insights into probing torsional modifications.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
