For QFT models, while T invariance is necessary\nfor locality, S invariance is not mandatory. S invariance is a form of\ncompleteness of the theory that has a precise meaning as Haag duality for\narbitrary multi-interval regions. We present a mathematical proof as well as\nderive this result from a physical standpoint using Renyi entropies and the\nreplica trick. For rational CFT's, the failure of modular invariance or Haag\nduality can be measured by an index, related to the quantum dimensions of the\nmodel. We show how to compute this index from the modular transformation\nmatrices. The index also appears in a limit of the Renyi mutual informations.\nCases of infinite index are briefly discussed. Part of the argument can be\nextended to higher dimensions, where the lack of completeness can also be\ndiagnosed using the CFT data through the thermal partition function and\nmeasured by an index.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
