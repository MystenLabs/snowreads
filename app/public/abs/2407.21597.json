We predict a persistent\nrealization of nodal magnon-photon polariton, i.e., a polariton without any gap\nsplitting in a thin ferromagnetic insulator film sandwiched by two normal\nmetals, which persistently exists when the ferromagnet is sufficiently thick\n$\\sim 100$~nm. We perform the model calculation beyond the perturbation theory\nusing a classical approach, develop a quantum scheme able to account for the\nOhmic dissipation, and find ultrastrong coupling with coupling strength\ncomparable to the bare magnon frequency. Via revealing a simple conversion\nrelation we extend this formalism to superconductors and predict the gap opened\nby the ultrastrong coupling strongly depends on the direction of polariton\npropagation. Our findings may help search for robust non-Hermitian topological\nphases in magnonic and spintronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"saLslTFNxxxXJXYTWodIecmcAOh3dQtKY9xGxADYQe4","pdfSize":"5283496"}
