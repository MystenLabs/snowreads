Keypoints come with a\nscore permitting to rank them according to their quality. While learned\nkeypoints often exhibit better properties than handcrafted ones, their scores\nare not easily interpretable, making it virtually impossible to compare the\nquality of individual keypoints across methods. We propose a framework that can\nrefine, and at the same time characterize with an interpretable score, the\nkeypoints extracted by any method. Our approach leverages a modified robust\nGaussian Mixture Model fit designed to both reject non-robust keypoints and\nrefine the remaining ones. Our score comprises two components: one relates to\nthe probability of extracting the same keypoint in an image captured from\nanother viewpoint, the other relates to the localization accuracy of the\nkeypoint. These two interpretable components permit a comparison of individual\nkeypoints extracted across different methods. Through extensive experiments we\ndemonstrate that, when applied to popular keypoint detectors, our framework\nconsistently improves the repeatability of keypoints as well as their\nperformance in homography and two/multiple-view pose recovery tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
