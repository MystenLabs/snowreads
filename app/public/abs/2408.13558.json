We address two main problems: the first centers on the\nordered Davenport constant and the second on Gao's constant. We establish a\nconnection between the ordered Davenport constant and the small Davenport\nconstant for a finite non-abelian group of even order, which in turn gives a\nrelation with the Noether number. Additionally, we confirm a conjecture of Gao\nand Li for a non-abelian group of order $2p^{\\alpha}$, where $p$ is a prime.\nFurthermore, we prove a conjecture that connects the ordered Davenport constant\nto the Loewy length for certain classes of finite $2$-groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7kyHDuupgosQWe9xNRTyiL4x5GE9XVwIjVCGoSX2r3Y","pdfSize":"234834"}
