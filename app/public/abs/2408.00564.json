This generalizes the previously known\nresult for complete $\\text{CAT}(0)$ spaces. The generalization involves\nextending the variance inequality known for barycenters in $\\text{CAT}(0)$\nspaces to an inequality analogous to one for $2$-uniformly convex Banach\nspaces, and demonstrating that the barycenter map on such spaces is Lipschitz\ncontinuous on the corresponding Wasserstein 2 space. By utilizing the\ngeneralized Ball extension theorem by Mendel and Naor, we obtain an extension\nresult for Lipschitz maps from Alexandrov spaces of nonnegative curvature into\n$\\text{CAT}(\\kappa)$ spaces whose image is contained in a subspace of\nsufficiently small radius, thereby weakening the curvature assumption in the\nwell-known Lipschitz extension theorem for Alexandrov spaces by Lang and\nSchr\\\"oder.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
