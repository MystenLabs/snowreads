Therefore,\nseveral companies have developed the technology and productions of connected\ncars based on specifications, and connected car patent portfolios have been\nproactively performed. Therefore, this study uses Patent Search System (PSS) to\nfind and analyze the contents of patents for obtaining the innovation reports\nof connected cars according to patents. This study considers the single-factor\nand two-factors to analyze the relationships of annuals, major technology\nleaders, major market leaders, and major technology and applications for\nexploring the patent portfolios of technology leaders and market leaders in\nconnected cars.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
