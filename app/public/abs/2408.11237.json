The majority of existing OOD\ndetection methods predominantly address uni-modal inputs, such as images or\ntexts. In the context of multi-modal documents, there is a notable lack of\nextensive research on the performance of these methods, which have primarily\nbeen developed with a focus on computer vision tasks. We propose a novel\nmethodology termed as attention head masking (AHM) for multi-modal OOD tasks in\ndocument classification systems. Our empirical results demonstrate that the\nproposed AHM method outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches and\nsignificantly decreases the false positive rate (FPR) compared to existing\nsolutions up to 7.5\\%. This methodology generalizes well to multi-modal data,\nsuch as documents, where visual and textual information are modeled under the\nsame Transformer architecture. To address the scarcity of high-quality publicly\navailable document datasets and encourage further research on OOD detection for\ndocuments, we introduce FinanceDocs, a new document AI dataset. Our code and\ndataset are publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
