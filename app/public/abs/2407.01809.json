One important determinant of system\nbehavior and efficiency is the end-effector that comes in direct contact with\nthe crop during harvesting and directly affects harvesting success. Harvesting\navocados poses unique challenges not addressed by existing end-effectors\n(namely, they have uneven surfaces and irregular shapes grow on thick\npeduncles, and have a sturdy calyx attached). The work reported in this paper\ncontributes a new end-effector design suitable for avocado picking. A rigid\nsystem design with a two-stage rotational motion is developed, to first grasp\nthe avocado and then detach it from its peduncle. A force analysis is conducted\nto determine key design parameters. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the\nefficiency of the developed end-effector to pick and apply a moment to an\navocado from a specific viewpoint (as compared to pulling it directly), and\nin-lab experiments show that the end-effector can grasp and retrieve avocados\nwith a 100% success rate.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
