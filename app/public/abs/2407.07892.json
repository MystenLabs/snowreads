(2024) presented an explicit metric describing the\nexterior of a collapsing dust ball within the framework of asymptotically safe\ngravity. Based on this metric, we investigate in detail the properties of the\nquasinormal mode (QNM) spectra for test massless scalar, vector, and Dirac\nfields. We find accurate values for the fundamental QNM frequency and the first\novertones, demonstrating the appearance of a peculiar spiral-like behavior of\nthe overtones compared to the fundamental modes. Additionally, we study black\nhole shadows and show that they align with EHT observations. Finally, we study\nthe grey-body factors and provide explicit lower bound estimates.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
