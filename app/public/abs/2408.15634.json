We consider a large number\nof distinct homogeneous groups of individuals of various sizes, called\nsubpopulations, and focus on the modelling of the changing conditions of their\nmixing along time and of the induced disease transmission. We propose a general\nclass of models in which the 'force of infection' plays a central role, which\nattempts to 'reconcile' the classical modelling approaches in mathematical\nepidemiology, based on compartmental models, with some widely used analysis\nresults (including those by P. van den Driessche and J. Watmough in 2002),\nestablished for apparently less structured systems of nonlinear\nordinary-differential equations. We take special care in explaining the\nmodelling approach in details, and provide analysis results that allow to\ncompute or estimate the value of the basic reproduction number for such general\nperiodic epidemic systems.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
