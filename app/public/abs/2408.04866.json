In the case of network\ndata, the structure is easily visualized by merging and shattering vertices,\nwhile respecting the edge structure. We further develop Bayesian inference\nprocedures for the model family, and apply them to synthetic and real data. The\nfamily provides a connection of practical and theoretical interest between the\nHollywood model of Crane and Dempsey, and the generalized-gamma graphex model\nof Caron and Fox. A key ingredient for the construction of the family is\nfragmentation and coagulation duality for integer partitions, and for this we\ndevelop novel duality relations that generalize those of Pitman and Dong,\nGoldschmidt and Martin. The duality is also crucially used in our inferential\nprocedures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
