Graphs that admit such orientations have been\nused by Kierstead and Trotter (1992), Carbonero, Hompe, Moore, and Spirkl\n(2023), Bria\\'nski, Davies, and Walczak (2024), and Gir\\~ao, Illingworth,\nPowierski, Savery, Scott, Tamitegami, and Tan (2024) to construct graphs with\nlarge chromatic number and small clique number that served as counterexamples\nto various conjectures. Motivated by this, we consider which graphs admit KT\norientations (named after Kierstead and Trotter). In particular, we construct a\ngraph family with small independence number (sublinear in the number of\nvertices) which admits a KT orientation. We show that the problem of\ndetermining whether a given graph admits a KT orientation is NP-complete, even\nif we restrict ourselves to planar graphs. Finally, we provide an algorithm to\ndecide if a graph with maximum degree at most 3 admits a KT orientation,\nwhereas, for graphs with maximum degree 4, the problem remains NP-complete.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
