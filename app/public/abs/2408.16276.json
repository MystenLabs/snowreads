To address these challenges, we\nexplore the use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to augment\npsychological consultation services. Our approach introduces a novel layered\nprompting system that dynamically adapts to user input, enabling comprehensive\nand relevant information gathering. We also develop empathy-driven and\nscenario-based prompts to enhance the LLM's emotional intelligence and\ncontextual understanding in therapeutic settings. We validated our approach\nthrough experiments using a newly collected dataset of psychological\nconsultation dialogues, demonstrating significant improvements in response\nquality. The results highlight the potential of our prompt engineering\ntechniques to enhance AI-driven psychological consultation, offering a scalable\nand accessible solution to meet the growing demand for mental health support.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
