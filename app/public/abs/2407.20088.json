It details a case study of a food product\nmanufacturer that transitioned to a new local information system. 41 units'\ndata (10160 cases) over the pre-maturity phase of the system were then\nstructured into event logs and analyzed. This analysis identified deviant\nprocess paths, questioning whether the new system efficiently supports\nprocurement operations immediately post-implementation. The findings reveal\ncritical implementation risks with conformance-checking of the as-is process\nwith the to-be process model; this includes incomplete cases, unauthorized\nactivities, irregular payment practices, stemming from organizational\nbottlenecks, or violating internal control regulations. Challenges are\nattributed to technical shortcomings in system design and cultural\nmisalignments, necessitating immediate interventions or longer-term cultural\nand training solutions. This study's contribution is its demonstration of a\ntransparent, process-driven approach to system governance, highlighting the\nstrategic benefits of this integration for organizational management.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ekqol26Reb61aVqLU5Y1vEoVlF6a1MeX_hY4NwEjaLE","pdfSize":"848386"}
