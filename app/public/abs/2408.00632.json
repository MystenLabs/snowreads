We also\ndiscuss how these non-perturbative corrections affect polarisation observables\nused to study single top production at the LHC. Finally, we point out that\ngeneric kinematic distributions of leptons from top quark decays are affected\nby linear power corrections, which may have implications for proposals to\nextract the top quark mass from such leptonic observables. On the other hand,\nwe demonstrate that the distribution of the ``out-of-collision-plane''\ncomponent of the positron momentum is free from linear power corrections,\nmaking it an interesting candidate for the top quark mass measurement.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
