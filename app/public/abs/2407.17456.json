Day-to-day drifts in the beam longitudinal\ntrajectory during regular operation are of the order of several degrees. They\nare believed to cause additional losses in both the Linac and the Booster and\nare addressed by empirically adjusting cavity phases of front end and Linac RF\ncavities. This work explores a scheme for expressing these drifts in terms of\nphase shifts in the low-energy part of the Linac. Such a description allows for\na simplified visual representation of the drifts, suggests a clear algorithm\nfor their compensation, and provides a tool for estimating efficiency of such\ncompensation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q4_2u5NCM-01YI4UrxofXPkkfGUoecXTr9MVlOh1f4w","pdfSize":"824032"}
