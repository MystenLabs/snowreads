In this\nwork, we apply the concept of unitary control to manipulate multiport wave\ntransmission. Unitary control aims to control the behaviors of a set of\northogonal waves simultaneously. The approach fully harnesses the capability of\nwavefront shaping techniques, with promising applications in communication,\nimaging, and photonic integrated circuits. Here we present a detailed theory of\nunitary control of wave transmission, focusing on two key characteristics:\ntotal (power) transmittance and direct (field) transmission. The total\ntransmittance for an input port represents the fraction of total transmitted\npower with respect to the input power for wave incident from an input port. The\ndirect transmission for an input port denotes the complex transmission\namplitude from that input port to its corresponding output port. We address two\nmain questions: (i) the achievable total transmittance and direct transmission\nfor each port, and (ii) the configuration of unitary control to attain desired\ntransmission values for each port. Our theory illustrates that unitary control\nenables uniform total transmittance and direct transmission across any medium.\nFurthermore, we show that reciprocity and energy conservation enforce direct\nsymmetry constraints on wave transmission in both forward and backward\ndirections under unitary control.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
