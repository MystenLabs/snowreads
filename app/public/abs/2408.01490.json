For a defect $\\mathscr{D}$ of codimension p, these\nrepresentations (charges) are in one-to-one correspondence with gapped boundary\nconditions for the SymTFT $\\mathcal{Z}(\\mathcal{C})$ on a manifold $Y =\n\\Sigma_{d-p+1} \\times S^{p-1}$, and can be efficiently described through\ndimensional reduction. We explore numerous applications of our construction,\nincluding scenarios where an anomalous bulk theory can host a symmetric defect.\nThis generalizes the connection between 't Hooft anomalies and the absence of\nsymmetric boundary conditions to defects of any codimension. Finally we\ndescribe some properties of surface charges for (3 + 1)d duality symmetries,\nwhich should be relevant to the study of Gukov-Witten operators in gauge\ntheories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CE3m0S6okqvEDkSjI3Km1-ZGVFNgQP7KqdtXRFFZTUs","pdfSize":"500995"}
