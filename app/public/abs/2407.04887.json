For constant $\\epsilon$, this is the first linear-time algorithm for this\nproblem without any restrictions on $\\Delta$ other than the necessary bound\n$\\Delta \\geq 1/\\epsilon$. The best previous result in this direction, very\nrecently obtained by Assadi, gives a randomized algorithm with expected running\ntime $O(m \\, \\log(1/\\epsilon))$ under the assumption $\\Delta \\gg \\log\nn/\\epsilon$; removing the lower bound on $\\Delta$ was explicitly mentioned as a\nchallenging open problem by Bhattacharya, Costa, Panski, and Solomon. Indeed,\neven for edge-coloring with $2\\Delta - 1$ colors (i.e., meeting the \"greedy\"\nbound), no linear-time algorithm covering the full range of $\\Delta$ has been\nknown until now. Additionally, when $\\epsilon = 1/\\Delta$, our result yields an\n$O(m\\,\\Delta^4\\log \\Delta)$-time algorithm for $(\\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring,\nimproving the bound $O(m\\, \\Delta^{17})$ from the authors' earlier work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
