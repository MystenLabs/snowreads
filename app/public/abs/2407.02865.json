The\nelectronic system is described by the Hubbard model with an anti-symmetric\nspin-orbit coupling. The AIAO spin ordered state is formed by arranging\ntetrahedral hedgehog spin-clusters uniformly in the lattice system, where 12\ntypes of spin-clusters are allowed in a unit cell. All spin-cluster\nsusceptibilities are calculated within the random phase approximation with\nrespect to the onsite electron interaction. It is shown that, for the negative\nspin-orbit coupling coefficient, the AIAO spin-cluster susceptibility diverges\nat q=0, while other types of spin-cluster susceptibilities are not developed\nand are structureless. By calculating the superconducting transition mediated\nby AIAO spin fluctuation, it is found that a spin-triplet superconductivity\nappears, while there is no signal of superconducting transition for the\nspin-singlet one. We suggest that the spin-triplet superconductivity appears\naround the AIAO spin ordered phase in the pyrochlore lattice.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
