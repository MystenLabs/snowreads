Another, more daring, approach is to treat an\nintegration theory on this scale from the point of view of the Lebesgue\nintegral, which generalizes the previous perspective. A great tool obtained\nwhen studying the integral of a scale $\\mathbb{T}$ as a Lebesgue integral is\nthe possibility of converting the ``$\\Delta$-integral of $\\mathbb{T}$'' to a\nclassical integral of $\\mathbb{R}$. In this way, we are able to migrate from a\ncalculation that is sometimes not so intuitive to a more friendly calculation.\nA question that arises, then, is whether the same result can be obtained just\nusing the ideas of integration via Riemann sums, without the need to develop\nthe Lebesgue integral for $\\mathbb{T}$. And, in this article, we answer this\nquestion affirmatively: In fact, for integrable functions an analogous result\nis valid by converting a $\\Delta$-integral over $\\mathbb{T}$ to a riemannian\nintegral of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"FTdJrxA8O-lGNXVXX6B_lSvQmAEZTpMVy0924GvdKw8","pdfSize":"329398"}
