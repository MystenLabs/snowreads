The Wiener index of a graph is the sum of\ndistances between all its unordered pairs of vertices. A graph has been\nobtained that contains a vertex achieving the maximum distance among all graphs\non $n$ vertices with fixed number of cut vertices. Further the graphs having\nmaximum Wiener index among all graphs on $n$ vertices with at most $3$ cut\nvertices have been characterised.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
