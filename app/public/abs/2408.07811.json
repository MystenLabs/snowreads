Some properties containing operational\nand integral representation, Laplace transform, fractional calculus operators\nof this family are studied. Also, computing Fourier transform for the new set,\na new family of biorthogonal functions are derived via Parseval's identity. On\nthe other hand, this finite set is modified by adding two new parameters in\norder to have semigroup property and construct fractional calculus operators.\nFurther, integral equation and integral operator are also derived for the\nmodified version.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GwhTFLVmWuwefHQB1ALLsCVsWKxWPZJydvmXemTeYWc","pdfSize":"336760"}
