For graphic\nmatroids, Cunningham [9] provided efficient algorithms for calculating graph\nstrength, and also for determining minimum cost reinforcement to achieve a\ndesired strength. This paper extends this latter problem by focusing on two\noptimal strategies for transforming a matroid into a homogeneous one, by either\nincreasing or decreasing element weights. As an application to graphs, we give\nalgorithms to solve this problem in the context of spanning trees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
