A\nroutine example of such diagnosis in cancerous tissues implies using microscope\nanalysis of fixed, paraffined, and colored slices such as the H&E stain (1).\nSuch a method, which takes place after surgery, is based on carefully analyzing\nthe cell's size and shape. Often, this approach is performed in parallel with\nmore modern genetic tests. Recent research has hypothesized that\nextrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) could be considered a new hallmark of\ncancer (4). Thus, this research aims to check if using a simple, label-free\nmicroscope dynamic analysis performed on living cancer cells would allow\nefficient and simpler detection of cancer cells.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
