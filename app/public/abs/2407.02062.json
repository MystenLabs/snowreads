However, DNNs are prone to\nmiscalibration, which limits their applicability. Moreover, existing methods\nfor calibration and uncertainty estimation are computational expensive. Our\ninvestigation in NER found that data augmentation improves calibration and\nuncertainty in cross-genre and cross-lingual setting, especially in-domain\nsetting. Furthermore, we showed that the calibration for NER tends to be more\neffective when the perplexity of the sentences generated by data augmentation\nis lower, and that increasing the size of the augmentation further improves\ncalibration and uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
