However, most existing image\ntranslation methods treat infrared images as a stylistic variation, neglecting\nthe underlying physical laws, which limits their practical application. To\naddress these issues, we propose a Physics-Informed Diffusion (PID) model for\ntranslating RGB images to infrared images that adhere to physical laws. Our\nmethod leverages the iterative optimization of the diffusion model and\nincorporates strong physical constraints based on prior knowledge of infrared\nlaws during training. This approach enhances the similarity between translated\ninfrared images and the real infrared domain without increasing extra training\nparameters. Experimental results demonstrate that PID significantly outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods.
