Generating light that simultaneously\ncarries high-order orbital angular momenta and exhibits quantum correlations is\na challenging task. In this work, we present a theoretical approach to the\ngeneration of correlated Schmidt modes carrying OAM via parametric\ndown-conversion (PDC) in cascaded nonlinear systems (nonlinear interferometers)\npumped by Laguerre-Gaussian beams. We demonstrate how the number of generated\nmodes and their population can be controlled by varying the pump parameters,\nthe gain of the PDC process and the distance between the crystals. We\ninvestigate the angular displacement sensitivity of these interferometers and\ndemonstrate that it can overcome the classical shot noise limit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
