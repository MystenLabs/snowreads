This is version 2 (v2) of the Catalog\nthat has been made as the default version as of May 1, 2024. The new features\nof the Catalog v2 are (i) online measurement tool, (ii) combination JavaScript\nmovies from the STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) missions, and (iii)\ninsertion of newly identified CMEs for the period 1996 to 2004. The CME\nidentification was revisited resulting in a set of $\\sim$3000 new CMEs added to\nthe Catalog. A vast majority of these CMEs are weak and narrow. The resulting\nstatistical properties of CMEs are not significantly different from those\nreported using version 1.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OoxI7MP5pmWVmLLWnqFLtvAuvbT3GAoHvmzl5Z-pxr0","pdfSize":"2021462"}
