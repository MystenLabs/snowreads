By thoroughly and accurately modeling this information, it can\nbe utilized in various intelligent speech applications, such as speaker\nrecognition, speaker diarization, speech synthesis, and target speaker\nextraction. In this article, we aim to present, from a unique perspective, the\ndevelopmental history, paradigm shifts, and application domains of speaker\nmodeling technologies within the context of deep representation learning\nframework. This review is designed to provide a clear reference for researchers\nin the speaker modeling field, as well as for those who wish to apply speaker\nmodeling techniques to specific downstream tasks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
