For two variables, we show that this problem can be\nreduced to determining the cyclicity of a single polynomial and obtain partial\nresults for more than two variables. We proceed to examine the maximal domain,\ni.e., the set of all points for which the evaluation functional is continuous.\nWhen $\\mathcal{X}$ is metrizable, we show that the maximal domain must be an\n$F_\\sigma$ set, and then construct Hilbert function spaces on the unit disk\nwhose maximal domain is the disk plus an arbitrary subset of the boundary that\nis both $F_\\sigma$ and $G_\\delta$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
