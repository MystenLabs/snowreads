Upon the use of a less conventional mineralizer\nspecies, SiO$_2$, we show the stabilization of spiroffite-type\nCo$_2$Te$_3$O$_8$ under less forceful hydrothermal conditions than in previous\nreports. When synthesized in the presence of both SiO$_2$ and each respective\nalkali carbonate as a secondary mineralizer, silicon substitution in place of\ntellurium in the host structure becomes apparent, and the corresponding\nintroduced disorder gives rise to enhanced low-temperature ferromagnetism. Our\nresults highlight the complexities of underutilized and combined mineralizer\nspecies in the stabilization and tuning of complex magnetic ground states via\nhydrothermal synthesis techniques.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fz1kF_OfAd3jCNwCbJKRE3u8rQIijYl9xXazbz96qJM","pdfSize":"20793170"}
