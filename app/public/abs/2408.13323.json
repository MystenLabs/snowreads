In the optimistic setting, we construct a\nlifted, alternative formulation that exhibits desirable stability properties\nunder mild assumptions that neither invoke convexity nor smoothness. The upper-\nand lower-level problems might involve integer restrictions and disjunctive\nconstraints. In a range of results, we at most invoke pointwise and local\ncalmness for the lower-level problem in a sense that holds broadly. The\nalternative formulation is computationally attractive with structural\nproperties being brought out and an outer approximation algorithm becoming\navailable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
