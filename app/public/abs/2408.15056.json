In particular, we\nconsider the bounds related to special relativity, relativistic kinetic theory\nand conformality. The low density hadronic phase is described by a\nstate-of-the-art microscopic relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. This\nwork aims to access the effect of the different speed of sound constraints on\nthe relevant parameter space of the key parameters of first-order phase\ntransitions by utilising recent astronomical data. This involves a systematic\nanalysis that also includes two distinct schemes for the construction of hybrid\nmodels, namely the Maxwell and Gibbs methods. Finally, a relevant discussion is\nconducted on the possible occurrence of a thermodynamic inconsistency that is\nrelated to the stability of the high density phase over hadronic matter at\nlarge densities.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
