In nonlinear substrates such as optical fibers or\nsemiconductors, these dynamics can widely vary depending on each optical input\nencoded with information to process and are in general difficult to estimate.\nThus, other approaches are required to optimize the schemes. Using a\nfrequency-multiplexed fiber-based Extreme Learning Machine as an example for a\nclassification task, I use Shannon entropy for optical power and introduce\nShannon entropy for optical phase and spectrum, all averaged only over a small\nsubset of the dataset to process. I show that the maximum and upper moderate\noptical power and phase entropies relate to the best data-processing capability\nof the Machine and, thus, can be used to find optimal system parameters such as\nfiber length, input power, and group-velocity dispersion in a more\ntime-efficient manner than running numerical simulations emulating the scheme.\nShannon entropy of the spectrum provides the information for what parameter\nspace broadest possible frequency combs can be expected and is interesting from\nthe perspective of frequency comb and supercontinuum generation. The introduced\nentropies are general and can be easily applied to describe and optimize other\nneuromorphic-photonic or nonlinear-optics schemes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UYUHh7FvW19ecbB4JR3znj9zcvK_7qCW3VrU6_CMVKM","pdfSize":"3865756"}
