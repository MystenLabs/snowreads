Attempts to\nincorporate Persistent homology in machine learning methods of protein function\nprediction have resulted in several techniques for vectorizing persistent\ndiagrams. However, current vectorization methods are excessively artificial and\ncannot ensure the effective utilization of information or the rationality of\nthe methods. To address this problem, we propose a more geometrical\nvectorization method of persistent diagrams based on maximal margin\nclassification for Banach space, and additionaly propose a framework that\nutilizes topological data analysis to identify proteins with specific\nfunctions. We evaluated our vectorization method using a binary classification\ntask on proteins and compared it with the statistical methods that exhibit the\nbest performance among thirteen commonly used vectorization methods. The\nexperimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the statistical\nmethods in both robustness and precision.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
