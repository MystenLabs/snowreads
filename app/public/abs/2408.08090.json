To consider this,\n3GPP introduces the UV-plane beam mapping for system-level simulations of\nnon-terrestrial networks (NTNs). This paper aims to provide a comprehensive\nunderstanding of how beams and user equipments (UEs) are placed on the UV-plane\nand subsequently mapped to the Earth's surface. We present a general process of\nprojecting UEs on the UV-plane onto the Earth's surface. This process could\noffer a useful guideline for beam and UE deployment when evaluating the\nsystem-level performance of NTNs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
