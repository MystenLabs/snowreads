We phrase his result in a relative categorical setting based on\nN-complexes instead of classical 2-complexes. The role of Cohen-Macaulay\nmodules is played by chains of monics in a Frobenius subcategory of an exact\ncategory. As a byproduct, we provide foundational results on derived categories\nof N-complexes over exact categories known from the Abelian case or for\n2-complexes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
