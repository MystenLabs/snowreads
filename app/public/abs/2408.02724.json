Using a 2+1D version\nof anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC\nsymmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks\ndemonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci\nanyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches,\nproviding a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems,\nrevealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E8pt_Eya3PBSD8Uj7OkHAZaHmTRo99D0xg9NqfPUcRk","pdfSize":"987339","txDigest":"BzCXAUtENjUfwXAUmjY371ytu818NHUzqWYEEw1mVYLN","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
