Several\nresearchers have extended the framework by combining it with other theories of\nuncertainty, such as fuzzy set theory, intuitionistic fuzzy soft set theory,\nrough soft set theory, and so on. These enhancements aim to increase the\napplicability and expressiveness of soft set theory, making it a more robust\ntool for dealing with complex, real-world problems characterized by uncertainty\nand vagueness. The notion of fuzzy soft sets and their associated operations\nwere introduced by Maji et al. \\cite{7}. However, Molodtsov \\cite{3} identified\nnumerous incorrect results and notions of soft set theory that were introduced\nin the paper \\cite{7}. Therefore, the derived concept of fuzzy soft sets is\nequally incorrect since the basic idea of soft sets in \\cite{7} is flawed.\nConsequently, it is essential to address these incorrect notions and provide an\nexact and formal definition of the idea of fuzzy soft sets. This reevaluation\nis important to guarantee fuzzy soft set theory's theoretical stability and\npractical application across a range of domains. In this paper, we propose\nfuzzy soft set theory based on Molodtsov's correct notion of soft set theory\nand demonstrate a fuzzy soft set in matrix form. Additionally, we derive\nseveral significant findings on fuzzy soft sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
