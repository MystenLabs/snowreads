However, deploying\nLLMs on edge devices poses several challenges with respect to memory, energy,\nand compute costs, limiting their widespread use in devices such as mobile\nphones. A promising solution is to reduce the number of bits used to represent\nweights and activations. While existing works have found partial success at\nquantizing LLMs to lower bitwidths, e.g. 4-bit weights, quantizing activations\nbeyond 16 bits often leads to large computational overheads due to poor\non-device quantization support, or a considerable accuracy drop. Yet, 8-bit\nactivations are very attractive for on-device deployment as they would enable\nLLMs to fully exploit mobile-friendly hardware, e.g. Neural Processing Units\n(NPUs). In this work, we make a first attempt to facilitate the on-device\ndeployment of LLMs using integer-only quantization. We first investigate the\nlimitations of existing quantization methods for on-device deployment, with a\nspecial focus on activation quantization. We then address these limitations by\nintroducing a simple post-training quantization method, named MobileQuant, that\nextends previous weight equivalent transformation works by jointly optimizing\nthe weight transformation and activation range parameters in an end-to-end\nmanner. MobileQuant demonstrates superior capabilities over existing methods by\n1) achieving near-lossless quantization on a wide range of LLM benchmarks, 2)\nreducing latency and energy consumption by 20\\%-50\\% compared to current\non-device quantization strategies, 3) requiring limited compute budget, 4)\nbeing compatible with mobile-friendly compute units, e.g. NPU.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"67PsQsm6LCNFNOmMX5Oc3EjKzMIcw0i1WflpmOIUfAc","pdfSize":"437486"}
