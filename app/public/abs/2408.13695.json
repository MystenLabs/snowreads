We considered the\nLang-Trotter conjecture for curves of genus 2, and obtained a similar result to\nthe Lang-Trotter conjecture on average for the family of curves\n$C_{\\lambda}:y^2=x(x-1)(x+1)(x-{\\lambda})(x-1/ \\lambda)$. Such curves are\ncharacterized as curves of genus two with reduced automorphism group containing\nthe Klein $4$-group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
