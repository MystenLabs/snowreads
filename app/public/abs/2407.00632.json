As these\ntasks become increasingly complex, effective communication and collaboration\namong multiple robots become imperative to ensure successful completion. In\nrecent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable\ncomprehension and planning abilities in the context of embodied agents.\nHowever, their application in household scenarios, specifically in the use of\nmultiple agents collaborating to complete complex navigation tasks through\ncommunication, remains unexplored. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework\nfor decentralized multi-agent navigation, leveraging LLM-enabled communication\nand collaboration. By designing the communication-triggered dynamic leadership\norganization structure, we achieve faster team consensus with fewer\ncommunication instances, leading to better navigation effectiveness and\ncollaborative exploration efficiency. With the proposed novel communication\nscheme, our framework promises to be conflict-free and robust in multi-object\nnavigation tasks, even when there is a surge in team size.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
