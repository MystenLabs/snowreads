Therefore, in this study,\nwe conducted a correlation analysis between the six cultural scales of Hofstede\net al. [1] and the 10 ageism scales calculated from data on 35,232 people from\n31 countries included in the World Values Survey Wave 6 by Inglehart et al.\n[2]. The results of a partial correlation analysis controlling for economic and\ndemographic factors showed that the cultural scales were correlated with\nageism. This is the first study to show that diverse cultural scales are\nrelated to multiple dimensions of ageism.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
