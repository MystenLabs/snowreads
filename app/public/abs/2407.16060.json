Using the colour-colour diagram, we found a region with a high\nconcentration of established PNe and PPNe, comprising about 95% of the objects.\nBased on this, we identified 67 objects within this region that lack definitive\nclassification in existing literature, suggesting they are promising\ncandidates. We conducted Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) analysis and\nmorphological investigations using imagery from various observatories and\nsatellites. Finally, we present a list of 65 potential PNe and PPNe candidates.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"opPw9AW_s2KNA9OiO14z6wl6MzjJkGxkbBbNgA283oU","pdfSize":"5314410","objectId":"0x8600e4181d1e7a79fb15cfa7376320c2a46935ea07262d5479056aaad7a7509b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
