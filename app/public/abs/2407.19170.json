Based on this theorem we derive loop equations for the\nGaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) partition function. We show that the GUE\npartition function is equal to part of the topological partition function of\nthe non-linear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) Frobenius manifold.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
