We explain how knowledge graph embeddings can be used to\napproximate probabilistic inference efficiently using the example of\nStatistical EL (SEL), a statistical extension of the lightweight Description\nLogic EL. We provide proofs for runtime and soundness guarantees, and\nempirically evaluate the runtime and approximation quality of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
