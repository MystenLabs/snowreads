We prove that the second cohomology\nspace is vanishing for $n \\geq 3$ and show that $\\dim(H^2(\\mathfrak{sch}_2,\n\\mathfrak{sch}_2)) =2.$ Moreover, we investigate the factor algebra of the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger algebra by its center and determine the second cohomology group\nof this factor algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
