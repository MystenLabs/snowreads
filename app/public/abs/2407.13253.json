In this paper, we present a systematic approach for applying the\nleast-squares functional error estimator to linear and nonlinear problems that\nare not solved by the least-squares finite element methods. For the case of an\nelliptic PDE solved by the standard conforming finite element method, we\nminimize the least-squares functional with conforming approximation inserted to\nrecover the other physical meaningful variable. By combining the numerical\napproximation from the original method with the auxiliary recovery\napproximation, we construct the least-squares functional a posteriori error\nestimator. Furthermore, we introduce a new interpretation that views the\nnon-intrusive least-squares functional error estimator as an estimator for the\ncombined solve-recover process. This simplifies the reliability and efficiency\nanalysis. We extend the idea to a model nonlinear problem. Plain convergence\nresults are proved for adaptive algorithms of the general second order elliptic\nequation and a model nonlinear problem with the non-intrusive least-squares\nfunctional a posteriori error estimators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
