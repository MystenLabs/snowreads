We revisit the original vision of the Web as\na hypermedia system that supports document composability and application\ninteroperability via name-based data access. We propose the use of secure web\nobjects (SWO), a data-oriented communication approach that can reduce\ncomplexity, centrality, and inefficiency, particularly for collaborative and\nlocal-first applications, such as the Metaverse and other collaborative\napplications. SWO are named, signed, application-defined objects that are\nsecured independently of their containers or communications channels, an\napproach that leverages the results from over a decade-long data-centric\nnetworking research. This approach does not require intermediation by\naggregators of identity, storage, and other services that are common today. We\npresent a brief design overview, illustrated through prototypes for two editors\nof shared hypermedia documents: one for 3D and one for LaTeX. We also discuss\nour findings and suggest a roadmap for future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
