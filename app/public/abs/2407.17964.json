The solution to the problem is characterized by the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system, which we formulate using a strong variational\nformulation of the state equation and a super weak formulation of the adjoined\nstate equation. This allows us to propose a preconditioner that is robust both\nin the regularization and the diffusion parameter. In order to discretize the\nproblem, we use Isogeometric Analysis since it allows the construction of\nsufficiently smooth basis functions effortlessly. To realize the\npreconditioner, one has to solve a problem over the whole space time cylinder\nthat is elliptic with respect to certain non-standard norms. Using a fast\ndiagonalization approach in time, we reformulate the problem as a collection of\nelliptic problems in space only. These problems are not only smaller, but our\napproach also allows to solve them in a time-parallel way. We show the\nefficiency of the preconditioner by rigorous analysis and illustrate it with\nnumerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
