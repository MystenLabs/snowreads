The\ntwo main theories are based on a continuous random network and on a\n`paracrystalline' model, respectively -- the latter being defined as showing\nlocalized structural order resembling the crystalline state whilst retaining an\noverall amorphous network. However, the extent of this local order has been\nunclear, and experimental data have led to conflicting interpretations. Here we\nshow that signatures of paracrystallinity in an otherwise disordered network\nare indeed compatible with the existing body of experimental observations for\na-Si. We use quantum-mechanically accurate, machine-learning-driven simulations\nto systematically sample the configurational space of quenched a-Si, thereby\nallowing us to elucidate the boundary between amorphization and\ncrystallization. We analyze our dataset using structural and local-energy\ndescriptors to show that paracrystalline models are consistent with experiments\nin both regards. Our work provides a unified explanation for seemingly\nconflicting theories in one of the most widely studied amorphous networks.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
