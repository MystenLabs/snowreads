We\nargue that in general, the model is not identifiable. We give an elegant\nnon-constructive proof that the model is identifiable if the shift parameter is\nbounded by a known value. However, we argue that the generalized maximum\nlikelihood estimator is inconsistent even if the shift parameter is bounded and\nthe shift and scale parameters are independent. The mixing distribution,\nhowever, is identifiable if we have more than one observations per any\nrealization of the latent shift and scale.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
