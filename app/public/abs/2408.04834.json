Such\nhomogeneity suggests the dark and stellar components must somehow compensate\nfor each other in order to produce such regular mass structures. We test the\nconspiracy using a sample of 22 galaxies from the `Middle Ages Galaxy\nProperties with Integral field spectroscopy' (MAGPI) Survey that targets\nmassive galaxies at $ z \\sim 0.3$. We use resolved, 2D stellar kinematics with\nthe Schwarzschild orbit-based modelling technique to recover intrinsic mass\nstructures, shapes, and dark matter fractions. This work is the first\nimplementation of the Schwarzschild modelling method on a sample of galaxies at\na cosmologically significant redshift. We find that the variability of\nstructure for combined mass (baryonic and dark) density profiles is greater\nthan that of the stellar components alone. Furthermore, we find no significant\ncorrelation between enclosed dark matter fractions at the half-light radius and\nthe stellar mass density structure. Rather, the total density profile slope,\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, strongly correlates with the dark matter fraction\nwithin the half-light radius, as $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}} = (1.3 \\pm 0.2)\nf_{\\mathrm{DM}} - (2.44 \\pm 0.04)$. Our results refute the bulge-halo\nconspiracy and suggest that stochastic processes dominate in the assembly of\nstructure for massive galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ILdKlpSvmhf5elY5Xqn_0QJh9PAJVGyr-t2-ZnJKOsk","pdfSize":"15926493"}
