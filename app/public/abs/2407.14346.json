Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture\nnuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to\nenhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals\nderived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online\ncache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in\nreal-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and\nexplanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated\nthrough a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and\ngenerative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free\nmodels. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we\nintroduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model\nrobustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference.\nExtensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach\nsubstantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing\non a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant\nimprovements in user engagement and revenue.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
