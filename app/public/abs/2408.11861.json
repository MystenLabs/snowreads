Nevertheless, the\nprimary hurdle that persists is related to the quality of accessible\nmulti-modal healthcare data in conjunction with the evolution of AI\nmethodologies. This study delves into the adoption of large language models to\naddress specific challenges, specifically, the standardization of healthcare\ndata. We advocate the use of these models to identify and map clinical data\nschemas to established data standard attributes, such as the Fast Healthcare\nInteroperability Resources. Our results illustrate that employing large\nlanguage models significantly diminishes the necessity for manual data curation\nand elevates the efficacy of the data standardization process. Consequently,\nthe proposed methodology has the propensity to expedite the integration of AI\nin healthcare, ameliorate the quality of patient care, whilst minimizing the\ntime and financial resources necessary for the preparation of data for AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
