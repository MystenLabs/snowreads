The two\nmodels are important as they set lower and upper bounds on the capacity region\nfor any other decoherence model. The paper's contributions are to characterize\nthe switch capacity region for both decoherence models and to propose\nthroughput-optimal policies based on gradient descent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
