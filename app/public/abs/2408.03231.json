First, we show that invariant spectrahedra admit an\nequivariant spectrahedral description, i.e., can be described by an equivariant\nlinear matrix inequality. Second, we show that the bijection induced by\nKostant's Convexity Theorem between convex subsets invariant under a polar\nrepresentation and convex subsets of a section invariant under the Weyl group\npreserves the classes of convex semi-algebraic sets, spectrahedral shadows, and\nrigidly convex sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
