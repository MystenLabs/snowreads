To calculate the necessary torque from these flywheels, a controller\nwas designed. Using newly derived equations of motion for the system, an\nexpression to optimise the gains was produced. With this controller,\nsimulations were run to evaluate the largest causes of error in target\npointing. Disturbance torques were safely handled by the controller, but led to\na 12% increase in wheel speeds, reaching 8325 rpm. This higher speed led to an\nincreased gyroscopic torque, reaching 10^-7 Nm in the worst case. However since\nthe flywheels can deliver 10^-5 Nm of torque, the controller could also correct\nfor this. Hardware performance was then varied to assess the effect of each\ncomponent on pointing accuracy. Attitude sensor noise was found to increase\npointing error by 1.9 degrees in the worst case. Minimum performance\nrequirements were then determined for each component in order to maintain an\nacceptable pointing accuracy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"chQjQ9AimHZqUdv2DDLILm68oDuj1yx0xot3aktdha4","pdfSize":"7515176"}
