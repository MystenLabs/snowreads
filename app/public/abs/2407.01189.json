Methods: The proposed patch antenna array utilizes\nthe MRI bore's RF shield as a functional component to enhance the RF magnetic\nfield ($B_1^+$) distribution. Numerical simulations were conducted to compare\nthe performance of the patch antenna array to bore-integrated stripline and\nlocal dipole arrays. A decoupling structure was implemented to minimize\ncoupling between adjacent patch antennas. The performance of the patch array\nwas evaluated experimentally. Results: The proposed patch array provides 3.9\ntimes higher averaged transmit (Tx) efficiency in the CP mode and 3.0 times\nhigher for the phase shimming regime versus the bore-integrated stripline\narray. Conclusion: Compared to the stripline array, the bore-integrated patch\nantenna array offers significant improvements in Tx efficiency for whole-body\nUHF MRI. Significance: The findings support the feasibility of integrating\narrays into the RF shield of MRI scanners. This could broaden the clinical use\nof UHF body MRI technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
