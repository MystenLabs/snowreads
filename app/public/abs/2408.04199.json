Generalizing a classic result due to\nZabrodin, the boundary dual of the free massive bulk theory is explicitly\nderived. Introducing perturbative interactions, the Wittens diagrams for the\ntwo-point and three-point correlators are computed for generic scaling\ndimensions at one-loop and tree level respectively. The answers obtained\ndemonstrate how $p$-adic AdS/CFT on the Tate curve provides a useful toy model\nfor real CFTs at finite temperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
