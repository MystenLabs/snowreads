A ring is\ndescribed as a continuous Gaussian polymer with a tangential active force of a\nconstant density along its contour. The linear but non-Hermitian equation of\nmotion is solved using an eigenfunction expansion, which yields\nactivity-independent, but shear-rate-dependent, relaxation times and\nactivity-dependent frequencies. As a consequence, the ring's stationary-state\nproperties are independent of activity, and its conformations as well as\nrheological properties are equal to those of a passive ring under shear. The\npresence of characteristic time scales by the relaxation and the frequency\ngives rise to a particular dynamical behavior. A tank-treading-like motion\nemerges for large relaxation times and high frequencies, specifically for\nstiffer rings, governed by the activity-dependent frequencies. In the case of\nvery flexible polymers, the relaxation behavior dominates over tank-treading.\nShear strongly affects the crossover from a tank-treading to a relaxation-time\ndominated dynamics and suppresses tank-treading. This is reflected in the\ntumbling frequency, which exhibits two shear-rate dependent regimes, with an\nactivity-dependent plateau at low shear rates followed by a power-law regime\nwith increasing tumbling frequency for large shear rates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
