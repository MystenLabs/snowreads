To extract encoded knowledge without (potentially) biased human\nlabels, unsupervised probing techniques like Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS)\nhave been developed (Burns et al., 2022). However, salient but unrelated\nfeatures in a given dataset can mislead these probes (Farquhar et al., 2023).\nAddressing this, we propose a cluster normalization method to minimize the\nimpact of such features by clustering and normalizing activations of contrast\npairs before applying unsupervised probing techniques. While this approach does\nnot address the issue of differentiating between knowledge in general and\nsimulated knowledge - a major issue in the literature of latent knowledge\nelicitation (Christiano et al., 2021) - it significantly improves the ability\nof unsupervised probes to identify the intended knowledge amidst distractions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
