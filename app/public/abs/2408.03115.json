Herein we report the chirality-dependent Floquet engineering on\ntopological fermions with the high Chern number in chiral crystal CoSi via\ncircularly polarized light (CPL) pumping. Intense light pumping does not\ncompromise the gapless nature of topological fermions in CoSi, but displaces\nthe crossing points in momentum space along the direction of light propagation.\nThe Floquet chirality index is proposed to signify the interplay between the\nchiralities of topological fermion, crystal, and incident light, which\ndetermines the amplitudes and directions of light-induced momentum shifts.\nRegarding the time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by the CPL pumping,\nmomentum shifts of topological fermions result in the birth of transient\nanomalous Hall signals in non-magnetic CoSi within an ultrafast time scale,\nwhich Mid-infrared (IR) pumping and terahertz (THz) Kerr or Faraday probe\nspectroscopy could experimentally detect. Our findings provide insights into\nexploring novel applications in optoelectronic devices by leveraging the degree\nof freedom of chirality in the non-equilibrium regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
