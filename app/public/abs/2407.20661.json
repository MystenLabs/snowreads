However, it\nis unclear whether some shares can be distributed before a secret is given in\nthe ramp quantum secret sharing schemes with the highest coding rate. In this\npaper, we propose methods to distribute some shares before a secret is given in\nthose schemes, then we prove that our new encoding procedures retain the\ncorrespondences between quantum secrets and quantum shares in the original\nschemes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
