We define an intrinsic notion of directional Banach\nfunction spaces, generalizing matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces. Moreover, we\nprove an extrapolation theorem for these spaces based on the boundedness of the\nconvex-set valued maximal operator. We also provide bounds and equivalences\nrelated to the convex body sparse operator. Finally, we introduce a weak-type\nanalogue of directional Banach function spaces. In particular, we show that the\nweak-type boundedness of the convex-set valued maximal operator on matrix\nweighted Lebesgue spaces is equivalent to the matrix Muckenhoupt condition,\nwith equivalent constants.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
