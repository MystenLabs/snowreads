Thus,\ngrowing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in distribution networks (DN) is\npredicted. Impact analyzes must be performed to determine if mitigation means\nare needed to accommodate a large quantity of EVs in the DN. Furthermore, the\nhabits of the local population resulting in different EVs charging patterns\nneeds to be realistically considered. This article proposed an individual\nresidential EVs multi-charging algorithm based on the observed charging\nbehavior of 500 measured residential EVs located in a large North American\nutility. Probability functions are derived from the analysis of these charging\npatterns. These can be used to model daily charging profiles of individual EV\nto assess, in a quasi-static time-series perspective, their impact either on a\nsingle costumer or a whole DN. An impact evaluation study is also presented.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
