We show that while the measurement-induced phase transition and\nits properties appear to be broadly insensitive to lack of integrability and\nbreaking of the $\\mathbb{Z_2}$ symmetry, a modification of the measurement\nbasis from the transverse to the longitudinal direction makes the phase\ntransition disappear altogether.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
