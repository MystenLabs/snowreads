The\napplication of machine learning, particularly that of deep learning models, has\ngained significant traction due to its ability to rapidly recognize patterns in\nlarge datasets, thereby offering numerous possibilities for personalization.\nThese models use embeddings to map discrete information, such as product IDs,\ninto a latent vector space, a method increasingly popular in recent years.\nHowever, e-commerce's dynamic nature, characterized by frequent new product\nintroductions, poses challenges for these embeddings, which typically require\nfixed dimensions and inputs, leading to the need for periodic retraining from\nscratch. This paper introduces a modular algorithm that extends embedding input\nsize while preserving learned knowledge, addressing the challenges posed by\ne-commerce's dynamism. The proposed algorithm also incorporates strategies to\nmitigate the cold start problem associated with new products. The results of\ninitial experiments suggest that this method outperforms traditional\nembeddings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
