Our findings reveal that under\nvertical confinement, the flow exhibits a unique mixed-dimensional (or 2.5D)\nstate, where large-scale two-dimensional and small-scale three-dimensional\nstructures coexist. This transition from three-dimensional turbulence near the\ninlet to two-dimensional dynamics downstream is dictated by the level of\nconfinement: weak confinement guarantees turbulence to remain\nthree-dimensional, whereas strong confinement forces the transition to\ntwo-dimensions; the mixed-dimensional state is observed for moderate\nconfinement and it emerges as soon as flow scales are larger than the vertical\nlength. In this scenario, we observed that the mixed-dimensional state is an\noverall more energetic state and it shows a multi-cascade process, where the\ndirect cascade of energy at small scales and the direct cascade of enstrophy at\nlarge scales coexist. The results provide insights into the complex dynamics of\nconfined turbulent flows, relevant in both natural and industrial settings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
