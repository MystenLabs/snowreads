Because\npreferences vary across different applications, numerous measures provide ways\nto reflect the complexity of a model with a numeric score. However, this\nabundance of different complexity measures makes it difficult to select one for\nanalysis. Furthermore, most complexity measures are defined for BPMN or EPC,\nbut not for workflow nets.\n  This paper is an extended analysis of complexity measures and their formal\nproperties. It adapts existing complexity measures to the world of workflow\nnets. It then compares these measures with a set of properties originally\ndefined for software complexity, as well as new extensions to it. We discuss\nthe importance of the properties in theory by evaluating whether matured\ncomplexity measures should fulfill them or whether they are optional. We find\nthat not all inspected properties are mandatory, but also demonstrate that the\nbehavior of evolutionary process discovery algorithms is influenced by some of\nthese properties. Our findings help analysts to choose the right complexity\nmeasure for their use-case.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XFb1eZIkkbn48516WpiLxvEHWrQ6PChi4beDG8pUu7Y","pdfSize":"782516"}
