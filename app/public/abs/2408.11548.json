Covering $359^\\circ\n\\leq l \\leq 1^\\circ$ and $|b| \\leq 0.5^\\circ$ with an angular resolution of 19\narcsec, velocity resolution of 1 km s$^{-1}$, and rms $T_A^* = 0.59$ K at these\nresolutions, our observations unveil the complex structure of the CMZ molecular\ngas in improved detail. Complemented by the $^{12}$CO CHIMPS2 data, we estimate\na median optical depth of $\\tau_{13} = 0.087$. The preliminary analysis yields\na median $^{13}$CO column density range equal to $N(^{13}\\text{CO})= 2$--$5\n\\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, median H$_2$ column density equal to $N(\\text{H}_2)=\n4 \\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $1 \\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.\n  We derive $N(\\text{H}_2)$-based total mass estimates of $M(\\text{H}_2)=\n2$--$6 \\times 10^7\\, M_{\\odot}$, in agreement with previous studies. We analyze\nthe relationship between the integrated intensity of $^{13}$CO and the surface\ndensity of compact sources identified by Herschel Hi-GAL, and find that younger\nHi-GAL sources detected at 500 $\\mu$m but not at 70 $\\mu$m follow the dense gas\nof the CMZ more closely than those that are bright at 70 $\\mu$m. The latter,\nactively star-forming sources, appear to be more associated with material in\nthe foreground spiral arms.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
