As an implication, we completely affirm all the conjectural Lucas\ncongruences that were recently posed by Cooper and reinterpret a number of\nknown results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8Ass34iRpxHPy_WpyQtnGUnCzyrhkaK-hDUGyKDtT88","pdfSize":"151206"}
