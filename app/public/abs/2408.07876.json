Recently, it was shown that\nwhen active noise at the microscopic level is included in the classical theory\nof nucleation and growth then this does not cause the breakdown of detailed\nbalance at the \\textit{macroscopic} level provided that the droplet radius is\nthe only collective coordinate. Here, we present a simple model for active LLPS\nin a confining environment, with the droplet location in a confining potential\nas a second collective coordinate, and find that detailed balance \\textit{is}\nbroken at the macroscopic level in an unusual fashion, using the\nFluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as a diagnostic.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oQAaMlIoiGJqz8LetLYWD1eHUb8fYf4OWfSVdikCzu8","pdfSize":"841318"}
