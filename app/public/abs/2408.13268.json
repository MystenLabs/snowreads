In\nparticular, Maxwell's equation for the curl of the magnetic field contains both\nthe steady current and a term depending upon the temporal derivative of the\nelectric displacement field. The latter is referred to as displacement current,\nand is generally believed to have been included originally by Maxwell himself,\nalthough there is evidence it was earlier considered by Kirchhoff. Maxwell's\nequations and Kirchoff's circuit laws both are important over the wide range of\nfrequencies with which electronics traditionally deals. And, displacement\ncurrent is an important contribution to these in both classical and quantum\nmechanics. Here, the development of displacement current, its importance in\nboth classical and quantum mechanics, and some applications are provided to\nillustrate the fundamental role that it plays in the dynamics of a wide range\nof systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cXqtTuCk4UZaSPRDEWWDQiDCjvyWVgAGAAWLtU99XIM","pdfSize":"1102238"}
