We present a study of six consecutive eclipses of PSR J0024-7204O in\nthe globular cluster 47 Tucanae as seen by the MeerKAT radio telescope in the\nUHF (544-1088 MHz) band. A high scintillation state boosted the signal during\none of the orbits and allowed a detailed study of the eclipse properties. We\nmeasure significant dispersion measure (DM) variations and detect strong\nscattering that seems to be the dominating mechanism of the eclipses at these\nfrequencies. A complete drop in the linear polarization together with a small\nincrease in the rotation measure suggests the presence of a magnetic field of\n$\\sim 2$ mG. The study of multiple eclipses allowed us to measure difference in\nthe lengths of the eclipses and DM differences of $\\sim 0.01$ pc cm$^{-3}$ in\nconsecutive orbits. One orbit in particular shows a delay in recovery of the\nlinear polarization and a visible delay in the arrival of the pulses caused by\na stronger scattering event. We suggest that these are caused by a higher\nvariance of density fluctuations during the event.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
