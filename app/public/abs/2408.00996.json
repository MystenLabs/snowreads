This paper presents IncidentNet - a novel approach for classifying,\nlocalizing, and estimating the severity of traffic incidents using deep\nlearning models trained on data captured from sparsely placed sensors in urban\nenvironments. Our model works on microscopic traffic data that can be collected\nusing cameras installed at traffic intersections. Due to the unavailability of\ndatasets that provide microscopic traffic details and traffic incident details\nsimultaneously, we also present a methodology to generate a synthetic\nmicroscopic traffic dataset that matches given macroscopic traffic data.\nIncidentNet achieves a traffic incident detection rate of 98%, with false alarm\nrates of less than 7% in 197 seconds on average in urban environments with\ncameras on less than 20% of the traffic intersections.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
