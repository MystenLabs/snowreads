Our architecture aims to learn effective\nrepresentations at many scales across all available data simultaneously. The\nmodel contains a number of novel modules: a differentiated form of time series\npatching which employs multiple resolutions, a multiple-resolution module for\ntime-varying known variables, a mixer-based module for capturing cross-series\ninformation, and a novel output head with favourable scaling to account for the\nincreased number of tokens. We present an application of this model to a real\nworld prediction problem faced by the markdown team at a very large retailer.\nOn the experiments conducted our model outperforms in-house models and the\nselected existing deep learning architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"jiTecjW9YkqogkiuVAOyp4bUMSp2avH4lJfkL9_ZWbI","pdfSize":"570151"}
