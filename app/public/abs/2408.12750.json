The proposed technique develops\ntwo scalar counterparts for the initial vector system. The solutions to these\nscalar nonlinear equations, which also incorporate delays and variable\ncoefficients, provide upper and lower bounds for the norms of solutions to the\noriginal vector equations with corresponding history functions. This enables\nevaluation of the dynamics of a vector system through the analysis of its\nscalar counterparts. This analysis can be accomplished using simplified\nanalytical reasoning or straightforward simulations, which remain effective\neven for systems with a large number of coupled equations. Consequently, we\nintroduced some novel boundedness, stability and instability criteria and\nestimated the radiuses of the balls containing the history functions which stem\nbounded/stabile solutions to the vector systems. Lastly, we validate our\nresults in representative simulations that also assess their accuracy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
