In this paper we consider the existence of a complete mapping\n$\\varphi$ of $\\Gamma$ and a partition $S_1,S_2,\\ldots S_t$ of elements of\n$\\Gamma$, such that $\\sum_{s\\in S_i}s=\\sum_{s\\in S_i}\\varphi(s)=0$ for every\n$i$, $1 \\leq i \\leq t$.\n  A $\\Gamma$-magic rectangle set $MRS_{\\Gamma}(a, b; c)$ of order $abc$ is a\ncollection of $c$ arrays $(a\\times b)$ whose entries are elements of group\n$\\Gamma$ of order $abc$, each appearing once, with all row sums in every\nrectangle equal to a constant $\\omega\\in \\Gamma$ and all column sums in every\nrectangle equal to a constant $\\delta \\in \\Gamma$.\n  While a complete characterization of MRS$_\\Gamma(a,b;c)$ exists for cases\nwhere $\\{a,b\\}\\not=\\{2k+1,2^{\\alpha}\\}$, the scenario where\n$\\{a,b\\}=\\{2k+1,2^{\\alpha}\\}$ remains unsolved for $\\alpha>1$. Using the\npartition of $\\Gamma$ into zero-sum sets by complete mappings, we give some\nsufficient conditions that a $\\Gamma$-magic rectangle set MRS$_{\\Gamma}(2k+1,\n2^{\\alpha};c)$ exists.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
