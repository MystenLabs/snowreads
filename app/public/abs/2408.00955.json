To\naddress the computational burdens of GP models for large-scale datasets,\ndistributed learning for GPs are often adopted. Current aggregation models for\ndistributed GPs are not time-efficient when incorporating correlations between\nGP experts. In this work, we propose a novel approach for aggregated prediction\nin distributed GPs. The technique is suitable for both the exact and sparse\nvariational GPs. The proposed method incorporates correlations among experts,\nleading to better prediction accuracy with manageable computational\nrequirements. As demonstrated by empirical studies, the proposed approach\nresults in more stable predictions in less time than state-of-the-art\nconsistent aggregation models.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
