However,\nin most cases wireless charging is accessible only to devices developed with\nsuch a functionality in mind or at least to gadgets with standard charging\nconnectors, such as USB type-C. We propose the design of a rechargeable battery\nhaving the size and output voltage characteristics of a standard AA battery,\nbut supporting magnetic wireless power transfer from charging stations of\nwidely used Qi standard. In our numerical simulations, we study the magnetic\nfield distributions and scattering parameters of the introduced battery with a\ncurved receiving coil coupled to a planar transmitting coil. The obtained\nresults are supported by an experimental realization of the proposed design and\na study of the prototype characteristics. The developed battery design\nfacilitates the possibility of adding wireless charging functionality to a wide\nrange of electronic devices in a universal way.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
