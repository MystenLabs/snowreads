By considering the system as an elliptic-dominated structure and\ndefining suitable energy functionals, after the elaborate index analysis, we\nestablish the global existence of strong solutions as long as the initial data\nis large enough. This is a big contrast to the classical results where the\ninitial data is a small perturbation of some resting states.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
