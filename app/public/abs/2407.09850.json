Here, we use a high throughput strategy to unravel\nthe influence of aliovalent doping with Ce on dielectric and piezoelectric\nproperties of BCTZ. We synthesize and characterize a single BCTZ thin film with\na composition gradient from undoped to 0.2 mol % cerium doping. The cerium\ndoping increases the piezoelectric coefficient from $42.3\\pm 2.9 \\text{pm\nV}^{-1}$ (undoped) to $63\\pm 2.4 \\text{pm V}^{-1}$ for 0.06 Ce-mol\\%, and then\ndecreases to $38.4 \\pm 1.3 \\text{pm V}^{-1}$ for the maximum amount of cerium\n(0.2 mol %). An investigation of sub-coercive field non-linearities reveal that\nthese variations are not only induced by changes in dynamics and densities of\ndomain walls. The results highlight the advantage of high throughput techniques\nto identify ideal compositions for applications, without synthesizing a high\nnumber of samples with unavoidable sample-to-sample variations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
