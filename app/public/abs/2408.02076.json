Distinctiveness centrality offers a novel reinterpretation of degree\ncentrality, particularly emphasizing the significance of direct connections to\nloosely connected peers within (social) networks. This response paper presents\na more comprehensive analysis of the correlation between Distinctiveness and\nthe Beta and Gamma measures. All five distinctiveness measures are considered,\nas well as a more meaningful range of the {\\alpha} parameter and different\nnetwork topologies, distinguishing between weighted and unweighted networks.\nFindings indicate significant variability in correlations, supporting the\nviability of Distinctiveness as alternative or complementary metrics within\nsocial network analysis. Moreover, the paper presents computational complexity\nanalysis and simplified R code for practical implementation. Encouraging\ninitial findings suggest potential applications in diverse domains, inviting\nfurther exploration and comparative analyses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
