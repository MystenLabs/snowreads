We obtain\nanalytical expressions for relaxation from weak-domain-wall initial conditions\nand corresponding predictions for the spin Drude weight. We corroborate the\nlatter against an exact microscopic calculation at infinite temperature and\nLuttinger-liquid expectations at zero temperature. We further obtain an\nanalytical expression for the long-wavelength dynamics of the longitudinal spin\nstructure factor at all fillings and temperatures. We show that the latter\ninterpolates between an empirically exact expression that we have found at\ninfinite temperature and the long-wavelength limit of the Haldane-Zirnbauer\nformula at zero temperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
