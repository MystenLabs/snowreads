These deviations affect the formation of dark\nmatter structure, which subsequently leads to different observable properties\nof galaxies. In this work, we study the impact of a blue and red tilted power\nspectrum on the central density of dwarf galaxies. To do this, we model\ndensities of dwarf galaxies using a combination of high-resolution numerical\nsimulations and galaxy formation model. The model galaxies in $\\Lambda$CDM are\nconsistent with observations of 41 faint dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky\nWay. The deviations from the $\\Lambda$CDM power spectrum are constrained by the\ncentral matter densities of dwarf galaxies, which set stringent constraints on\nthe possible small-scale tilt of the primordial power spectrum, improving on\nthe current limits. Moreover, similar analysis can be applied to test any\nfeature in the power spectrum at small scales between $k\\sim\n10-100$~Mpc$^{-1}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
