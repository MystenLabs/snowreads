One such\ntechnology is word prediction software, designed to minimize keystrokes\nrequired for text input. This study investigates the impact of word prediction\non typing performance among blind users using an on-screen QWERTY keyboard. We\nconducted a comparative study involving eleven blind participants, evaluating\nboth standard QWERTY input and word prediction-assisted typing. Our findings\nreveal that while word prediction slightly improves typing speed, it does not\nenhance typing accuracy and increases both physical and temporal workload\ncompared to the default keyboard. We conclude with recommendations for\nimproving word prediction systems, including more efficient editing methods and\nthe integration of voice pitch variations to aid error recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
