These methods have attracted\nsignificant interest due to their potential impact on advancing scientific\nresearch and industrial practices by improving predictive models with small- or\nlarge-scale datasets and expressive predictive models with useful inductive\nbiases. The survey has two parts. The first considers incorporating physics\nknowledge on an architectural level through objective functions, structured\npredictive models, and data augmentation. The second considers data as physics\nknowledge, which motivates looking at multi-task, meta, and contextual learning\nas an alternative approach to incorporating physics knowledge in a data-driven\nfashion. Finally, we also provide an industrial perspective on the application\nof these methods and a survey of the open-source ecosystem for physics-informed\nmachine learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
