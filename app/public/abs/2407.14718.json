This structure may be exploited to design numerical\nmethods which preserve the Hamiltonian structure in the dissipation-free limit,\nand which achieve the correct dissipation rate in the spatially-discrete\ndissipative dynamics. Moreover, by using spatial discretizations which preserve\nthe de Rham cohomology, the non-evolving involution constraint for the\nvorticity may be exactly satisfied for all of time. Numerical examples are\ngiven using a mimetic finite difference spatial discretization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
