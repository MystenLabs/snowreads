This model combines the full\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation via\nthe momentum and energy exchanges. We obtain the global existence and optimal\ntime decay rates of strong solutions to the model in whole space $\\mathbb{R}^3$\nwhen the initial data are a small perturbation of the given equilibrium in\n$H^2$. We show that the $L^2$-norms of the solutions and their gradients decay\nas $(1+t)^{-3/4}$ and $(1+t)^{-5/4}$ respectively. Moreover, we also obtain the\ndecay rates of solutions in $L^p$-norms for $p\\in [2,\\infty]$, and the optimal\ntime decay rates of the highest-order derivatives of strong solutions which\nreads as $(1+t)^{-{7}/{4}}$ in $L^2$-norm. % Our decay rates are consistent\nwith those of non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. When the\nmodel is considered in a periodic domain, besides the global existence results,\nwe show the strong solution decay exponentially. Our proofs rely on the energy\nmethod,\n  Fourier analysis techniques, and the method of frequency decomposition. And\nsome new ideas are introduced to achieve the desired convergence rates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5wPCaVtA3WDvaFkMm0IPOu_sa8F9EXxtFjfQ00YmRrw","pdfSize":"464273"}
