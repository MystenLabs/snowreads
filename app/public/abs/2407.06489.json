However, the AIGC in material science faces\nchallenges in the ability to efficiently discover innovative materials that\nsurpass existing databases, alongside the invariances and stability\nconsiderations of crystal structures. To address these challenges, we develop\nT2MAT (Text-to-Material), a comprehensive framework processing from a\nuser-input sentence to inverse design material structures with goal properties\nbeyond the existing database via globally exploring chemical space, followed by\nan entirely automated workflow of first principal validation. Furthermore, we\npropose CGTNet (Crystal Graph Transformer NETwork), a novel graph neural\nnetwork model that captures long-term interactions, to enhance the accuracy and\ndata efficiency of property prediction and thereby improve the reliability of\ninverse design. Through these contributions, T2MAT minimizes the dependency on\nhuman expertise and significantly enhances the efficiency of designing novel,\nhigh-performance functional materials, thereby actualizing AIGC in the\nmaterials design domain.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
