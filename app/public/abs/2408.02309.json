This source is the most polarized Atoll source so far\nobserved with IXPE, with a polarization degree of 2.7% $\\pm$ 0.9% in the 2-8\nkeV band during the non-dip phase and marginal evidence of an increasing trend\nwith energy. The higher polarization degree compared to other Atolls can be\nexplained by the high inclination of the system ($i \\approx 60${\\deg}). The\nspectra are well described by the combination of a soft thermal emission, a\nComptonized component, plus reflection of soft photons off the accretion disk.\nDuring the dips, the hydrogen column density of the highly-ionized absorber\nincreases while the ionization state decreases. The Comptonized radiation seems\nto be the dominant contribution to the polarized signal, with additional\nreflected photons which significantly contribute even if their fraction in the\ntotal flux is not high.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
