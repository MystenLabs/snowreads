The question concerning the rigidity of the inequality, raised\nby Yau in 1990, was left open. Going beyond rigidity, our main result\nstrengthens Andrews-Clutterbuck inequality, by quantifying geometrically the\nexcess of the gap compared to the diameter in terms of flatness. The proof\nrelies on a localized, variational interpretation of the fundamental gap,\nallowing a dimension reduction via the use of convex partitions \\`a la\nPayne-Weinberger: the result stems by combining a new sharp result for one\ndimensional Schr\\\"odinger eigenvalues with measure potentials, with a thorough\nanalysis of the geometry of the partition into convex cells. As a by-product of\nour approach, we obtain a quantitative form of Payne-Weinberger inequality for\nthe first nontrivial Neumann eigenvalue of a convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, thus\nproving, in a stronger version, a conjecture from 2007 by Hang-Wang.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
