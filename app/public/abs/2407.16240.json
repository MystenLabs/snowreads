In addition, a\nweight function and two positive parameters have also been included in the\nnonlinearity. The developed analysis is significantly influenced by these two\nparameters. Further, the mountain pass theorem, the Ekeland variational\nprinciple, the Trudinger-Moser inequality, the doubly weighted\nHardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality and a completely new Br\\'ezis-Lieb type\nlemma for Choquard nonlinearity play key roles in our proofs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
