Social engineering tactics are widely recognized as a\nsignificant risk to information security. The increasing digital environment\nhas increased the prevalence of social engineering attacks, bringing huge\nthreats to both people and organizations. This paper explores current deception\ntechniques used during social engineering attacks to understand emerging trends\nand discuss effective countermeasures. It is always a good idea to have\nknowledge of counter measures and risks from these increasing cyber threats. We\nhave also explored the types of deception attacks and role of social\nengineering in Advanced Persistent Threats. Today major concern for\ncybersecurity and other web related attacks is due to social engineering\nattacks that is also the driving force of increasing cybercrimes worldwide. By\nuncovering emerging trends and analyzing the psychological underpinnings of\nthese attacks this paper highlights the known deception techniques, emerging\ntrends and counter measures of social engineering attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
