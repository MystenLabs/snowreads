In particular, by leveraging sparsity in random effect precision\nmatrices, INLA is commonly used in spatial and spatio-temporal applications.\nHowever, the speed of INLA comes at the cost of restricting the user to the\nfamily of latent Gaussian models and the likelihoods currently implemented in\n{INLA}, the main software implementation of the INLA methodology.\n  {inlabru} is a software package that extends the types of models that can be\nfitted using INLA by allowing the latent predictor to be non-linear in its\nparameters, moving beyond the additive linear predictor framework to allow more\ncomplex functional relationships. For inference it uses an approximate\niterative method based on the first-order Taylor expansion of the non-linear\npredictor, fitting the model using INLA for each linearised model\nconfiguration.\n  {inlabru} automates much of the workflow required to fit models using\n{R-INLA}, simplifying the process for users to specify, fit and predict from\nmodels. There is additional support for fitting joint likelihood models by\nbuilding each likelihood individually. {inlabru} also supports the direct use\nof spatial data structures, such as those implemented in the {sf} and {terra}\npackages.\n  In this paper we outline the statistical theory, model structure and basic\nsyntax required for users to understand and develop their own models using\n{inlabru}. We evaluate the approximate inference method using a Bayesian method\nchecking approach. We provide three examples modelling simulated spatial data\nthat demonstrate the benefits of the additional flexibility provided by\n{inlabru}.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
