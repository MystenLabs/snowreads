A striking example is the spontaneous assembly of fire\nants into \"bridges\" comprising their own bodies to traverse obstacles and reach\nsources of food. Experiments and simulations suggest that, remarkably, these\nants always form one bridge -- instead of multiple, competing bridges --\ndespite a lack of central coordination. We argue that the reliable formation of\na single bridge does not require sophistication on behalf of the individuals by\nprovably reproducing this behavior in a self-organizing particle system. We\nshow that the formation of a single bridge by the particles is a statistical\ninevitability of their preferences to move in a particular direction, such as\ntoward a food source, and their preference for more neighbors. Two parameters,\n$\\eta$ and $\\beta$, reflect the strengths of these preferences and determine\nthe Gibbs stationary measure of the corresponding particle system's Markov\nchain dynamics. We show that a single bridge almost certainly forms when $\\eta$\nand $\\beta$ are sufficiently large. Our proof introduces an auxiliary Markov\nchain, called an \"occupancy chain\", that captures only the significant, global\nchanges to the system. Through the occupancy chain, we abstract away\ninformation about the motion of individual particles, but we gain a more direct\nmeans of analyzing their collective behavior. Such abstractions provide a\npromising new direction for understanding many other systems of programmable\nmatter.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
