We make\nuse of the halo CME database\n(https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/halo/halo.html) to compare the halo CME\nabundance during the first four years in each of SCs 23 to 25. The main result\nis that in several aspects such as the abundance, occurrence rate, source\nlocations, and halo heights, halo CMEs are similar between SCs 24 and 25 but\ndifferent from SC 23. This result follows from the fact that weaker cycles have\nlow heliospheric total pressure, whose backreaction on CMEs allows them to\nexpand more and hence enhancing the chance of becoming a halo. The solar cycle\nvariation of halo CME properties is consistent with the precursor-based cycle\nprediction methods that indicate SC 25 is similar to or only slightly stronger\nthan SC 24.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
