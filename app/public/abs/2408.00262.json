It was recently rediscovered that some logics between CK and IK\nalso disagree on their diamond-free fragments, with only some remaining\nconservative over the standard axiomatisation of intuitionistic modal logic\nwith necessity (box) alone. We show that relational Kripke semantics for CK can\nbe extended with frame conditions for all axioms in the standard axiomatisation\nof IK, as well as other axioms previously studied. This allows us to answer\nopen questions about the (non-)conservativity of such logics over\nintuitionistic modal logic without diamond. Our results are formalised using\nthe Coq Proof Assistant.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
