Restricted spatial regression (RSR) models\nrestrict the spatial random effects to be in the orthogonal column space of the\ncovariates, which \"deconfounds\" the SLMM. Recent articles have shown that the\nRSR generally performs worse than the SLMM under a certain interpretation of\nthe RSR. We show that every additive model can be reparameterized as a\ndeconfounded model leading to what we call the linear reparameterization of\nadditive models (LRAM). Under this reparameterization the coefficients of the\ncovariates (referred to as deconfounded regression effects) are different from\nthe (confounded) regression effects in the SLMM. It is shown that under the\nLRAM interpretation, existing deconfounded spatial models produce estimated\ndeconfounded regression effects, spatial prediction, and spatial prediction\nvariances equivalent to that of SLMM in Bayesian contexts. Furthermore, a\ngeneral RSR (GRSR) and the SLMM produce identical inferences on confounded\nregression effects. While our results are in complete agreement with recent\ncriticisms, our new results under the LRAM interpretation provide\nclarifications that lead to different and sometimes contrary conclusions.\nAdditionally, we discuss the inferential and computational benefits to\ndeconfounding, which we illustrate via a simulation.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
