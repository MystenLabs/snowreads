There are sophisticated kinetic theories that describe some aspects of\ngalaxy disk dynamics, but extracting quantitative predictions from those\ntheories has proven very difficult, meaning they have shed little light on\nobservations/simulations of galaxies. Here, we begin to address this issue by\ndeveloping a tractable theory describing fluctuations and transport in thin\ngalactic disks. Our main conceptual advance is to split potential fluctuations\ninto asymptotic wavelength regimes relative to orbital guiding radius and\nepicyclic amplitude (similar to plasma gyrokinetics), and then to treat\nseparately the dynamics in each regime. As an illustration, we apply our\nresults to quasilinear theory, calculating the angular-momentum transport due\nto a transient spiral. At each stage we verify our formulae with numerical\nexamples. Our approach should simplify many important calculations in galactic\ndisk dynamics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
