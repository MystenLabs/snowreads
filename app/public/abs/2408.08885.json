However, decision-makers lack the tools to\nspatialize their deployment as part of their urban cooling and climate change\nadaptation strategies. Among other indicators, a spatial assessment of the\ncooling potential for a technique in a given area is lacking. To this end, we\nanalyze the physical mechanisms on which these techniques are based and\nidentify corresponding geographical indicators that influence their cooling\nperformance. Solar irradiance, existing material properties and underground\ninfrastructure stand out as essential indicators for this purpose.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
