Additionally, modeling high-order interactions\ntypically leads to increased computational costs. Therefore, the challenge lies\nin adaptively modeling high-order feature interactions while maintaining\nefficiency. To address this issue, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Represented\nSparse Efficient Interaction Network (KarSein), designed to optimize both\npredictive accuracy and computational efficiency. We firstly identify\nlimitations of directly applying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to CTR and\nthen introduce KarSein to overcome these issues. It features a novel\narchitecture that reduces the computational costs of KAN and supports embedding\nvectors as feature inputs. Additionally, KarSein employs guided symbolic\nregression to address the challenge of KAN in spontaneously learning\nmultiplicative relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate KarSein's\nsuperior performance, achieving significant predictive accuracy with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Furthermore, KarSein maintains strong global\nexplainability while enabling the removal of redundant features, resulting in a\nsparse network structure. These advantages also position KarSein as a promising\nmethod for efficient inference.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QZRRJUxr7SMrFzqrj5CMFYb6nkwMB3lUKdkAou9AGMM","pdfSize":"2378644"}
