With the advent of deep learning,\nautomated segmentation techniques have demonstrated remarkable progress,\nachieving high accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional manual methods.\nAmong these techniques, the nnU-Net framework stands out as a robust and\nversatile tool for medical image segmentation. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of nnU-Net in segmenting cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRIs).\nUtilizing five cardiac segmentation datasets, we employ various nnU-Net\nconfigurations, including 2D, 3D full resolution, 3D low resolution, 3D\ncascade, and ensemble models. Our study benchmarks the capabilities of these\nconfigurations and examines the necessity of developing new models for specific\ncardiac segmentation tasks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eG58WeUOES8_c8dxQyLfh2s99wU_yJ7ADgFmMciuAqk","pdfSize":"2141879"}
