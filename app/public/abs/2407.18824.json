Using the obtained coupling strengths, we\npropose an approach to compute the temperature-dependent mobilities of\nelectrons and holes. This methodology is applied to both bulk and thin-film\npolymorphs of tetracene. To validate our treatment of the electronic structures\nand vibrational properties, we calculate the Raman spectra in the\nlattice-phonon region and compare them with experimental data. We then compare\nthe computed mobilities with available data for single crystals, finding good\nagreement within the experimental range, especially when accounting for\npossible charged impurities. Finally, we discuss the observed differences\nbetween the polymorphs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
