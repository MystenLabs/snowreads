Our main result\nis a generalization of Yuan's equidistribution theorem that does not require\nZhang's lower bound for the essential minimum to be attained. It extends to all\nprojective varieties a theorem of Burgos Gil, Philippon, Rivera-Letelier and\nthe second author for toric varieties, and implies the semiabelian\nequidistribution theorem of K\\\"uhne. We also generalize previous work of\nChambert-Loir and Thuillier to prove new logarithmic equidistribution results.\nIn the last section, we extend our main theorem to the quasi-projective setting\nrecently introduced by Yuan and Zhang.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
