One of the theoretical\nsystematics for lensing reconstruction is the impact of the lensing field\nnon-Gaussianities on its estimators. Non-linear matter clustering and post-Born\nlensing corrections are known to bias standard quadratic estimators to some\nextent, most significantly so in temperature. In this work, we explore the\nimpact of non-Gaussian deflections on Maximum a Posteriori lensing estimators,\nwhich, in contrast to quadratic estimators, are able to provide optimal\nmeasurements of the lensing field. We show that these naturally reduce the\ninduced non- Gaussian bias and lead to unbiased cosmological constraints in\n$\\Lambda$CDM at CMB-S4 noise levels without the need for explicit modelling. We\nalso test the impact of assuming a non-Gaussian prior for the reconstruction;\nthis mitigates the effect further slightly, but generally has little impact on\nthe quality of the reconstruction. This shows that higher-order statistics of\nthe lensing deflections are not expected to present a major challenge for\noptimal CMB lensing reconstruction in the foreseeable future.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
