Here, we investigate the relation\nbetween the information flow and turbulent fluctuations. We first establish a\nconnection between the information flow and phase-space contraction rate. From\nthis relation, we then prove a universal inequality between the information\nflow and turbulent fluctuations, which states that the information flow from\nlarge to small scales amplifies turbulent fluctuations at small scales. This\ninequality can also be interpreted as a quantification of Landau's objection to\nthe universality of turbulent fluctuations. We also discuss the difference\nbetween the information flow and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
