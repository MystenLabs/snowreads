This work contributes to this direction. We\nleverage model explanation methods to identify the features crucial for the\nmodel to reach optimal performance and the smallest set of features sufficient\nto achieve this performance. We evaluate our approach on three temporal\nmultimodal geospatial datasets and compare multiple model explanation\ntechniques. Our results reveal that some datasets can reach their optimal\naccuracy with less than 20% of the temporal instances, while in other datasets,\nthe time series of a single band from a single modality is sufficient.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GqiKwvSWd2xd837ID37kjk4hplkvBmXMwbTZMeMKoTM","pdfSize":"3299459"}
