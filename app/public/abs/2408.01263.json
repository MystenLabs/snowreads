These abilities enable individuals\nto break down complex problems into more manageable steps and create a sequence\nof actions to solve them. To address the increasing demand for AT assessments\nin educational settings and the limitations of current methods, this paper\nintroduces the virtual Cross Array Task (CAT), a digital adaptation of an\nunplugged assessment activity designed to evaluate algorithmic skills in Swiss\ncompulsory education. This tool offers scalable and automated assessment,\nreducing human involvement and mitigating potential data collection errors. The\nplatform features gesture-based and visual block-based programming interfaces,\nensuring its usability for diverse learners, further supported by multilingual\ncapabilities. To evaluate the virtual CAT platform, we conducted a pilot\nevaluation in Switzerland involving a heterogeneous group of students. The\nfindings show the platform's usability, proficiency and suitability for\nassessing AT skills among students of diverse ages, development stages, and\neducational backgrounds, as well as the feasibility of large-scale data\ncollection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
