While the linear anomalous Hall response strictly\nrequires the absence of time-reversal symmetry, the second-order, thus\nnonlinear, Hall response needs broken inversion symmetry. Recently, much effort\nhas been made to obtain a second-order Hall voltage in response to a\nlongitudinal ac driving current, both to obtain information about band\ngeometric quantities and for its useful technological applications, including\nrectification and frequency doubling. Typically, additional material\nengineering is required in noncentrosymmetric systems to obtain second-order\nresponses since it obeys a stringent crystallographic symmetry constraint. To\ncircumvent this, an alternative route is to apply a dc electric field. In this\nLetter, we uncover an electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall effect\nin an inversion-broken system possessing unconventional Rashba bands. We\nestablish that the quantum metric, a geometrical feature of electronic wave\nfunctions providing information on non-trivial structure of Bloch bands, is\nresponsible for providing the nonlinear Hall response.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
