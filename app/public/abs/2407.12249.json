Specifically, in this work,\nwe focus on the security issues over a multi-carrier (MC)-non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA) assisted ISAC system, considering imperfect channel\nstate information (CSI) of an active Eve and graded confidentiality demands for\nusers. To this end, the subcarrier allocation, the information, and artificial\nnoise beamforming are designed to maximize the minimum communication rate,\nwhile ensuring diverse confidentiality and sensing performance demands. An\neffective security strategy is devised via the Lagrangian dual transformation\nand successive convex approximation methods. Simulations confirm the validity\nand robustness of the proposed scheme in terms of the security performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
