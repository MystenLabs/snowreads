The time-reversal\ntransformation is described as a transformation from the perspective of\nfuture-directed observer to that of the corresponding past-directed observer,\nwhich enables us to maintain general covariance throughout the construction.\nThe result presented in this work may be applied in understanding the origin of\nirreversibility in macroscopic processes in the presence of relativistic\ngravity, as in most astrophysical or cosmological processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
