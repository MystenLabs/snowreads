From 38 good observations, which spans over a period of 18 years from\n2006 to 2023, we found that the Crab's X-ray flux does not only flicker, but\nalso significantly anti-correlates to its spectral power-law photon index.\nSince emission contribution of the Crab pulsar in this energy range is small,\nthis anti-correlation is mainly about the emission of the Crab nebula. We\nsuggest that this anti-correlation is an observational supporting evidence for\nthe long-standing notion that the nebula emission is due to synchrotron\nradiation of shocked pulsar winds in the nebula.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
