The\nnon-stationarity of these kernels is induced by arbitrary spatially-varying\nvertical and horizontal scales. In particular, any stationary kernel can be\naccommodated as a special case, and we focus especially on the generalization\nof the standard Mat\\'ern kernel. Our subroutine for kernel matrix-vector\nmultiplications scales almost optimally as $O(N\\log N)$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of regression points. Like the recently developed equispaced Fourier\nGaussian process (EFGP) methodology, which is applicable only to stationary\nkernels, our approach exploits non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFTs). We\noffer a complete analysis controlling the approximation error of our method,\nand we validate the method's practical performance with numerical experiments.\nIn particular we demonstrate improved scalability compared to to\nstate-of-the-art rank-structured approaches in spatial dimension $d>1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
