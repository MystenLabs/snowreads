The realizations of irreducible\nsubrepresentations, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are\ndescribed, and the decomposition of $\\Lambda_n$ is found. The actions on the\nSchur polynomials is also determined. By using an isomorphism between\n$\\Lambda_n$ and the vector space of Young diagrams $\\mathbb{Q}\\mathcal{Y}_n$\nwith no more than $n$ rows, these representations are transferred to\n$\\mathbb{Q}\\mathcal{Y}_n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
