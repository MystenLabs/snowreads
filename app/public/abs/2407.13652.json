In this paper,\nwe study a variant where fires are coming from the boundary of the forest\ninstead.\n  In particular we prove that, for the case without recoveries where the forest\nis an $N \\times N$ box in the triangular lattice, the probability that the\ncenter of the box gets burnt tends to $0$ as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ (but\nsubstantially slower than the one-arm probability of critical Bernoulli\npercolation). And, for the case where the forest is the upper-half plane, we\nshow (still for the version without recoveries) that no infinite occupied\ncluster emerges. We also discuss analogs of some of these results for the\ncorresponding models with recoveries, and explain how our results and proofs\ngive valuable insight on a process considered earlier by Graf.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
