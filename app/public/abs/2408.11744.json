The training data\nfor FSDMC is based on the opensource Jiehua artist's work collected from the\nInternet, which were subsequently manually constructed in the format of\n(Original Image, Canny Edge Features, Text Prompt). By employing the optimal\nhyperparameters identified in this paper, it was observed FSDMC outperforms\nCycleGAN, another mainstream style transfer model. FSDMC achieves FID of 3.27\non the dataset and also surpasses CycleGAN in terms of expert evaluation. This\nnot only demonstrates the model's high effectiveness in extracting Jiehua's\nstyle features, but also preserves the original pre-trained semantic\ninformation. The findings of this study suggest that the application of FSDMC\nwith appropriate hyperparameters can enhance the efficacy of the Stable\nDiffusion Model in the field of traditional art style migration tasks,\nparticularly within the context of Jiehua.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
