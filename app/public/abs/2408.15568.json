It delves into the comparative costs of\npurchasing versus renting servers, guided by market research and economic\ntheories on tiered pricing. The paper offers detailed insights into the\nselection and assembly of hardware components such as CPUs, GPUs, and\nmotherboards tailored to specific research needs. It introduces innovative\nmethods to mitigate the performance issues caused by PCIe switch bandwidth\nlimitations in order to enhance GPU task scheduling. Furthermore, a Graph\nNeural Network (GNN) framework is proposed to analyze and optimize parallelism\nin computing networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
