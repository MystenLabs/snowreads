The circulation of the magma ocean can be driven by stellar radiation\nand atmospheric winds. The strength of ocean circulation and the depth of the\nmagma ocean depend on external forcings and the dominant balance of the\nmomentum equation. In this study, we develop scaling laws for the magma ocean\ndepth, oceanic current speed, and ocean heat transport convergence driven by\nstellar and wind forcings in three different dynamic regimes: non-rotating\nviscosity-dominant Regime I, non-rotating inviscid limit Regime II, and\nrotation-dominant Regime III. Scaling laws suggest that magma ocean depth,\ncurrent speed, and ocean heat transport convergence are controlled by various\nparameters, including vertical diffusivity/viscosity, substellar temperature,\nplanetary rotation rate, and wind stress. In general, scaling laws predict that\nmagma ocean depth ranges from a few meters to a few hundred meters. For Regime\nI, results from scaling laws are further confirmed by numerical simulations.\nConsidering the parameters of a typical lava super-Earth, we found that the\nmagma ocean is most likely in the rotation-dominant Regime III.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
