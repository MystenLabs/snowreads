We prove the equivalence between the toric setup and the\nG-graded one, and a Hessian criterion in the G-graded setup. We provide an\napplication to toric geometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
