By imposing rotation, translation, and permutation\nequivariance inductive biases in both space and time, we show that the\nSpacetime $E(n)$-Transformer (SET) outperforms purely spatial and temporal\nmodels without symmetry-preserving properties. We benchmark SET against said\nmodels on the charged $N$-body problem, a simple physical system with complex\ndynamics. While existing spatio-temporal graph neural networks focus on\nsequential modeling, we empirically demonstrate that leveraging underlying\ndomain symmetries yields considerable improvements for modeling dynamical\nsystems on graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
