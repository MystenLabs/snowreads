He discovered complex behavior in\nsome of these automata and developed a classification for all cellular automata\nbased on their phenomenology. In this paper, we present an algorithm to\nclassify them more effectively by measuring difference patterns using the\nHamming distance. Our classification aligns with Wolfram's and further\ncategorizes them into additional subclasses.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
