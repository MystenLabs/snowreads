We introduce a novel approach to MDVSP by\nincorporating service reliability through chance-constrained programming (CCP),\ntargeting the pivotal issue of travel time uncertainty and its impact on\ntransit service quality. Our model guarantees service reliability measured by\non-time performance (OTP), a primary metric for transit agencies, and fairness\nacross different service areas.We propose an exact branch-and-cut (B&C) scheme\nto solve our CCP model. We present several cut-generation procedures that\nexploit the underlying problem structure and analyze the relationship between\nthe obtained cut families. Additionally, we design a Lagrangian-based heuristic\nto handle large-scale instances reflective of real-world transit operations.\nOur approach partitions the set of trips, each subset leading to a subproblem\nthat can be efficiently solved with our B&C algorithm, and then employs a\nprocedure to combine the subproblem solutions to create a vehicle schedule that\nsatisfies all the planning constraints of the MDVSP. Our empirical evaluation\ndemonstrates the superiority of our stochastic variant in achieving\ncost-effective schedules with reliable OTP guarantees compared to alternatives\ncommonly used by practitioners, as well as the computational benefits of our\nmethodologies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
