This model integrates\nhierarchical information from the charts of accounts into the sentence\nembedding process, aiming to accurately capture both the semantic similarity\nand the hierarchical structure of the ledger accounts. In addition, we\nintroduce a data augmentation strategy that enriches the training data and, as\na result, increases the performance of our proposed model. Compared to\nbenchmark methods, TopoLedgerBERT demonstrates superior performance in terms of\naccuracy and mean reciprocal rank.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
