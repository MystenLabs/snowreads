This paper fills this gap by investigating three potential\nRIS-induced attacks against RSMA in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) network: random interference, aligned interference, and mitigation\nattack. The random interference attack employs random RIS coefficients to\ndisrupt RSMA. The other two attacks are triggered by optimizing the RIS through\nweighted-sum strategies based on the projected gradient method. Simulation\nresults reveal significant degradation caused by all the attacks under perfect\nCSI conditions. Remarkably, when imperfect CSI is considered, RSMA, owing to\nits flexible power allocation strategy designed to counter CSI-related\ninterference, can be robust to the attacks even when the base station is blind\nto them. It is also shown that RSMA can significantly outperform conventional\nspace-division multiple access (SDMA).\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M9aXmporAnNNLCrX1ZOvX5jrMvJHe5MQFXb9Tq0s9ZY","pdfSize":"1141270"}
