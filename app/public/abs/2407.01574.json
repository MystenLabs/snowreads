Methods like AlphaFold have revolutionized protein structure\nprediction based only on the amino-acid sequence. However, proteins often\nappear in multiple different conformations, and it is highly relevant to\nresolve the full conformational distribution. Single-particle cryo-electron\nmicroscopy (cryo EM) is a powerful tool for capturing a large number of images\nof a given protein, frequently in different conformations (referred to as\nparticles). The images are, however, very noisy projections of the protein, and\ntraditional methods for cryo EM reconstruction are limited to recovering a\nsingle, or a few, conformations. In this paper, we introduce cryoSPHERE, a deep\nlearning method that takes as input a nominal protein structure, e.g. from\nAlphaFold, learns how to divide it into segments, and how to move these as\napproximately rigid bodies to fit the different conformations present in the\ncryo EM dataset. This formulation is shown to provide enough constraints to\nrecover meaningful reconstructions of single protein structures. This is\nillustrated in three examples where we show consistent improvements over the\ncurrent state-of-the-art for heterogeneous reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
