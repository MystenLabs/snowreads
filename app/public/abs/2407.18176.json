Our new algorithms compute all strata\nusing algebro-geometric techniques. For very affine hypersurfaces, we\ninvestigate and exploit the relation to critical point computations. Euler\nstratifications are relevant in particle physics and algebraic statistics. They\nfully describe the dependence of the number of master integrals, respectively\nthe maximum likelihood degree, on kinematic or model parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
