In this\npaper, we study a bistatic sensing system by maximizing the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ration (SINR) from the target aircraft in the\nspace-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). We formulate a joint optimization\nproblem for the transmit beamforming of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite and the\nreceive filtering of ground base station. To tackle this problem, we decompose\nthe original problem into two sub-problems and use the alternating optimization\nto solve them iteratively. Using techniques of fractional programming and\ngeneralized Rayleigh quotient, the closed-form solution for each sub-problem is\nreturned. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has good\nconvergence performance.Moreover, the optimization of receive filtering\ndominates the optimality, especially when the satellite altitude becomes\nhigher, which provides valuable network design insights.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
