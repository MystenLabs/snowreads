As the number of antenna elements increases within a given region,\nthe NDoF eventually saturates due to correlation of the radiated fields. The\nmaximal NDoF can be determined numerically for communication between two\nregions using singular value decomposition of a channel model representing wave\npropagation between densely sampled sources at the transmitter and fields at\nthe receiver. This paper provides a straightforward analytical estimate of the\nNDoF for arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions. The analysis show\nthat the NDoF for electrically large regions is approximated by the mutual\nshadow area of the regions, measured in wavelengths. Several setups illustrate\nthe results, which are then compared with numerical evaluations of the singular\nvalues of the propagation channel. These new analytical expressions also\nsimplify to previously established results based on Weyl's law and the paraxial\napproximation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
