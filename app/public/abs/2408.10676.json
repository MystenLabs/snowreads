However, it becomes particularly challenging when the models\nare trained on long-tailed datasets, as the models often struggle to\ndistinguish tail-class in-distribution samples from OOD samples. We examine the\nmain challenges in this problem by identifying the trade-offs between OOD\ndetection and in-distribution (ID) classification, faced by existing methods.\nWe then introduce our method, called \\textit{Representation Norm Amplification}\n(RNA), which solves this challenge by decoupling the two problems. The main\nidea is to use the norm of the representation as a new dimension for OOD\ndetection, and to develop a training method that generates a noticeable\ndiscrepancy in the representation norm between ID and OOD data, while not\nperturbing the feature learning for ID classification. Our experiments show\nthat RNA achieves superior performance in both OOD detection and classification\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods, by 1.70\\% and 9.46\\% in FPR95 and\n2.43\\% and 6.87\\% in classification accuracy on CIFAR10-LT and ImageNet-LT,\nrespectively.
