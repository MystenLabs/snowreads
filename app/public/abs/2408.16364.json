By using mountain pass lemma together with cut-off technique,\nwe obtain that system has at least a nontrivial weak solution\n$(u_{\\lambda},v_{\\lambda})$ for every large parameter $\\lambda$ when the\nnonlinear term $F(x,u,v)$ satisfies superlinear growth conditions only in a\nneighborhood of origin point $(0,0)$. We also obtain a concrete form for the\nlower bound of parameter $\\lambda$ and the trend of $(u_{\\lambda},v_{\\lambda})$\nwith the change of parameter $\\lambda$. Moreover, by using a revised Clark's\ntheorem together with cut-off technique, we obtain that system has a sequence\nof solutions tending to 0 for every $\\lambda>0$ when the nonlinear term\n$F(x,u,v)$ satisfies sublinear growth conditions only in a neighborhood of\norigin point $(0,0)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
