It includes\nspecific provisions for general-purpose AI models which however need to be\nfurther interpreted in terms of technical standards and state-of-art studies to\nensure practical compliance solutions. This paper examines the AI act\nrequirements for providers and deployers of general-purpose AI and further\nproposes uncertainty estimation as a suitable measure for legal compliance and\nquality assurance in training of such models. We argue that uncertainty\nestimation should be a required component for deploying models in the real\nworld, and under the EU AI Act, it could fulfill several requirements for\ntransparency, accuracy, and trustworthiness. However, generally using\nuncertainty estimation methods increases the amount of computation, producing a\ndilemma, as computation might go over the threshold ($10^{25}$ FLOPS) to\nclassify the model as a systemic risk system which bears more regulatory\nburden.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
