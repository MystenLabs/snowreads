Here, we show that\nthe basic structure of these states can be generalized to arbitrary bipartite\nquantum systems in a manner that allows simultaneous, Heisenberg-limited\nestimation of two independent parameters for finite-dimensional systems.\nFurther, we show that these general states can always be stabilized by a\nrelatively simple Markovian dissipative process. In the specific case where the\ntwo subsystems are ensembles of two-level atoms or spins, our generalized\nstates define a notion of two-mode spin squeezing that is valid beyond the\nGaussian limit and that enables true multi-parameter estimation. We discuss how\ngeneralized Ramsey measurements allow one to reach the two-parameter quantum\nCramer-Rao bound, and how the dissipative preparation scheme is compatible with\ncurrent experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
