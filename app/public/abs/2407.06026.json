Recently,\nthe concept of variational quantum cloning was introduced: a quantum machine\nlearning algorithm through which, by exploiting a classical feedback loop\ninformed by the output of a quantum processing unit, the system can self-learn\nthe programming required for an optimal quantum cloning strategy. In this work,\nwe experimentally implement a $1 \\rightarrow 2$ variational cloning machine of\ndual-rail encoded photonic qubits, both for phase-covariant and state-dependent\ncloning. We exploit a fully programmable 6-mode universal integrated device and\nclassical feedback to reach near-optimal cloning performances. Our results\ndemonstrate the potential of programmable integrated photonic platforms for\nvariational self-learning of quantum algorithms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
