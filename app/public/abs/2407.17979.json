In this work, we developed a MW magnetic field (h-field)\nvector detector based on the nonresonant spin rectification effect. By\nmeasuring and analyzing the angle dependence of the rectification voltages\nunder nonresonant conditions, we can extract the three components of the\nh-field. As an initial test of this method, we obtained the h-field\ndistributions at 5.4 GHz generated by a coplanar waveguide with sub-wavelength\nresolution. Compared to methods using ferromagnetic resonance, this technique\noffers a faster and more convenient way to determine the spatial distribution\nof the h-field, which can be used for MW integrated circuit optimization and\nfault diagnosis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
