First, we outline conditions under which the initial ideal\ncan be used to compute the positive tropicalization, offering a real analogue\nto the Fundamental Theorem of Tropical Geometry. Additionally, under certain\ntechnical assumptions, we provide a real version of the Transverse Intersection\nTheorem. Building on these results, we propose an algorithm to compute a\ncombinatorial bound on the number of positive real roots of a parametrized\npolynomial equations system. Furthermore, we discuss how this combinatorial\nbound can be applied to study the number of positive steady states in chemical\nreaction networks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
