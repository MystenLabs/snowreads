We prove that the latter are\nsmoothable. For the former, we obtain upper bounds for the border rank in\ngeneral and prove that they are optimal under mild conditions. We give\napplications to complexity theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
