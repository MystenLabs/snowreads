We find that emissions dynamics\nexhibit significant volatility influenced by changing policy frameworks.\nFurthermore, the distribution of emissions growth rates is asymmetric and\ndisplays fat tails, suggesting the potential for extreme emissions events. We\nidentify marked disparities across regions: less developed regions experience\nhigher emissions growth rates and greater volatility compared to many developed\nareas, which show a trend of declining emissions and reduced volatility. Our\nfindings highlight the sensitivity of emissions to policy changes and emphasise\nthe need for clear and effective governance in emissions trading schemes.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
