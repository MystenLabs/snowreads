Recently, a novel quantum joint measurement named\nelegant joint measurement (EJM) has been proposed, where the reduced states of\nthe EJM basis have tetrahedral symmetry. In this work, we first suggest a\nfive-parameter entangled state and reveal its inherent symmetry. Based on this,\nwe define a more generalized EJM parameterized by $z$, $\\varphi$ and $\\theta$,\nand provide the quantum circuits for preparing and detecting these basis\nstates. There are three main results: (i) the previous single-parameter EJM can\nbe directly obtained by specifying the parameters $z$ and $\\varphi$; (ii) the\ninitial unit vectors related to the four vertices of the regular tetrahedron\nare not limited to the original choice and not all the unit vectors in\ncylindrical coordinates are suitable for forming the EJM basis; and (iii) the\nreduced states of the present EJM basis can always form two mirrorimage\ntetrahedrons, robustly preserving its elegant properties. We focus on figuring\nout what kind of states the EJM basis belongs to and providing a method for\nconstructing the more generalized three-parameter EJM, which may contribute to\nthe multi-setting measurement and the potential applications for quantum\ninformation processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
