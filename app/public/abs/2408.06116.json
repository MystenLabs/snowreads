Using the G$_0$W approximation, we find that the\nsoftening of the dielectric function significantly enhances the quasiparticle\ndecay rate near the instability. While the zero-temperature quasiparticle\nlifetime at the Fermi surface generally follows a\n$|\\varepsilon_k-\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}|^{-\\alpha}$ divergence with $\\alpha=2$, we\nobserve $\\alpha=0.5$ at the instability point and $\\alpha=1$ within the\ndensity-wave phase. Moreover, we demonstrate that the renormalization constant\n$Z$ is substantially suppressed as the instability is approached, enhancing the\neffective mass. We extend our analysis to ultra-cold Rydberg-dressed Fermi\nliquids, where the soft-core interactions promote density-wave instability, and\nfind that our numerical G$_0$W results are in excellent agreement with our\nanalytic predictions for quasiparticle lifetime, renormalization constant, and\neffective mass.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
