In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and\nthe final hadronic state (FHS) are consecutively simulated and recorded. The\nX(2370) glueball- or tetraquark-state is then, respectively, recombined by two\ngluons or four quarks $ss\\bar{s}\\bar{s}$ in the FPS using the quantum\nstatistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence\n(DCPC) model. The X(2370) molecular-state is recombined by the\nbaryon-antibaryon of $\\Lambda$-$\\bar{\\Lambda}$ or $\\Sigma$-$\\bar{\\Sigma}$, or\nby three mesons of $\\pi^+\\pi^{-}\\eta'$, $K^+K^-\\eta'$, or $K_S^0K_S^0\\eta'$ in\nthe FHS using DCPC model. In both $e^+e^-$ and pp collisions, significant\ndiscrepancies in the yields, the transverse momentum spectra and the rapidity\ndistributions among the X(2370) glueball-, tetraquark-, and molecular-state are\nobserved. These discrepancies are proposed as valuable criteria identifying the\nX(2370) different states from each other. Our results not only support the\nBESIII observation of glueball-like particle $\\rm X(2370)$ production in\n$e^+e^-$ collisions, but also serve as a prediction for the $\\rm X(2370)$\nproduction in pp collisions. We strongly suggest the experimental measurement\nof the X(2370) glueball-like particle production in pp collisions at the LHC\nenergies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
