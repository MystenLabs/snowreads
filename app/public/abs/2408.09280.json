In this paper, we delve into the\nemerging practice transitioning these events from physical venues to social VR\nas a new medium. Specifically, we ask: how does the spatial design in social VR\naffect the attendee's networking behaviors and experiences at these events? To\nanswer this question, we conducted in-situ observations and in-depth interviews\nwith 13 participants. Each of them had attended or hosted at least one\nreal-world professional event taking place in social VR. We identified four\nelements of VR spatial design that shaped social interactions at these events:\narea size, which influenced a person's perceived likelihood of encountering\nothers; pathways connecting areas, which guided their planning of the next\nactivity to perform; magnets in areas, which facilitated spontaneous gatherings\namong people; and conventionality, which affected the assessment of a person's\nbehavior appropriateness. Some of these elements were interpreted differently\ndepending on the role of the participant, i.e., event hosts vs. attendees. We\nconcluded this paper with multiple design implications derived from our\nfindings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
