The higher order perturbative\ncorrections up to the next-to-next-to-the-leading order (NNLO) using the\nparameterization of LSS05 polarized parton distribution functions in the\n3-flavor MSbar scheme and the nonperturbative corrections viz. the twist-3\ncorrections and target mass corrections (TMC) have been included in the\ncalculations. The numerical results for the polarized nucleon structure\nfunctions and the proton asymmetries are presented and compared with the\nexperimental results. The sum rule integrals of the nucleon structure functions\ncorresponding to the Ellis-Jaffe, Bjorken, Gottfried and Burkhardt-Cottingham\nsum rules have been evaluated numerically and are compared with the\nexperimental results.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TQ3665mH8KHGzbAlITh4MJ0mtu-U_JhckexwysXWGoI","pdfSize":"582507"}
