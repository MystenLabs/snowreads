Using density functional theory,\nthe formation energies within the relevant ternary phase diagrams were\ncalculated to predict the stability of both compounds. Simultaneously, Pu-Ni-Sn\nand Pu-Pt-Sn materials were arc-melted and subsequently characterized with\nmagnetization, specific heat, and resistivity measurements from 2-300 K.\nMagnetization measurements show that PuNiSn and PuPtSn order\nantiferromagnetically at TN = 11 K and TN = 15 K, respectively. Specific heat\nmeasurements show an enhanced residual electronic specific heat that is\nindicative of strong electron correlations. Resistivity measurements are\nindicative of Kondo behavior for PuNiSn while crystal field effects may play a\nrole in the observed temperature dependence for PuPtSn.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IKNVZcXuq1iu5XnbSSjdhAWeTfauWGwzBQW4SMJpaww","pdfSize":"2184585","objectId":"0x85a17108c243f6e3c0dea369b2a8299940b97633077d9174d0b4f92b88584c0f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
