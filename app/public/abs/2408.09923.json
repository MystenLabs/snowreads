This extension is considered based on simulations\nperformed with the PYTHIA 8 event generator in the context of pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV but can be trivially applied to any other scenario and\nimplemented in measurements of correlated particle production in pp, pA, and AA\ncollisions at colliders. Correlation of selected flavor balancing pairs are\nexamined as function of the produced charged particle multiplicity. One finds\nthat the amplitude of the correlations increases monotonically with the number\nof balanced flavors and the actual flavor content of correlated particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2hCNaSZoSem0Ck2s1ZUpLSa0P_rH4B3o5btYAfywMeg","pdfSize":"763238"}
