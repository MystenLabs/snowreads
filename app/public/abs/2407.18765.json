Affine control systems on R^n are embedded\ninto bilinear control systems in an extended state space and it is shown that\nthey are topologically conjugate to the induced system on the northern\nhemisphere of the Poincar\\'e sphere. This preserves strong chain control sets.\nFurther chain controllability properties on spheres are analyzed\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AFk-PuJXXnKMpaqfg8lsDpLJvrG41-w2dlVbPXi6lP8","pdfSize":"374812"}
