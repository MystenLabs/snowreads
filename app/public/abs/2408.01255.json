This solves the\ncoordination problem in which users wish to sign a petition or commit to a\ncause, but do not want to be identified as having signed it before enough\nothers have signed it too. We present an implementation of such a petition\nbased on the ElGamal cryptosystem. Applications include reporting misconduct in\nsituations were complainants hesitate to come forward alone, such as in\nallegations of sexual harassment or police brutality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tHBFR-jyYzPf-I16qdgoooGYEz8BtkHwrFvYsOF-pY8","pdfSize":"122540"}
