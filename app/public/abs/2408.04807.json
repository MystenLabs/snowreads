However, these multiple topological states are only\nlocalized at the corners in nonlocal systems. Here, first, we rigorously prove\nthat the multiple topological states of nonlocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)\nchains can be inherited and realized by local aperiodic chains with only the\nnearest couplings. Then, we report a new class of higher-order topological\ninsulators constructed with the local aperiodic chains, which can have any\ninteger number of 0D topological states localized at arbitrary positions in the\nwhole domain of the insulators, including within the bulk. The 0D topological\nstates are protected by the local topological marker in each direction, instead\nof the bulk multipole chiral numbers in the existing work. Our work provides\nmultiple combinations of localized corner-bulk topological states, which\nenables programmable lasers and sasers by selecting the excitation sites\nwithout altering the structure, and thus opens a new avenue to signal\nenhancement for computing and sensing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
