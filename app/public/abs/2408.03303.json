However, the gap between\nbenchmark performances and practical usability remains a significant challenge.\nThis paper presents a study aimed at understanding blind users' interaction\nwith object recognition systems for identifying and avoiding errors. Leveraging\na pre-existing object recognition system, URCam, fine-tuned for our experiment,\nwe conducted a user study involving 12 blind and low-vision participants.\nThrough in-depth interviews and hands-on error identification tasks, we gained\ninsights into users' experiences, challenges, and strategies for identifying\nerrors in camera-based assistive technologies and object recognition systems.\nDuring interviews, many participants preferred independent error review, while\nexpressing apprehension toward misrecognitions. In the error identification\ntask, participants varied viewpoints, backgrounds, and object sizes in their\nimages to avoid and overcome errors. Even after repeating the task,\nparticipants identified only half of the errors, and the proportion of errors\nidentified did not significantly differ from their first attempts. Based on\nthese insights, we offer implications for designing accessible interfaces\ntailored to the needs of blind and low-vision users in identifying object\nrecognition errors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
