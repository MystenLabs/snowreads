There exists a convergent trajectory of\nelectrons when the energy gain of electrons via direct laser acceleration can\ncompensate the energy loss via radiation. An electron beam initially around the\nconvergent trajectory evolves into the trajectory, making its occupied phase\nspace volume decrease exponentially while mean energy remain the same. This\nmechanism can be used for cooling relativistic electron beams especially those\nproduced in plasma-based acceleration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v_qbHwijO5C2q15T0XEeMBa40Fg7XVp6jRk3FmLWa6c","pdfSize":"1176415"}
