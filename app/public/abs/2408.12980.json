In this paper, we develop a\nnew dataset called \"MedDec\", which contains clinical notes of eleven different\nphenotypes (diseases) annotated by ten types of medical decisions. We introduce\nthe task of medical decision extraction, aiming to jointly extract and classify\ndifferent types of medical decisions within clinical notes. We provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of the dataset, develop a span detection model as a\nbaseline for this task, evaluate recent span detection approaches, and employ a\nfew metrics to measure the complexity of data samples. Our findings shed light\non the complexities inherent in clinical decision extraction and enable future\nwork in this area of research.
