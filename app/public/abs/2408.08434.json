This can be achieved by superimposing a spatially oscillatory\nperturbation on a guide field, then setting up an electric field perpendicular\nto the guide field to drive flow over the perturbation. However, subtle\ndistinctions in the structure of the resulting electric field can entirely\nchange the behavior of the resulting ponderomotive force. Previous work has\nshown that, in slab models, these distinctions can be explained in terms of the\npolarization of the effective wave that appears in the co-moving frame. Here we\nconsider what happens to this picture in a cylindrical system, where the\ntransformation to the co-moving (rotating) frame is not inertial. It turns out\nthat the non-inertial nature of this frame transformation can lead to\ncounterintuitive behavior, partly due to the appearance of parallel\n(magnetic-field-aligned) electric fields in the rotating frame even in cases\nwhere none existed in the laboratory frame. Apart from the academic interest of\nthis study, the practical impact lies in being better able to anticipate the\nantenna configuration on the plasma periphery of a cylindrical plasma that will\nlead to optimal ponderomotive barrier formation in the interior plasma.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
