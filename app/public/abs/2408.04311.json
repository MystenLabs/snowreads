All projects used IBM Watson as the development platform for\nbuilding tailored AI-based solutions to support workers or customers of the\nclient companies. Yet, many of the projects turned out to be significantly more\nchallenging than IBM and its clients had expected. The analysis reveals that\nproject members struggled to establish reliable meanings about the technology,\nthe project, context, and data to act upon. The project members report multiple\naspects of the projects that they were not expecting to need to make sense of\nyet were problematic. Many issues bear upon the current-generation AI's\ninherent characteristics, such as dependency on large data sets and continuous\nimprovement as more data becomes available. Those characteristics increase the\ncomplexity of the projects and call for balanced mindfulness to avoid\nunexpected problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RGi248fouxs1ZwwrGYD-lIuMHtXyEYFrkAkPxrJLqoE","pdfSize":"804388"}
