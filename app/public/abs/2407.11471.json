In particular, we\nconsider a multi-point feedback setting, where the player chooses $d + 1$\npoints in each round (where $d$ is the problem dimension) and then receives the\nvalue of the constraint function and cost function at each of these points. To\naddress this problem, we propose an algorithm that leverages forward-difference\ngradient estimation as well as optimistic and pessimistic action sets to\nachieve $\\mathcal{O}(d \\sqrt{T})$ regret and zero constraint violation under\nthe assumption that the constraint function is smooth and strongly convex. We\nthen perform a numerical study to investigate the impacts of the unknown\nconstraint and zero-order feedback on empirical performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
