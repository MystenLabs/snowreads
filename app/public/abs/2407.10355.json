We focus on\nthe square root operator and the substitution operator. We establish an\nexponential lower bound for superword-closed languages for the k-th root. For\nsubword-closed languages we analyze in detail a specific instance of the square\nroot problem for which a quadratic complexity is proven. For the substitution\noperator, we show an exponential lower bound for the general substitution. We\nthen find some conditions for which we prove a quadratic upper bound.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
