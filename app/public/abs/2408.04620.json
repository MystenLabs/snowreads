In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing functions of the form\n$h = f-c$, where $f$ is a monotone, non-negative, weakly submodular set\nfunction and $c$ is a modular function. We design a deterministic approximation\nalgorithm that runs with ${{O}}(\\frac{n}{\\epsilon}\\log \\frac{n}{\\gamma\n\\epsilon})$ oracle calls to function $h$, and outputs a set ${S}$ such that\n$h({S}) \\geq\n\\gamma(1-\\epsilon)f(OPT)-c(OPT)-\\frac{c(OPT)}{\\gamma(1-\\epsilon)}\\log\\frac{f(OPT)}{c(OPT)}$,\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the submodularity ratio of $f$. Existing algorithms for this\nproblem either admit a worse approximation ratio or have quadratic runtime. We\nalso present an approximation ratio of our algorithm for this problem with an\napproximate oracle of $f$. We validate our theoretical results through\nextensive empirical evaluations on real-world applications, including vertex\ncover and influence diffusion problems for submodular utility function $f$, and\nBayesian A-Optimal design for weakly submodular $f$. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that our algorithms efficiently achieve high-quality solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sle_gwwSACx_xKBm9nqX6EVDa_aksnl8B2lpCCgidyc","pdfSize":"1113853"}
