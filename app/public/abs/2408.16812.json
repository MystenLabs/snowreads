Interestingly, within the MFV framework, a\nnew colorless field that transforms non-trivially under a global ${\\rm\nSU}(3)^3$ quark flavor group can naturally be stable. Such a new field is thus\na promising dark matter candidate, provided it is electrically neutral. We\nextend the MFV framework for dark matter and demonstrate that dark matter can\nnaturally be multi-component across a broad parameter space. For illustration,\nwe consider a gauge singlet, flavor triplet scalar field and identify parameter\nspaces for multi-component dark matter, where only the lightest flavor\ncomponent is absolutely stable and heavy flavor components are decaying with\nlifetimes sufficiently longer than the age of the universe. Phenomenological,\ncosmological and astrophysical aspects of multi-component flavored dark matter\nare briefly discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
