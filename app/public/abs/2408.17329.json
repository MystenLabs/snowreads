Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are\nfundamental for evaluating a patient's cardiac health and are readily\navailable. Despite this, little attention has been given to the remarkable\npotential of ECG data in detecting non-cardiac conditions.\n  Methods: In our study, we used publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV-ECG-ICD\nand ECG-VIEW II) to investigate the feasibility of inferring general diagnostic\nconditions from ECG features. To this end, we trained a tree-based model\n(XGBoost) based on ECG features and basic demographic features to estimate a\nwide range of diagnoses, encompassing both cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.\n  Results: Our results demonstrate the reliability of estimating 23 cardiac as\nwell as 21 non-cardiac conditions above 0.7 AUROC in a statistically\nsignificant manner across a wide range of physiological categories. Our\nfindings underscore the predictive potential of ECG data in identifying\nwell-known cardiac conditions. However, even more striking, this research\nrepresents a pioneering effort in systematically expanding the scope of\nECG-based diagnosis to conditions not traditionally associated with the cardiac\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
