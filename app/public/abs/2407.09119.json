Frequently, however, the control fidelity is limited by optical\nphase noise. This is exacerbated in stabilized laser systems where\nhigh-frequency phase noise is an unavoidable consequence of feedback. Here we\nimplement an optical feedforward technique to suppress laser phase noise in the\nSTIRAP state transfer of ultracold RbCs molecules, across 114 THz, from a\nweakly bound Feshbach state to the rovibrational ground state. By performing\nover 100 state transfers on single molecules, we measure a significantly\nenhanced transfer efficiency of 98.7(1)% limited only by available laser\nintensity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
