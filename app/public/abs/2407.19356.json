CubeSats are often powered\nusing expensive, inflexible commercial-off-the-shelf solar panels, largely due\nto a lack of flight-qualified open-source alternatives. Here, we describe the\ndesign of customizable, deployable solar panels, offering an open-source,\ncost-effective alternative. Towards a fully open-source CubeSat, our designs\nhave mission-tailored power generation capabilities and simple electrical and\nmechanical integration. The solar panel designs were demonstrated on-orbit on\nthree satellites in the Northern SPIRIT constellation and will be on\nAlbertaSat's Ex-Alta~3 satellite, which will launch in 2025. The design files,\nassembly procedures, and best practices will be open-source-published online.\nThis work lowers the barrier of entry into space, making satellite design\neasier and less expensive -- students helping students design better\nsatellites.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KF1_3JDailQA70nte1Sgf-uVFBWwifbOmi4e1TDlpPM","pdfSize":"6449233"}
