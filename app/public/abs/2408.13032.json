Together with the metric, these\nthree fields are naturally embedded in the $\\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric\nframework of double field theory. The $\\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry uniquely\nprescribes the interactions between the extended gravitational sector and other\nmatter, leading to novel features beyond conventional string cosmology. In this\nwork we present the equations of motion for linear perturbations around\n$\\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ string cosmological backgrounds in $D=4$ under a\nscalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We obtain analytic solutions in the\nsuperhorizon limit for scalar perturbations around various homogeneous and\nisotropic background solutions, including some candidate models for bouncing\ncosmologies. The generalized energy-momentum tensor includes source terms for\nthe $B$-field and dilaton, and we show how the resulting generalized\nconservation laws modify the conditions for conservation of curvature\nperturbations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
