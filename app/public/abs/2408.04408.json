The emission spectrum deviates from the pure thermal\nspectrum, but conforms to the unitary principle of quantum mechanics. Our\nresults support the conservation of information.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
