In this paper, we extend this theorem by exploring the\neigenvalue perturbation of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix with fixed diagonals,\nwhich is referred to as the continuity of the Schur-Horn mapping. We introduce\na concept called strong Schur-Horn continuity, characterized by minimal\nconstraints on the perturbation. We demonstrate that several categories of\nmatrices exhibit strong Schur-Horn continuity. Leveraging this notion, along\nwith a majorization constraint on the perturbation, we prove the Schur-Horn\ncontinuity for general symmetric (Hermitian) matrices. The Schur-Horn\ncontinuity finds applications in oblique manifold optimization related to\nquantum computing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
