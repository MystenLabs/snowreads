Some new\nsecond-order constraint qualifications and second-order quasi-normality are\nintroduced for (MPSC), which are crucial to establish the second-order\nnecessary conditions and the error bound of (MPSC). We explore the relations\namong these constraint qualifications in term of (MPSC). The characterizations\nof Mordukhovich stationary point and strong stationary point of (MPSC) are\nderived under some mild conditions. A sufficient condition is provided for a\nMordukhovich stationary point of (MPSC) being a strong stationary point. The\nstrong second-order necessary conditions as well as weak second-order necessary\nconditions of (MPSC) are established under these weak constraint\nqualifications. Finally, we obtain the local exact penalty of (MPSC) under the\nlocal error bound or some constraint qualifications in term of (MPSC).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
