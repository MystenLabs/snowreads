As a\nconsequence, for electrons occupying bottom conduction bands, a carrier spin\nflip occurs only if there is a simultaneous change of valley. However, very\nlittle is known about the intra-valley spin relaxation processes. In this work\nwe have performed stationary and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements\nin high quality WSe$_2$ monolayers. Our experiments highlight an efficient\nrelaxation from bright to dark excitons, due to a fast intra-valley electron\ntransfer from the top to the bottom conduction band with opposite spins. A\ncombination of experiments and theoretical analysis allows us to infer a spin\nrelaxation time of about $\\tau_s\\sim10~$ps, driven by the interplay between\n$\\Gamma$-valley chiral phonons and spin-orbit mixing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
