We investigate whether maximisation, as used for the profiling, or\nintegration, as used for the marginalisation, is more appropriate. To report\nresults we recommend the marginal posterior distribution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MnKsP7ufP5UfRlNpDLKdXyKGV49fr0oNjSNE7CwOyRE","pdfSize":"5675152"}
