Applying it to an image segmentation task of detecting railway tracks\nin images, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully identify\nweaknesses of the tested DNN regarding particular combinations of common\nperturbations (e.g., rain, fog, blur, noise) on specific clusters of test\nimages.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
