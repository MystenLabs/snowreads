Previous works mostly\nfocused on recognizing and localizing welding seams one by one, leading to\ninferior efficiency in modeling the workpiece. This paper proposes a novel\nframework capable of multiple weld seams extraction using both RGB images and\n3D point clouds. The RGB image is used to obtain the region of interest by\napproximately localizing the weld seams, and the point cloud is used to achieve\nthe fine-edge extraction of the weld seams within the region of interest using\nregion growth. Our method is further accelerated by using a pre-trained deep\nlearning model to ensure both efficiency and generalization ability. The\nperformance of the proposed method has been comprehensively tested on various\nworkpieces featuring both linear and curved weld seams and in physical\nexperiment systems. The results showcase considerable potential for real-world\nindustrial applications, emphasizing the method's efficiency and effectiveness.\nVideos of the real-world experiments can be found at\nhttps://youtu.be/pq162HSP2D4.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
