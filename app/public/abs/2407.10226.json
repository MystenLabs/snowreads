This paper proposes a novel dual-branch collaborative\nunpaired dehazing model (DCM-dehaze) to address this issue. The proposed method\nconsists of two collaborative branches: dehazing and contour constraints.\nSpecifically, we design a dual depthwise separable convolutional module (DDSCM)\nto enhance the information expressiveness of deeper features and the\ncorrelation to shallow features. In addition, we construct a bidirectional\ncontour function to optimize the edge features of the image to enhance the\nclarity and fidelity of the image details. Furthermore, we present feature\nenhancers via a residual dense architecture to eliminate redundant features of\nthe dehazing process and further alleviate the domain deviation problem.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method reaches the\nstate-of-the-art.
