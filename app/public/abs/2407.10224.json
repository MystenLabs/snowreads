The\ntechnical problem we investigate is that of allocating compression resources\nover time such that the control performance degradation induced by compression\nis minimized. This can be formulated as an optimization problem to find the\noptimal resource allocation policy. Under mild assumptions, this optimization\nproblem can be proved to have the same well-known structure as in [1], allowing\nthe optimal resource allocation policy to be determined in closed-form. The\nobtained insights behind the optimal policy provide clear guidelines on the\nissue of \"when to communicate\" and \"how to communicate\" in dynamical systems\nwith restricted communication resources. The obtained simulation results\nconfirm the efficiency of the proposed allocation policy and illustrate the\ngain over the widely used uniform rate allocation policy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
