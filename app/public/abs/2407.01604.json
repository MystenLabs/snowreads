We\nstudied XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the nearby LBG analog Haro 11,\nwhich contains two X-ray-bright sources, X1 and X2. Both sources exhibit Lyman\ncontinuum (LyC) leakage, particularly X2. We analyzed the X-ray variability\nusing principal component analysis (PCA) and performed spectral modeling of the\nX1 and X2 observations made with the Chandra ACIS-S instrument. The PCA\ncomponent, which contributes to the X-ray variability, is apparently associated\nwith variable emission features, likely from ionized superwinds. Our spectral\nanalysis of the Chandra data indicates that the fainter X-ray source, X2 (X-ray\nluminosity $L_{\\rm X} \\sim 4 \\times 10^{40} $ erg s$^{-1}$), the one with\nhigher LyC leakage, has a much lower absorbing column ($N_{\\rm H} \\sim 1.2\n\\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) than the heavily absorbed luminous source X1\n($L_{\\rm X} \\sim 9 \\times 10^{40} $ erg s$^{-1}$ and $N_{\\rm H} \\sim 11.5\n\\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$). We conclude that X2 is likely less covered by\nabsorbing material, which may be a result of powerful superwinds clearing\ngalactic channels and facilitating the escape of LyC radiation. Much deeper\nX-ray observations are required to validate the presence of potential\nsuperwinds and determine their implications for the LyC escape.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
