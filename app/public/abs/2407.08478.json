Major ingredients of\nthe proofs are an excursion decomposition of sample paths, a generalised\ndetailed-balance condition, and representations of our processes in terms of\nsuperpositions of simpler processes. An overarching role is played by Siegmund\nduality, which allows us to invert the relationship between the processes.\n  We apply our results to a pair of ancestral processes in population genetics,\nnamely the killed ancestral selection graph and the pruned lookdown ancestral\nselection graph, in a finite population setting and its diffusion limit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
