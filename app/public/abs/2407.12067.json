Several research efforts have tried to address this\nchallenge by leveraging the fact that large portions of the video undergo very\nlittle change across frames, leading to redundant computations in frame-based\nvideo processing. In particular, some works leverage pixel or semantic\ndifferences across frames, however, this yields limited latency benefits with\nsignificantly increased memory overhead. This paper, in contrast, presents a\nstrategy for masking regions in video frames that leverages the semantic\ninformation in images and the temporal correlation between frames to\nsignificantly reduce FLOPs and latency with little to no penalty in performance\nover baseline models. In particular, we demonstrate that by leveraging\nextracted features from previous frames, ViT backbones directly benefit from\nregion masking, skipping up to 80% of input regions, improving FLOPs and\nlatency by 3.14x and 1.5x. We improve memory and latency over the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) by 2.3x and 1.14x, while maintaining similar detection\nperformance. Additionally, our approach demonstrates promising results on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and provides latency improvements over the\nSOTA up to 1.3x using specialized computational kernels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
