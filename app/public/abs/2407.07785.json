The states\nin our game can represent positional advantages in physical conflict such as\nhigh ground or camouflage, or product characteristics that lend an advantage\nover competing sellers in a duopoly. We study the equilibria of the game as a\nfunction of the topological and geometric properties of the underlying graph.\nOur main result characterizes the expected payoff of both players starting from\nany initial position, under the assumption that the graph does not contain\ncertain types of small cycles. This characterization leverages the block-cut\ntree of the graph, a construction that describes the topology of the\nbiconnected components of the graph. We identify three natural types of\n(on-path) pure equilibria, and characterize when these equilibria exist under\nthe above assumptions. On the geometric side, we show that strongly connected\nouterplanar graphs with undirected girth at least 4 always support some of\nthese types of on-path pure equilibria. Finally, we show that a data structure\ndescribing all pure equilibria can be efficiently computed for these games.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
