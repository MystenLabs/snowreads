This concept extends the notion of purely\ninseparable field extensions to the more general context of extensions of\ncommutative rings. We use differential operators methods to provide a\ncharacterization for a ring extension to be purely inseparable in terms of a\ncondition on certain modules of differential operators associated to the ring\nextension. This approach is also used to recover an already known\ncharacterization involving the modules of principal parts.\n  Next, given a purely inseparable ring extension $A\\subset C$, we aim to\nunderstand which intermediate rings $A\\subset B\\subset C$ satisfy the property\nthat both $A\\subset B$ and $B\\subset C$ are both flat extensions by considering\nonly the subalgebra $\\operatorname{End}_B(C)$ of $\\operatorname{End}_A(C)$. To\nachieve this, we prove a generalization of the Jacobson-Bourbaki theorem on\nGalois correspondence for field extensions to the setting of commutative ring\nextensions with homeomorphic spectra.\n  Finally, given a tower of ring extensions $A\\subset B\\subset C$, we consider\nthe question of whether the fact that two of the three extensions $A\\subset C$,\n$A\\subset B$, and $B\\subset C$ are purely inseparable implies that the third\none is also purely inseparable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
