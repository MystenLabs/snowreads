This framework represents a non-extensive\ngeneralization of classical statistical mechanics, inspired by the symmetries\nof relativity and offering a novel perspective on black hole thermodynamics.\nOur focus is on investigating how Kaniadakis entropy modifies the thermodynamic\nphase space of rotating AdS black holes. To achieve this, we analyze three\nprominent rotating AdS black hole systems: the Kerr AdS black hole, the\nKerr-Sen AdS black hole, and the Kerr-Newman AdS black hole. We assess their\nthermodynamic quantities, phase transitions, thermodynamic topology and\nthermodynamic geometry within the Kaniadakis statistical framework. Our\nanalysis reveals notable deviations from the behaviour predicted by traditional\nGibbs-Boltzmann(GB) statistics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
