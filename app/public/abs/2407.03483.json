Here we develop an\ninnovative powerful, rigorous and flexible framework for asymptotic\nhomogenisation of dynamics at the finite scale separation of real physics, with\nproven results underpinned by modern dynamical systems theory. The novel\nsystematic approach removes most of the usual assumptions, whether implicit or\nexplicit, of other methodologies. By no longer assuming averages the\nmethodology constructs so-called multi-continuum or micromorphic\nhomogenisations systematically based upon the microscale physics. The developed\nframework and approach enables a user to straightforwardly choose and create\nsuch homogenisations with clear physical and theoretical support, and of highly\ncontrollable accuracy and fidelity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2_Wd7NI-IdRiygOPUXfGsJ0mT8F7GjaX9bCadrwIJEc","pdfSize":"1777912"}
