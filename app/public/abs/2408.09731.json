In\nscenarios where CT imaging is not an option, reconstructing CT scans from\nX-rays can offer a viable alternative. In this paper, we introduce an\ninnovative method for 3D CT reconstruction utilizing biplanar X-rays. Distinct\nfrom previous research that relies on conventional image generation techniques,\nour approach leverages a conditional diffusion process to tackle the task of\nreconstruction. More precisely, we employ a diffusion-based probabilistic model\ntrained to produce 3D CT images based on orthogonal biplanar X-rays. To improve\nthe structural integrity of the reconstructed images, we incorporate a novel\nprojection loss function. Experimental results validate that our proposed\nmethod surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in both visual image\nquality and multiple evaluative metrics. Specifically, our technique achieves a\nhigher Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.83, a relative increase of 10\\%,\nand a lower Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 83.43, which represents a\nrelative decrease of 25\\%.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
