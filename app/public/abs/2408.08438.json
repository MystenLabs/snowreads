This study investigates the impact of gender and acoustic\nvariables on decision-making, confidence, and trust through a crowdsourced\nexperiment. We compared visualization-only representations of uncertainty to\ntext-forward and speech-forward bimodal representations, including multiple\nsynthetic voices across gender. Speech-forward representations led to an\nincrease in risky decisions, and text-forward representations led to lower\nconfidence. Contrary to prior work, speech-forward forecasts did not receive\nhigher ratings of trust. Higher normalized pitch led to a slight increase in\ndecision confidence, but other voice characteristics had minimal impact on\ndecisions and trust. An exploratory analysis of accented speech showed\nconsistent results with the main experiment and additionally indicated lower\ntrust ratings for information presented in Indian and Kenyan accents. The\nresults underscore the importance of considering acoustic and contextual\nfactors in presentation of data uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N85e8Ilox4r7W3vScHCD2Ku79-Dm9jjvjWfAbdj8hE0","pdfSize":"3162042"}
