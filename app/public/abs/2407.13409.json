We\nobtained an estimated leading solution of scale factor in CSVS proportional to\n$t^{2/3}$ follow similar diversification as demonstrated by Semiclassical\nEinstein Equation (SCEE) of gravity in matter dominated universe. We also\nstudied the validity of SCEE in CSVS. By determining the quantum fluctuation\nfor CSVS validity of uncertainty relation for FRW Universe also computed. The\nresults shows that Quantum fluctuations doesn't depend on coherent parameter\n$\\Upsilon$ as uncertainty relation doesn't effected by the displacement of\n$\\Upsilon$ in phase space. We study the production of particles in CSVS for\noscillating massive inflaton in flat FRW universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ic9EdetdET6j-uayABZb2OsUndSGbPbuW2oW84tfQzw","pdfSize":"4150909"}
