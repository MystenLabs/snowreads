The normalization poses technical\nchallenges in analyzing the collective behavior due to the absence of\nconservation of momentum. We study three quantitative estimates for the\ndiscrete-time MT model considering the first-order Euler discretization. First,\nwe provide a sufficient framework leading to the asymptotic mono-cluster\nflocking. The proposed framework is given in terms of coupling strength,\ncommunication weight function, and initial data. Second, we show that the\ncontinuous transition from the discrete MT model to the continuous MT model can\nbe made uniformly in time using the finite-time convergence result and\nasymptotic flocking estimate. Third, we present uniform-in-time stability\nestimates for the discrete MT model. We also provide several numerical examples\nand compare them with analytical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3PN-RuDvWQZ50cUY4HUJn-0BN_XvJsWWKqvl1WNbhQQ","pdfSize":"1970049"}
