Instead of relying purely on\noptimization or machine learning, the ICNN-Assisted OPF is a combination of\noptimization and machine learning. It utilizes ICNN to learn the nonlinear but\nconvex mapping from control variables to system state variables, followed by\nembedding into constrained optimization problems as convex constraints.\nUtilizing a designed ICNN structure, a fast primal-dual gradient method is\ndeveloped to solve the ICNN-Assisted OPF, with the chain rule of deep learning\napplied to accelerate the algorithmic implementation. Convergence and optimally\nproperties of the algorithm design are further established. Finally, different\ndistribution network applications are discussed and proposed by means of the\nICNN-Assisted OPF.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
