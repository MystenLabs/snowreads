Our experiments show that\nour implementation performs up to about 352.5 times faster than OpenSpiel's\nPython implementation and up to about 22.2 times faster than OpenSpiel's C++\nimplementation and the speedup becomes more pronounced as the size of the game\nbeing solved grows.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t4re0uf40VlmsrVDU76vG81WpG1mIFzspOnOCPGeM9I","pdfSize":"902684"}
