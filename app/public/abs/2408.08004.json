It is still unclear about the precise nature of the\naccreting compact object in IC 10 X-1, although it looks more like a black hole\nthan a neutron star. In this work, we use a binary population synthesis method\nto simulate the formation of IC 10 X-1 like binaries by assuming different\ncommon-envelope ejection efficiencies. This work represents a big step forward\nover previous studies since we adopt new criteria of mass-transfer stability.\nThese criteria allow the formation of IC 10 X-1 like systems without\nexperiencing common envelope evolution. Based on our calculations, we propose\nthat the compact object in IC 10 X-1 is a black hole with mass of $\\sim\n10-30M_\\odot$ and the progenitor evolution of this binary probably just\nexperienced stable mass transfer.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
