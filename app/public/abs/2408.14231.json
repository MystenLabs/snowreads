We simulate potential microlensing events from a sample of\nthe TESS Candidate Target List(CTL) stars by assuming different observational\ntime spans(or different numbers of sectors for each star) and a wide range of\nlens masses, i.e., $M_{\\rm l}\\in [0.1M_{\\oplus},~2 M_{\\odot}]$. On average, the\nmicrolensing optical depth and the event rate for CTL stars are $\\simeq\n0.2\\times 10^{-9}$, and $\\Gamma_{\\rm{TESS}}\\simeq0.6\\times10^{-9}$ per star per\nday, respectively. The microlensing optical depth decreases by increasing the\nCTL priority, whereas the efficiency for detecting their microlensing signals\nenhances with the priority. Additionally, we simulate the microlensing events\nfrom the TESS Full-Frame Images(FFIs) stars extracted from the\n\\texttt{TESS}-\\texttt{SPOC} pipeline. The optical depth and event rate for\nthese stars are on average $\\simeq 1$-$3\\times 10^{-9}$, and\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm{TESS}}\\simeq 1$-$4\\times 10^{-9}$ per star per day, and their\nhighest values occur for sector $12$. The total number of microlensing events\nfor the CTL stars is $N_{\\rm e, \\rm{tot}}\\sim0.03$, whereas for the FFIs' stars\nnumber of events per star during $27.4$-day observing windows is $\\hat{N}_{\\rm\ne, \\rm{tot}}\\simeq1.4 \\times 10^{-6}$. Based on four criteria we extract the\ndetectable microlensing events and evaluate the detection efficiencies. The\nhighest efficiency for detecting microlensing events from the TESS data occurs\nfor the lens mass $\\log_{10}[M_{\\rm l}(M_{\\odot})] \\in [-4.5$,~$-2.5]$, i.e.,\nsuper-Earth to Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets(FFPs). The detectable\nmicrolensing events from the TESS stars are significantly affected by both\nfinite-source and parallax effects.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IRJjrxuRuYdgxVG_8jacMRHXHmWQcP76Nuqn22vIGt8","pdfSize":"4172689"}
