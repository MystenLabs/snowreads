We\nargue that the line broad wings are emitted at the tmperature of $\\sim300$ K.\nThe flux excess in the red wing of [Ar II] line is reproduced by the line\nphotons scattering off the optically thin uniform dust component with the grain\nsize of 1 - 2 mcm and the total mass of\n$\\mbox{(several)}\\times10^{-3}\\,M{\\odot}$. The dusty opaque clumps containing\nalmost all the dust of SN~1987A have a low occultation optical depth and line\nphoton scattering on dusty clumps do not contribute noticeably in the red wing.\nThe additional heating might be related to ionization losses of relativistic\nprotons.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AntwrlGvFN4yGTrRB6uCcS96QIDbZT12ER2EwfV7FTo","pdfSize":"167812"}
