Due to recent progress in controlling the\namplitudes of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR),\ntwo vital ingredients for PMMs, experimental investigations of PMMs have gained\nsignificant interest. Previously, analytic conditions for the \"sweet spots\"\nthat result in PMMs have focused on systems with infinite Zeeman energy. Here,\nwe derive analytically a sweet spot condition for PMMs in a system with finite\nZeeman energy in the absence of Coulomb interaction. We then consider two\nnumerical models, one in which ECT and CAR are transmitted via superconducting\nbulk states and one in which they are transmitted via an Andreev bound state.\nIn both models we find numerically near zero-energy states that are highly\nlocalized, even in the presence of finite Coulomb interaction. These states can\nbe related to the analytic sweet spot derived in this work. However, we also\nfind that in these more realistic models such states do not perfectly satisfy\nthe characteristics of PMMs, rather they exist only within a \"region of\nthreshold\" where PMM characteristics are approximately achieved.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
