We\nfocus on the communication bandwidth cost analysis presented in the original\nwork and identify potential issues that require clarification or revision. The\nproblem at hand is the need to address inconsistencies and miscalculations\nfound in the analysis, particularly in the categorization of costs into three\nscenarios based on the relationship between matrix dimensions and processor\ncount. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse in the field and pave\nthe way for further improvements in this area of research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
