By\nstudying the evolution of negative Sobolev norms, we show an anomalous\nregularization effect induced by the dynamics: distributional initial\nconditions immediately become functions of positive Sobolev regularity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
