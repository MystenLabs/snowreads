Here we investigate the unusual re-entrant ferromagnetic state in\nSmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ using ac-susceptibility in the frequency range 0.1 Hz - 1 kHz.\nSurprisingly, we find Debye-like relaxation with an energy barrier $E_B \\approx\n840$ $k_B$ and attempt frequencies in the THz range. We discuss the origin of\nthis resonance and, in particular, the implication for single-spin resonance of\nSm spins.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
