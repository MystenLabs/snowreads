Repeated repeated\nsignificance competes well with methods built on assumptions about the test --\nassumptions that may be impossible to evaluate a priori and may require extra\ndata to evaluate empirically.\n  Instead, requiring repeated significance allows the data itself to prove\ndirectly that the required results are not due to chance alone. We explain how\nto apply tests with repeated significance to continuously monitor unbounded\ntests -- tests that do not have an a priori bound on running time or number of\nobservations. We show that it is impossible to maintain a constant requirement\nfor significance for unbounded tests, but that we can come arbitrarily close to\nthat goal.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"quxYvzvYLsrZKadqw4JfXk_E8JDjYio_c5CxEes49oM","pdfSize":"608530"}
