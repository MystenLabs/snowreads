We shall obtain a description of\nthe cohomology of $E$ when $B=X_\\Gamma:=\\Gamma\\backslash X,\nE=Y_\\Gamma:=\\Gamma\\backslash Y$ and $F=K/H$, a flag variety, where $Y=G/H$ and\n$X=G/K$, a Hermitian globally symmetric space of non-compact type with $G$\nbeing a real, connected, non-compact, semisimple linear Lie group with no\ncompact factors and simply connected complexification, $K\\subset G$, a maximal\ncompact subgroup, $H=Z_K(S)$, the centralizer in $K$ of a toral subgroup\n$S\\subseteq K$ containing $Z(K)$, the center of $K$ and $\\Gamma\\subset G$, a\nuniform and torsionless lattice in $G$. We also obtain a description of the\nPicard group of $Y_\\Gamma$ and $X_{\\Gamma}$, for which the complexification of\n$G$ need not be simply connected. Moreover when $G$ is simple, we obtain the\nvalues of $ q$ for which $H^{p,q}(X_\\Gamma)$ vanishes when $p=0,1$. This\nextends the results of R. Parthasarathy from $1980$, who considered (partially)\nthe case $p=0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nsKyMkRNs0Pnd9d2GWFaW7nFB9eP1Ba4i1t-L9g4kwk","pdfSize":"561075","objectId":"0xc910d6554a9307dc783c4f09c28e9f0da263c04ca0691371b5ef225bc4f9a1c8","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
