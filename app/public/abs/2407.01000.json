We implement the variational quantum eigensolver\nalgorithm to calculate the molecular ground-state energy of the H2 molecule and\nexperimentally demonstrated it on an NMR quantum processor. Further, we\nsimulate the excited states of the H2 molecule using the variational quantum\ndeflation algorithm and experimentally demonstrate it on the same NMR quantum\nprocessor. We also develop the first simulation of the energy calculation of\nthe H2 molecule using only a single qubit, and verify the results on an NMR\nquantum computer. Our experimental results demonstrate that only a single NMR\nqubit suffices to calculate the molecular energies of the H2 molecule to the\ndesired accuracy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UHQirSHBUCApl99MwiTgNd6au97j1l_w2ZFdLJqmA2c","pdfSize":"1443912"}
