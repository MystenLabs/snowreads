Historically, these studies go back to the publications: Regge\n(Nuovo Cimento 14, 1959), Newton (J. Math. Phys. 3, 1962) and Sabatier (J.\nMath. Phys. 7, 1966). Our review is based on the works: Grinevich, Novikov\n(Commun. Math. Phys. 174, 1995; Eurasian Journal of Mathematical and Computer\nApplications 9(4), 2021; Russian Math. Surveys, 77(6), 2022). Results of the\nfirst of these works include examples of transparent at fixed energy potentials\nfrom the Schwartz class in two dimensions. The two others works include the\nresult that, for compactly supported multipoint potentials of Bethe - Peierls -\nThomas type in two and three dimensions, any positive energy is a transmission\neigenvalue of infinite multiplicity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
