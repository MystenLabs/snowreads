Motivated by challenges related to the size of commercial\ndatabase schemata and the deployability of business intelligence solutions, we\npropose an approach that dynamically retrieves input database information and\nuses abstract syntax trees to select few-shot examples for in-context learning.\n  Furthermore, we investigate the extent to which an in-parallel semantic\nparser can be leveraged for generating $\\textit{approximated}$ versions of the\nexpected SQL queries, to support our retrieval. We take this approach to the\nextreme--we adapt a model consisting of less than $500$M parameters, to act as\nan extremely efficient approximator, enhancing it with the ability to process\nschemata in a parallelised manner. We apply our approach to monolingual and\ncross-lingual benchmarks for semantic parsing, showing improvements over\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Comprehensive experiments highlight the\ncontribution of modules involved in this retrieval-augmented generation\nsetting, revealing interesting directions for future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
