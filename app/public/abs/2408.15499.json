We analyze new data on the previously considered\ntwo dozen solar-type stars with identified cycles, adding the results of\nstudying the long-term variability of two more solar-type G stars and 15 cooler\nM dwarfs with planets. If the cyclic activity is determined by a strong tidal\ninfluence of the planet, then the cycle duration of the star should be\nsynchronized with the period of orbital revolution of the planet. We calculate\nthe gravitational effect of planets on their parent stars. The results obtained\nconfirm the earlier conclusion that exoplanets do not influence the formation\nof the stellar cycle. We examine the change in the position of the barycenter\nof the solar system relative to the center of the Sun over 420 years. A\ncomparison of these data with the most reliable 120-year SSN (sunspot number)\nseries as the index of solar activity has shown that they are not synchronized.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
