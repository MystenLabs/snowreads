Previous work\ntypically considered replicating behavior of GMM-HMM based systems, but the\nbehavior of more modern posterior-based neural network acoustic models is not\nthe same and requires adjustments to the error prediction model. In this work,\nwe extend a prior phonetic confusion based model for predicting speech\nrecognition errors in two ways: first, we introduce a sampling-based paradigm\nthat better simulates the behavior of a posterior-based acoustic model. Second,\nwe investigate replacing the confusion matrix with a sequence-to-sequence model\nin order to introduce context dependency into the prediction. We evaluate the\nerror predictors in two ways: first by predicting the errors made by a\nSwitchboard ASR system on unseen data (Fisher), and then using that same\npredictor to estimate the behavior of an unrelated cloud-based ASR system on a\nnovel task. Sampling greatly improves predictive accuracy within a 100-guess\nparadigm, while the sequence model performs similarly to the confusion matrix.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
