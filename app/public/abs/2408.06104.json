For mesoscopic fluids consisting of a small number of\natoms, second-order corrections can become significant. We investigate here\nspecifically superfluids at vanishing temperature, and identify relevant\nsecond-order terms of quantum origin that contribute already in a static\nsituation. The general form of these terms arises from an extension of the\nGross-Pitaevskii theory. In the context of density functional theory, they are\nnamed after C. von Weizs\\\"acker. We assess the influence of these terms on\nnumerical solutions of second-order fluid dynamic equations for the expansion\nof a mesoscopic ultra-cold Fermi gas released from an anisotropic harmonic trap\nin two spatial dimensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
