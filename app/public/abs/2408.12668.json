The framework performs\nrefinement on abstract system inputs rather than abstract states, avoiding\nproblems of previous frameworks. We formalise input-based refinement by\nintroducing the concept of generating automata, and prove that our framework is\nsound, monotone, and complete. We evaluate the usefulness of the framework on\nits implementation in our free and open-source formal verification tool.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
