However, in certain scenarios\nwhere effective relay node deployment is often not feasible, such as harsh\nenvironments with extremely poor infrastructure and emergency conditions,\neffective time transfer without inline amplifiers becomes crucial. In this\nsituation, the maximum transmission distance is limited by the receiver's\nmeasurement capability, particularly its ability to amplify the signal. Here we\npropose a theoretical model, giving a technical lower bound of the detected\nsignal stability at different transmission distances, induced by limited\ngain-bandwidth products. The results under common gain-bandwidth products show\nthat while for shorter transmission distances, stability is mainly limited by\nthe background noise of the time interval counter, for longer distances\nreaching the scale of 300 kilometers, the technical lower bound is below the\nlevel of 10 nanoseconds without any inline amplification devices. Therefore,\nthe given technical bound offers guidance on managing the balance between\ndistance and stability, together with the optimization of the receiver in\nlong-distance time transfer without inline amplification.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
