The B field\nwithin the CND exhibits a coherent spiral pattern. Applying the model described\nby Wardle and Ko\\ddot{o}nigl 1990 (WK model) to the observed B field pattern,\nit favors gas-pressure-dominant models without dismissing a gas-and-B field\ncomparable model, leading us to estimate the B-field strength in the ionized\ncavity around Sgr A* as 0.24 + 0.05 mG. Analysis -0.04 based on the WK model\nfurther allows us to derive representative B-field strengths for the radial,\nazimuthal, and vertical components as (Br,B{\\phi},Bz) = (0.4 \\pm 0.1,-0.7 \\pm\n0.2,0.2 \\pm 0.05) mG, respectively. A key finding is that the |{\\phi}|\ncomponent is dominant over Br and Bz components, consistent with the spiral\nmorphology, indicating that the CND' s B-field is predominantly toroidal,\npossibly shaped by accretion dynamics. Considering the turbulent pressure,\nestimated plasma \\{beta} values indicate the effective gas pressure should\nsurpass the magnetic pressure. Assessing the CND of our MWG in the\ntoroidal-and-vertical stability parameter space, we propose that such an\n\"effective\" magnetoro-tational instability (MRI) may likely be active. The\nestimated maximum unstable wavelength, {\\lambda}max = 0.1 \\pm 0.1 pc, is\nsmaller than the CND' s scale height (0.2 \\pm 0.1 pc), which indicates the\npotential for the effective MRI intermittent cycles of \\sim 10^{6} years, which\nshould profoundly affect the CND's evolution, considering the estimated mass\naccretion rate of 10^{-2}M_{\\odot} yr^{-1} to the Sgr A*.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
