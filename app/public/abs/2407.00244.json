The vertices are the plane spanning paths of $ S $ and there is an edge\nbetween two vertices if the two corresponding paths differ by two edges (one\nremoved, one added). Since 2007, this graph is conjectured to be connected but\nno proof has been found. In this paper, we prove several results to support the\nconjecture. Mainly, we show that if all but one point of $ S $ are in convex\nposition, then the graph is connected with diameter at most $ 2 | S | $ and\nthat for $ | S | \\geq 3 $ every connected component has at least $ 3 $\nvertices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ATUnF_bylXuuzTZCveJ4YCXLrgkJc-Ql7f6vIUjae84","pdfSize":"722725","objectId":"0x11f946b753ecd61d28a203b9bee70a2dab62f1c2868cbe9e25d62550ad256eb2","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
