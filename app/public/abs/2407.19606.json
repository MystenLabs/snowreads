By building the\ntheory of average Lyapunov functions, we formulate general criteria based on\nthe signs of Lyapunov exponents that guarantee extinction ($X_t \\to\n\\mathcal{M}_0$ as $t \\to \\infty$). Additionally, we provide applications to a\nstochastic SIS epidemic model on a network with regime-switching, a stochastic\ndifferential equation version of the Lorenz system, a general class of\ndiscrete-time ecological models, and stochastic Kolmogorov systems. In many\nexamples we improve existing results by removing unnecessary assumptions or\nproviding sharper criteria for the extinction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YMP60_mpVkRiKL-XCqzkzOcS2g9ScAH0kjzPSJce_F0","pdfSize":"927132"}
