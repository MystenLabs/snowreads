Although numerical computations applying methods such as the finite\ndifference method are well known, to the best of our knowledge, there are no\nexamples of applying particle-based methods like the SPH method to this\nproblem. Therefore, we applied the SPH method to the Navier-Stokes equations,\nformulated with the stream function and vorticity as unknown functions, and\nconducted numerical computations of high Reynolds number cavity flow. The\nresults confirmed the reproduction of small vortices and demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the scheme using the stream function and vorticity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
