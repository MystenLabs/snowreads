We also prove that the group of conformal\ntransformations of a non-conformally flat simply connected homogeneous plane\nwave $(M,g)$ consists of homotheties, hence it is a 1-dimensional extension of\nthe group of isometries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
