We consider a\nsetting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first\npresent a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by\nconstructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the\nLipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation\nperformance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation\nlearning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF\nkernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The\nproposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that\nfits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training\ndataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM\nspace, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping\nfunction in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses\nbenchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
