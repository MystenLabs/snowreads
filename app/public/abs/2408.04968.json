However, experimental studies on\nspin manipulation and the resulting propagation of these states are lacking.\nHere, we demonstrate experimentally spin manipulation of topological edge\nstates by the boundary conditions of the one-dimensional path. Armchair\nboundaries at the endpoints of the path induce spin-flipping back-scattering,\nresulting in a novel one-dimensional resonance -- traveling resonance.\nRemarkably, we demonstrate lasing of this one-dimensional traveling resonance.\nOur findings hold significant potential for practical applications in spin\nmanipulation of light.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
