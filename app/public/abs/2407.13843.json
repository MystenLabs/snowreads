The conductance ($\\sigma\\equiv \\kappa/L$) is calculated for\ntypical values of $\\alpha$, temperature $T$ and lattice size $L$. For large\n$L$, the results can be collapsed into an universal $q$-stretched exponential\nform, namely $L^{\\delta_{\\alpha}} \\sigma \\propto\ne_{q_{\\alpha}}^{-B_{\\alpha}(L^{\\gamma_{\\alpha}}T)^{\\eta_{\\alpha}}}$, where\n$e_q^z\\equiv [1+ (1-q)z]^{1/(1-q)}$. The parameters\n$(\\gamma_{\\alpha},\\delta_{\\alpha},B_{\\alpha}, \\eta_{\\alpha})$ are\n$\\alpha$-dependent, and $q_{\\alpha}$ is the index of the $q$-stretched\nexponential. This form is achievable due to the ratio $\\eta_{\\alpha}/(q-1)$\nbeing almost constant with respect to the lattice size $L$. Two distinct\nregimes are identified: for $0 \\le \\alpha < 2$, the Fourier law is violated,\nwhereas for $\\alpha\\ge 2$, it is satisfied. These findings provide significant\ninsights into heat conduction mechanisms in systems with long-range\ninteractions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
