In\nthe first design, when interviewers are responsible for either face-to-face or\ntelephone mode, we examine whether there are mode differences in interviewer\nvariances for 1) sensitive political questions, 2) international items, 3) and\nitem missing indicators on international items, using the Arab Barometer wave 6\nJordan data. In the second design, we draw on Health and Retirement Study (HRS)\n2016 core survey data to examine the question on three topics when interviewers\nare responsible for both modes. The topics cover 1) the CESD depression scale,\n2) interviewer observations, and 3) the physical activity scale. To account for\nthe lack of interpenetrated designs in both data sources, we include\nrespondent-level covariates in our models. We find significant differences in\ninterviewer variances on one item (twelve items in total) in the Arab Barometer\nstudy; whereas for HRS, the results are three out of eighteen. Overall, we find\nthe magnitude of the interviewer variances larger in FTF than TEL on sensitive\nitems. We conduct simulations to understand the power to detect mode effects in\nthe typically modest interviewer sample sizes.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
