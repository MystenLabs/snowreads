To address this issue,\nwe propose a cross-spectral analysis tool for bivariate graph signals. The main\ngoal of this study is to extend the scope of spectral analysis of graph signals\nto multivariate graph signals. In this study, we define joint weak stationarity\ngraph processes and introduce graph cross-spectral density and coherence for\nmultivariate graph processes. We propose several estimators for the\ncross-spectral density and investigate the theoretical properties of the\nproposed estimators. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed estimators through numerical experiments, including simulation studies\nand a real data application. Finally, as an interesting extension, we discuss\nrobust spectral analysis of graph signals in the presence of outliers.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
