As a promising area, this paper studies an MTL-based control approach\nconsidering Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Task compliance is measured via the\nRobustness Degree (RD) which is computed by using the STL semantics. A suitable\nmethodology is provided to solve the learning and testing stages, with an\nappropriate treatment of the non-convex terms in the quadratic objective\nfunction and using Sequential Convex Programming based on trust region update.\nIn the learning stage, an ensemble of tasks is generated from deterministic\ngoals to obtain a strong initializer for the testing stage, where related tasks\nare solved with a larger impact of perturbation. The methodology demonstrates\nto be robust in two dynamical systems showing results that meet the task\nspecifications in a few shots for the testing stage, even for highly perturbed\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
