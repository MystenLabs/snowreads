{"id":"2407.20305","title":"A Short History of the First 50 Years: from the GRB Prompt Emission and\n  Afterglow Discoveries to the Multimessenger Era","authors":"Filippo Frontera","authorsParsed":[["Frontera","Filippo",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2024 13:49:06 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-31","timestamp":1722260946000,"abstract":"  More than fifty years have been elapsed from the first discovery of a Gamma\nRay Burst (GRB) with the American Vela satellites, and more than twenty-five\nyears from the discovery with the BeppoSAX satellite of the first X-ray\nafterglow of a GRB. Thanks to the afterglow discovery and to the possibility\ngiven to the optical and radio astronomers to discover the GRB optical\ncounterparts, the long-time mystery about the origin of these events was\nsolved. Now we know that GRBs are huge explosions, mainly ultra relativistic\njets, in galaxies at cosmological distances. Starting from the first GRB\ndetection with the Vela satellites, I will review the story of these\ndiscoveries, those obtained with BeppoSAX, the contribution to GRBs by other\nsatellites and ground experiments, among them Venera, Compton Gamma Ray\nObservatory, HETE2, Swift, Fermi, AGILE, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., which were, and some\nof them are still, very important for the study of GRB properties. Then I will\nreview the main results obtained thus far and the still open problems and\nprospects of the GRB astronomy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
