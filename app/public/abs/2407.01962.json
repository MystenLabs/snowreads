Further, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor the positivity of $2\\times 2$ certain block matrices and using this\ncondition we deduce an upper bound for the numerical radius involving a\ncontraction operator. Furthermore, we study the Schatten $p$-norm inequalities\nfor the sum of two $n\\times n$ complex matrices via singular values and from\nthe inequalities we obtain the $p$-numerical radius and the classical numerical\nradius bounds. We show that for every $p>0$, the $p$-numerical radius\n$w_p(\\cdot): \\mathcal{M}_n(\\mathbb C)\\to \\mathbb R$ satisfies $ w_p(T) \\leq\n\\frac12 \\sqrt{\\left\\| |T|^{2(1-t)}+|T^*|^{2(1-t)} \\right\\|^{} \\, \\big\n\\||T|^{2t}+|T^*|^{2t} \\big\\|_{p/2}^{} } $ for all $t\\in [0,1]$. Considering\n$p\\to \\infty$, we get a nice refinement of the well known classical numerical\nradius bound $w(T) \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac12 \\left\\| T^*T+TT^* \\right \\|}.$\n  As an application of the Schatten $p$-norm inequalities we develop a bound\nfor the energy of graph. We show that\n  $ \\mathcal{E}(G) \\geq \\frac{2m}{ \\sqrt{ \\max_{1\\leq i \\leq n} \\left\\{\n\\sum_{j, v_i \\sim v_j}d_j\\right\\}} },$ where $\\mathcal{E}(G)$ is the energy of\na simple graph $G$ with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices $v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_n$ such\nthat degree of $v_i$ is $d_i$ for each $i=1,2,\\ldots,n.$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
