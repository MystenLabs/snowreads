In this paper, we compute the $\\ell$-adic cohomology of the\nZariski closure of any such stratum. These are known as closed Bruhat-Tits\nstrata. We prove that the cohomology groups of odd degree vanish, and those of\neven degree are explicitely determined as representations of the symplectic\ngroup with a Frobenius action. Each closed Bruhat-Tits stratum is linearly\nstratified by Coxeter varieties attached to smaller symplectic groups. Thanks\nto results of Lusztig who computed the cohomology of Coxeter varieties for\nclassical groups, we make use of the spectral sequence associated to this\nstratification and describe explicitely all the terms at infinity. We point out\nthat the closed Bruhat-Tits strata have isolated singularities when the\ndimension is greater than 1. Our analysis requires discussing the smoothness of\nthe blow-up at the singular points, as well as comparing the ordinary\n$\\ell$-adic cohomology with intersection cohomology. A by-product of our\ncomputations is that these two cohomologies actually coincide, so that\nsurprisingly the presence of singularities does not interfere with the\ncohomology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
