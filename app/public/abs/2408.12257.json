The most numerous fixed points and cycles are\nthose we denote symmetric and almost-symmetric; the structure of the cycles of\nthese classes in base $b$ is determined by subgroups and cosets in the\nmultiplicative group modulo $b-1$. We provide methods and formulae for\nenumerating the fixed points and cycles of these and other classes. A detailed\nsurvey of the fixed points and cycles is provided for bases 4, 6 and 8,\nincluding a rigorous proof that the classification is complete in base 4.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OE23LS6M8aZMvWGa6sAEXBf1Xhmu1BXKPkHr4xUqLd4","pdfSize":"371722"}
