We\nstudy the solar rotation and its correlation with solar activity by applying a\nmodified machine learning algorithm to identify and track coronal bright points\n(CBPs) from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\nobservations at 193 \\AA\\ during cycle 24. For more than 321,440 CBPs, the\nsidereal and meridional velocities are computed. We find the occurring height\nof CBPs about 5627 km above the photosphere. We obtain a rotational map for the\ncorona by tracking CBPs at the formation height of Fe\\,{\\sc xii} (193 \\AA)\nemissions. The equator rotation (14.$^{\\circ}$40 to 14.$^{\\circ}$54 day$^{-1}$)\nand latitudinal gradient of rotation ($ - $3.$^{\\circ}$0 to $ - $2.$^{\\circ}$64\nday$^{-1}$) show very slightly positive and negative trends with solar activity\n(sunspots and flares), respectively. For cycle 24, our investigations show that\nthe northern hemisphere has more differential rotation than the southern\nhemisphere, confirmed by the asymmetry of the midlatitude rotation parameter.\nThe asymmetry (ranked) of the latitudinal gradient of the rotation parameter is\nconcordant with the sunspot numbers for 7 yr within the 9 yr of the cycle;\nhowever, for only 3 yr, it is concordant with the flare index. The minimum\nhorizontal Reynolds stress changes from about $ - $2500 m$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$\n(corresponding to high activity) in 2012 and 2014 to $ - $100 m$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$\n(corresponding to low activity) in 2019 over 5$^{\\circ}$ to 35$^{\\circ}$\nlatitudes within cycle 24. We conclude that the negative horizontal Reynolds\nstress (momentum transfer toward the Sun's equator) is a helpful indication of\nsolar activity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
