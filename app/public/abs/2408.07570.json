Inspired by the study\non the relations between solitons and yrast states, we investigate here the\nemergence of vortices from the eigenstates of a N -body Hamiltonian of\ninteracting particles trapped in a disk. We analyse states that appear by\nconsecutively measuring the positions of particles. These states have\ndensities, phases, and energies closely resembling mean-field vortices. We\ndiscuss similarities, but also point out purely many-body features, such as\nvortex smearing due to the quantum fluctuation of their center. The ab initio\nanalysis of the many-body system, and mean-field approaches are supported by\nthe analysis within the Bogoliubov approach.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2rxseoGI1fSThmOhAXrumVZjGqBRDce8ef8O9xRH464","pdfSize":"913895"}
