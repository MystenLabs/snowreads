Nanoribbons made from\n1.696{\\deg}-TBLG show edge-localized states inside the superlattice gaps.\nApplying the Green's function method, we demonstrate that the edge states carry\nelectronic current with conductance values close to the conductance quantum.\nThe edge states can generate a non-local resistance, which is not due to\none-way transport at the edges but due to the fact that these states are\nlocalized only at certain edges of the system, depending on how the nanoribbon\nhas been cut from the bulk.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
