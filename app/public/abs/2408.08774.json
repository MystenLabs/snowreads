The study presents a comparative analysis of six distinct\nspeckle noise reduction techniques: Lee Filtering, Frost Filtering, Kuan\nFiltering, Gaussian Filtering, Median Filtering, and Bilateral Filtering. These\nmethods, selected for their unique approaches to noise reduction and image\npreservation, were applied to SAR datasets sourced from the Alaska Satellite\nFacility (ASF). The performance of each technique was evaluated using a\ncomprehensive set of metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean\nSquared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Equivalent Number of\nLooks (ENL), and Speckle Suppression Index (SSI). The study concludes that both\nthe Lee and Kuan Filters are effective, with the choice of filter depending on\nthe specific application requirements for image quality and noise suppression.\nThis work provides valuable insights into optimizing SAR image processing, with\nsignificant implications for remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and\ngeological surveying.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FJulXf6v-CdVxUH8ev9ZXKGXwhzg9QT4rO3SnHAuAGQ","pdfSize":"268058"}
