In ``Extremal length and\nfunctional completion'', Fuglede initiated an abstract theory of extremal\nlength which has since been widely applied. Concentrating on duality properties\nand applications to quasiconformal analysis, we demonstrate the flexibility of\nthe theory and present recent advances in three different settings: Extremal\nlength and uniformization of metric surfaces, Extremal length of families of\nsurfaces and quasiconformal maps between $n$-dimensional spaces, and Schramm's\ntransboundary extremal length and conformal maps between multiply connected\nplane domains.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
