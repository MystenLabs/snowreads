By introducing suitable thresholds for the\nparameters $\\nu$ and $\\mu$, which are related to the coefficients $A_0(x)$,\nrespectively $A(x)$, under suitable hypotheses on $g(x,t)$, the existence of a\nnontrivial weak solution is proved if either $\\nu$ is large enough with $\\mu$\nsmall enough or $\\nu$ is small enough with $\\mu$ large enough. Variational\nmethods are used and in the first case a minimization argument applies while in\nthe second case a suitable Mountain Pass Theorem is used.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gQbPbe7q4OiH-EgHcJegP0vPLD20jKRJlHmXNXmMJfE","pdfSize":"208210"}
