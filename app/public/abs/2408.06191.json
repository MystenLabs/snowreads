First, we consider a variant notion of Zelevinsky's PSH\nalgebra defined over the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. In particular, we show that\ntwo specific $\\mathbb{R}$-lattices inside the complex Hopf algebra\n$\\bigoplus_nC(\\mathfrak{gl}_n(\\mathbb{F}_q))$ are real PSH algebras, and that\nthey do not descend to $\\mathbb{Z}$. Then, among consequences, we prove that\nevery element in $C(\\mathfrak{gl}_n(\\mathbb{F}_q))$ is a linear combination of\nHarish-Chandra inductions of Kawanaka's pre-cuspidal functions, and give a\nconceptual characterisation of duality operation for\n$\\mathfrak{gl}_n(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, which in turn allows us to give a new proof of\na classical result of Kawanaka.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
