Implementing real-time TSE is challenging as the computational\ncomplexity must be reduced to provide real-time operation. This work introduces\nto Conv-TasNet-based TSE a new architecture based on state space modeling (SSM)\nthat has been shown to model long-term dependency effectively. Owing to SSM,\nfewer dilated convolutional layers are required to capture temporal dependency\nin Conv-TasNet, resulting in the reduction of model complexity. We also enlarge\nthe window length and shift of the convolutional (TasNet) frontend encoder to\nreduce the computational cost further; the performance decline is compensated\nby over-parameterization of the frontend encoder. The proposed method reduces\nthe real-time factor by 78% from the conventional causal Conv-TasNet-based TSE\nwhile matching its performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_9F8TR5nU5KgQqQvVhY2ci7v80vau_D7dFK74UqbveM","pdfSize":"341667"}
