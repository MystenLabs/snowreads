The primary objective is to evaluate whether optimizing hyperparameters\nusing Bayesian Optimization enhances the base model's performance. For this\npurpose, a Kaggle [1] dataset that comprises real background noise (labeled 0)\nand simulated gravitational wave signals with noise (labeled 1) is used. Data\nwith real noise is collected from three detectors: LIGO Livingston, LIGO\nHanford, and Virgo. Through data preprocessing and training, the models\neffectively classify testing data, predicting the presence of gravitational\nwave signals with a remarkable score, of 83.61%. The BO model demonstrates\ncomparable accuracy to the base model, but its performance improvement is not\nvery significant (84.34%). However, it is worth noting that the BO model needs\nadditional computational resources and time due to the iterations required for\nhyperparameter optimization, requiring additional training on the entire\ndataset. For this reason, the BO model is less efficient in terms of resources\ncompared to the base model in gravitational wave classification\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
