Electrically neutral, pseudo-spin-$1/2$ condensates\nare probed by one-component weak-link potentials that make available paths for\nthe transit of vortices into and out of the ring in both components, and thus\ncan control the number of flux quanta threading the ring hole. For\nperpendicular fields, domain walls that are dynamically generated in the\nrelative phase of the spin components are shown to play a key role in driving\nthe hysteretic behaviour of the whole system through changes in the net\nmagnetic flux. In the presence of spin-orbit-coupling, hysteresis is exhibited\naround the phase transitions found by the metastable current states for varying\nfields.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
