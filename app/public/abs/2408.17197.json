In this work,\nwe first identify a network degeneration dilemma that hinders the model\nlearning by introducing a high linear dependence among the features inputted\ninto the classifier. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework\ncalled Whitening-Net to mitigate the degenerate solutions, in which ZCA\nwhitening is integrated before the linear classifier to normalize and\ndecorrelate the batch samples. However, in scenarios with extreme class\nimbalance, the batch covariance statistic exhibits significant fluctuations,\nimpeding the convergence of the whitening operation. Therefore, we propose two\ncovariance-corrected modules, the Group-based Relatively Balanced Batch Sampler\n(GRBS) and the Batch Embedded Training (BET), to get more accurate and stable\nbatch covariance, thereby reinforcing the capability of whitening. Our modules\ncan be trained end-to-end without incurring substantial computational costs.\nComprehensive empirical evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets, including\nCIFAR-LT-10/100, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist-LT, validate the effectiveness of\nour proposed approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
