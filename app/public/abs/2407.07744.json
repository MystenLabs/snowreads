From the perspective of communication system evolution,\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology remains pivotal for enhancing\ntransmission rates. However, current MIMO systems rely on inserting pilot\nsignals to achieve accurate channel estimation. As the increase of transmit\nstream, the pilots consume a significant portion of transmission resources,\nseverely reducing the spectral efficiency. In this correspondence, we propose a\nbelief information based mechanism. By introducing a plug-and-play belief\ninformation module, existing single-antenna channel estimation networks could\nbe seamlessly adapted to multi-antenna channel estimation and fully exploit the\nspatial correlation among multiple antennas. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method can either improve 1 ~ 2 dB channel estimation\nperformance or reduce 1/3 ~ 1/2 pilot overhead, particularly in bad channel\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
