Such formulations, however, are in general not easy to\nimplement within specialized software frameworks tailored to numerical optimal\ncontrol. This paper introduces a new multi-phase OCP interface for the\nopen-source software acados allowing to conveniently formulate such problems\nand generate fast solvers that can be used for nonlinear model predictive\ncontrol (NMPC). While multi-phase OCP (MOCP) formulations occur naturally in\nmany applications, this work focuses on MOCP formulations that can be used to\nefficiently approximate standard continuous-time OCPs in the context of NMPC.\nTo this end, the paper discusses advanced control parametrizations, such as\nclosed-loop costing and piecewise polynomials with varying degree, as well as\npartial tightening and formulations that leverage models of different fidelity.\nAn introductory example is presented to showcase the usability of the new\ninterface. Finally, three numerical experiments demonstrate that NMPC\ncontrollers based on multi-phase formulations can efficiently trade-off\ncomputation time and control performance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
