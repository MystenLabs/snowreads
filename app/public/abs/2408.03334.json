We show how to implement indirect addressing for a\nworking memory of fixed size; this makes it possible to simulate a Turing\nmachine with a finite tape. The result is, of course, only of theoretical and\nhistorical interest, without any practical implications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T0oYPpHMNM0o7G-o1b9xEKAs7o17tuxudIC131tVp-A","pdfSize":"306352"}
