Here, we study powder spreading for\nmixtures of spherical and irregularly shaped particles in Polyamide 12 powders.\nUsing DEM simulations, including heat transfer, we find that spherical\nparticles exhibit better flowability. Thus, the particles are deposited far\nahead of the spreading blade. In contrast, a large fraction of non-spherical\nparticles hinders the flow. Therefore, the cold particles are deposited near\nthe front of the spreading blade. This results in a temperature drop of the\ndeposited particles near the substrate, which cannot be seen with spherical\nparticles. The particles of both shapes are homogeneously distributed in the\ndeposited powder layer.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
