The study is focused on the dependence of its diffusion\ncoefficient $D$ on the damping $\\gamma$ ranging from the weak to strong one. We\nreveal the mechanisms of counterintutive effects in which diffusion can\nincrease despite the grow of friction and exhibits both minima and maxima.\nTheir origin is explained by analysis of the deterministic dynamics perturbed\nby thermal fluctuations. In the weak damping regime the maximum of diffusion is\ninduced by a non-monotonic change of population of the running orbits when the\nfriction increases. In the strong dissipation regime the effect is caused by\nbifurcation of periodic orbits oscillating symmetrically around the potential\nmaximum and their displacement towards the potential minimum when the damping\ncoefficient increases. It induces the change of the effective barrier of the\nperiodic potential and its vanishing at the maximum of $D$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
