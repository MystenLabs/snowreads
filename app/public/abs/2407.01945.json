Previous methods usually assume known intrinsics, which are\npre-calibrated from known objects, or self-calibrated from multi-view\nobservations. It is still challenging to reliably recover CPP intrinsics from\nonly two views without any known objects. In this paper, we provide a simple\nyet reliable solution. We demonstrate that, for the first time, sufficient\nconstraints on CPP intrinsics can be derived from an unknown cuboid corner\n(C2), e.g. a room's corner, which is a common structure in indoor scenes. In\naddition, with only known camera principal point, the complex multi-variable\nestimation of all CPP intrinsics can be simplified to a simple univariable\noptimization problem, leading to reliable calibration and thus direct 3D\nreconstruction with unknown CPP. Extensive results have demonstrated the\nsuperiority of the proposed method over both traditional and learning-based\ncounterparts. Furthermore, the proposed method also demonstrates impressive\npotential to solve similar tasks without active lighting, such as sparse-view\nstructure from motion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_GhKSvnwdADy0ePzKlnA8y5xLjO71I00a3Ysqfjdzuw","pdfSize":"12229685"}
