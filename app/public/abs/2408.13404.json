This article develops combinatorial formulas for some\nmultiplication rules and transition matrix entries for P$\\Lambda$ that are\nanalogous to well-known classical formulas for $\\Lambda$. In more detail, we\nconsider pure tensor bases $\\{s^{\\otimes}_{\\tau}\\}$, $\\{p^{\\otimes}_{\\tau}\\}$,\nand $\\{m^{\\otimes}_{\\tau}\\}$ for P$\\Lambda$ that arise as tensor products of\nthe classical Schur basis, power-sum basis, and monomial basis for $\\Lambda$.\nWe find expansions in these bases of the non-pure bases $\\{P_{\\delta}\\}$,\n$\\{H_{\\delta}\\}$, $\\{E^+_{\\delta}\\}$, and $\\{E_{\\delta}\\}$ studied by Asvin G\nand O'Desky. The answers involve tableau-like structures generalizing\nsemistandard tableaux, rim-hook tableaux, and the brick tabloids of\nE\\u{g}ecio\\u{g}lu and Remmel. These objects arise by iteration of new\nPieri-type rules that give expansions of products such as\n$s^{\\otimes}_{\\sigma}H_{\\delta}$, $p^{\\otimes}_{\\sigma}E_{\\delta}$, etc.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
