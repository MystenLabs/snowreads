The LyC\ndetection is made in the far-ultraviolet F154W band of the UVIT telescope\nonboard AstroSat. Both JWST and HST imaging of the system reveal signs that it\nis a likely merger. In particular, high-resolution imaging in the JWST bands\nreveals an infrared luminous object within the system that is faint in the\nbluer HST bands. The ionized-gas kinematics from the MUSE-UDF data supports the\nmerger hypothesis. We estimate that the entire system is leaking more than $8\n\\%$ of its ionizing photons to the intergalactic medium. The SED-derived\nstellar masses of the two components indicate that this is a major merger with\na mass ratio of ${1.13 \\pm 0.37}$. This detection hints at the potential\ncontribution of massive interacting systems at higher redshifts, when major\nmergers were more frequent, to the ionizing budget of the universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
