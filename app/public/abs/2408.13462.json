The model has potential applications to bubble dynamics.\nA Poisson bracket is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative. A\nLagrangian invariant of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the\nCauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--is derived.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
