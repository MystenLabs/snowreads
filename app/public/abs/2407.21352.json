However, as\ncompute-intensive services continue to emerge and the number of IoT devices\nexplodes, MEC servers are confronted with resource limitations. In this work,\nwe investigate a task-offloading framework for device-assisted edge computing,\nwhich allows MEC servers to assign certain tasks to auxiliary IoT devices (ADs)\nfor processing. To facilitate efficient collaboration among task IoT devices\n(TDs), the MEC server, and ADs, we propose an incentive-driven pricing and task\nallocation scheme. Initially, the MEC server employs the Vickrey auction\nmechanism to recruit ADs. Subsequently, based on the Stackelberg game, we\nanalyze the interactions between TDs and the MEC server. Finally, we establish\nthe optimal service pricing and task allocation strategy, guided by the\nStackelberg model and priority settings. Simulation results show that the\nproposed scheme dramatically improves the utility of the MEC server while\nsafeguarding the interests of TDs and ADs, achieving a triple-win scenario.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
