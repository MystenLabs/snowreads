In other words, how does an artificial intelligence\nfundamentally \"think,\" and in what form does its knowledge reside? The\npsychology of artificial intelligence, as predicted by Asimov (1950), aims to\nstudy this AI probing and explainability-sensitive matter. This study requires\na neuronal level of cognitive granularity, so as not to be limited solely to\nthe secondary macro-cognitive results (such as cognitive and cultural biases)\nof synthetic neural cognition. A prerequisite for examining the latter is to\nclarify some epistemological milestones regarding the cognitive status we can\nattribute to its phenomenology.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
