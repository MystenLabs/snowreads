To this end, we first obtain\nthe achievable downlink sum-rate for the mixed coherent and non-coherent\ntransmissions, and then provide a closed-form expression for the case with the\nmaximum ratio precoding. Subsequently, an efficient clustering algorithm is\nproposed to group access points into different clusters with the same quantized\nphase shift in each cluster. Numerical results demonstrate that the mixed\ncoherent and non-coherent transmissions can effectively improve the sum-rate of\nCF mMIMO-OFDM systems under asynchronous reception.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
