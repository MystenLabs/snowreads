We show how to use inequalities\nsatisfied by superquadratic functions and how to adapt the technique used to\nget them in order to obtain new results satisfied by uniformly convex functions\nand to $\\phi $-convex functions.\n  Also, we show examples that emphasize relations between superquadracity and\nsome other types of convex functions\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
