We\npresent NutriBench, the first publicly available natural language meal\ndescription based nutrition benchmark. NutriBench consists of 5,000\nhuman-verified meal descriptions with macro-nutrient labels, including\ncarbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. The data is divided into 15\nsubsets varying in complexity based on the number, servings, and popularity of\nthe food items in the meal and the specificity of serving size descriptions. We\nconducted an extensive evaluation of seven popular and state-of-the-art Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5, Llama-3, and a medical\ndomain-specific model with standard, Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration strategies on our benchmark for carbohydrate estimation. We also\nconducted a human study involving expert and non-expert participants and found\nthat LLMs can provide more accurate and faster predictions over a range of\ncomplex queries. We present a thorough analysis and comparison of different\nLLMs, highlighting the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition\nestimation in real-life scenarios.
