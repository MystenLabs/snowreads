Such label errors might hurt model\ntraining, affect evaluation results, and lead to an inaccurate assessment of\nmodel performance. In this study, we dived deep into one of the widely adopted\nArabic NER benchmark datasets (ANERcorp) and found a significant number of\nannotation errors, missing labels, and inconsistencies. Therefore, in this\nstudy, we conducted empirical research to understand these errors, correct them\nand propose a cleaner version of the dataset named CLEANANERCorp. CLEANANERCorp\nwill serve the research community as a more accurate and consistent benchmark.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jFIe0zEtTrDZ2Hz8sVRxdstmLvkDzGghU-lih_O7o9U","pdfSize":"264321"}
