In J.Math.Phys.11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced\nan interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical\nsolution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's\nmethod. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the\nperturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic\nfunction of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a\nsufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel\nnumerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary\ndynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our\nmethod offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many\npoints in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of\nour method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the\nmethod of characteristics, together with interpolation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pf6xLPAmOm4c-qdxB7Pw1lSqYG0Kn25HBFvrSJIweU8","pdfSize":"793833"}
