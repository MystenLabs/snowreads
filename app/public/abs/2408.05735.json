Here, we investigate the effects of electron-electron\ninteractions and phonons on the topological superconductivity in two parallel\nchannels of such helical liquids. Interactions between electrons in different\nchannels tend to reduce nonlocal pairing, suppressing the topological regime.\nAdditionally, electron-phonon coupling breaks the self duality in the\nelectronic subsystem and renormalizes the pairing strengths. Notably, while\nearlier perturbative calculations suggested that longitudinal phonons have no\neffect on helical liquids themselves to the leading order, our nonperturbative\nanalysis shows that phonons can induce transitions between topological and\ntrivial superconductivity, thereby weakening the stability of topological zero\nmodes. Our findings highlight practical limitations in realizing topological\nzero modes in various systems hosting helical channels, including quantum spin\nHall insulators, higher-order topological insulators, and their fractional\ncounterparts recently observed in twisted bilayer systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
