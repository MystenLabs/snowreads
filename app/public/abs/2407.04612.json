They are obtained as the discrete set of poles of the meromorphically\ncontinued cutoff resolvent. The construction combines the method of complex\nscaling near asymptotically flat infinity with microlocal methods near the\nblack hole horizon. We study the distribution of quasinormal modes in both the\nhigh and low energy regimes. We establish the existence of a high energy\nspectral gap and exclude the accumulation of quasinormal modes at zero energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
