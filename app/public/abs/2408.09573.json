Once the velocity gradient exceeds this\nthreshold, a dissipation mechanism is activated. Assuming that the fluid, after\nsuch an activation, dissipates the energy in a specific manner, we prove that\nthe corresponding initial-boundary-value problem is globally-in-time well-posed\nin the sense of Hadamard. In particular, we show that for an arbitrary,\nsufficiently regular, initial velocity there is a unique weak solution to the\nspatially periodic problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
