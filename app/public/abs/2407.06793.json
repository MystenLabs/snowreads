This study\ninvestigates the behavior of the Heider balance model in Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi random\ngraphs in the presence of a noisy environment, particularly the transition from\nan initially entirely positively polarized paradise state to a disordered\nphase. We examine both single-layer and bilayer network configurations and\nprovide a mean-field solution for the average link polarization that predicts a\nfirst-order transition where the critical temperature scales with the\nconnection probability $p$ as $p^2$ for a monolayer system and in a more\ncomplex way for a bilayer. We show that to mimic the dynamics observed in\ncomplete graphs, the intralayer Heider interaction strengths should be scaled\nas $p^{-2}$, while the interlayer interaction strengths should be scaled as\n$p^{-1}$ for random graphs. Numerical simulations have been performed, and\ntheir results confirm our analytical predictions, provided that graphs are\ndense enough.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
