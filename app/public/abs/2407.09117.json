However, in practice, the ability\nto detect forest fires in an effective way using distributed sensor nodes is\nchallenging to achieve. In this short paper, we exemplify this challenge based\non a case study that uses real data collected from the Low-Cost Internet of\nThings Sensor of Haze Air Quality Disasters in Communities in Thailand and\nSoutheast Asia (SEA-HAZEMON) platform. The work is a preliminary step towards\nassessing the efficacy of a real-life fire detection system based on\ndistributed sensor nodes. More generally, the objective is to develop a set of\npractical guidelines for the design of a 6G-enabled IoT-based fire detection\nmechanism.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
