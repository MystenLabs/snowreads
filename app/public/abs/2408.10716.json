Many examples are\nprovided, including specific surgery, homogeneous spaces and low dimensional\nmanifolds. Additionally, we propose eight open problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
