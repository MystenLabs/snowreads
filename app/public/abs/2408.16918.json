We have obtained several widely applicable sufficient\nconditions for this problem and have introduced a sufficient condition for the\nexistence of a Minty solution. We have shown that the extra-gradient method\nconverges to a solution of VI in the presence of a Minty solution.\nAdditionally, we have shown that, under some extra assumption, the algorithm is\nefficient and approaches a particular type of Minty solution. Interpreting\nthese results in an equivalent game theory problem, weak coupling conditions\nwill be obtained, stating that if the players' cost functions are sufficiently\nweakly coupled, the game has a pure quasi-Nash equilibrium. Moreover, under the\nadditional assumption of the existence of Minty solutions, a pure Nash\nequilibrium exists for the corresponding game.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
