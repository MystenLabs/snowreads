By\nusing two new entanglement measures based on dual entropy, the $S^{t}$-entropy\nentanglement and $T^{t}_q$-entropy entanglement measures, we present the\ngeneral monogamy relations in multi-qubit quantum systems. We show that these\nnewly derived monogamy inequalities are tighter than the existing ones. Based\non these general monogamy relations, we construct the set of multipartite\nentanglement indicators for $N$-qubit states, which are shown to work well even\nfor the cases that the usual concurrence-based indicators do not work. Detailed\nexamples are presented to illustrate our results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
