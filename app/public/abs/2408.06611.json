We investigate the probabilistic and/or enumerative aspects of random\nelements of $G_{k,n}$. This includes novel limit theorems for fixed points,\ncycles of various lengths, number of cycles and inversions. The limits are\ncompound Poisson distributions with interesting dependence structure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
