However, deploying\nsuch localization systems for heterogeneous phones affects their accuracy as\nthe cellular received signal strength (RSS) readings vary for different types\nof phones. In this paper, we introduce a number of techniques for addressing\nthe phones heterogeneity problem in the deep-learning based localization\nsystems. The basic idea is either to approximate a function that maps the\ncellular RSS measurements between different devices or to transfer the\nknowledge across them.\n  Evaluation of the proposed techniques using different Android phones on four\nindependent testbeds shows that our techniques can improve the localization\naccuracy by more than 220% for the four testbeds as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art systems. This highlights the promise of the proposed device\nheterogeneity handling techniques for enabling a wide deployment of deep\nlearning-based localization systems over different devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
