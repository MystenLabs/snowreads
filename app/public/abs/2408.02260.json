This resolves two problems proposed by Bang-Jensen and\nWang and contributes to a series of efforts aimed at addressing this problem\nfor specific graph classes. This work continues the research on semicomplete\ncomposition [Bang-Jensen, Gutin and Yeo, J. Graph Theory, 2020]; on locally\nsemicomplete digraphs [Bang-Jensen and Huang, J. Combin. Theory Ser.
