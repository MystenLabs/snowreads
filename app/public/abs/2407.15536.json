Our neural network, henceforth deep\ndifferential network (DDN), learns both the Heston pricing formula for\nplain-vanilla options and the partial derivatives with respect to the model\nparameters. The price sensitivities estimated by the DDN are not subject to the\nnumerical issues that can be encountered in computing the gradient of the\nHeston pricing function. Thus, our network is an excellent pricing engine for\nfast gradient-based calibrations. Extensive tests on selected equity markets\nshow that the DDN significantly outperforms non-differential feedforward neural\nnetworks in terms of calibration accuracy. In addition, it dramatically reduces\nthe computational time with respect to global optimizers that do not use\ngradient information.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
