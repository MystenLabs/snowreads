This research especially addresses the optimization\nof tool shape for robotic tool-use. We propose a method in which a robot\nobtains an optimized tool shape, tool trajectory, or both, depending on a given\ntask. The feature of our method is that a transition of the task state when the\nrobot moves a certain tool along a certain trajectory is represented by a deep\nneural network. We applied this method to object manipulation tasks on a 2D\nplane, and verified that appropriate tool shapes are generated by using this\nnovel method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
