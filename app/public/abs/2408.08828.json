Focusing on\nthe gapped phase of the sine-Gordon model, we demonstrate the method's accuracy\nby comparing our results to the predictions of other methods and to exact\nresults in the thermodynamic limit. We find excellent agreement between the\nmethod of random surfaces and other approaches when the temperature is not too\nsmall with respect to the mass gap. Extending the method to more general\nproblems in strongly interacting one-dimensional quantum systems is discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
