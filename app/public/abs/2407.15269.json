This note attempts to give a short survey on the study of\nbiharmonic Riemannian submersions which are a dual concept of biharmonic\nsubmanifolds (i.e., biharmonic isometric immersions).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
