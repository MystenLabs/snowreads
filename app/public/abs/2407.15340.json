The focus is specifically on defining a new functional data structure,\nthe Censored Functional Data (CFD), for dealing with temporal observations that\nare censored due to study limitations or incomplete data collection. This\napproach allows for precise modelling of functional survival trajectories,\nleading to improved interpretation and prediction of survival dynamics across\ndifferent groups. A medical survival study on the benchmark SOFA data set is\npresented. Results show good performance of the proposed approach, particularly\nin ranking the importance of predicting variables, as captured through dynamic\nchanges in SOFA scores and patient mortality rates.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fi29ZdfJNFX3BKEOM6Fp9c3R-wdNZoVTXOUfZu9s2uU","pdfSize":"1220515"}
