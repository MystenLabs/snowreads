We present 163 flares from 162\nindividual M2 through L1-type stars that triggered the GWAC, with flare\nenergies ranging from $10^{32.2}$ to $10^{36.4}$ erg . The flare amplitudes\nrange from $\\triangle G = 0.84$ to $\\sim 10$ mag. Flare energy increases with\nstellar surface temperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$) but both $\\triangle G$ and\nequivalent duration $\\log_{10}(ED)$ seem to be independent of $T_{\\rm eff}$.\nCombining periods detected from light curves of TESS and K2, spectra from\nLAMOST, SDSS and the 2.16 m Telescope, and the Gaia DR3 data, we found that\nthese GWAC flare stars are young. For the stars that have spectra, we found\nthat these stars are in or very near to the saturation region, and\n$\\log_{10}(L_{\\rm H\\alpha}/L_{\\rm bol})$ is lower for M7-L1 stars than for\nM2-M6 stars. We also studied the relation between GWAC flare bolometric energy\n$E_{\\rm bol}$ and stellar hemispherical area $S$, and found that\n$\\log_{10}E_{\\rm bol}$ (in erg) increases with increasing $S$ (in cm$^2$), and\nthe maximum flare energy $\\log_{10}E_{\\rm bol, max} \\geqslant \\log_{10}S +\n14.25$. For M7-L1 stars, there seem to be other factors limiting their maximum\nflare energies in addition to stellar hemispherical area.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
