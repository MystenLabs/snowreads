A rigorous PDE analysis of (CM-DNLS) was\nrecently initiated by G\\'erard and Lenzmann, who demonstrated its Lax pair\nstructure. Additionally, (CM-DNLS) exhibits several symmetries, such as\nmass-criticality with pseudo-conformal symmetry and a self-dual Hamiltonian.\nDespite its integrability, finite-time blow-up solutions have been constructed.\n  The purpose of this paper is to establish soliton resolution for both\nfinite-time blow-up solutions and global solutions in a fully general setting,\n\\emph{without imposing radial symmetry or size constraints}. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first non-integrable proof of full soliton resolution for\nSchr\\\"odinger-type equations. A key aspect of our proof is the control of the\nenergy of the outer radiation after extracting a soliton, referred to as the\n\\emph{energy bubbling} estimate. This benefits from two levels of convervation\nlaws, mass and energy, and self-duality. This approach allows us to directly\nprove continuous-in-time soliton resolution, bypassing time-sequential soliton\nresolution. Importantly, our proof does not rely on the integrability of the\nequation, potentially offering insights applicable to other non-integrable\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
