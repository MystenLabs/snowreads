In this paper we explore the effect of quantization on PHY\nperformance, drawing on the Bussgang decomposition and the implications of the\nBussgang theorem and extending it to the case of non-Gaussian signals. We first\nprove several theorems regarding the signal to distortion plus noise ratio for\na general non-linearity, applicable to both the Gaussian and the non-Gaussian\ncase, showing that the decomposition can be applied to the non-Gaussian case,\nbut that formulae previously introduced should be amended. We then apply these\nresults to the non-linearity created by quantization, both for Gaussian and\nnon-Gaussian signal distributions, and give numerical results derived from both\ntheory and simulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"05Y8JGeWyOqe0KEC8oWrEEVwlcyAwkZL_FDZACdAzRo","pdfSize":"403162"}
