The 3D-BPP is an NP-hard problem\nsignificant in logistics, warehousing, and transportation, involving the\noptimal arrangement of objects inside a bin. Traditional heuristic algorithms\noften fail to address dynamic and physical constraints in real-time scenarios.\nWe introduce a novel DRL framework that integrates a reliable physics heuristic\nalgorithm and object rearrangement and stable placement. Our experiment show\nthat the proposed framework achieves higher space utilization rates effectively\nminimizing the amount of wasted space with fewer training epochs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"o4fnGFRpFRCe07wo16gOgX4NJtPXTB2V9nSstkUEE-g","pdfSize":"2661179"}
