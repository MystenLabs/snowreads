This\nincludes both, endogenous network statistics (e.g. twostars, triangles, etc.)\nas well as statistics involving exogenous covariates; on the node as well as on\nthe edge level. LASSO estimation is a penalized estimation that shrinks some of\nthe parameter estimates to be equal to zero. As such it allows for model\nselection by modifying the amount of penalty. The concept is well established\nin standard regression and we demonstrate its usage in network data analysis,\nwith the advantage of automatically providing a model selection framework.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
