However, the bipedal locomotion\nmode for quadruped robots remains unverified. This paper explores the\nadaptation of a learning framework originally designed for quadrupedal robots\nto operate blind locomotion in biped mode. We leverage a framework that\nincorporates Adversarial Motion Priors with a teacher-student policy to enable\nimitation of a reference trajectory and navigation on tough terrain. Our work\ninvolves transferring and evaluating a similar learning framework on a\nquadruped robot in biped mode, aiming to achieve stable walking on both flat\nand complicated terrains. Our simulation results demonstrate that the trained\npolicy enables the quadruped robot to navigate both flat and challenging\nterrains, including stairs and uneven surfaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
