MoULDyS is Python-based and available under the GNU General\nPublic License v3.0 (gpl-3.0). We further provide easy-to-use scripts to\nrecreate the results of two case studies introduced in an earlier work.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
