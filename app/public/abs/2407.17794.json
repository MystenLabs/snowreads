Using an experimental setup that combines laser source and\nphotomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for accurate light intensity calibration, we\nevaluated SiPMs with pixel counts up to 244,719 and pixel sizes down to 6\nmicrometers. To complement the experimental findings, a \"Toy Monte Carlo\" was\ndeveloped to replicate the SiPMs' reponses under different lighting conditions,\nincorporating essential parameters such as pixel density and photon detection\nefficiency. The simulations aligned well with the experimental results for\nlaser light, demonstrating similar nonlinearity trends. For BGO scintillation\nlight, the simulations, which included multi-firing effect of pixels, showed\nsignificantly higher photon counts compared to the laser simulations.\nFurthermore, the simulated response derived in this research offer a method to\ncorrect for SiPM saturation effect, enabling accurate measurements in\nhigh-energy events even with SiPMs having a limited number of pixels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
