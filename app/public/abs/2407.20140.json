We characterize the migration dynamics using survival\nanalysis for a given configuration with a unique disk count in each lobe.\nQualitatively, all the configurations exhibit stretched exponential decay with\ntime, ascribed to a disk s aging. A given configuration s stability decreases\nwith increasing pairwise interactions. The most stable configuration is always\nthe one with equal partitioning of disks between the lobes, i.e., exactly\none-half of disks in each lobe for even-numbered systems but with one extra\ndisk in either of the lobes for odd-numbered systems. Furthermore, we model a\ncamphor disk as a Chiral Active Particle (CAP), as initially proposed by Cruz\net al. and show that decreasing motility (or aging) indeed causes the stretched\nexponential behavior.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
