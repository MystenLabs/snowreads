The Voronoi graph is the Cayley\ngraph on the lattice having the strict Voronoi vectors as generators. In this\npaper we determine the chromatic number of all 4-dimensional lattices. To\nachieve this we use the known classification of 52 parallelohedra in dimension\n4. These 52 geometric types yield 16 combinatorial types of relevant Voronoi\ngraphs. We discuss a systematic approach to checking for isomorphism of Cayley\ngraphs of lattices. Lower bounds for the chromatic number are obtained from\nchoosing appropriate small finite induced subgraphs of the Voronoi graphs.\nMatching upper bounds are derived from periodic colorings. To determine the\nchromatic numbers of these finite graphs, we employ a SAT solver.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
