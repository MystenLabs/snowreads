The\nobjective was to address the challenges of optimizing the behavior of\nautonomous agents while ensuring safety, reliability, and explainability.\nQuantum Computing techniques, including Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm (QAOA), were employed to efficiently explore large solution spaces\nand find approximate solutions to complex MARL problems. Neuromorphic\nComputing, inspired by the architecture of the human brain, provided parallel\nand distributed processing capabilities, which were leveraged to develop\nintelligent and adaptive systems. The combination of these technologies held\nthe potential to enhance the safety, reliability, and explainability of MARL in\nautonomous robotics. This research contributed to the advancement of autonomous\nrobotics by exploring cutting-edge technologies and their applications in\nmulti-agent systems. Codes and data are available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pGBQUxoaAweVTT8DVT0JFN-wc48GZ76FgydEtCdwUGc","pdfSize":"709789"}
