However, the SE of wireless communications is severely degraded\nunder co-frequency and co-mode hostile jamming. Focused on this issue, we\npropose a novel OAM active anti-jamming scheme to significantly enhance the\nanti-jamming results of wireless communications under broadband hostile\njamming. Specifically, the OAM transmitter with energy detection senses jamming\nsignals to identify which OAM modes are jammed and unjammed. Based on the\nrecognition of OAM modes, useful signals are modulated by reflecting the\nreceived co-frequency and co-mode jamming signals with the assistance of a\nprogrammable gain amplifier (PGA) to the OAM receiver, thus utilizing both the\nOAM modes jammed by hostile attacks and the energy of jamming signals.\nMeanwhile, the unjammed OAM modes allocated with total transmit power are\nmultiplexed for useful signal transmission. Numerical results demonstrate that\nour proposed OAM active anti-jamming scheme can achieve high OAM mode\nutilization and significantly increase the SEs.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
