This\nresearch paper presents an in-depth analysis of extensive system telemetry\ndata, proposing an ensemble methodology for detecting system failures. Our\napproach entails scrutinizing various parameters of system metrics,\nencompassing CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk activity, CPU\ntemperature, and pertinent system metadata such as system age, usage patterns,\ncore count, and processor type. The proposed ensemble technique integrates a\ndiverse set of algorithms, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks,\nisolation forests, one-class support vector machines (OCSVM), and local outlier\nfactors (LOF), to effectively discern system failures. Specifically, the LSTM\nnetwork with other machine learning techniques is trained on Intel Computing\nImprovement Program (ICIP) telemetry software data to distinguish between\nnormal and failed system patterns. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the\nremarkable efficacy of our models, achieving a notable detection rate in\nidentifying system failures. Our research contributes to advancing the field of\nsystem reliability and offers practical insights for enhancing user experience\nin computing environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iyKonXmdXRz1c2zMMVfV5rDZVd097mia97l5Fqx-rqg","pdfSize":"928236"}
