It is found that\nthe magnetic reconnection between the filament and the surrounding magnetic\nloops resulted in the formation of two new filaments, which erupted\nsuccessively. The observational evidences of magnetic reconnection, such as the\nobvious brightening at the junction of two different magnetic structures, the\nappearance of a bidirectional jet, and subsequent filament splitting, were\nclearly observed. Even though the two newly formed filaments experienced failed\neruptions, three obvious dimmings were observed at the footpoints of the\nfilaments during their eruptions. Based on these observations, it is suggested\nthat magnetic reconnection is the trigger mechanism for the splitting of the\noriginal filament and the subsequent eruption of the newly formed filaments.\nFurthermore, the process of filament splitting dominated by magnetic\nreconnection can shed light on the explanation of double-deck filament\nformation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
