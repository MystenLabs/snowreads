We develop a technique that overcomes this limitation for\nsingle-mode quantum states conditionally prepared through measurements on\nanother mode of a two-mode state. This task is performed by testing\nnonclassical steering -- a class of quantum correlations beyond quantum\nentanglement and quantum discord, for which we introduce a rigorous\ndescription.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
