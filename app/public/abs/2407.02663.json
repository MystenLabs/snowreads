Several examples of braided algebras satisfy a weaker\nversion of commutativity, which is called braided commutativity and involves\nthe Yang-Baxter operator of the algebra. We extend the theory of Yang-Baxter\nHochschild cohomology to study braided commutative deformations of braided\nalgebras. The resulting cohomology theory classifies infinitesimal deformations\nof braided algebras that are braided commutative, and provides obstructions for\nbraided commutative quadratic deformations. We consider braided commutativity\nfor Hopf algebras in detail, and obtain some classes of nontrivial examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dUN33AY_Y9knuEV-JND9J8mhq0OJ1il9wR4l7lGTe1c","pdfSize":"622535"}
