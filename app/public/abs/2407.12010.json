To obtain an accurate\nand stable mass value, I constructed a new network. The results show that this\nDNN provides a more precise and stable mass estimate compared to the\ntraditional least squares method.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
