This condition is\nsatisfied by all previously known obstructions, and we verify that there are no\nadditional obstructions with this property. This supports the conjecture that a\ntoroidal graph is 5-choosable if and only if it is 5-colorable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
