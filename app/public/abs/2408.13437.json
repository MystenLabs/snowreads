We first consider the estimation of standard measures of dependence in\nthe idiosyncratic volatilities such as covariances and correlations. Naive\nestimators of these measures are biased due to the use of the error-laden\nestimates of idiosyncratic volatilities. We provide bias-corrected estimators\nand the relevant asymptotic theory. Next, we introduce an idiosyncratic\nvolatility factor model, in which we decompose the variation in idiosyncratic\nvolatilities into two parts: the variation related to the systematic factors\nsuch as the market volatility, and the residual variation. Again, naive\nestimators of the decomposition are biased, and we provide bias-corrected\nestimators. We also provide the asymptotic theory that allows us to test\nwhether the residual (non-systematic) components of the idiosyncratic\nvolatilities exhibit cross-sectional dependence. We apply our methodology to\nthe S&P 100 index constituents, and document strong cross-sectional dependence\nin their idiosyncratic volatilities. We consider two different sets of\nidiosyncratic volatility factors, and find that neither can fully account for\nthe cross-sectional dependence in idiosyncratic volatilities. For each model,\nwe map out the network of dependencies in residual (non-systematic)\nidiosyncratic volatilities across all stocks.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
