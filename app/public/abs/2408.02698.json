The beam material properties are assumed\nto vary as an arbitrary continuous function. The methods consider the output of\na neural network/operator as an approximation to the displacement fields and\nderive the equations governing beam behavior based on the continuum\nformulation. The methods are implemented in the framework and formulated by\nthree approaches: (a) the vector approach leads to a Physics-Informed Neural\nNetwork (PINN), (b) the energy approach brings about the Deep Energy Method\n(DEM), and (c) the data-driven approach, which results in a class of Neural\nOperator methods. Finally, a neural operator has been trained to predict the\nresponse of the porous beam with functionally graded material under any\nporosity distribution pattern and any arbitrary traction condition. The results\nare validated with analytical and numerical reference solutions.
