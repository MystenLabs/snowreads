Consider a voting scenario\nwhere a coalition forms, but needs more voters to pass a bill. The cohesion of\nthe new group of voters hinges on whether all the new members can proficiently\ncollaborate with the existing players to ensure the bill's passage or if\nsubgroups form that pursue an independent alternative, thus generating\nantagonism among the new voters.\n  This research introduces the coopetition index, ranging from -1 to 1, to\nmeasure agents' preferences for cooperation (near 1) or competition (near -1)\nwith the remaining players. We also introduce the Banzhaf and Shapley-Owen\ncoopetition indices, addressing limitations of previous indices.\n  By applying our index to the apex game and symmetric majority games, we\nobserve that cooperation and competition frequently balance each other out,\nleading to null values for the Shapley-Owen and Banzhaf coopetition indices. To\ndistinguish balanced scenarios from those involving powerless coalitions, we\ndefine a decisiveness index that measures the extent of coalition involvement\nin negotiations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
