At finite nucleon density, the ALP's\ndynamics is governed by an effective potential which is the sum of the bare\nperiodic potential and a linear potential whose strength depends on the nucleon\ndensity. We identify a critical nucleon density $\\rho_c$ controlling the\ndynamics. At densities smaller than $\\rho_c$ the effective potential is a\ntilted sinusoidal curve and the field is displaced from its zero-density\nminimum. At densities larger than $\\rho_c$ the minima (and maxima) are absent,\nand the ALP is destabilized. Astrophysically, this implies that neutron stars\ncan source a radial ALP field, providing a complementary probe to equivalence\nprinciple tests. Cosmologically, the ALP may have been destabilized in the\nearly Universe and could have made large field excursions. We discuss\nmodel-building applications of our results for such early universe scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
