NCRs enhance previous radio\nfrequency (RF) repeaters by exploring beamforming transmissions controlled by\nthe network through side control information. In this context, this paper\nintroduces the concept of NCR. Furthermore, we present a system level model\nthat allows the performance evaluation of an NCR-assisted network. Finally, we\nevaluate the network deployment impact on the performance of NCR-assisted\nnetworks. As we show, with proper network planning, NCRs can boost the signal\nto interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the user equipments (UEs) in a poor\ncoverage of a macro base station. Furthermore, celledge UEs and uplink (UL)\ncommunications are the ones that benefit the most from the presence of NCRs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
