In this work, we present a novel\nrepresentation of the imaginary-time propagator based on restricted Boltzmann\nmachines. We test its accuracy against the routinely employed\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformations by evaluating ground-state energies and\nsingle-particle densities of selected light nuclei. This analysis paves the way\nfor incorporating more realistic nuclear potentials in the auxiliary field\ndiffusion Monte Carlo method, including isospin-dependent spin-orbit terms and\ncubic spin-isospin operators, which characterize accurate phenomenological and\nchiral effective field theory Hamiltonians.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
