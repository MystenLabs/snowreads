In some sources, this emission was\nfound to be highly polarized and was suggested to be emitted at the base of the\njet. Until now, no $\\gamma$-ray polarization had been found in any other state.\nUsing INTEGRAL/IBIS, we studied the soft gamma-ray spectral and polarization\nproperties of Swift J1727.8-1613 throughout its outburst. We detect a highly\npolarized spectral component in both the hard intermediate state and the early\nstages of the soft intermediate state above 210 keV. In the hard intermediate\nstate, the polarization angle significantly deviates from the compact jet angle\nprojected onto the sky, whereas in the soft intermediate they are closely\naligned. This constitutes the first detection of jet-aligned polarization in\nthe soft gamma-ray for a microquasar. We attribute this polarized spectral\ncomponent to synchrotron emission from the jet, which indicates that some of\nthe jet might persist into the softer states.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
