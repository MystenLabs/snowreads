However, most efforts require the application of\nexternal magnetic fields. Gate-defined valley-helical narrow channels offer a\nmagnetic field-free approach to generate valley currents. However, achieving\nperfect helical transport in such gate-defined devices remains challenging due\nto stringent requirements for gate alignment. Misalignments lead to the\npresence of non-helical states that suppress the efficiency of these devices.\nHere, we propose an alternative gate layout to overcome the fabrication\nchallenges. Our layout creates a series of helical quantum point contacts that\nsuppress the transmission of non-helical modes. We show that such a layout can\nbe implemented with four layers of independent gates or two layers of split\ngates. Thus, our approach offers a robust magnetic field-free platform to\ngenerate valley-polarized currents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9v1V51crg4Z345an20KFTX1fWcTockS8JOPNQ_yEVO4","pdfSize":"1283133"}
