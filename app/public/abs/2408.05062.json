The key feature of the analysis\nis that we introduce a new variable, which quantifies the energy transferred\nfrom a source mode to a recipient mode through explicit examination of\nnonlinear triadic interactions in streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space. First,\nwe use this variable to quantify the nonlinear energy transfer gain and loss\nfor individual Fourier modes. The nonlinear energy transfer gain and loss\ncannot be directly obtained from the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equation.\nSecond, we quantify the nonlinear energy transfer budgets for three types of\nstructures: streamwise streaks, oblique waves and Tollmien-Schlichting waves.\nWe found that a transverse cascade from streamwise-elongated modes to\nspanwise-elongated modes exists in all three structures. Third, we quantify the\nforward and inverse cascades between resolved scales and subgrid scales in the\nspirit of large-eddy simulation. For the cutoff wavelength range we consider,\nthe forward and inverse cascades between the resolved scales and subgrid scales\nresult in a net forward cascade from the resolved scales to the subgrid scales.\nThe shape of the net forward cascade curve with respect to the cutoff\nwavelength resembles the net forward cascade predicted by the Smagorinsky eddy\nviscosity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
