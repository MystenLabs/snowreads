In this\nregime, the NH quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators show quantized\n$\\sigma_{xy}$ and $G_{xx}$, respectively, the NH $p+ip$ ($p \\pm ip$) pairing\nshows half-quantized $\\kappa_{xy}$ ($G^{th}_{xx}$), while the NH $d+id$ pairing\nshows quantized $\\kappa_{xy}$ and $\\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ in the clean and weak\ndisorder (due to random pointlike charge impurities) regimes. We compute these\nquantities in experimentally realizable suitable six-terminal setups using the\nKwant software package. But, in the strong disorder regime, all these\ntopological responses vanish and with the increasing non-Hermiticity in the\nsystem this generic phenomenon occurs at weaker disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i-kqxbUqF2JCjOM89vN6he_1V12nu8lRhCSBCoL9VKQ","pdfSize":"1066467"}
