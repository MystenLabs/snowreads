By translating principles of anti-discrimination law into a\ndecision-theoretic framework, we formalise discrimination and propose a new,\nlegally informed approach to developing systems for automated decision-making.\nOur investigation reveals that while algorithmic fairness approaches have\nadapted concepts from legal theory, they can conflict with legal standards,\nhighlighting the importance of bridging the gap between automated decisions,\nfairness, and anti-discrimination doctrine.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
