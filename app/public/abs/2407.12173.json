This paper proposes an efficient time step sampling method based on\nan image spectral analysis of the diffusion process, aimed at optimizing the\ndenoising process. Instead of the traditional uniform distribution-based time\nstep sampling, we introduce a Beta distribution-like sampling technique that\nprioritizes critical steps in the early and late stages of the process. Our\nhypothesis is that certain steps exhibit significant changes in image content,\nwhile others contribute minimally. We validated our approach using Fourier\ntransforms to measure frequency response changes at each step, revealing\nsubstantial low-frequency changes early on and high-frequency adjustments\nlater. Experiments with ADM and Stable Diffusion demonstrated that our Beta\nSampling method consistently outperforms uniform sampling, achieving better FID\nand IS scores, and offers competitive efficiency relative to state-of-the-art\nmethods like AutoDiffusion. This work provides a practical framework for\nenhancing diffusion model efficiency by focusing computational resources on the\nmost impactful steps, with potential for further optimization and broader\napplication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
