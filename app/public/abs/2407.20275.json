The nanotrusses are optimized for different\npurposes, including various loadings, boundary conditions, parameterizations,\nobjectives and constraints used to formulate optimization problems. The\nprocedure relies on a recently developed framework consisting of molecular\ndynamics simulations, neural networks and finite elements. This framework is\nnow used in the design optimization of nanostructures and the performances of\ndifferent popular heuristic optimization methods are compared. Five\napplications of nanotrusses made of carbon nanotubes are analyzed in detail to\ninvestigate the mechanical behavior of such structures and the efficiency of\nthe optimizations. Besides an introductory example, the design of an energy\ntrapping carbon nanotube nanotruss, an auxetic nanotruss, a cantilever\nnanotruss and the maximization of the compressive strength of a metamaterial\nare presented. It is shown that the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon\nnanotubes can indeed be exploited for the development of structures and\nmaterials with extraordinary mechanical properties. Although hampered by\nmaterial and geometrical nonlinearity of the problem, most of the tested\noptimization methods have proven to be a good choice for the design of such\nmaterials and structures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
