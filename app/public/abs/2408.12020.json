We use the $K$-theory of a $C^*$-algebra $A_V$ associated to $V(k)$\nto define a height of points of $V(k)$. The corresponding counting function is\ncalculated and we show that it coincides with the known formulas for $n=1$. As\nan application, it is proved that the set $V(k)$ is finite, whenever the sum of\nthe odd Betti numbers of $V(k)$ exceeds $n+1$. Our construction depends on the\n$n$-dimensional Minkowski question-mark function studied by Panti and others.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
