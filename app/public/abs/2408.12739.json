In this work we tie their\nheuristic success to two facts. First, that when randomly initialized, they can\nonly operate on the information encoded in low-bodyness measurements of their\ninput states. And second, that they are commonly benchmarked on \"locally-easy''\ndatasets whose states are precisely classifiable by the information encoded in\nthese low-bodyness observables subspace. We further show that the QCNN's action\non this subspace can be efficiently classically simulated by a classical\nalgorithm equipped with Pauli shadows on the dataset. Indeed, we present a\nshadow-based simulation of QCNNs on up-to $1024$ qubits for phases of matter\nclassification. Our results can then be understood as highlighting a deeper\nsymptom of QML: Models could only be showing heuristic success because they are\nbenchmarked on simple problems, for which their action can be classically\nsimulated. This insight points to the fact that non-trivial datasets are a\ntruly necessary ingredient for moving forward with QML. To finish, we discuss\nhow our results can be extrapolated to classically simulate other\narchitectures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
