We prove a total variation distance estimate for the\ndifference between the model and actual prime factors of shifted primes, and\napply it to show that the prime factors of shifted primes in disjoint sets\nbehave like independent Poisson variables. As a consequence, we establish a\ntransference principle between the anatomy of random integers up to x and of\nrandom shifted primes p+a with p < x.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
