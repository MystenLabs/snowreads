A\nfew years before gravitational-wave signals from sBHB mergers are recorded in\nthe LVK detectors, their early coalescence will leave a unique signature in the\nESA/NASA mission Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Multiband\nobservations of sBHB sources between LISA and LVK detectors opens an\nunprecedented opportunity to investigate the astrophysical environment and\nmulti-messenger early-alerts. In this study, we report the sBHB sources that\nwill be present in the LISA data derived directly from the hydrodynamic\ncosmological simulation Illustris. By surveying snapshots across cosmological\nvolume, metallicity and look-back time, we find that about tens to thousand\nsBHB candidates will be present in the LISA data for various combinations of\nmission lifetime. For estimates consistent with the LVK rates, we find that\nonly 20 sBHBs across Illustris snapshots will be detected with significant\nconfidence for a 10-year LISA mission, while a 4-year LISA mission would detect\nonly 2 sBHBs. Our work paves the way for creating LISA mock data and bench\nmarking LISA detection pipelines directly using cosmological simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
