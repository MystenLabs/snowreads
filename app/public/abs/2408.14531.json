Bayesian inference is\nperformed on the baryon abundance and the effective number of neutrino species,\n$N_{\\rm eff}$, using a CMB Boltzmann solver in combination with LINX, a new\nflexible and efficient BBN code. We marginalize over Planck nuisance parameters\nand nuclear rates to find $N_{\\rm{eff}} = 3.08_{-0.13}^{+0.13},\\,2.94\n_{-0.16}^{+0.16},$ or $2.98_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$, for three separate reaction\nnetworks. This framework enables robust testing of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter\nparadigm and its variants with CMB and BBN data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
