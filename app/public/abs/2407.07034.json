After a brief review of\nbosonization in two dimensional conformal field theories, we discuss how\ninternal bosonic string coordinates can be consistently replaced by free\nfermionic degrees of freedom. In this framework, worldsheet supersymmetry may\nbe realized entirely among free fermions. Embedding this construction into\nstring theory leads to a number of constraints arising from modular invariance\nat one and higher genera. The solution of these constraints takes the form of a\nsmall number of model building rules from which the string spectrum and\ninteractions may be analyzed. We review some of the most well-studied models in\nthe literature and their classification, with emphasis on the symmetric basis.\nThe explicit map of free fermionic models to the orbifold construction is\npresented in some detail.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
