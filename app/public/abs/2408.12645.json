However,\nmeasuring such entropies, which can be used to certify topological order, on\nlarge partitions is challenging and becomes practically unfeasible for large\nsystems. We propose a protocol based on local adiabatic deformations of the\nHamiltonian which extracts the universal features of long-range topological\nentanglement from measurements on small subsystems of finite size, trading an\nexponential number of measurements against a polynomial-time evolution. Our\nprotocol is general and readily applicable to various quantum simulation\narchitectures. We apply our method to various string-net models representing\nboth abelian and non-abelian topologically ordered phases, and illustrate its\napplication to neutral atom tweezer arrays with numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_5b88F5V8Xy1YX7qp2vEYujMUrZuaLmjsYUgN-szLic","pdfSize":"2035900"}
