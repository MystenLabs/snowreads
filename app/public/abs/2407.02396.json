We introduce a microscopic model that describes the\nprobability of infection for a single individual and the evolution of the\ndisease within their body. From the individual-level description, we then\npresent the corresponding population-level model of epidemic spreading on the\nmesoscopic and macroscopic scale. We conclude with numerical illustrations\ntaking into account either a white Gaussian noise or an escape noise to\nshowcase the potential of our approach in producing both transient and\nasymptotic complex dynamics as well as finite-size fluctuations consistently\nacross multiple scales. A comparison with the epidemiology of coronaviruses is\nalso given to corroborate the qualitative relevance of our new approach.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
