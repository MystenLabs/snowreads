The ALMA data reveal a 2e42 erg/s [CII] 158um\nemission line at z=6.9964 with a [CII]-inferred star-formation rate of 58\nMsun/yr. We estimate a dynamical mass of 4.6e9 Msun, implying a black hole mass\nto host a dynamical mass ratio of 0.15. The 238 GHz continuum (rest-frame IR)\ndecreased by ~33% from the NOEMA to the ALMA observations taken ~10 months\napart. The VLA 3-10 GHz radio flux densities showed a ~37% decrease in a\nsimilar time frame, suggesting a causal connection. At face value, J0410-0139\nwould have the lowest [CII]-to-IR luminosity ratio of a z>5.7 quasar reported\nto date (~1e-4). However, if only <20% of the measured IR luminosity were due\nto thermal emission from dust, the [CII]-to-IR luminosity ratio would be\ntypical of (U)LIRGS, and the star formation rates derived from [CII] and IR\nluminosities would be consistent. These results provide further evidence that\nsynchrotron emission significantly contributes to the observed rest-frame IR\nemission of J0410-0139, similar to what has been reported in some radio-loud\nAGN at z<1.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"iOXXpHejPsTRWj7xJHUsk-mtzo631wMgZu3UoNc4oLU","pdfSize":"1194138"}
