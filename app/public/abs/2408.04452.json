Despite intense efforts to understand the mechanism\ndriving the electronic modulations, its origin is still unknown and hindered by\ncompeting interactions and intertwined orders. Here, we identify a\ndimerization-driven 2D hexagonal charge-diffuse precursor in the\nantiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe and demonstrate that the fraction of\ndimerized/undimerized states is the relevant order parameter of the\nmultiple-$\\mathrm{\\textbf{q}}$ CDW of a continuous phase transition. The\npretransitional charge fluctuations with propagation vector\n$\\mathrm{\\textbf{q}=\\textbf{q}_M}$ at T$_{\\mathrm{CDW}}$$<$T$<$T$^*$(125 K) are\nanisotropic, hence holding a quasi-long-range bond-orientational order. The\nbroken translational symmetry emerges from the anisotropic diffuse precursor,\nakin to the Ising scenario of antiferromagnetic triangular lattices. The\ntemperature and momentum dependence of the critical scattering show parallels\nto the stacked hexatic $\\mathrm{B}$-phases reported in liquid crystals and\ntransient states of CDWs and highlight the key role of the topological\ndefect-mediated melting of the CDW in FeGe.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yF99nanYsb9zpkxeC00TqLsTEqzhybZLawEoVAOVuSA","pdfSize":"48206553"}
