We present a systematic analysis across mobility datasets and\nprediction lookaheads and reveal that adding mobility data to predictive models\nimproves model performance only for about two months at the onset of the\ntesting period, and that performance improvements -- measured as predicted vs.\nactual correlation improvement over non-mobility baselines -- are at most 0.3.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7cUG0dUblmwfp4O4sbw5HtFJieqZq3mHVhHs9AGEye4","pdfSize":"1093213"}
