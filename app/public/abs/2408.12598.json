However, it is non-trivial to\nsimultaneously recover meticulous geometry and preserve smoothness across\nregions with differing characteristics. To address this issue, previous methods\ntypically employ geometric priors, which are often constrained by the\nperformance of the prior models. In this paper, we propose ND-SDF, which learns\na Normal Ddeflection field to represent the angular deviation between the scene\nnormal and the prior normal. Unlike previous methods that uniformly apply\ngeometric priors on all samples, introducing significant bias in accuracy, our\nproposed normal deflection field dynamically learns and adapts the utilization\nof samples based on their specific characteristics, thereby improving both the\naccuracy and effectiveness of the model. Our method not only obtains smooth\nweakly textured regions such as walls and floors but also preserves the\ngeometric details of complex structures. In addition, we introduce a novel ray\nsampling strategy based on the deflection angle to facilitate the unbiased\nrendering process, which significantly improves the quality and accuracy of\nintricate surfaces, especially on thin structures. Consistent improvements on\nvarious challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
