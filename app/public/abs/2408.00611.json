One notable application integrates event-based\ncameras with spiking neural networks (SNNs) to process event-based sequences\nthat are asynchronous and sparse, making them difficult to handle. In this\nproject, we develop a convolutional spiking neural network (CSNN) architecture\nthat leverages convolutional operations and recurrent properties of a spiking\nneuron to learn the spatial and temporal relations in the ASL-DVS gesture\ndataset. The ASL-DVS gesture dataset is a neuromorphic dataset containing hand\ngestures when displaying 24 letters (A to Y, excluding J and Z due to the\nnature of their symbols) from the American Sign Language (ASL). We performed\nclassification on a pre-processed subset of the full ASL-DVS dataset to\nidentify letter signs and achieved 100\\% training accuracy. Specifically, this\nwas achieved by training in the Google Cloud compute platform while using a\nlearning rate of 0.0005, batch size of 25 (total of 20 batches), 200\niterations, and 10 epochs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h9LNsx-f1lzAtouoEmUa7oanTvzJtD3M_mXsXiSctuk","pdfSize":"994187"}
