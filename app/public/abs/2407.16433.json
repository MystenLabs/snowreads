Fiber-based interferometers are compact, robust\nand cheap, thus are ubiquitously deployed. However, the optical phase in fiber\ninterferometers is sensitive to ambient perturbation, resulting in compromised\nphase sensing precision. Therefore, phase control, shifting and stabilization\nof fiber interferometers is essential. Methods to create stable interference\npatterns and to lock a fiber interferometer at arbitrary phase have been shown,\nwhich however are sophisticated, bulky and delicate, preventing wider\napplication in harsh environment outside laboratories or in space. Here we\ndemonstrate a new method for arbitrary-phase locking of fiber unbalanced\nMach-Zehnder interferometers. Compared to existing method, our method is\nsimpler, more robust and more compact. We showcase the preparation and\ncharacterization of narrow-band energy-time-entanglement photon state generated\nin integrated nonlinear microresonators, where two-photon interference\nvisibility reaching 0.993(6) is enabled. Our method constitutes a critical\nbuilding block for photonic quantum network, and is useful to emerging\nsingle-photon interference in curved space-time that facilitates exploration of\nthe interface of quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
