Below ~60 K,\namorphous water becomes metastable, and the formation of any form of ice I is\noften implicitly precluded. Using a newly developed low-temperature reflection\nhigh-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique, we show that crystalline\nice with cubic stacking sequences (i.e., ice Ic) formed through Ne sublimation\nfrom a solid H2O/Ne (1:1000 ratio) matrix at 13 K. The extent of staking\ndisorder (disordered cubic and hexagonal stacking sequences) in the ice formed\nby Ne matrix sublimation is smaller than that in vapor-deposited ice Isd\nprepared at 143 K and below the limit of detection of low-temperature RHEED.\nDependence of the resulting ice structures on the thickness of the H2O/Ne\nmatrix shows that amorphous water first forms in the early stages of Ne\nsublimation and the cubic stacking sequence subsequently takes place. As the\ncubic ice Ic formed here at a much lower temperature (13 K) than previously\nobserved (typically above 78 K), Ne matrix sublimation represents a novel route\nto the formation of cubic ice Ic under low-temperature and low-pressure\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
