Market participants consume this high-frequency data\nto build limit order books, representing the current bids and offers for a\ngiven asset. The arrival processes, or the order flow of bid and offer events,\nare asymmetric and possibly dependent on each other. The quantum and direction\nof this asymmetry are often associated with the direction of the traded price\nmovement. The Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) is an indicator commonly used to\nestimate this asymmetry. This paper uses Hawkes processes to estimate the OFI\nwhile accounting for the lagged dependence in the order flow between bids and\noffers. Secondly, we develop a method to forecast the near-term distribution of\nthe OFI, which can then be used to compare models for forecasting OFI. Thirdly,\nwe propose a method to compare the forecasts of OFI for an arbitrarily large\nnumber of models. We apply the approach developed to tick data from the\nNational Stock Exchange and observe that the Hawkes process modeled with a Sum\nof Exponential's kernel gives the best forecast among all competing models.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"s23aD_WvvpYvhfXzoOCaB8VCD_ROTSeQI2T_r7BXd2E","pdfSize":"1029409"}
