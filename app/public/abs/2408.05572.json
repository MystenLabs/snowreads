The pairing mechanism is unconventional. There is no\nCooper instability. Instead, pairing is due to the divergence of the density of\nstates at a Van Hove point, leading to a superconducting quantum critical point\nat a finite detuning from the Van Hove point. The transition temperature is\nuniversally determined by the exponent governing the divergence of the density\nof states. Enhancing this exponent drastically increases $T_c$. The Cooper pair\nwave function has a non-monotonic momentum dependence with a steep slope near\nthe gap nodes. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, pairing fluctuations\nsuppress a $2e$ spin-triplet state, but allow pairs of triplets to condense\ninto a charge-$4e$ singlet state at a temperature of similar order as our\nresult.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DKAYv4l-sgqmTrD6nkNVoRgIyg9c0Kd3P2FSFhzCx4s","pdfSize":"1156558"}
