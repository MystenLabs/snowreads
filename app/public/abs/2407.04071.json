We provide an analytical derivation of the\nrelationship between the newly proposed 4P FA model and its counterpart in the\nitem response theory (IRT) framework, the 4P IRT model. A Bayesian estimation\nmethod for the proposed 4P FA model is provided to estimate the four item\nparameters, the respondents' latent scores, and the scores cleaned of the\nguessing and inattention effects. The newly proposed algorithm is implemented\nin R and Python, and the relationship between the 4P FA and 4P IRT is\nempirically demonstrated using real datasets from admission tests and the\nassessment of anxiety.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
