It determines the presence of boundary\nstates, while lacking direct measurements. Here, we develop time-varying\nprogrammable coupling circuits between acoustic cavities to mimic the\nHamiltonians in the Brillouin zone, with which excitation and adiabatic\nevolution of bulk states are realized in a unit cell. By extracting the Berry\nphases of the bulk band, topological invariants, including the Zak phase for\nthe SSH model and the Chern number for the AAH model, are obtained\nconvincingly. The bulk state evolution also provides insight into the\ntopological charges of our newly developed non-Abelian models, which are also\nverified by observing the adiabatic eigenframe rotation. Our work not only\nprovides a general recipe for telling various topological invariants but also\nsheds light on transient acoustic wave manipulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oUPi9EwUn246fJnB2nDu8KmNOXQXnhQTuevW31DcQu8","pdfSize":"1966665"}
