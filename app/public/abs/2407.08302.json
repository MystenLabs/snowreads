There are now an\nincreasing number of gradual semantics and impact measures that have emerged to\nfacilitate the interpretation of their outcomes. An impact measure assesses,\nfor each argument, the impact of other arguments on its score. In this paper,\nwe refine an existing impact measure from Delobelle and Villata and introduce a\nnew impact measure rooted in Shapley values. We introduce several principles to\nevaluate those two impact measures w.r.t. some well-known gradual semantics.\nThis comprehensive analysis provides deeper insights into their functionality\nand desirability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ruDXUeXYv_qqah6tvlRoSQjLdPiA45sN122tCpWNXfg","pdfSize":"259638","objectId":"0x05e42bd741359cf53e7f1a0381a21391df096ca8504790eb75e99e995ed40a64","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
