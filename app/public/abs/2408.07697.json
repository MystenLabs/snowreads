However, ASP(Q) lacks a method for encoding in an elegant and\ncompact way problems requiring a polynomial number of calls to an oracle in\n$\\Sigma_n^p$ (that is, problems in $\\Delta_{n+1}^p$). Such problems include, in\nparticular, optimization problems. In this paper we propose an extension of\nASP(Q), in which component programs may contain weak constraints. Weak\nconstraints can be used both for expressing local optimization within\nquantified component programs and for modeling global optimization criteria. We\nshowcase the modeling capabilities of the new formalism through various\napplication scenarios. Further, we study its computational properties obtaining\ncomplexity results and unveiling non-obvious characteristics of ASP(Q) programs\nwith weak constraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
