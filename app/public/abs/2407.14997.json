While prior works have investigated length-controlled generation,\ntheir effectiveness depends on knowing the appropriate generation length. In\nthis work, we present an in-depth study of the limitations of predicting\nscientific citation text length and explore the use of heuristic estimates of\ndesired length.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Cygj64mrnZRLov93cpyh2sqwsb46qyNALWIH8nxH27s","pdfSize":"286644"}
