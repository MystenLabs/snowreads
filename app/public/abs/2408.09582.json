However, the end goal of\nthe experiment often is not to learn the model parameters, but to predict\ndownstream quantities of interest (QoIs) that depend on the learned parameters.\nAnd designs that offer high EIG for parameters may not translate to high EIG\nfor QoIs. Goal-oriented optimal experimental design (GO-OED) thus directly\ntargets to maximize the EIG of QoIs.\n  We introduce LF-GO-OED (likelihood-free goal-oriented optimal experimental\ndesign), a computational method for conducting GO-OED with nonlinear\nobservation and prediction models. LF-GO-OED is specifically designed to\naccommodate implicit models, where the likelihood is intractable. In\nparticular, it builds a density ratio estimator from samples generated from\napproximate Bayesian computation (ABC), thereby sidestepping the need for\nlikelihood evaluations or density estimations. The overall method is validated\non benchmark problems with existing methods, and demonstrated on scientific\napplications of epidemiology and neural science.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
