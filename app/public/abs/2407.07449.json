Using the Teukolsky and generalized\nSasaki-Nakamura formalisms, we provide the post-Newtonian expansion of the\nenergy flux of the vector waves up to $O(v^5)$ beyond the quadrupole formula in\nthe weak field and numerically calculate the energy flux in the strong field\nfor a charged particle moving in circular orbits. Our findings reveal a\ndegeneracy in the scalar and vector charge parameters for weak-field,\nslow-motion orbits. However, for strong-field, fast-motion orbits close to the\ninnermost stable circular orbit, we observe distinct behaviors between scalar\nand vector fields. We investigate the potential of using EMRIs detected by\nspace-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer\nSpace Antenna to identify whether a black hole carries a scalar or vector\ncharge. The influence of scalar and vector flux on the orbital evolution and\ntensor GW phase can not help us distinguish scalar and vector fields. However,\nextra polarizations emitted by the scalar or vector field can break the\ncorrelations between the scalar field and vector field and then help us\ndistinguish the scalar and vector field.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
