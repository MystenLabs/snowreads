The emergence of a Bragg-type bandgap when constructing a\ntwo-dimensional plate from such unit cells is experimentally validated. It is\ndemonstrated that increasing both mass and porosity of the Schwarz primitive\nleads to a decrease in the frequency of the out-of-plane propagating wave\ntargeted in this study. By arranging these modified Schwarz primitive unit\ncells in constant and graded layouts, two-dimensional plates with an embedded\nmetabarrier and a metalens are numerically designed. The metabarrier protects\nan interior area of the plate from the propagating waves on a wide frequency\nband (approx. 1.4-3.4 kHz). Equally, the refractive index profile necessary for\ngradient index lenses is obtained via a progressive variation of the added mass\nor, alternatively, the porosity of the unit cell over a rectangular area. For\nthe first time, bending of the out-of-plane mode towards the focusing point is\npractically validated in a challenging mesoscale experiment requiring the\nassembly of different three-dimensional printed sections of the plate. The\nincreased porosity design is advantageous not only in terms of overall\nlightweight, but also towards additive manufacturing as it requires less\nmaterial.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
