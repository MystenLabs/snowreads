Deep\nlearning-based methods have demonstrated effectiveness in estimating\nquantitative maps from series of weighted images. In this study, we present\nqMRI Diffusor, a novel approach to qMRI utilising deep generative models.\nSpecifically, we implemented denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM)\nfor T1 quantification in the brain, framing the estimation of quantitative maps\nas a conditional generation task. The proposed method is compared with the\nresidual neural network (ResNet) and the recurrent inference machine (RIM) on\nboth phantom and in vivo data. The results indicate that our method achieves\nimproved accuracy and precision in parameter estimation, along with superior\nvisual performance. Moreover, our method inherently incorporates stochasticity,\nenabling straightforward quantification of uncertainty. Hence, the proposed\nmethod holds significant promise for quantitative MR mapping.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bqgug7Xqj2taZmQwB6Y0vQ7ZPvQvi91g_skK2lOUf6o","pdfSize":"3445517"}
