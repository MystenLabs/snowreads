We demonstrate the correctness and applicability of\nthe technique by computing alchemical free energy changes of gas-phase\nmolecules, with both nuclear and electron creation/annihilation. We also show\nan initial application to first-principles pKa calculation for solvated\nmolecules where we quantum mechanically annihilate a bonded proton.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
