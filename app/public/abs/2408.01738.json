A relaxation\nterm is added to the Quadratic Programs (QP) combining the transformed Control\nLyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), to mediate the\npotential conflict. The existing Lyapunov-based adaptive schemes designed to\nguarantee specific properties of the Lyapunov functions, may grow unboundedly\nunder the effects of the relaxation term. The adaptive law is designed by\nprocessing system inputs and outputs, to avoid unbounded estimates and\noverparameterization problems in the existing results. A safetytriggered\ncondition is presented, based on which the forward invariant property of the\nsafe set is shown and Zeno behavior can be excluded. Simulation results are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive control\nscheme.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
