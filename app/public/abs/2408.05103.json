Let\n$G$ be a semisimple reductive group split over a $p$-adic field $F$. The main\nresult of this paper shows that category of modules over the extension algebra\nof generalized Steinberg representations of $G(F)$ appears as a full\nsubcategory of equivariant perverse sheaves on the variety of Langlands\nparameters for these representations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
