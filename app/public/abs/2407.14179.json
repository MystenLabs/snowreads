In this study, we\nanalyze French occupational data to uncover patterns of worker mobility and\npinpoint specific occupations that act as bottlenecks which impede rapid\nreallocation. We introduce two metrics, transferability and accessibility, to\nquantify the diversity of occupational transitions and find that bottlenecks\ncan be explained by a condensation effect of occupations with high\naccessibility but low transferability. Transferability measures the variety of\ntransitions from an occupation to others, while accessibility assesses the\nvariety of transitions into an occupation. We provide a comprehensive framework\nfor analyzing occupational complexity and mobility patterns, offering insights\ninto potential barriers and pathways for efficient retraining programs. We\nargue that our approach can inform policymakers and stakeholders aiming to\nenhance labor market efficiency and support workforce adaptability.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
