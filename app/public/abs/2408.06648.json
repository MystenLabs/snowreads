To begin with, I propose developing a visual\nlocalization system to enable blimps to localize themselves in an indoor\nenvironment autonomously. This system initially reconstructs an indoor\nenvironment by employing Structure from Motion with Superpoint visual features.\nNext, with the previously built sparse point cloud map, the system generates\ncamera poses by continuously employing pose estimation on matched visual\nfeatures observed from the map. In this project, the blimp only serves as a\nreference mobile platform that constrains the weight of the perception system.\nThe perception system contains one monocular camera and a WiFi adaptor to\ncapture and transmit visual data to a ground PC station where the algorithms\nwill be executed. The success of this project will transform remote-controlled\nindoor blimps into autonomous indoor blimps, which can be utilized for\napplications such as surveillance, advertisement, and indoor mapping.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
