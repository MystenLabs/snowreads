Our method relies\non a Block Lanczos transformation that maps the whole system onto a strip\ngeometry, whose width is given by the number of emitters. Utilizing the spatial\nsymmetries of the problem and identifying the relevant range of energies of the\nbath we achieve a more efficient simulation, which we perform using tensor\nnetwork techniques. As a demonstration, we study the collective emission from\nmultiple emitters coupled to a square lattice of bosons and observe how the\ndeparture from Markovianity as coupling strength and emitter number is\nincreased prevents collective radiation. We also simulate the dynamic\npreparation of an excitation in a bound state from a multi-excitation initial\nstate. Our work opens new possibilities for the systematic exploration of\nnon-Markovian effects in the dynamics and equilibrium properties of\nmulti-emitter systems. Furthermore, it can easily be extended to other setups,\nincluding finite bath temperature or impurities coupled to fermionic\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
