Distilling the key information in nursing notes through text\nsummarization techniques can improve clinicians' efficiency in understanding\npatients' conditions when reviewing nursing notes. However, existing\nabstractive summarization methods in the clinical setting have often overlooked\nnursing notes and require the creation of reference summaries for supervision\nsignals, which is time-consuming. In this work, we introduce QGSumm, a\nquery-guided self-supervised domain adaptation framework for nursing note\nsummarization. Using patient-related clinical queries as guidance, our approach\ngenerates high-quality, patient-centered summaries without relying on reference\nsummaries for training. Through automatic and manual evaluation by an expert\nclinician, we demonstrate the strengths of our approach compared to the\nstate-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) in both zero-shot and few-shot\nsettings. Ultimately, our approach provides a new perspective on conditional\ntext summarization, tailored to the specific interests of clinical personnel.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
