Despite the pressing need for principled approaches\ntailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution\nin such settings remains unexplored, possibly due to challenges associated with\nhandling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a data\ncontribution estimation method for time-series datasets. TimeInf uses influence\nfunctions to attribute model predictions to individual time points while\npreserving temporal structures. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate\nthat TimeInf outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying harmful\nanomalies and helpful time points for forecasting. Additionally, TimeInf offers\nintuitive and interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to easily\ndistinguish diverse anomaly patterns through visualizations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Q9VkGvm2wOEkUWwrWad0KxLgIaD-CqEjekpKq0t6Q4","pdfSize":"5651662"}
