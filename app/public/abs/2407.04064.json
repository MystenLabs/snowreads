However, existing DRL-based methods\noften suffer from performance degradation when tackling unseen scenarios, since\nthe non-causal factors in visual representations adversely affect policy\nlearning. To address this issue, we propose a novel representation learning\napproach, \\ie, causal representation disentanglement, which can identify the\ncausal and non-causal factors in representations. After that, we only pass\ncausal factors for subsequent policy learning and thus explicitly eliminate the\ninfluence of non-causal factors, which effectively improves the generalization\nability of DRL models. Experimental results show that our proposed method can\nachieve robust navigation performance and effective collision avoidance\nespecially in unseen scenarios, which significantly outperforms existing SOTA\nalgorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
