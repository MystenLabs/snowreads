Although the scenario map is known, the robot lacks\ninformation about the movement of dynamic obstacles during the monitoring\nmission. Numerous local planners have been developed in recent years for\nnavigating highly dynamic environments. However, the absence of a global\nplanner for these environments can result in unavoidable collisions or the\ninability to successfully complete missions in densely populated areas, such as\na scenario monitoring in our case. This work addresses the development and\nevaluation of a global planner, $MADA$ (Monitoring Avoiding Dynamic Areas),\naimed at enhancing the deployment of robots in such challenging conditions. The\nrobot plans and executes the mission using the proposed two-step approach. The\nfirst step involves selecting the observation goal based on the environment's\ndistribution and estimated monitoring costs. In the second step, the robot\nidentifies areas with moving obstacles and obtains paths avoiding densely\noccupied dynamic regions based on their occupation. Quantitative and\nqualitative results based on simulations and on real-world experimentation,\nconfirm that the proposed method allows the robot to effectively monitor most\nof the environment while avoiding densely occupied dynamic areas.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
