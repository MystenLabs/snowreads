Acoustic energy measurements\noffer an independent means of energy estimation. Here we combine optical and\nacoustic methods to validate the luminous efficiency model of Borovi\\v{c}ka et\nal. (2020). Our goal is to compare these models with acoustic measurements of\nmeteoroid energy deposition. Employing theoretical blast scaling laws following\nthe approach of McFadden et al. (2021), we determine explosive yields for both\nfireball fragmentation events and cylindrical shocks for four different bright\nfireballs. We model fireballs using the MetSim software (Vida et al., 2023) and\nfind that the Borovi\\v{c}ka et al. (2020) model produces agreement better than\na factor of two for our three chondritic fireball case studies. The major\nexception is an iron meteorite-producing fireball where the luminous efficiency\nis an order of magnitude higher than model predictions calibrated with stony\nfireballs. We suggest that large disparities between optical and acoustic\nenergies could be a signature of iron fireballs and hence useful as a\ndiscriminant of that population.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
