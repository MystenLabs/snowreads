Attributing individual extreme events (EEs) to ACC is\nbecoming crucial to assess the risks of climate change. Traditional attribution\nmethods often suffer from a selection bias, are computationally demanding, and\nprovide answers after the EE occurs. This study presents a ground-breaking\nhybrid attribution method by combining physics-based ACC estimates from global\nclimate models with deep-learning weather forecasts. This hybrid approach\ncircumvents the framing choices and accelerates the attribution process, paving\nthe way for operational anticipated global forecast-based attribution. We apply\nthis methodology to three distinct high-impact weather EEs. Despite some\nlimitations in predictability, the method uncovers ACC fingerprints in the\nforecasted fields of EEs. Specifically, forecasts successfully anticipate that\nACC exacerbated the 2018 Iberian heatwave, deepened hurricane Florence, and\nintensified the wind and precipitable water of the explosive cyclone Ciar\\'an.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bwr0IqtKi-COjZkcL1G6GkQ_1u7FzcvYgTbZkpTZDyQ","pdfSize":"40735685"}
