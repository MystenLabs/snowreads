The proposed framework first constructs a linear\nGaussian belief propagation (GaBP) algorithm to estimate the absolute sensor\npositions utilizing the range-based received signal model, which is used for\nthe reconstruction of the RBL transformation model, linearized with a\nsmall-angle approximation. In light of the reformulated system, a second\nbivariate GaBP is designed to directly estimate the 3D rotation angles and\ntranslation distances, with an interference cancellation (IC) refinement to\nimprove the angle estimation performance. The effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod is verified via numerical simulations, highlighting the superior\nperformance of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art (SotA)\ntechniques for the position, rotation, and translation estimation performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
