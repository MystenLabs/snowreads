The block-additive structure of the model is\nparticularly suitable in the presence of interactions, while maintaining\ntractable computations. In addition, we develop a sequential algorithm, MaxMod,\nfor model selection (i.e., the choice of the active input variables and of the\nblocks). We speed up our implementations through efficient matrix computations\nand thanks to explicit expressions of criteria involved in MaxMod. The\nperformance and scalability of our methodology are showcased with several\nnumerical examples in dimensions up to 120, as well as in a 5D real-world\ncoastal flooding application, where interpretability is enhanced by the\nselection of the blocks.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
