The compound is an antiferromagnetic insulator with two subsequent\nmagnetic phase transitions at $T_{N1} \\approx$ 14.0 K and $T_{N2} \\approx$ 7.1\nK. The compound was found to exhibit both normal and inverse MCE. Furthermore,\ndue to substantial magnetic anisotropy, it also exhibits a rotational MCE. For\nconventional MCE, the maximum value of the isothermal entropy change $\\Delta\nS_m$ is -4.7(1) J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 15(1) K for a magnetic field change of\n5 T, independent of the field direction. The relative cooling power (RCP) is\nalso almost identical for both directions, and equals 81(1) J kg$^{-1}$ for a\nmagnetic field change of 5 T. The most significant rotational MCE was observed\nat about 11 K, with a maximum $\\Delta S_R$ value of 2.4(1) J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\nand RCP = 17.5(6) J kg$^{-1}$ for a magnetic field change of 4 T.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"msj9Yce-7WNecKfzSdIyoshG6rdI7wN-vHEjX-Cc71A","pdfSize":"1198770"}
