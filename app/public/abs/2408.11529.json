The equations of motion of the perturbations are\npartially diagonalized by the group theory of broken symmetry. Nearly all\nfields in theory have non-minimal couplings, so their equations of motion are\nnot merely massive Klein-Gordon equations with minimal coupling to background\ngauge fields, and their analogues for fields with spin. In the special case of\nextremal black holes we identify specific modes of instability, some of which\ntouch supersymmetric locus. For example, we identify scalar fields in\nsupergravity that condense in the near horizon region and transition the black\nhole into a superconducting phase. We also identify supergravity modes that are\nsusceptible to superradiant instability.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bFCG7yhkYUkYHcMnllV51NUl8y4CDmpCA09eEaHgRvU","pdfSize":"1006011"}
