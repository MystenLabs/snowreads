We define unitarity, polynomial energy bounds and\npolynomial spectral density for full VOA. Under these conditions and local\n$C_1$-cofiniteness of the simple full VOA, we show that the correlation\nfunctions of quasi-primary fields define tempered distributions and satisfy a\nconformal version of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, including the linear\ngrowth condition.\n  As an example, we show that a family of full extensions of the Heisenberg VOA\nsatisfies all these assumptions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
