In this paper, we provide another proofs of\nthese congruences using classical $q$-series manipulations. We also give an\ninfinite family of congruences for $a_c(n)$ for primes $p\\equiv 5,7\\pmod{8}$\nand other isolated congruences modulo $19,23$ and $31$ using modular forms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ps6RqtoMDWOPoK0UHqRN7YsTVEWSOdXLHzfhQ3QKZVU","pdfSize":"131708"}
