To this end, we first show that the steady state of the\nqubit-oscillator system, described by the open quantum Rabi model with\ntwo-photon relaxation, undergoes a superradiant phase transition that breaks\nthe strong symmetry of the Lindblad master equation. In the strong\nsymmetry-broken phase, we show that a cat qubit can be stabilized in the steady\nstate by tuning the qubit-oscillator coupling strength and demonstrate that\npassive error correction can be realized against errors due to fluctuations in\nthe system frequencies. Our study deepens the understanding of dissipative\nphases in a qubit-oscillator system with strong symmetry and paves the way to\nutilize them for passive error correction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
