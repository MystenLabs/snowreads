For the $^{\\rm nat}$Mo($\\gamma,x$n)$^{\\rm\n93m}$Mo reaction the experimental flux-averaged cross-section <$\\sigma(E_{\\rm\n\\gamma max})$>$_\\rm m$ at the bremsstrahlung end-point energy range of 38--93\nMeV was first time determined. The theoretical values of the yields $Y_{\\rm\nm,g}(E_{\\rm \\gamma max})$ and flux-averaged cross-sections <$\\sigma(E_{\\rm\n\\gamma max})$>$_{\\rm m,g}$ for the $^{\\rm nat}$Mo($\\gamma,x$n)$^{\\rm 93m,g}$Mo\nreactions were calculated using the cross-sections $\\sigma(E_{\\rm \\gamma})$\nfrom the TALYS1.96 code for different gamma strength functions and level\ndensity models. The comparison showed strong discrepancies between the\nexperimental values and the theoretical results of <$\\sigma(E_{\\rm \\gamma\nmax})$>$_m$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
