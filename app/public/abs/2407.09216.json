This can be exploited to\nincrease the final score. We correct this flaw and provide a fair ranking over\na wide range of existing PSGG models. The observed scores for existing methods\nincrease by up to 7.4 mR@50 for all two-stage methods, while dropping by up to\n19.3 mR@50 for all one-stage methods, highlighting the importance of a correct\nevaluation. Contrary to recent publications, we show that existing two-stage\nmethods are competitive to one-stage methods. Building on this, we introduce\nthe Decoupled SceneFormer (DSFormer), a novel two-stage model that outperforms\nall existing scene graph models by a large margin of +11 mR@50 and +10 mNgR@50\non the corrected evaluation, thus setting a new SOTA. As a core design\nprinciple, DSFormer encodes subject and object masks directly into feature\nspace.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
