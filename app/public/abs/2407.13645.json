Within the framework of fossil field hypothesis these\ninhomogeneities are considered to be essentially stable over the Main Sequence\n(MS) timescale. However, a small group of Ap/Bp stars show rotational period\nchanges, which are currently not well understood. We present results of Doppler\nImaging (DI) of rapidly rotating Ap star 56 Ari for which changes in period\nwere previously detected. Reconstruction of the surface distribution of silicon\nin 56 Ari reveals its complex spot pattern, which is responsible for the\nrotationally light variability and correlated with magnetic field modulation.\nComparison of abundance maps obtained over the unprecedentedly long for such\nstudies interval from 1986 to 2014 confirms stability and rigid rotation of the\nspot pattern. Thus, the period change in 56 Ari is not caused by rearrangement\nof the surface magnetic structures and/or atomic diffusion operating on short\ntime scale. It is also unlikely to be explained by the visibility changes of\nthe spots due to free-body precession of stellar rotational axis. In the end of\nthe paper we briefly discuss possible alternative explanations of period\nvariability.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
