The problem of determining which part of the\nservice fits within which domain is referred to as slice partitioning. The\npartitioning of multi-domain network slices poses a challenging problem,\nparticularly when striving to strike the right balance between inter-domain and\nintra-domain costs, as well as ensuring optimal load distribution within each\ndomain. To approach the optimal partition solution while maintaining load\nbalance between domains, a framework has been proposed. This framework not only\ngenerates partition plans with various characteristics but also employs a Graph\nNeural Network solver, which significantly reduces the plan generation time.\nThe proposed approach is promising in generating partition plans for\nmulti-domain network slices and is expected to improve the overall performance\nof the network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aJgMfvoTkTQ8WpCEx1FVkhwD9w_igbesjSqzcLtEog8","pdfSize":"371801"}
