To\nreproduce nuclear matter properties adequately at the saturation density,\nfour-point and eight-point interactions are introduced. Within a Bayesian\ninference approach, the parameters of the model are determined by imposing\nnuclear matter, both experimental and from {\\it ab-initio} calculations, and\nneutron star observational constraints. Nuclear matter properties are well\nreproduced with an effective mass of 0.75 to 0.8 nucleon mass at the saturation\ndensity. At 90% confidence level, the radius of a $1.4 ~\\rm M_\\odot$ star\nvaries between 11.48 km and 13.20 km, masses as large as $\\sim 2.2 ~\\rm\nM_\\odot$ are predicted and the radius of a 2 M$_\\odot$ star is above 10.5 km.\nHigh-density perturbative QCD (pQCD) results exclude equations of state that\npredict larger maximum masses and radii. The speed of sound increases\nmonotonically with density and reaches values as large as\n$\\sqrt{0.7}c$-$\\sqrt{0.8}c$ in the center of massive stars. Several properties\nsuch as the polytropic index or the renormalized trace anomaly, that have been\nproposed to identify the deconfined phase transition, are analyzed.\nInterestingly, the radius of the obtained posterior that also meets pQCD\nconstraints aligns closely with the mass-radius measurement of the recent PSR\nJ0437-4715, which contrasts with other relativistic mean field model results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PVZZbLjeohKHeuxnui-iHs8FlxLdAMQtvOAv9UEGuQI","pdfSize":"2807759"}
