Unlike traditional EAs, QIEAs employ quantum bits to adopt\na probabilistic representation of the state of a feature in a given solution.\nThis unprecedented feature enables them to achieve better diversity and perform\nglobal search, effectively yielding a tradeoff between exploration and\nexploitation. We conducted a comprehensive survey across various publishers and\ngathered 56 papers. We thoroughly analyzed these publications, focusing on the\nnovelty elements and types of heuristics employed by the extant\nquantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) proposed to solve the feature\nsubset selection (FSS) problem. Importantly, we provided a detailed analysis of\nthe different types of objective functions and popular quantum gates, i.e.,\nrotation gates, employed throughout the literature. Additionally, we suggested\nseveral open research problems to attract the attention of the researchers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
