If Grand\nUnification is not realized in nature, this would appear to be a coincidence.\nWe attempt to quantify how frequent this coincidence is among theories with\ngroup structure and fermion content similar to the Standard Model. We find that\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/100)$ of consistent fermion representations similar to the\nStandard Model are unifiable, and discuss how the result depends on our\ndefinitions. This purely group-theoretical analysis may be taken as a bottom-up\nindication for Grand Unification, conceptually similar to a naturalness\nargument.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
