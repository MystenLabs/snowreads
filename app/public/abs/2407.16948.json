However, this definition lacks\nthe invariance under marginal distribution transformations, which is often\nrequired as a criterion for dependence measures. In this study, we examine the\n\\textit{relative local dependence}, which we define as the ratio of the local\ndependence to the probability density function, for copulas. By using this\nnotion, we point out that typical copulas can be characterised as the solutions\nto the corresponding partial differential equations, particularly highlighting\nthat the relative local dependence of the Frank copula remains constant. The\nestimation and visualization of the relative local dependence are demonstrated\nusing simulation data. Furthermore, we propose a class of copulas where local\ndependence is proportional to the $k$-th power of the probability density\nfunction, and as an example, we demonstrate a newly discovered relationship\nderived from the density functions of two representative copulas, the Frank\ncopula and the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
