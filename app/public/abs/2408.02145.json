In particular, the\nrelevant Hamiltonians can contain the solution and they only need to be\nmeasurable with respect to time. We apply our results to optimal control\nproblems of (delay) functional differential equations with cost functionals\nthat have discount factors and with time-measurable data. Our main results are\nalso crucial for our companion paper Bandini and Keller (2024), where non-local\npath-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to the stochastic\noptimal control of non-Markovian piecewise deterministic processes are studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
