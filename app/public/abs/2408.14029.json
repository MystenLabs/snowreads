Here we propose a proposal for\ngenerating chiral cat states in a spinning resonator supporting both the\nclockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) traveling modes, which are\ndispersively coupled to a two-level atom. The physical mechanism for the chiral\ncat-state generation is based on the Sagnac-Fizeau effect. Concretely, when the\nresonator is rotating, the CW and CCW modes have different frequency detuning\nwith respect to the atomic transition frequency, and hence the\natomic-state-dependent rotating angular velocities for the CW and CCW modes in\nphase space are different. This mode-dependent evolution leads to the chirality\nin the state generation. By choosing proper system parameters, we achieve the\nseparate generation of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states and coherent states in\nthe two traveling modes. We also investigate quantum coherence properties of\nthe generated states by examining their Wigner functions. In addition, the\ninfluence of the system dissipations on the state generation in the open-system\ncase is investigated. Our work will provide some insights into the development\nof chiral optical devices and nonreciprocal photonics physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
