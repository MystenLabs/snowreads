However, it is expected that they\nare not arbitrarily wild, but rather have only a finite amount of geometric\ncomplexity. This expectation has been recently formalized by a tameness\nprinciple: physical observables should be definable in o-minimal structures and\ntheir sharp refinements. In this work, we show that a broad class of\nnon-analytic partition and correlation functions are tame functions in the\no-minimal structure known as $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathscr{G}}$ - the structure\ndefining Gevrey functions. Using a perturbative approach, we expand the\nobservables in asymptotic series in powers of a small coupling constant.\nAlthough these series are often divergent, they can be Borel-resummed in the\nabsence of Stokes phenomena to yield the full partition and correlation\nfunctions. We show that this makes them definable in $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathscr{G}}$\nand provide a number of motivating examples. These include certain\n0-dimensional quantum field theories and a set of higher-dimensional quantum\nfield theories that can be analyzed using constructive field theory. Finally,\nwe discuss how the eigenvalues of certain Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics are\nalso definable in $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathscr{G}}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
