In classical batteries, the energy density at each\nsubsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by\ndividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that\nthis limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy\nTeleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed\nthe value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces\nexperimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy\ncharging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC).\nLeveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum\nenergy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new\ntechnological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards\nrevolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
