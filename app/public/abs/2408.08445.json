Stat. Phys. 132, 275-290, 2008) Borodin and P\\'ech\\'e introduced a\ngeneralization of the extended Airy kernel based on two infinite sets of\nparameters. For an arbitrary choice of parameters we construct determinantal\npoint processes on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ for these generalized kernels. In addition,\nfor a subset of the parameter space we show that the point processes can be\nlifted to line ensembles on $\\mathbb{R}$, which satisfy the Brownian Gibbs\nproperty. Our ensembles generalize the wanderer line ensembles introduced by\nCorwin and Hammond in (Invent. Math. 195, 441-508, 2014).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
