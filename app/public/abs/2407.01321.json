Our result extends the uniqueness regime that is\ngiven by the classical Ruelle--Penrose bound by a factor of at least $e$, where\nthe improvements becomes larger as the negative parts of the potential become\nmore prominent (i.e., for attractive interactions at low temperature). Our\ntechnique is based on the approach of Dyer et al. (Rand. Struct. & Alg. '04):\nwe show that for any bounded region and any boundary condition, we can\nconstruct a Markov process (in our case spatial birth-death dynamics) that\nconverges rapidly to the finite-volume Gibbs point process while effects of the\nboundary condition propagate sufficiently slowly. As a result, we obtain a\nspatial mixing property that implies uniqueness of the infinite-volume Gibbs\nmeasure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
