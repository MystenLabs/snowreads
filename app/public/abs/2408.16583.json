For the description of the ``visible''\nsector, we use a specific phenomenological quark model that takes into account\nin-medium effects for the quark masses through a suitable baryonic density\ndependence, in which the free parameters are chosen from the analysis of the\nstellar matter stability window (parametrizations presenting lower energy per\nbaryon than iron nuclei). In the case of the dark sector, we investigate the\npredictions of fermionic and bosonic models. In the former we consider a spin\n$1/2$ dark particle, and the latter is described by a dark scalar meson. Both\nmodels present a repulsive vector interaction, particularly important for the\nbosonic model since it helps avoiding the collapse of the star due to the lack\nof the degeneracy pressure. Our results point out to possible stable strange\nstars configurations in agreement with data from PSR J0030+0451, PSR\nJ0740+6620, NICER and HESS J1731-347. As another feature, we find stars with\ndark matter halo configurations for lower values of the dark particle mass.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
