In the last part, we prove the weak\nbounded negativity for self-intersections $C^2$ of integral curves $C$ in a\nfamily of surfaces $f:Y\\longrightarrow B$ where $B$ is a smooth curve.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
