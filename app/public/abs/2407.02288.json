We have some\nset $V$ of items for purchase. Maker's goal is to purchase some member of a\ngiven family $\\cH$ of subsets of $V$ as cheaply as possible and Breaker's goal\nis to make the purchase as expensive as possible. Each player has a pointer and\nduring a player's turn their pointer moves through the items in the order of\nthe permutation until the player decides to take one. We mostly focus on the\ncase where the permutation is random and unknown to the players (it is revealed\nby the players as their pointers move).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
