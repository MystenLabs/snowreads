{"id":"2407.00775","title":"On $C^1$ regularity for degenerate elliptic equations in the plane","authors":"Thibault Lacombe and Xavier Lamy","authorsParsed":[["Lacombe","Thibault",""],["Lamy","Xavier",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2024 17:26:49 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-02","timestamp":1719768409000,"abstract":"  We show that Lipschitz solutions $u$ of $\\mathrm{div}\\, G(\\nabla u)=0$ in\n$B_1\\subset\\mathbb R^2$ are $C^1$, for strictly monotone vector fields $G\\in\nC^0(\\mathbb R^2;\\mathbb R^2)$ satisfying a mild ellipticity condition. If\n$G=\\nabla F$ for a strictly convex function $F$, and $0\\leq \\lambda(\\xi)\\leq\n\\Lambda(\\xi)$ are the two eigenvalues of $\\nabla^2 F(\\xi)$, our assumption is\nthat the set $\\lbrace\\lambda=0\\rbrace \\cap \\lbrace \\Lambda=\\infty\\rbrace$,\nwhere ellipticity degenerates $both$ from below and from above, is finite. This\nextends results by De Silva and Savin (Duke Math. J. 151, No. 3, p.487-532,\n2010), which assumed either that set empty, or the larger set $\\lbrace\n\\lambda=0\\rbrace$ finite. Our main new input is to transfer estimates in\n$\\lbrace \\lambda > 0 \\rbrace $ to estimates in $\\lbrace \\Lambda <\\infty\\rbrace$\nby means of a conjugate equation. When $G$ is not a gradient, the ellipticity\nassumption needs to be interpreted in a specific way, and we highlight the\nnontrivial effect of the antisymmetric part of $\\nabla G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
