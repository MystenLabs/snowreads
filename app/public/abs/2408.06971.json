Two devices\nare presented, a near-infrared (NIR) laser using a 850 nm diode and a red laser\nusing a 650 nm diode. The NIR laser has $\\approx$1 mW on chip power, 6 nm of\nspectral coverage, instantaneous linewidth of 720$\\pm$80 kHz, and 12 dB side\nmode suppression ratio (SMSR). The red laser has 15 dB SMSR.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
