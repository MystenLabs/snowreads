The moduli space\nprovides a wall crossing between certain KSBA and K-moduli spaces and is the\nample model of the Hodge line bundle. In the case of K3 surfaces with a\nnon-symplectic automorphism, the moduli space gives a modular interpretation\nfor the Baily--Borel compactification.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
