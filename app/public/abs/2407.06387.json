However,\nwhen covariates are incorporated to capture between-group persistence, the\nresulting coefficients can be difficult to interpret as such. We propose the\nconditional rank-rank regression, which uses conditional ranks instead of\nunconditional ranks, to measure average within-group income persistence. This\nproperty is analogous to that of the unconditional rank-rank regression that\nmeasures the overall income persistence. The difference between conditional and\nunconditional rank-rank regression coefficients therefore can measure\nbetween-group persistence. We develop a flexible estimation approach using\ndistribution regression and establish a theoretical framework for large sample\ninference. An empirical study on intergenerational income mobility in\nSwitzerland demonstrates the advantages of this approach. The study reveals\nstronger intergenerational persistence between fathers and sons compared to\nfathers and daughters, with the within-group persistence explaining 62% of the\noverall income persistence for sons and 52% for daughters. Families of small\nsize or with highly educated fathers exhibit greater persistence in passing on\ntheir economic status.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
