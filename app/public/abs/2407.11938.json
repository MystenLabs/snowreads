The question of a\npossible correlation between the two events has implications for the comet's\noverall performance. In this note I examine the light curve at times of equal\nphase angles to circumvent the effect and show that the comet was as bright\nintrinsically in late March as it was in early May. From a plot of the comet's\nmagnitude at unit geocentric distance against the phase angle before and after\nits minimum on 18 April I derive a very steep phase law and a relatively flat,\nr^(-2.55) light curve failing to fit the recently reported magnitudes. After\nstalling in May and June, the comet's activity enters another surge (at a time\nof peak phase effect), as fragmentation continues.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
