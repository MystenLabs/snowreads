Specifically, atoms in subradiant states are promising\ncandidates for long-lifetime qubits and quantum memory because of the immunity\nto the common environment. However, subradiant states can still be influenced\nby local environments, which are incoherent for different atoms and cannot be\ncanceled out through interference. Here we propose to break this limit by\npreparing a waveguide QED system in the non-Markovian regime, where the\nultra-small decay rate arises because of the retarded interaction. We further\nshow that similar effect occurs spontaneously by self-interference and can be\nstressed by cooperative coupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
