We first provide a generic ISAC framework for\ndynamic target sensing based on massive multiple input and multiple output\n(MIMO) array. Next, we derive the relationship between the sensing channel of\nISAC base station (BS) and the 6D motion parameters of dynamic target. Then, we\nemploy the array signal processing methods to estimate the horizontal angle,\npitch angle, distance, and virtual velocity of dynamic target. Since the\nvirtual velocities observed by different antennas are different, we adopt plane\nfitting to estimate the dynamic target's radial velocity, horizontal angular\nvelocity, and pitch angular velocity from these virtual velocities. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 6D motion parameters\nestimation scheme, which also confirms a new finding that one single BS with\nmassive MIMO array is capable of estimating the horizontal angular velocity and\npitch angular velocity of dynamic target.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
