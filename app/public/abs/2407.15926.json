One may\nnaively expect that the temperature profile continuously decreases from the\nHawking temperature at the surface of the BH towards an outer region. We show\nanalytically and numerically that this is not the case because local thermal\nequilibrium cannot be maintained near the surface of the BH and also because\nthe high-energy particles emitted from Hawking radiation cannot be\ninstantaneously thermalized into the background plasma. The temperature profile\nhas a plateau within a finite distance from the BH, and even the overall\namplitude of background temperature at a distance far away from the BH is\nsignificantly suppressed compared with the naive expectation. The main reason\nfor these counterintuitive results comes from the fact that the size of the BH\nis too small that particles of Hawking radiation goes far away within the\ntypical time scale of interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
