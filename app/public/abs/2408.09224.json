Neuro-Symbolic AI is an\nemerging approach that leverages and augments the strengths of neural networks\nand symbolic reasoning. These systems have the potential to be more impactful\nand flexible than traditional AI systems, making them well-suited for military\napplications. This paper comprehensively explores the diverse dimensions and\ncapabilities of Neuro-Symbolic AI, aiming to shed light on its potential\napplications in military contexts. We investigate its capacity to improve\ndecision-making, automate complex intelligence analysis, and strengthen\nautonomous systems. We further explore its potential to solve complex tasks in\nvarious domains, in addition to its applications in military contexts. Through\nthis exploration, we address ethical, strategic, and technical considerations\ncrucial to the development and deployment of Neuro-Symbolic AI in military and\ncivilian applications. Contributing to the growing body of research, this study\nrepresents a comprehensive exploration of the extensive possibilities offered\nby Neuro-Symbolic AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
