We present a novel face-based voice conversion\nframework that particularly utilizes the average fundamental frequency of the\ntarget speaker, derived solely from their facial images. Through extensive\nanalysis, our framework demonstrates superior speech generation quality and the\nability to align facial features with voice characteristics, including tracking\nof the target speaker's fundamental frequency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
