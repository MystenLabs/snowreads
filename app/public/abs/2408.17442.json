Therefore, it is important to\ninvestigate fundamental properties of MBF. In particular, how the entropy of\nthe controlled system under the MBF behaves is of great interest. In this\nstudy, we examine this problem by deriving a sufficient condition that the time\nderivative of the von Neumann entropy is nonnegative under the MBF control.\nThis result is rigorously characterized by the variance of the system\nobservable and the quantumness of a given decoherence. We show the validity of\nthe result and physical interpretation in the example of qubit stabilizing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
