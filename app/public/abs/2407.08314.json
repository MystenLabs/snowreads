For\nincompressible flows, any force distribution $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r})$ acting in\nthe fluid bulk induces flow and motion only through its solenoidal component.\nFor force distributions that are spatially localized (i.e., vanish sufficiently\nfast at infinity), we derive the representation of the rigid body motion as an\nexplicit linear functional of $\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{f}$, which complements the\nusual representation in terms of $\\mathbf{f}$. We illustrate the utility of\nthis alternative representation, which has the advantage of having the\nincompressibility constraint built-in, in avoiding certain ambiguities that\narise, e.g., when implementing approximations for swimmers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
