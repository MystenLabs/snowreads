We show how this result relates to perturbative studies and sheds\nlight on numerical simulations. We also observe that the limit $N\\to 1$ may be\nof interest for the Ising spin glass, and point out potential relevance for\nnonuniversality in other contexts of random criticality.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
