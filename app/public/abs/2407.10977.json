In this\npaper, we introduce CIRCUITSYNTH, a novel approach that harnesses LLMs to\nfacilitate the automated synthesis of valid circuit topologies. With a dataset\ncomprising both valid and invalid circuit configurations, CIRCUITSYNTH employs\na sophisticated two-phase methodology, comprising Circuit Topology Generation\nand Circuit Topology Refinement. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CIRCUITSYNTH compared to various fine-tuned LLM variants. Our\napproach lays the foundation for future research aimed at enhancing circuit\nefficiency and specifying output voltage, thus enabling the automated\ngeneration of circuit topologies with improved performance and adherence to\ndesign requirements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
