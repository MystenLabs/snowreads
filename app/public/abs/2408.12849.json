Under suitable assumptions we show that\nthe associated ergodic optimality equations admit unique solutions. Finally,\nthe existence of Nash-equilibrium in randomized stationary strategies is\nestablished by showing that an appropriate set-valued map has a fixed point.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
