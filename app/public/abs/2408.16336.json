However, due to the utilization of\nthe hinge loss function, TSVM is sensitive to outliers or noise. To remedy it,\nwe introduce the guardian loss (G-loss), a novel loss function distinguished by\nits asymmetric, bounded, and smooth characteristics. We then fuse the proposed\nG-loss function into the TSVM and yield a robust and smooth classifier termed\nGL-TSVM. Further, to adhere to the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle\nand reduce overfitting, we incorporate a regularization term into the objective\nfunction of GL-TSVM. To address the optimization challenges of GL-TSVM, we\ndevise an efficient iterative algorithm. The experimental analysis on UCI and\nKEEL datasets substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed GL-TSVM in\ncomparison to the baseline models. Moreover, to showcase the efficacy of the\nproposed GL-TSVM in the biomedical domain, we evaluated it on the breast cancer\n(BreaKHis) and schizophrenia datasets. The outcomes strongly demonstrate the\ncompetitiveness of the proposed GL-TSVM against the baseline models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
