The survey categorizes CL according to who controls (users or\nplatforms), what is controllable (e.g., retrieval objectives, users' historical\nbehaviors, controllable environmental adaptation), how control is implemented\n(e.g., rule-based method, Pareto optimization, Hypernetwork), and where to\nimplement control (e.g.,pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing\nmethods). Then, we identify challenges faced by CL across training, evaluation,\ntask setting, and deployment in online environments. Additionally, we outline\npromising directions for CL in theoretical analysis, efficient computation,\nempowering large language models, application scenarios and evaluation\nframeworks in IR.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
