The conjecture $\\alpha(2n+1) = (2n+1) \\alpha(2n)$,\nprovided by Stanley[4], was proved by Blum[1] using a generating function. This\npaper presents a combinatorial proof for this conjecture. At the same time, we\ndemonstrate that all permutations with an even number of even cycles in both\n$S_{2n}$ and $S_{2n+1}$ can be categorized into three distinct types that\ncorrespond to each other.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
