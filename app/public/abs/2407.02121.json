Three rotational transitions with\nhalf-integer quantum numbers from $J$=7/2 to 11/2 have been observed with the\nYebes 40m radio telescope and assigned to HC$_3$N$^+$, which has an inverted\n$^2\\Pi$ ground electronic state. The three rotational transitions exhibit\nseveral hyperfine components due to the magnetic and nuclear quadrupole\ncoupling effects of the H and N nuclei. We confidently assign the\ncharacteristic rotational spectrum pattern to HC$_3$N$^+$ based on the good\nagreement between the astronomical and theoretical spectroscopic parameters. We\nderived a column density of (6.0$\\pm$0.6)$\\times$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a\nrotational temperature of 4.5$\\pm$1\\,K. The abundance ratio between HC$_3$N and\nHC$_3$N$^+$ is 3200$\\pm$320. As found for the larger members of the family of\ncyanopolyyne cations (HC$_5$N$^+$ and HC$_7$N$^+$), HC$_3$N$^+$ is mainly\nformed through the reactions of H$_2$ and the cation C$_3$N$^+$ and by the\nreactions of H$^+$ with HC$_3$N. In the same manner than other cyanopolyyne\ncations, HC$_3$N$^+$ is mostly destroyed through a reaction with H$_2$ and a\ndissociative recombination with electrons.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jLF04sFK_pXJDLU55I0vqRHaIEphSJMRYxcq7zCj_Ow","pdfSize":"227152"}
