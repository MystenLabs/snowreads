We establish a clear link\nbetween predictor serial correlation and the finite sample performance of the\nLASSO, showing that even orthogonal or weakly correlated stationary AR\nprocesses can lead to significant spurious correlations due to their serial\ncorrelations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach named\nARMAr-LASSO (ARMA residuals LASSO), which applies the LASSO to predictor time\nseries that have been pre-whitened with ARMA filters and lags of dependent\nvariable. Utilizing the near-epoch dependence framework, we derive both\nasymptotic results and oracle inequalities for the ARMAr-LASSO, and demonstrate\nthat it effectively reduces estimation errors while also providing an effective\nforecasting and feature selection strategy. Our findings are supported by\nextensive simulations and an application to real-world macroeconomic data,\nwhich highlight the superior performance of the ARMAr-LASSO for handling sparse\nlinear models in the context of time series.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N32o7nJQzuJKrjBO7BhRmhaVC9JVGFj9-avpDcPk-8E","pdfSize":"1017150"}
