One of our main results\nasserts that the canonical restriction-induction adjoint pair of the skew group\nalgebra extension $\\Lambda \\subset A$ induces a poset isomorphism between the\nposet of $G$-stable support $\\tau$-tilting modules over $\\Lambda$ and that of\n$(\\!\\!\\!\\mod G)$-stable support $\\tau$-tilting modules over $A$. We also\nestablish a similar poset isomorphism of posets of appropriate classes of\nsilting complexes over $\\Lambda$ and $A$. These two results generalize and\nunify preceding results by Huang-Zhang, Breaz-Marcus-Modoi and the second and\nthe third authors. Moreover, we give a practical condition under which\n$\\tau$-tilting finiteness and silting discreteness of $\\Lambda$ are inherited\nto those of $A$. As applications we study $\\tau$-tilting theory and silting\ntheory of the (generalized) preprojective algebras and the folded mesh\nalgebras. Among other things, we determine the posets of support $\\tau$-tilting\nmodules and of silting complexes over preprojective algebra $\\Pi(\\Bbb{L}_{n})$\nof type $\\Bbb{L}_{n}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tp-Ghm1rCH529CJ8aZMUT8CBXhKu7PnFNApdaaXSI1c","pdfSize":"480409"}
