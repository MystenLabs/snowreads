To demonstrate\nthe performance gain from adopting the multi-antenna technique, we first\nconsider the scenario when S, R and D all adopt single antenna, and apply\nhypothesis testing and statistics theories to develop a theoretical framework\nfor the covert performance modeling in terms of detection error probability\n(DEP) and covert throughput. We then consider the scenario when S, R and D all\nadopt multiple antennas, and apply the hypothesis testing, statistics and\nmatrix theories to develop corresponding theoretical framework for performance\nmodeling. We further explore the optimal designs of the target rate and\ntransmit power for covert throughput maximization under above both scenarios,\nsubjecting to the constraints of covertness, reliability and transmit power. To\nsolve the optimization problems, we employ Karushi-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions\nmethod in the single antenna scenario and a search algorithm in the\nmulti-antenna scenario. Finally, we provide extensive numerical results to\nillustrate how the multi-antenna technique can enhance the covert performance\nin two-hop relay systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
