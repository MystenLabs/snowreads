Whereas self-interaction is easy to\ncharacterize in one-electron systems, its orbital-dependent nature makes it\ndifficult to uniquely define and decompose it and other components of the KS\nenergy into orbital components. By starting from the orthogonal Hartree ansatz\nas the exchange-free self-interaction-free model, it is possible to uniquely\ndefine self-interaction and genuine exchange total energies as well as their\ndecomposition into orbital contributions. Using Edmiston-Ruedenberg orbitals as\na close numerical surrogate of the Hartree orbitals we investigate the accuracy\nof genuine exchange energies predicted by several levels of Jacob's ladder of\nfunctionals and their Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction corrected\ncounterparts. Among several notable insights provided by the per-orbital\nbreakdown of the KS energies the key is the delicate cancellation of errors\nbetween core and valence orbitals that belies the remarkable accuracy of many\nfunctionals (particularly, GGAs). Disruption of the cancellation by the PZ\ncorrection accounts for its relatively modest impact on GGAs and other\nsemilocal functionals.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
