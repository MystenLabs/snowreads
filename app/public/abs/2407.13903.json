To leverage limitations in terms of the\naccessible length and time scales, one requires a physically justified\ninteratomic potential which is accurate to correctly account for the complexity\nof iron-oxygen systems. Such a potential is not yet available in the\nliterature. In this work, we propose a machine-learning potential based on the\nAtomic Cluster Expansion for modeling the iron-oxygen system, which explicitly\naccounts for magnetism. We test the potential on a wide range of properties of\niron and its oxides, and demonstrate its ability to describe the thermodynamics\nof systems spanning the whole range of oxygen content and including magnetic\ndegrees of freedom.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
