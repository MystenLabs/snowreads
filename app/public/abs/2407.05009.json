These systems are often\ndescribed by transport equations, all coupled through an integro-differential\nequation. In this paper, we address the understudied aspect of the\ncontrollability of reparable systems. In particular, we focus on a two-state\nreparable system and our goal is to design a control strategy that enhances the\nsystem availability -- the probability of being operational when needed. We\nestablish bilinear controllability, demonstrating that appropriate control\nactions can manipulate system dynamics to achieve desired availability levels.\nWe provide theoretical foundations and develop control strategies that leverage\nthe bilinear structure of the equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
