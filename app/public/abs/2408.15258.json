This suggests that human\ncognition can predict the unfolding of physical events using an intuitive\nprediction process. This process might result from memory recall, yielding a\nqualitatively believable mental image, though it may not be exactly according\nto real-world physics. Drawing inspiration from the intriguing human ability to\nqualitatively visualize and describe dynamic events from past experiences\nwithout explicitly engaging in mathematical computations, this paper\ninvestigates the application of recent transformer architectures as a\nneuro-animator model. The visual transformer model is trained to predict flag\nmotions at the \\emph{t+1} time step, given information of previous motions from\n\\emph{t-n} $\\cdots$ \\emph{t} time steps. The results show that the visual\ntransformer-based architecture successfully learns temporal embedding of flag\nmotions and produces reasonable quality simulations of flag waving under\ndifferent wind forces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2EnM4dZxvJTGHJ-gZcJ9HTnt2zNX08OjpRWsDm0nrKs","pdfSize":"1100036"}
