This study introduces a novel composite forecasting framework that\nintegrates variational mode decomposition (VMD), PatchTST, and adaptive\nscale-weighted layer (ASWL) to address these challenges. Utilizing datasets of\nfour major stock indices--SP500, DJI, SSEC, and FTSE--from 2000 to 2024, the\nproposed method first decomposes the raw price series into intrinsic mode\nfunctions (IMFs) using VMD. Each IMF is then modeled with PatchTST to capture\ntemporal patterns effectively. The ASWL module is applied to incorporate scale\ninformation, enhancing prediction accuracy. The final forecast is derived by\naggregating predictions from all IMFs. The VMD-PatchTST-ASWL framework\ndemonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to\ntraditional models, showing robust performance across different indices. This\ninnovative approach provides a powerful tool for stock index price forecasting,\nwith potential applications in various financial analysis and investment\ndecision-making contexts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
