Such a channel is motivated by\napplications in molecular data storage and forensics, and we refer to it as the\ntorn-paper channel. We characterize the capacity of this channel under\narbitrary fragment length distributions and deletion probabilities. Precisely,\nwe show that the capacity is given by a closed-form expression that can be\ninterpreted as F - A, where F is the coverage fraction ,i.e., the fraction of\nthe input codeword that is covered by output fragments, and A is an alignment\ncost incurred due to the lack of ordering in the output fragments. We then\nconsider a noisy version of the problem, where the fragments are corrupted by\nbinary symmetric noise. We derive upper and lower bounds to the capacity, both\nof which can be seen as F - A expressions. These bounds match for specific\nchoices of fragment length distributions, and they are approximately tight in\ncases where there are not too many short fragments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
