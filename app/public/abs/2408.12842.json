However, most of them could not strike a\ngood balance between privacy protection and good data utility. In this paper,\nwe propose DP-STTS, a differentially private spatiotemporal trajectory\nsynthesizer with high data utility, which employs a model composed of a start\nspatiotemporal cube distribution and a 1-order Markov process. Specially,\nDP-STTS firstly discretizes the raw spatiotemporal trajectories into\nneighboring cubes, such that the model size is limited and the model's\ntolerance for noise could be enhanced. Then, a Markov process is utilized for\nthe next location point picking. After adding noise under differential privacy\n(DP) to the model, synthetic trajectories that preserve essential spatial and\ntemporal characteristics of the real trajectories are generated from the noisy\nmodel. Experiments on one real-life dataset demonstrate that DP-STTS provides\ngood data utility.
