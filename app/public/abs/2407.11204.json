EyeDentify addresses the lack\nof available datasets for pupil diameter estimation, a crucial domain for\nunderstanding physiological and psychological states traditionally dominated by\nhighly specialized sensor systems such as Tobii. Unlike these advanced sensor\nsystems and associated costs, webcam images are more commonly found in\npractice. Yet, deep learning models that can estimate pupil diameters using\nstandard webcam data are scarce. By providing a dataset of cropped eye images\nalongside corresponding pupil diameter information, EyeDentify enables the\ndevelopment and refinement of models designed specifically for less-equipped\nenvironments, democratizing pupil diameter estimation by making it more\naccessible and broadly applicable, which in turn contributes to multiple\ndomains of understanding human activity and supporting healthcare.
