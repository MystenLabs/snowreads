Here we\nfocus on the emergence of spatiotemporal density waves in a one-dimensional\n\"cell train.\" Combining a minimal theoretical model with observations in an in\nvitro experimental system of MDCK epithelial cells confined to a linear\npattern, we examine the spontaneous oscillations driven by the feedback between\nmyosin activation and mechanical deformations and their effect on the response\nof the tissue to externally applied deformations. We show that the nature and\nfrequency of spontaneous oscillations is controlled by the size of the cell\ntrain, with a transition from size-dependent standing waves to intrinsic\nspontaneous waves at the natural frequency of the tissue. The response to\nexternal boundary perturbations exhibit a resonance at this natural frequency,\nproviding a possible venue for inferring the mechanochemical couplings that\ncontrol the tissue behavior from rheological experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
