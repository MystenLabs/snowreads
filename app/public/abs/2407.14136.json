To bridge this\ngap, we propose a novel approach called the head Translation, Rotation, and\nface Geometry network (TRG), which stands out for its explicit bidirectional\ninteraction structure. This structure has been carefully designed to leverage\nthe complementary relationship between face geometry and head translation,\nmarking a significant advancement in the field of head pose estimation. Our\ncontributions also include the development of a strategy for estimating\nbounding box correction parameters and a technique for aligning landmarks to\nimage. Both of these innovations demonstrate superior performance in 6DoF head\npose estimation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on ARKitFace and BIWI\ndatasets confirm that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art\ntechniques.
