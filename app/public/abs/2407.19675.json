In practice, the labeled data are difficult to obtain because the\nAQA annotation process requires domain-specific expertise. In this paper, we\npropose a novel semi-supervised method, which can be utilized for better\nassessment of the AQA task by exploiting a large amount of unlabeled data and a\nsmall portion of labeled data. Differing from the traditional teacher-student\nnetwork, we propose a teacher-reference-student architecture to learn both\nunlabeled and labeled data, where the teacher network and the reference network\nare used to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data to supervise the student\nnetwork. Specifically, the teacher predicts pseudo-labels by capturing\nhigh-level features of unlabeled data. The reference network provides adequate\nsupervision of the student network by referring to additional action\ninformation. Moreover, we introduce confidence memory to improve the\nreliability of pseudo-labels by storing the most accurate ever output of the\nteacher network and reference network. To validate our method, we conduct\nextensive experiments on three AQA benchmark datasets. Experimental results\nshow that our method achieves significant improvements and outperforms existing\nsemi-supervised AQA methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
