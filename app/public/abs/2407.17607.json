This paper focuses on integrating GaAsSb (with absorption in the\nC-band at 1550nm) with silicon to fabricate photodiodes, leveraging epitaxial\nlayer transfer (ELT) methods. Two ELT techniques, epitaxial lift-off (ELO) and\nmacro-transfer printing (MTP), are compared for transferring GaAsSb films from\nInP substrates to Si, forming PIN diodes. Characterization through atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibits a\nhigh-quality, defect-free interface. Current-voltage (IV) measurements and\ncapacitance-voltage (CV) analysis validate the quality and functionality of the\nheterostructures. Photocurrent measurements at room temperature and 200 K\ndemonstrate the device's photo-response at 1550 nm, highlighting the presence\nof an active interface.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
