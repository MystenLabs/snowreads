We\nprove the existence of a positive integer $z_2$ such that any $2$-edge coloring\nof $K_{n,n}$ with at least $z_2$ edges in each color contains at least one of\nthese patterns. We give a general upper bound for $z_2$ and prove its tightness\nfor some cases. We define the concepts of bipartite $r$-tonality and bipartite\nomnitonality using the complete bipartite graph as a base graph. We provide a\ncharacterization for bipartite $r$-tonal graphs and prove that every tree is\nbipartite omnitonal. Finally, we define the bipartite balancing number and\nprovide the exact bipartite balancing number for paths and stars.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
