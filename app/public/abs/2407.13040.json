This research extends the current computational\nwork on potentially euphemistic terms (PETs) to Turkish. We introduce the\nTurkish PET dataset, the first available of its kind in the field. By creating\na list of euphemisms in Turkish, collecting example contexts, and annotating\nthem, we provide both euphemistic and non-euphemistic examples of PETs in\nTurkish. We describe the dataset and methodologies, and also experiment with\ntransformer-based models on Turkish euphemism detection by using our dataset\nfor binary classification. We compare performances across models using F1,\naccuracy, and precision as evaluation metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
