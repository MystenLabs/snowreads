The answer\nto this question is no. To reach this conclusion, two main arguments are\ndiscussed. The first characterises COARA as a form of 'technocracy' perfectly\nconsistent with a neo-liberal view of research. The second consists in the\nadoption of Philip Kitcher's idea of well-ordered science. It is argued that\nadministrative evaluation of research, even if correct on the basis of COARA\nprinciples, is at odds with the principles of well-ordered science since it\ncannot escape neither the tyranny of expertise nor the tyranny of ignorance.\nThese two arguments allow to suggest limiting administrative evaluation to the\nbare minimum (recruitment of researchers and funding of projects), and to focus\nattention mainly to the fairness of evaluation procedures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
