The\nformation processes for these vortices is poorly understood, and aside from a\nfew known, long-lived ovals, such as the Great Red Spot, and Oval BA, vortex\nstability and their temporal evolution are currently largely unknown. In this\nstudy, we use JunoCam data and a citizen-science project on Zooniverse to\nderive a catalog of vortices, some with repeated observations, through May 2018\nto Sep 2021, and analyze their associated properties, such as size, location\nand color. We find that different colored vortices (binned as white, red, brown\nand dark), follow vastly different distributions in terms of their sizes and\nwhere they are found on the planet. We employ a simplified stability criterion\nusing these vortices as a proxy, to derive a minimum Rossby deformation length\nfor the planet of $\\sim1800$ km. We find that this value of $L_d$ is largely\nconstant throughout the atmosphere, and does not have an appreciable meridional\ngradient.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AoC0d5paY4jmulEs7zScaInDZZt0nUoZLYpS8MFcLWM","pdfSize":"37656016"}
