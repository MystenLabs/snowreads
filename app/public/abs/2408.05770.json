In this work, we present a\npreviously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons in\nsemimetals. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the\nRaman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the\npossibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic\ncoupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we\ndemonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of\ncreating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our\nwork highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering\npotential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of\nsemimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
