Through empirical evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that Sentence Transformers outperform TF-IDF features across\nvarious experimental setups. Our team, dzStance, participated in a stance\ndetection competition, achieving the 13th position (74.91%) among 15 teams in\nWomen Empowerment, 10th (73.43%) in COVID Vaccine, and 12th (66.97%) in Digital\nTransformation. Overall, our team's performance ranked 13th (71.77%) among all\nparticipants. Notably, our approach achieved promising F1-scores, highlighting\nits effectiveness in identifying writers' stances on diverse topics. These\nresults underscore the potential of Sentence Transformers to enhance stance\ndetection models for addressing critical societal issues.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IKir9wRTB6l7KEpXzC4QuBLJYsVwTNxaZm4VSooddsI","pdfSize":"140485","objectId":"0x1d4e9301af0a6394405d0e301fd9da6ffc59f83d034142d86a69c93882e368aa","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
