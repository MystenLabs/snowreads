The\nKrylov exponent characterising the exponential growth of Krylov complexity is\nconjectured to upper-bound the Lyapunov exponent. We compute the Krylov and the\nLyapunov exponents in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and in some of its\ndeformations. We do this analysis both at infinite and finite temperatures, in\nmodels where the number of fermionic interactions is both finite and infinite.\nWe consider deformations that interpolate between two regions of near-maximal\nchaos and deformations that become nearly-integrable at low temperatures. In\nall cases, we find that the Krylov exponent upper-bounds the Lyapunov one.\nHowever, we find that while the Lyapunov exponent can have non-monotonic\nbehaviour as a function of temperature, in all studied examples the Krylov\nexponent behaves monotonically. For instance, we find models where the Lyapunov\nexponent goes to zero at low temperatures, while the Krylov exponent saturates\nto its maximal bound. We speculate on the possibility that this monotonicity\nmight be a generic feature of the Krylov exponent in quantum systems evolving\nunder unitary evolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
