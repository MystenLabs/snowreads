Starting with an introduction to the basics of\nNewton-Cartan geometry, we examine the motion of point particles within this\nframework, leading to a detailed analysis of kinetic theory and the derivation\nof conservation equations. The equilibrium distribution function is explored,\nand the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed.\nFurther, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis\nthrough a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive\nrelations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox,\npresenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies. Our\nconstruction resolves a fifty-year-old debate about the frame-indifferent\nformulation of kinetic theory. The resolution is presented in a modern,\nsymmetry-based approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
