In contrast to prior studies\non paraconsistent DLs, we allow truth value operators in the query language,\nwhich can be used to differentiate between answers having contradictory\nevidence and those having only positive evidence. We present a reduction to\nclassical DL query answering that allows us to pinpoint the precise combined\nand data complexity of answering queries with values in paraconsistent\n$\\mathcal{ALCHI}$ and its sublogics. Notably, we show that tractable data\ncomplexity is retained for Horn DLs. We present a comparison with repair-based\ninconsistency-tolerant semantics, showing that the two approaches are\nincomparable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Databases","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P6ToZ2Jyt25uUfevY7WaByotqW7dOqNxU_xyRC80J2o","pdfSize":"338396"}
