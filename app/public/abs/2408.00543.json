The method employs a\ncommon BFGS matrix to approximate the Hessian matrix of all objective functions\nin each iteration. This matrix is updated using function and gradient\ninformation from the previous step. Our analysis confirms the convergence of\nthe method without relying on convexity assumptions. We also establish a local\nsuperlinear convergence rate for MFQNMO under mild conditions and validate its\neffectiveness through experiments on both nonconvex and convex test problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
