The time\nevolution of these CRNs is driven by the kinetics of the law of mass action. A\nscaling analysis is done when the rates of external arrivals of chemical\nspecies are proportional to a large scaling parameter $N$. A natural hierarchy\nof fast processes, a subset of the coordinates of $(X_i(t))$, is determined by\nthe values of the mapping $i{\\mapsto}k_i$. We show that the scaled vector of\ncoordinates $i$ such that $k_i{=}1$ and the scaled occupation measure of the\nother coordinates are converging in distribution to a deterministic limit as\n$N$ gets large. The proof of this result is obtained by establishing a\nfunctional equation for the limiting points of the occupation measure, by an\ninduction on the hierarchy of timescales and with relative entropy functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FYvlocuQE9ihCJNEgWSvfiOWtxccP_B2U8tIwVhg4yE","pdfSize":"406855"}
