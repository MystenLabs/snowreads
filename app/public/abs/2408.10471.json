In this paper, we\ninvestigate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of CHMs. We show that any $n\\times\nn$ CHM with dephased form has two constant eigenvalues $\\pm\\sqrt{n}$ and has\ntwo constant eigenvectors. We obtain the maximum numbers of identical\neigenvalues of $6\\times 6$ CHMs with dephased form and we extend this result to\narbitrary dimension. We also show that there is no $6\\times 6$ CHM with four\nidentical eigenvalues. We conjecture that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of\n$6\\times 6$ CHMs will lead to the complete classification of $6\\times 6$ CHMs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
