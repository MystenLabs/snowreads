We show that the equations of motion can\nbe decoupled in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, revealing the existence of a\nfourth constant of motion. The equations of motion can be analytically\nintegrated. The solutions are presented in terms of elementary and elliptic\nfunctions. In addition, we discuss the possible orbits for both uncharged\nparticles (in which case the motion is geodesic) and charged particles,\nrespectively. A typical orbit is bounded in the radial direction and escapes to\ninfinity in the $z-$ direction. However, the presence of the electromagnetic\nfields also leads to the existence of planar orbits.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
