Our analysis uses the problem of industrial shift scheduling in\nmanufacturing and the Quantum Industrial Shift Scheduling algorithm. We base\nour figures of merit on current technology, as well as theoretical\nhigh-fidelity scenarios for superconducting qubit platforms. We find that the\nexecution time of gate and measurement operations determines the overall\ncomputational runtime more strongly than the system error rates. Moreover,\nachieving a quantum speedup would not only require low system error rates\n($10^{-6}$ or better), but also measurement operations with an execution time\nbelow 10ns. This rules out the possibility of near-term quantum advantage for\nthis use case, and suggests that significant technological or algorithmic\nprogress will be needed before such an advantage can be achieved.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cS9Q7soxlCsfXqJUDv-icvF_eRq8Oaje62rr2Wqfy0U","pdfSize":"1071582","txDigest":"CPAifmTj6WcQdQ5cFvkMpQ8icQdq4TekFdH8YesUNjuq","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
