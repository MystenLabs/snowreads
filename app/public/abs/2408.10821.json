However, lakes are\nincreasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. Therefore,\ncontinuous global monitoring of lake dynamics is crucial, but remains\nchallenging on a large scale. The recently developed Global Lakes Area Database\n(GLAKES) has mapped over 3.4 million lakes worldwide, but it only provides data\nat decadal intervals, which may be insufficient to capture rapid or short-term\nchanges.This paper introduces an expanded lake database, GLAKES-Additional,\nwhich offers biennial delineations and area measurements for 152,567 lakes\nglobally from 1990 to 2021. We employed the Swin-Unet model, replacing\ntraditional convolution operations, to effectively address the challenges posed\nby the receptive field requirements of high spatial resolution satellite\nimagery. The increased biennial time resolution helps to quantitatively\nattribute lake area changes to climatic and hydrological drivers, such as\nprecipitation and temperature changes.For predicting lake area changes, we used\na Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and an extended time series\ndataset for preliminary modeling. Under climate and land use scenarios, our\nmodel achieved an RMSE of 0.317 km^2 in predicting future lake area changes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
