A challenge in seizure detection is\nthat patient-specific models typically outperform patient-independent models.\nHowever, in a wearable device one typically starts with a patient-independent\nmodel, until such patient-specific data is available. To avoid having to\nconstruct a new classifier with this data, as required in conventional kernel\nmachines, we propose a transfer learning approach with a tensor kernel machine.\nThis method learns the primal weights in a compressed form using the canonical\npolyadic decomposition, making it possible to efficiently update the weights of\nthe patient-independent model with patient-specific data. The results show that\nthis patient fine-tuned model reaches as high a performance as a\npatient-specific SVM model with a model size that is twice as small as the\npatient-specific model and ten times as small as the patient-independent model.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gqXB191ivszPl4DJQOdEaUjg03ZBIcwCRn1Gz5Y2Dtg","pdfSize":"177780"}
