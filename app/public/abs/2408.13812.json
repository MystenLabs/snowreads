In the past decade, machine\nlearning techniques have gradually become one of the mainstream methods in PID,\nusually providing superior discrimination power compared to classical\nalgorithms. In recent years, quantum machine learning (QML) has bridged the\ntraditional machine learning and the quantum computing techniques, providing\nfurther improvement potential for traditional machine learning models. In this\nwork, targeting at the $\\mu^{\\pm} /\\pi^{\\pm}$ discrimination problem at the\nBESIII experiment, we developed a variational quantum classifier (VQC) with\nnine qubits. Using the IBM quantum simulator, we studied various encoding\ncircuits and variational ansatzes to explore their performance. Classical\noptimizers are able to minimize the loss function in quantum-classical hybrid\nmodels effectively. A comparison of VQC with the traditional multiple layer\nperception neural network reveals they perform similarly on the same datasets.\nThis illustrates the feasibility to apply quantum machine learning to data\nanalysis in collider physics experiments in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
