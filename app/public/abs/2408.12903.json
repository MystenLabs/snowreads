In this work,\nwe demonstrate a quantum sensor that exploits the phase of a single electron\nwavefunction, measured in an electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer, to detect a\nclassical time-dependent electric field. The time resolution, limited by the\ntemporal width of the electronic wavepacket, is a few tens of picoseconds. The\ninterferometry technique provides a voltage resolution of a few tens of\nmicrovolts, corresponding to a few microwave photons. Importantly, our detector\nsimultaneously probes the amplitude of the field from the phase of the measured\ninterference pattern and its fluctuations from the interference contrast. This\ncapability paves the way for on-chip detection of quantum radiation, such as\nsqueezed or Fock states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
