The first estimator is derived\ndirectly from the model equation without any post-processing technique. We\nrigorously prove the efficiency and reliability of the estimator by\nconstructing bubble functions. Additionally, we extend this type of estimator\nto general fourth-order elliptic equations with various boundary conditions.\nThe second estimator is based on projecting the Dirac delta function onto the\ndiscrete finite element space, allowing the application of a standard\nestimator. Notably, we additionally incorporate the projection error into the\nstandard estimator. The efficiency and reliability of the estimator are also\nverified through rigorous analysis. We validate the performance of these a\nposteriori estimates within an adaptive algorithm and demonstrate their\nrobustness and expected accuracy through extensive numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zvdBaPVyN1pp-Hh_ld9gqb5vBEW7u7M6X_kcGT94eY0","pdfSize":"2949585"}
