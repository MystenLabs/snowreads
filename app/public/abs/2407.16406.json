To address this, we transform\nAffective Forecasting into a Deep Learning problem by designing an Emotion\nForecasting paradigm based on two-party interactions. We propose a novel\nEmotion Forecasting (EF) task grounded in the theory that an individuals\nemotions are easily influenced by the emotions or other information conveyed\nduring interactions with another person. To tackle this task, we have developed\na specialized dataset, Human-interaction-based Emotion Forecasting (Hi-EF),\nwhich contains 3069 two-party Multilayered-Contextual Interaction Samples\n(MCIS) with abundant affective-relevant labels and three modalities. Hi-EF not\nonly demonstrates the feasibility of the EF task but also highlights its\npotential. Additionally, we propose a methodology that establishes a\nfoundational and referential baseline model for the EF task and extensive\nexperiments are provided.
