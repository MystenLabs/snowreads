The method is based on the Mellin-Barnes\nrepresentation of the Feynman integral. The Meijer theorem and its corollary\nare used to perform the integration over the Gamma functions, exponential\nfunctions, and hypergeometric functions. We also discuss the application of the\nmethod in other multi-loop Feynman integrals.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_xyOoRadc9dqIHnBCJQV4fvadhS4AGiUqW6X1qBuMC0","pdfSize":"245591","txDigest":"t7XSENU99Z2abqX2hqsPnaico2xtwCBJQAfQtjhVBMT","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
