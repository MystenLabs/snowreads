We establish basic\nfacts about mixed-platonic manifolds which allow us to conclude, among other\nthings, that there is no mixed-platonic hyperbolic knot complement with hidden\nsymmetries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
