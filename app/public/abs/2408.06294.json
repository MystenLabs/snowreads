Besides emoticons or stickers, messaging\nusers continue seeking richer options for affective communication. Recent\nresearch explored using chat balloons' shape and color to communicate emotional\nstates. However, little work explored whether and how chat-balloon animations\ncould be designed to convey emotions. We present the design of AniBalloons, 30\nchat-balloon animations conveying Joy, Anger, Sadness, Surprise, Fear, and\nCalmness. Using AniBalloons as a research means, we conducted three studies to\nassess the animations' affect recognizability and emotional properties (N =\n40), and probe how animated chat balloons would influence communication\nexperience in typical scenarios including instant messaging (N = 72) and\nchatbot service (N = 70). Our exploration contributes a set of chat-balloon\nanimations to complement non-nonverbal affective communication for a range of\nmessage-based interfaces, and empirical insights into how animated chat\nballoons might mediate particular conversation experiences (e.g., perceived\ninterpersonal closeness, or chatbot personality).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GRzdgpNmb9iB1h2-Lmvo9ZlB7Tz8fFVacEdDjjCcruQ","pdfSize":"6638606"}
