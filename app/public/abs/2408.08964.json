However, there has yet to be a\nlarge-scale and diverse sentiment analysis dataset on code-mixed Bengali. We\naddress this limitation by introducing BnSentMix, a sentiment analysis dataset\non code-mixed Bengali consisting of 20,000 samples with $4$ sentiment labels\nfrom Facebook, YouTube, and e-commerce sites. We ensure diversity in data\nsources to replicate realistic code-mixed scenarios. Additionally, we propose\n$14$ baseline methods including novel transformer encoders further pre-trained\non code-mixed Bengali-English, achieving an overall accuracy of $69.8\\%$ and an\nF1 score of $69.1\\%$ on sentiment classification tasks. Detailed analyses\nreveal variations in performance across different sentiment labels and text\ntypes, highlighting areas for future improvement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
