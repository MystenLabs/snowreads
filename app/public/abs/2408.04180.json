This\nreport details the primary features of the detector, the electronics involved,\nand preliminary physics results from the operational phase, particularly the\nON-OFF analysis comparing the signals with the reactor in operation (ON) and\nduring the maintenance shut-down (OFF), demonstrating the detector's capability\nto monitor reactor activity. Additionally, we will briefly discuss the\nprospects of using a cryogenic calorimeter to detect neutrinos via Coherent\nElastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS), highlighting potential\nadvancements in neutrino detection technology. Looking ahead, the project\npromises to play a crucial role in the integration of Latin American scientists\nand engineers into global scientific collaborations, significantly contributing\nto the LASF4RI and the broader HECAP strategic framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vQY_VFJnNWgfCUmmFEWabbscbOjz31jFvujMat5XKII","pdfSize":"842498"}
