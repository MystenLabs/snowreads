We construct density\n$\\varrho$ and velocity $u$ such that, for any $\\alpha<1/7$, both of them are\n$\\alpha $-H\\\"older continuous and $(\\varrho, u)$ is a weak solution to the\nunderlying equations. The proof is based on typical convex integration\ntechniques using Mikado flows as building blocks. As a main novelty with\nrespect to the related literature, our result produces a H\\\"older continuous\ndensity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
