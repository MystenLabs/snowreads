In this paper, we present an\napproach to perturbation theory in spherical symmetry that addresses\nsimultaneously some conceivably inconvenient aspects of the traditional\nmethods. In particular, focusing on Schwarzschild's background we are able to\nderive a decoupled wave equation, for a single complex variable, by simply\ncomputing one component of the curvature wave equation satisfied by a complex\nself-dual version of the Riemann tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the\nvariable consist only of even and odd pieces of the metric fluctuation,\nrespectively, and both satisfy the Regge-Wheeler equation. Besides providing a\nsystematic derivation of decoupled equations, an immediate corollary of our\nresults is the isospectrality between even and odd sectors. We conclude by\ndiscussing potential extensions of our formalism to include matter and higher\norders in perturbation theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
