However, how SUSY casts the light on nonequilibrium dynamics remains\nopen. In this letter, we investigate the Kibble-Zurek dynamics across a QCP\nwith emergent $\\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY between the Dirac semimetal and a\nsuperconductor through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation. The scaling\nbehaviors in the whole driven process are uncovered to satisfy the full\nfinite-time scaling (FTS) forms. More crucially, we demonstrate that the\nemergent SUSY manifests in the intimate relation between the FTS behaviors of\nfermionic and bosonic observables, namely the fermions and bosons acquire the\nidentical anomalous dimensions. Our work not only brings a fundamental new\ningredient into the critical theory with SUSY, but also provide the theoretical\nguidance to experimental detect of QCP with emergent SUSY from the perspectives\nof Kibble-Zurek mechanism and FTS.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QnR0GXGXcASG4yrdRfxwYe9Pjh9UtIoElO5fhxeKmm0","pdfSize":"962642"}
