However, TTS evaluation needs to be revisited to make sense of the\nresults obtained with the new architectures, approaches and datasets. We\npropose evaluating the quality of synthetic speech as a combination of multiple\nfactors such as prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility. Our approach\nassesses how well synthetic speech mirrors real speech by obtaining correlates\nof each factor and measuring their distance from both real speech datasets and\nnoise datasets. We benchmark 35 TTS systems developed between 2008 and 2024 and\nshow that our score computed as an unweighted average of factors strongly\ncorrelates with the human evaluations from each time period.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
