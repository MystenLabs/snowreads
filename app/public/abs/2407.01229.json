The paper\nestablishes rigorous upper and lower bounds, as well as code constructions\nbased on techniques from coding theory, optimization, and projective geometry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
