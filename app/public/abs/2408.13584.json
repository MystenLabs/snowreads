From the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau\n(TDGL) equations for two-component superconductors, we apply linear instability\ntheory and develop a semi-analytical method that provides the critical flux for\nphase-slip occurrence. The developed method was applied to investigate how the\ncritical flux depends on physical properties, such as band parameters and\ntemperature. Finally, we show the possible existence of a soliton state, in\nwhich the phase winding number is different in each condensate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TSZBBApMp1LomCyIa0DQuywGgjNKU-NV5Ggc_AxSZV8","pdfSize":"730122"}
