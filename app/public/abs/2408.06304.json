Trust assurances in the target are provided by testing whether\nits execution follows an authorised control-flow path. The problem has been\nexplored in various settings, such as assessing the trustworthiness of\ncyber-physical systems, Internet of Things devices, cloud platforms, and many\nothers. Despite a significant number of proposals being made in recent years,\nthe area remains fragmented, addressing different adversarial behaviours,\nverification paradigms, and deployment challenges. In this paper, we present\nthe first survey of control-flow attestation, examining the core ideas and\nsolutions in state-of-the-art schemes. In total, we survey over 30 papers\npublished between 2016-2024, consolidate and compare their key features, and\npose several challenges and recommendations for future research in the area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
