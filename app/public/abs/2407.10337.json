One of these conditions leads us to a\ngeneral Lichnerowicz equation with analytic and geometric coefficients for this\nclass of metrics on the space of warping functions. In this way, we prove\ngradient estimates for positive solutions of a nonlinear elliptic differential\nequation on a complete Riemannian manifold with associated Bakry-\\'Emery Ricci\ntensor bounded from below. As an application, we provide nonexistence and\nrigidity results for a large class of gradient Einstein-type warped metrics.\nFurthermore, we show how to construct gradient Einstein-type warped metrics,\nand then we give explicit examples which are not only meaningful in their own\nright, but also help to justify our results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
