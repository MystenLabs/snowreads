Focusing on\ncontact-rich rummaging, our approach leverages mutual information between the\nobject pose distribution and robot trajectory for action planning. From an\nobserved partial point cloud, RUMI deduces the compatible object pose\ndistribution and approximates the mutual information of it with workspace\noccupancy in real time. Based on this, we develop an information gain cost\nfunction and a reachability cost function to keep the object within the robot's\nreach. These are integrated into a model predictive control (MPC) framework\nwith a stochastic dynamics model, updating the pose distribution in a closed\nloop. Key contributions include a new belief framework for object pose\nestimation, an efficient information gain computation strategy, and a robust\nMPC-based control scheme. RUMI demonstrates superior performance in both\nsimulated and real tasks compared to baseline methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
