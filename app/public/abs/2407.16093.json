The formula implies that, letting $\\tau_x^\\varnothing$, $\\tau_x^+$, and\n$\\tau_x^-$ be the rooted spanning tree polynomials obtained respectively by\nremoving an edge in both directions or by forcing the tree to pass through\neither direction of that edge, the vectors $(\\tau_x^\\varnothing, \\tau_x^+,\n\\tau_x^-)$ are coplanar for all roots $x$. We deploy the result to give an\nalternative derivation of a recently found mutual linearity of stationary\ncurrents of Markov chains. We generalize deletion-constriction and current\nlinearity among two edges, and conjecture that similar results may hold for\narbitrary subsets of edges.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
