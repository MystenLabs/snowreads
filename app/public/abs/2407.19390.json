However, most of those studies are for\nmarkets under the continuous auction, i.e. trades are executed sequentially.\nThere has been less research on another major type of auction, call auctions,\nwhere orders are accumulated and those are executed at once in the final\nmoment. This study focuses on the structure of the limit order books of stocks\nunder the call auctions. Using the data of all stocks listed in the Tokyo Stock\nExchange, we find that the shape of the limit order books in call auctions are\nwell fitted by a simple functional form of hyperbolic tangent. From the\nfitting, we define the ``median spread'' and the ``width'' of limit orders. The\nratio of the ``width'' to the ``median spread'' of most stocks are found to be\nsimilar, indicating that the execution ratio (the trading volume relative to\nthe total number of orders) are nearly equal among them. Furthermore, the\ndeviation in this ratio from the majority is found to be a good indicator for\nfinding the stocks of the companies making outstanding profit. Our results\ndemonstrate that those parameters of the structure of the limit order book well\ncharacterizes the states of the market under call auctions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
