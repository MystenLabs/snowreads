We start with linear\nautomorphism that is hyperbolic and whose eigenvectors are orthogonal. Then we\nstudy the perturbation of such maps by trigonometric polynomial. It is known\nthat there exist a (continuous) map $H$ which acts as a change of coordinate\nbetween the perturbed and unperturbed system, but such a map is in general, not\ndifferentiable. By \"re-scaling\" the parametrization $H$, we will be able to\nobtain the explicit formula for the tangent vectors of these maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"53IsDBewHMvbo72-7JzgYhR3W7A_9KL7Pxrx8MV1cUA","pdfSize":"252865"}
