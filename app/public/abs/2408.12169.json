A\ncomprehensive collection of matrices, along with a scoring method for measuring\nthe quality of visual patterns in these matrices, contributes to building a\nbenchmark. This benchmark is essential for selecting or designing suitable\nreordering algorithms for specific tasks. In this paper, we build a matrix\nreordering benchmark, ReorderBench, with the goal of evaluating and improving\nmatrix reordering techniques. This is achieved by generating a large set of\nrepresentative and diverse matrices and scoring these matrices with a\nconvolution- and entropy-based method. Our benchmark contains 2,835,000 binary\nmatrices and 5,670,000 continuous matrices, each featuring one of four visual\npatterns: block, off-diagonal block, star, or band. We demonstrate the\nusefulness of ReorderBench through three main applications in matrix\nreordering: 1) evaluating different reordering algorithms, 2) creating a\nunified scoring model to measure the visual patterns in any matrix, and 3)\ndeveloping a deep learning model for matrix reordering.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
