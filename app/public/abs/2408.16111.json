For low ac amplitudes, at all fillings we find\nreversible motion where the skyrmions return to their original positions at the\nend of each ac drive cycle and the diffusion is zero. We also identify two\ndistinct irreversible regimes. The first is a translating regime in which the\nskyrmions form channels of flow in opposing directions and translate by one\nsubstrate lattice constant per ac drive cycle. The translating state appears in\nthe dimer and trimer states, and produces pronounced peaks in the diffusivity\nin the direction perpendicular to the external drive. For larger ac amplitudes,\nwe find chaotic irreversible motion in which the skyrmions can randomly\nexchange places with each other over time, producing long-time diffusive\nbehavior both parallel and perpendicular to the ac driving direction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
