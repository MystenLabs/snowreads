Network pharmacology\nlays the theoretical groundwork for identifying new drug indications, and deep\ngraph models have become essential for their precision in mapping complex\nbiological networks. Our study introduces an advanced graph model that utilizes\ngraph convolutional networks and tensor decomposition to effectively predict\nsigned chemical-gene interactions. This model demonstrates superior predictive\nperformance, especially in handling the polar relations in biological networks.\nOur research opens new avenues for drug discovery and repurposing, especially\nin understanding the mechanism of actions of drugs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
