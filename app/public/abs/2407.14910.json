Our approach integrates three primary\nmethods: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for place recognition,\ntraditional image processing for identifying road junction types, and deep\nlearning using the VGG16 model for classifying road junctions. The most\neffective techniques have been integrated into an offline mobile application,\nenhancing accessibility for users requiring reliable location information in\nGPS-denied environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
