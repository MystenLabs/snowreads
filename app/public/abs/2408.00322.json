We explore the roles of the SO coupling strength and helicity pitch\nin the creation of these anomalously tall PSs and find that their amplitude,\nnormalized to the background height, attains indefinitely large values. The\ninvestigation of the modulation instability (MI) in the same system\ndemonstrates that these PSs exist in a range of relatively weak MI, maintaining\nthe feasibility of their experimental observation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
