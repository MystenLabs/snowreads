To address this problem, we have\nrecently introduced covariance kernels obtained by using a Machine Learning\nbased Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) algorithm in combination with simulations\nof the 21-cm signal. In this work, we apply this framework to 141 hours\n($\\approx 10$ nights) of LOFAR data at $z \\approx 9.1$, and report revised\nupper limits of the 21-cm signal power spectrum. Overall, we agree with past\nresults reporting a 2-$\\sigma$ upper limit of $\\Delta^2_{21} < (80)^2~\\rm mK^2$\nat $k = 0.075~h~\\rm Mpc^{-1}$. Further, the VAE-based kernel has a smaller\ncorrelation with the systematic excess noise, and the overall GPR-based\napproach is shown to be a good model for the data. Assuming an accurate bias\ncorrection for the excess noise, we report a 2-$\\sigma$ upper limit of\n$\\Delta^2_{21} < (25)^2~\\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\\rm Mpc^{-1}$. However, we\nstill caution to take the more conservative approach to jointly report the\nupper limits of the excess noise and the 21-cm signal components.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
