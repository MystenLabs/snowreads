More specifically, Markov\nbinomial chains are the model that arises from stochastic time-discretizations\nof classical compartmental models. In this work we formalize this class of\nMarkov population processes and focus on the problem of computing the expected\ntime to termination in a given such model. Our theoretical contributions\ninclude proving that Markov binomial chains whose flow of individuals through\ncompartments is acyclic almost surely terminate. We give a PSPACE algorithm for\nthe problem of approximating the time to termination and a direct algorithm for\nthe exact problem in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation. Finally, we\nprovide a natural encoding of Markov binomial chains into a common input\nlanguage for probabilistic model checkers. We implemented the latter encoding\nand present some initial empirical results showcasing what formal methods can\ndo for practicing epidemilogists.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
