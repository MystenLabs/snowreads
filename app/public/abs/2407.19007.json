This method provides a way to study the matter distribution and the\nevolution of large-scale structures throughout the history of the Universe.\nHowever, modeling intensity mapping from ab-initio approaches can be\nchallenging due to significant astrophysical uncertainties and noticeable\ndegeneracies among astrophysical and cosmological parameters. To address these\nchallenges, we develop a semi-empirical, data-driven framework for galaxy\nevolution, which features a minimal set of assumptions and parameters gauged on\nobservations. By integrating this with stellar evolution and radiative transfer\nprescriptions for line emissions, we derive the cosmic [CII] intensity over an\nextended redshift range $0 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 10$. Our approach is quite\ngeneral and can be easily applied to other key lines used in intensity mapping\nstudies, such as [OIII] and the CO ladder. We then evaluate the detectability\nof the [CII] power spectra using current and forthcoming observational\nfacilities. Our findings offer critical insights into the feasibility and\npotential contributions of intensity mapping for probing the large-scale\nstructure of the Universe and understanding galaxy evolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EuXb5eUaj3emwSS5qd7B34f_pUQcKO8vm3h9huh3JbI","pdfSize":"2113882"}
