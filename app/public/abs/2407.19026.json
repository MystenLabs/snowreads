We shorten their proof, replacing the underlying book\nalgorithm with a simple inductive statement. This modification allows us\n  - to give a very short proof of an improved upper bound on the off-diagonal\nRamsey numbers, which extends to the multicolor setting, and\n  - to clarify the dependence of the bounds on underlying parameters and\noptimize these parameters, obtaining, in particular, an upper bound $$R(k,k)\n\\leq (3.8)^{k+o(k)}$$ on the diagonal Ramsey numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
