This\nstudy used historical weather station data to reconstruct ET trends over the\npast 300 years with machine learning. A Random Forest model, trained on\nFLUXNET2015 flux stations' monthly data using precipitation, temperature,\naridity index, and rooting depth as predictors, achieved an R2 of 0.66 and a\nKGE of 0.76 through 10-fold cross-validation. Applied to 5267 weather stations,\nthe model produced monthly ET data showing a general increase in global ET from\n1700 to the present, with a notable acceleration after 1900 due to warming.\nRegional differences were observed, with higher ET increases in mid-to-high\nlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and decreases in some mid-to-low latitudes\nand the Southern Hemisphere. In drylands, ET and temperature were weakly\ncorrelated, while in humid areas, the correlation was much higher. The\ncorrelation between ET and precipitation has remained stable over the\ncenturies. This study extends the ET data time span, providing valuable\ninsights into long-term historical ET trends and their drivers, aiding in\nreassessing the impact of historical climate change and human activities on the\nwater cycle and supporting future climate adaptation strategies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ce2fgZJ8vv3CTdMWC-GLiSdZR79V1Fi8vTq51PRL8M0","pdfSize":"1932702"}
