With the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence present, nontrivial surface-bulk hybridization is inevitable but\nless understood. Spectroscopies have been often limited to verifying the\nexistence of surface Fermi arcs, whereas its spectral shape related to the\nhybridization profile in energy-momentum space is not well studied. We present\nan exactly solvable formalism at the surface for a wide range of prototypical\nWeyl semimetals. The resonant surface state and the bulk influence coexist as a\nsurface-bulk hybrid and are treated in a unified manner. Directly accessible to\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we analytically reveal universal\ninformation about the system obtained from the spectroscopy of resonant\ntopological states. We systematically find inhomogeneous and anisotropic\nsingular responses around the surface-bulk merging borderline crossing Weyl\npoints, highlighting its critical role in the Weyl topology. The response in\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy is also discussed. The results will provide\nmuch-needed insight into the surface-bulk-coupled physical properties and guide\nin-depth spectroscopic investigation of the nontrivial hybrid in many\ntopological semimetal materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
