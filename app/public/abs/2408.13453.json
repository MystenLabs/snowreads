Both methods are presented within a unified\nframework with a simple consistent notation, and the differences in the two\nparadigms are explained within this common framework. We examine the different\ndefinitions of the \"population variance\" within the two paradigms and examine\nthe use of Bessel's correction for a population variance. We critique some\nmessy aspects of the presentation of the design-based paradigm and implore\nreaders to avoid the standard presentation of this framework in favour of a\nmore explicit presentation that includes explicit conditioning in probability\nstatements. We also discuss a number of confusions that arise from the standard\npresentation of the design-based paradigm and argue that Bessel's correction\nshould be applied to the population variance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
