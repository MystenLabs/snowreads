Assuming that\ndark matter consists of axions or axion-like particles with masses on the order\nof electron volts or higher, we expect an additional contribution to the CB due\nto their decay into two photons. Here, we model the CB between the optical and\nX-ray regimes, and include the contribution of decaying axions. Through a\ncomparison with the most recent direct and indirect CB measurements, we\nconstrain the axion parameter space between masses $0.5\\, \\mathrm{eV}\\, -\n10^7\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and improve previous limits on axion-photon coupling derived\nfrom the CB by roughly an order of magnitude, also reaching the QCD band. We\nfurther study the contribution of axions decaying in the Milky Way halo and\ncharacterize the axion parameters that would explain the tentative excess CB\nemission observed with the LORRI instrument on-board the New Horizons probe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
