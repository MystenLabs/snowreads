Researchers attempt to prevent malicious personalization using\nadversarial perturbations. However, previous efforts have mainly focused on the\neffectiveness of protection while neglecting the visibility of perturbations.\nThey utilize global adversarial perturbations, which introduce noticeable\nalterations to original images and significantly degrade visual quality. In\nthis work, we propose the Visual-Friendly Concept Protection (VCPro) framework,\nwhich prioritizes the protection of key concepts chosen by the image owner\nthrough adversarial perturbations with lower perceptibility. To ensure these\nperturbations are as inconspicuous as possible, we introduce a relaxed\noptimization objective to identify the least perceptible yet effective\nadversarial perturbations, solved using the Lagrangian multiplier method.\nQualitative and quantitative experiments validate that VCPro achieves a better\ntrade-off between the visibility of perturbations and protection effectiveness,\neffectively prioritizing the protection of target concepts in images with less\nperceptible perturbations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
