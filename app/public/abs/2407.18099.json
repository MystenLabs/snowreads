Thereafter, using the\ngyro measurements, some landmarks known in the inertial frame and the estimates\nfrom the LTV observer, we propose a nonlinear pose observer on $\\SO(3)\\times\n\\mathbb{R}^3$. The overall estimation system is shown to be almost globally\nasymptotically stable (AGAS) using the notion of almost global input-to-state\nstability (ISS). Interestingly, we show that with the knowledge (in the\ninertial frame) of a small number of landmarks, we can recover (under some\nconditions) the unknown positions (in the inertial frame) of a large number of\nlandmarks. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the\nperformance of the proposed estimation scheme.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
