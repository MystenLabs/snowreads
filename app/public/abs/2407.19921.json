These palettes (as well as any other sets of colors)\ncan be visualized, assessed, and manipulated in various ways, e.g., by color\nswatches, emulating the effects of color vision deficiencies, or depicting the\nperceptual properties. Finally, the color palettes generated by the package can\nbe easily integrated into standard visualization workflows in Python, e.g.,\nusing matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nvOJZOuCCmB2kbUCacsA9TiOO9BosXi7GTp9y4OuOuw","pdfSize":"1051753"}
