Unlike existing end-to-end deep learning models, our proposed method\nexplicitly models BWE using excitation and linear time-varying (LTV) filter\nstages. The excitation stage broadens the spectrum of the input, while the\nfiltering stage properly shapes it based on outputs from an acoustic feature\npredictor. To this end, an acoustic feature loss term can implicitly promote\nthe excitation subnetwork to produce white spectra in the upper frequency band\nto be synthesized. Experimental results demonstrate that the added inductive\nbias provided by our approach can improve upon BWE results using the generators\nfrom both SEANet or HiFi-GAN as exciters, and that our means of adapting\nprocessing with acoustic feature predictions is more effective than that used\nin HiFi-GAN-2. Secondary contributions include extensions of the SEANet model\nto accommodate local conditioning information, as well as the application of\nHiFi-GAN-2 for the BWE problem.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
