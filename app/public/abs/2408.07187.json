For field applications, these systems must be robust\nand compact, driving the need for miniaturized and highly stable optical setups\nand system integration. In this work, we present a micro-integrated\ncrossed-beam optical dipole trap setup, the $\\mu$XODT, designed for trapping\nand cooling $^{87}\\text{Rb}$. This fiber-coupled setup operates at\n$1064\\,\\text{nm}$ wavelength with up to $2.5\\,\\text{W}$ optical power and\nrealizes a free-space crossed beam geometry. The $\\mu$XODT precisely overlaps\ntwo focused beams ($w_0 \\approx 33\\,\\mu\\text{m}$) at their waists in a\n$45^\\circ$ crossing angle, achieving a position difference $\\leq\n3.4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and 0.998 power ratio between both beams with long-term\nstability. We describe the design and assembly process in detail, along with\noptical and thermal tests with temperatures of up to $65\\,^\\circ C$. The\nsystem's volume of $25\\,\\text{ml}$ represents a reduction of more than two\norders of magnitude compared to typically used macroscopic setups, while\ndemonstrating exceptional mechanical robustness and thermal stability. The\n$\\mu$XODT is integrated with a $^{87}\\text{Rb}$ 3D MOT setup, trapping $3\n\\times 10^5$ atoms from a laser-cooled atomic cloud, and has shown no signs of\ndegradation after two years of operation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
