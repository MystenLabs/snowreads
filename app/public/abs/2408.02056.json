This study explores the\napplicability of synthetic data in real-world medical settings. We introduce\nMedSyn, a novel medical text generation framework that integrates large\nlanguage models with a Medical Knowledge Graph (MKG). We use MKG to sample\nprior medical information for the prompt and generate synthetic clinical notes\nwith GPT-4 and fine-tuned LLaMA models. We assess the benefit of synthetic data\nthrough application in the ICD code prediction task. Our research indicates\nthat synthetic data can increase the classification accuracy of vital and\nchallenging codes by up to 17.8% compared to settings without synthetic data.\nFurthermore, to provide new data for further research in the healthcare domain,\nwe present the largest open-source synthetic dataset of clinical notes for the\nRussian language, comprising over 41k samples covering 219 ICD-10 codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TC1W259hsTCJbBhBYJIsEzCHSKy9j7RboinSPdNaqaw","pdfSize":"1118079"}
