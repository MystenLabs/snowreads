For\nexample, washing dishes is a dexterous operation that involves scrubbing the\ndishes with a sponge and rinsing them with water. It is necessary to learn it\nsafely without splashing water and without dropping the dishes. In this study,\nwe propose a safe and dexterous manipulation system. The robot learns a\ndynamics model of the object by estimating the state of the object and the\nrobot itself, the control input, and the amount of human assistance required\n(assistance rate) after the human corrects the initial trajectory of the\nrobot's hands by interruptive direct teaching. By backpropagating the error\nbetween the estimated and the reference value using the acquired dynamics\nmodel, the robot can generate a control input that approaches the reference\nvalue, for example, so that human assistance is not required and the dish does\nnot move excessively. This allows for adaptive rinsing and scrubbing of dishes\nwith unknown shapes and properties. As a result, it is possible to generate\nsafe actions that require less human assistance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
