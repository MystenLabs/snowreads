To achieve high network throughput while ensuring\nfairness across all links, we formulate a resilient power optimization problem\nwith per-user minimum-rate constraints. We obtain the corresponding Lagrangian\ndual problem and parameterize all variables with neural networks, which can be\ntrained in an unsupervised manner due to the provably acceptable duality gap.\nWe develop a meta-learning approach with graph neural networks (GNNs) as\nparameterization that exhibits fast adaptation and scalability to varying\nnetwork configurations. We formulate the objective of meta-learning by\namalgamating the Lagrangian functions of different network configurations and\nutilize a first-order meta-learning algorithm, called Reptile, to obtain the\nmeta-parameters. Numerical results verify that our method can efficiently\nimprove the overall throughput and ensure the minimum rate performance. We\nfurther demonstrate that using the meta-parameters as initialization, our\nmethod can achieve fast adaptation to new wireless network configurations and\nreduce the number of required training data samples.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
