The robots map their desired velocities into a corresponding\ndesired change in the formation parameters and apply a consensus step to reach\nagreement on the desired formation and a constraint satisfaction step to ensure\ncollision avoidance within the formation. The constraint set is found such that\nthe probability of collision remains below an upper bound. The method was\ndemonstrated in a manual teleoperation scenario both in simulation and a\nreal-world experiment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
