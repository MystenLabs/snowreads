FORGE\ncombines a force threshold mechanism with a dynamics randomization scheme\nduring policy learning in simulation, to enable the robust transfer of the\nlearned policies to the real robot. At deployment, FORGE policies, conditioned\non a maximum allowable force, adaptively perform contact-rich tasks while\nrespecting the specified force threshold, regardless of the controller gains.\nAdditionally, FORGE autonomously predicts a termination action once the task\nhas succeeded. We demonstrate that FORGE can be used to learn a variety of\nrobust contact-rich policies, enabling multi-stage assembly of a planetary gear\nsystem, which requires success across three assembly tasks: nut-threading,\ninsertion, and gear meshing.
