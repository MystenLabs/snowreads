We modify the HiDDeN deep-learning watermarking\narchitecture to embed and extract high-dimensional real vectors representing\nimage captions. Our method improves significantly robustness on both malign and\nbenign edits. We also introduce a local confidence metric correlated with\nMessage Recovery Rate, enhancing the method's practical applicability. This\napproach bridges the gap between traditional watermarking and passive forensic\nmethods, offering a robust solution for image integrity verification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
