Here we report\nthe creation of self-organized, re-writable, laser-induced surface structures\nin single-crystalline vanadium dioxide. We discover anisotropic features caused\nby canalized surface plasmon polaritons that can only propagate along one\ncrystal axis. The nanostructures remain single-crystalline and preserve the raw\nmaterial's metal-to-insulator transition, enabling femtosecond switching by\ntemperature or light.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"KEg5DfN49YYKCWi3bJlvfduZGjWWpi-tbhV7calFIYA","pdfSize":"1704385"}
