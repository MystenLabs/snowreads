However, data\navailability and privacy concerns pose significant challenges. Traditional\nmethods like data encryption and anonymization, while essential, may not fully\naddress these issues. For instance, in sparsely populated areas, anonymized\ndata can still be traced back to individual users. Additionally, the volume of\ndata generated by users can reveal their identities. To develop credible\ncrowd-sensing systems, data must be anonymized, aggregated and separated into\nuniformly sized chunks. Furthermore, decentralizing the data management\nprocess, rather than relying on a single server, can enhance security and\ntrust. This paper proposes a system utilizing smart contracts and blockchain\ntechnologies to manage crowd-sensing campaigns. The smart contract handles user\nsubscriptions, data encryption, and decentralized storage, creating a secure\ndata marketplace. Incentive policies within the smart contract encourage user\nparticipation and data diversity. Simulation results confirm the system's\nviability, highlighting the importance of user participation for data\ncredibility and the impact of geographical data scarcity on rewards. This\napproach aims to balance data origin and reduce cheating risks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6z9N8ZLKJrUp6gMqTCMniHg1MjnCa3nIfpGOtIRGdkg","pdfSize":"384462"}
