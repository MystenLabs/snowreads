However, traditional\nHAR approaches face challenges including data scarcity, difficulties in model\ngeneralization, and the complexity of recognizing activities in multi-person\nscenarios. This paper proposes a system framework called LAHAR, based on large\nlanguage models. Utilizing prompt engineering techniques, LAHAR addresses HAR\nin multi-person scenarios by enabling subject separation and action-level\ndescriptions of events occurring in the environment. We validated our approach\non the ARAS dataset, and the results demonstrate that LAHAR achieves comparable\naccuracy to the state-of-the-art method at higher resolutions and maintains\nrobustness in multi-person scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
