Some of their states are broadcasting, i.e., dispatched to all\nother automata. At each step of the computation, each automaton changes state\nand moves right, left or stay in place according to the current state and the\npossible messages dispatched. The input is recognized if the following occurs:\nstarting from the initial configuration (the heads of all automata are\npositioned to the left end of the tape) one automaton reaches a final state\nwhen its head is positioned to the right end of the tape. We show that if the\nnumber of messages sent during the computation is bounded by some integer which\nis independent of the length of the input, then the language recognized is\nregular,\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
