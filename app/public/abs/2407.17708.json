Unlike the\nstandard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require the\nGinsparg-Wilson relation or the modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We\nprove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the\ncorresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of\nthe $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated\nby the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\\eta$ invariant at finite masses,\nare proved to be equal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4vmtsZVWSPbsugQ4cMlwHtWDaEOY7ecss4wnqUZ_AxQ","pdfSize":"1191756","objectId":"0x226f5afc032a36d215f23cb5bfbceac81be39d65817893c2a44d924622bd4ebc","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
