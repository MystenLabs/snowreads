In the present paper, we are concerned mainly with group\n$G=G_{39}$ of order 27 in a list of Tahara's paper, with $M(G)={\\mathbb\nZ}_3\\times {\\mathbb Z}_3$. In this case, to arrive up to the Sky, we have two\nsteps of one-step efficient central extensions. By the 1st step, we obtain a\ncovering group of order 81, and by the 2nd step we arrive to $R(G)$ of order\n243. At the 1st step, to construct explicitly a complete set of representatives\nof IRs of the group, we apply Mackey's induced representations, and at the 2nd\nstep, with a help of this result, we apply so-called classical method for\nsemidirect product groups given by Hirai and arrive to a complete list of IRs\nof $R(G)$. Then, using explicit realization of these IRs, we can compute their\ncharacters (called spin characters).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
