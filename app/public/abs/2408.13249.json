Insulating layered\nmaterials with inert and atomically flat surfaces are ideal for high\nperformance transistors and this has been exemplified with commonly used boron\nnitride. While the list of insulating 2D materials is limited, the\nearth-abundant phyllosilicates are particularly attractive candidates. Here, we\ninvestigate the properties of atomically thin biotite and muscovite, the most\ncommon and commercially important micas from the rock-forming minerals. From a\ngroup of five natural bulk samples, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is\nused to classify exfoliated flakes into three types of biotite, including the\nphlogopite endmember, and two muscovites. We provide a catalog of RGB contrast\nvalues for exfoliated flakes ranging from bilayer to approximately 175 nm.\nAdditionally, we report the complex index of refraction for all investigated\nmaterials based on micro-reflectance measurements. Our findings suggest that\nearth-abundant phyllosilicates could serve as scalable insulators for logic\ndevices employing 2D materials, potentially overcoming current limitations in\nthe field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
