We\ndetermine the complete phase diagram as a function of packing fraction and\naspect ratio, which consists of four distinct phases. At very high packing\nfractions, particles form a smectic solid for all aspect ratios. Rod-like\nparticles with large aspect ratio assemble in an intervening nematic phase,\nwhich is displaced by a \"tetratic\" phase (also called biaxial nematic) for\nmoderately elongated rectangles. Surprisingly, we find evidence that the\ntransition from tetratic to smectic is weakly discontinuous at variance with\npreviously proposed two-step scenarios for the melting of hard particles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
