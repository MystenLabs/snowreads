In some cases, for example when all the hypersurfaces are\nnon-linear and all the intersections are transverse, this improves an\ninequality of Quang, whose inequality is sharp for the case of hyperplanes in\nsubgeneral position.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
