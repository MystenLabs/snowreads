We develop a new invariant of a real isolated zero of a\nnonnegative polynomial in the plane, that we call \\emph{the SOS-invariant}, and\nrelate it to the well-known delta invariant of a plane curve singularity. Using\nthe SOS-invariant we show that any polynomial that spans an extreme ray of the\nconvex cone of nonnegative ternary forms of degree 6 is stubborn. We also show\nhow to use the SOS-invariant to prove stubbornness of ternary forms in higher\ndegree. Furthermore, we prove that in a given degree and number of variables,\nnonnegative polynomials that are not stubborn form a convex cone, whose\ninterior consists of all strictly positive polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
