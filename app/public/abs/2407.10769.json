Single-processor monolithic quantum computers are\naffected by increased cross talk and difficulty of implementing gates when the\nnumber of qubits is increased. In a QDC, multiple quantum processing units\n(QPUs) are linked together over short distances, allowing the total number of\ncomputational qubits to be increased without increasing the number of qubits on\nany one processor. In doing so, the error incurred by operations at each QPU\ncan be kept small, however additional noise will be added to the system due to\nthe latency cost and errors incurred during inter-QPU entanglement\ndistribution. We investigate the relative impact of these different types of\nnoise using a classically simulated QDC with two QPUs and compare the\nrobustness to noise of the two main ways of implementing remote gates, cat-comm\nand TP-comm. We find that considering the quantity of gates or inter-QPU\nentangled links is often inadequate to predict the output fidelity from a\nquantum circuit and infer that an improved understanding of error propagation\nduring distributed quantum circuits may represent a significant optimisation\nopportunity for compilation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
