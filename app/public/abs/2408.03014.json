The task aims to detect abnormal events in test video using unlabeled\nvideos as training data. The presence of anomalies in the training data poses a\nsignificant challenge in this task, particularly because they form clusters in\nthe feature space. We refer to this property as the \"Anomaly Cluster\" issue.\nThe condensed nature of these anomalies makes it difficult to distinguish\nbetween normal and abnormal data in the training set. Consequently, training\nconventional anomaly detection techniques using an unlabeled dataset often\nleads to sub-optimal results. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a new\nmethod called Cleansed k-Nearest Neighbor (CKNN), which explicitly filters out\nthe Anomaly Clusters by cleansing the training dataset. Following the k-nearest\nneighbor algorithm in the feature space provides powerful anomaly detection\ncapability. Although the identified Anomaly Cluster issue presents a\nsignificant challenge to applying k-nearest neighbor in UVAD, our proposed\ncleansing scheme effectively addresses this problem. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate that CKNN outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art UVAD method by up to 8.5% (from 82.0 to 89.0) in\nterms of AUROC. Moreover, we emphasize that the performance of the proposed\nmethod is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art method trained using\nanomaly-free data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
