While it is essential for\npersonalized pricing to predict the purchase probabilities for each consumer,\nthese predicted values are inherently subject to unavoidable errors that can\nnegatively impact the realized revenues and profits. To address this issue, we\nfocus on robust optimization techniques that yield reliable solutions to\noptimization problems under uncertainty. Specifically, we propose a robust\noptimization model for personalized pricing that accounts for the uncertainty\nof predicted purchase probabilities. This model can be formulated as a\nmixed-integer linear optimization problem, which can be solved exactly using\nmathematical optimization solvers. We also develop a Lagrangian decomposition\nalgorithm combined with line search to efficiently find high-quality solutions\nfor large-scale optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our robust optimization model and highlight the utility of our\nLagrangian decomposition algorithm in terms of both computational efficiency\nand solution quality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
