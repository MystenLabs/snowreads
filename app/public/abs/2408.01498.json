In our study, we\ndevelop a nonperturbative analysis of the replica two-dimensional nonlinear\nsigma model in class C. We explicitly construct the instanton solution with a\nunit topological charge. By treating fluctuations around the instanton at a\nGaussian level, we calculate the instanton correction to the free energy. We\ncompute non-perturbative corrections to the anomalous dimensions of pure\npower-law scaling local operators, which determine the spectrum of generalized\nmultifractality. We also calculate instanton corrections to the renormalized\nlongitudinal and Hall spin conductivities and determine the topology of the\nphase diagram for class C. Our results demonstrate that the spin quantum Hall\neffect is indeed a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
