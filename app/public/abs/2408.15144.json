This provides a limitation on reasonable tightenings of a question\nof Alon from 2023 and of a conjecture of Gowers from 2009, and investigates a\ndirection analogous to that of recent works of Conlon, Kam\\v{c}ev, Leader,\nR\\\"aty and Spiegel on intervals in the Hales-Jewett theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
