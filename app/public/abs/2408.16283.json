Mechanisms involving tidal resonances,\nelectrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed\nas instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and\nmultimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are\nreviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain\nthe neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and\nevolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray\nbursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment,\ncrustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
