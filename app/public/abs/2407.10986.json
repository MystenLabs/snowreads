In particular, integrating passive intelligent surface\n(IS) into the base station (BS) is a novel solution to enhance the wireless\nnetwork throughput and coverage both cost-effectively and energyefficiently. In\nthis article, we provide an overview of IS-integrated BSs for wireless\nnetworks, including their motivations, practical architectures, and main design\nissues. Moreover, numerical results are presented to compare the performance of\ndifferent IS-integrated BS architectures as well as the conventional BS without\nIS. Finally, promising directions are pointed out to stimulate future research\non IS-BS/terminal integration in wireless networks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
