It turns out that degenerate\nchiral zero-modes non-trivially transform under the non-invertible symmetries\nin the context of quantum mechanics. Hence, non-invertible symmetries\ncorrespond to flavor symmetries of chiral zero modes and determine their flavor\nstructure. We explicitly show the representations and selection rules of chiral\nzero modes on their wave functions. These zero modes may correspond to\ngenerations of quarks and leptons in four-dimensional low-energy effective\nfield theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W2IJN49d5-Vrf2TDwHIYuYF151lhwgtcYNQ_oPfKCXs","pdfSize":"819862"}
