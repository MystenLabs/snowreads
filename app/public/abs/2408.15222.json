In particular, we discuss the impact of artificial satellites on\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the High Energy Stereoscopic System\n(H.E.S.S.), an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope, as well as possible\nmitigation strategies for the European Southern Observatory 4-metre\nMulti-Object Spectrograph Telescope (ESO 4MOST). Furthermore, we shed light on\nhow ground-based optical telescopes such as the Oukaimeden Observatory\ncontribute to IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from\nSatellite Constellation Interference (IAU CPS) efforts that quantify satellite\nbrightness.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
