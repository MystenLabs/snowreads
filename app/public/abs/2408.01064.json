These two properties are\nrealized as manifestations of a more general phenomenon of \"self-synchronous\nintertwinement\". It is shown that this concept is a logically stronger form of\nasymptotic enslavement, as characterized by the existence of finitely many\ndetermining modes in the 2D NSE. In particular, this stronger form is shown to\nimply convergence of the synchronization filter and the nudging filter from\ncontinuous data assimilation (CDA), and then subsequently invoked to show that\nconvergence in these filters implies that the 2D NSE possesses finitely many\ndetermining modes. The main achievement of this article is to therefore\nidentify a new concept, that of self-synchronous intertwinement, through which\na rigorous relationship between the determining modes property and\nsynchronization in these CDA filters is established and made decisively clear.\nThe theoretical results are then complemented by numerical experiments that\nconfirm the conclusions of the theorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
