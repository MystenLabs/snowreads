The novelty of our results is\nthat they are the first allowing for equilibrium prices driven by general\nsemimartingales and hold in discrete as well as continuous time. For agents\nwith quadratic utility functions, we provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the existence and uniqueness of equilibria. We complement our\nanalysis by providing explicit examples showing non-uniqueness or non-existence\nof equilibria. We then study the more difficult case of linear mean-variance\npreferences. We first show that under mild assumptions, a linear mean-variance\nequilibrium corresponds to a quadratic equilibrium (for different preference\nparameters). We then use this link to study a fixed-point problem that\nestablishes existence (and uniqueness in a suitable class) of linear\nmean-variance equilibria. Our results rely on fine properties of dynamic\nmean-variance hedging in general semimartingale markets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EeP78XPXsl8GL1viCsy-Op5FrSl5V_1oBvJYj8ngD7I","pdfSize":"442736"}
