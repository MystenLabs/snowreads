The revealed BICs appear due to the strong spatial dispersion making\npossible the propagation of longitudinal plasma-like waves and TEM polarized\nmodes with a flat band. The symmetry-protected (at-$\\Gamma$) BICs are formed\ndue to the polarization mismatch between the longitudinal plasma-like waves and\ntransversal plane waves in the surrounding space, while the accidental\n(off-$\\Gamma$) BICs appear as a result of the Friedrich-Wintgen destructive\ninterference between them. All revealed BICs can be well-described analytically\nwithout the use of the Bloch theorem within effective medium approximation when\nthe wire medium behaves as homogeneous 1D anisotropic plasma with strong\nspatial dispersion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
