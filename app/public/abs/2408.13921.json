In the present paper, we show that every\n$\\mathrm{SL}(d,\\mathbb{R})$ cocycle over a shift of finite type either admits a\ndominated splitting or is $\\mathcal{C}^0$-approximated by a cocycle that\n$\\mathcal{C}^\\alpha$-stably exhibits bounded orbits ($\\alpha>0$). The proof is\nbased on a new mechanism which yields stable elliptic-type behavior in\narbitrary dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"XbxAxpRfrje1faDKMw-xzTPFwuPbxPifTGz4QLZTwHw","pdfSize":"1062423"}
