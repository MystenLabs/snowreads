In this way, we prove a theorem\nthat provides a necessary and sufficient condition for delta sequences of trees\nto be comparable in the majorization order. Although our investigation is\nlargely theoretical, our study contributes to a better knowledge of trees as an\nimportant data structure. We point out that this study is among the few\ncombining Lorenz curves and majorization on the one hand, and degree sequences\nof networks on the other.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
