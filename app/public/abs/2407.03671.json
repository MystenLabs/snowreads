However, autonomous\nvehicles engaging in depth coordination between vehicle and road in merging\nzones, by pre-planning and uploading travel trajectories, can significantly\nenhance the safety and efficiency of merging zones.In this paper,we mainly\nintroduce mainline priority cooperation method to achieve the time and space\ncooperative control of highway merge.Vehicle-mounted intelligent units share\nreal-time vehicle status and driving intentions with Road Section Management\nUnits, which pre-plan the spatiotemporal trajectories of vehicle travel. After\nreceiving these trajectories, Vehicle Intelligent Units strictly adhere to\nthem. Through this deep collaboration between vehicles and roads, conflicts in\ntime and space during vehicle travel are eliminated in advance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
