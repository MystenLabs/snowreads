The first methods were based on pixel-wise skin color modeling\nand they were later enhanced with context-based analysis to include the\ntextural and geometrical features, recently extracted using deep convolutional\nneural networks. It has been also demonstrated that skin regions can be\nsegmented from grayscale images without using color information at all.\nHowever, the possibility to combine these two sources of information has not\nbeen explored so far and we address this research gap with the contribution\nreported in this paper. We propose to train a convolutional network using the\ndatasets focused on different features to create an ensemble whose individual\noutcomes are effectively combined using yet another convolutional network\ntrained to produce the final segmentation map. The experimental results clearly\nindicate that the proposed approach outperforms the basic classifiers, as well\nas an ensemble based on the voting scheme. We expect that this study will help\nin developing new ensemble-based techniques that will improve the performance\nof semantic segmentation systems, reaching beyond the problem of detecting\nhuman skin.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
