In this paper we\nstudy such a system derived from Eulerian droplet model for air particle flow.\nThis is a 2 x 2 non - strictly hyperbolic system of conservation laws with\nlinear damping. We first study a regularized viscous system with variable\nviscosity term and obtain a weak asymptotic solution with general initial data\nand also get solution in the Colombeau algebra. We also study the vanishing\nviscosity limit and show that this limit is a distribution solution. Further we\nstudy the large time asymptotic behaviour of the viscous system. This important\nsystem, is not very well studied due to complexities in the analysis. As far as\nwe know the only work done on this system is for Riemann type of initial data.\nThe significance of this paper is that we work on the system having general\ninitial data and not just initial data of the Riemann type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cgDZb0-q3rW9a5ACPNIem6nXQshh_SnclMGCogRRg2U","pdfSize":"254378"}
