Single shot beam measurements only exist for\ncertain 2D beam projections and these methods are destructive. A virtual\ndiagnostic that can generate an accurate prediction of a beam's 6D phase space\nwould be incredibly useful for precisely controlling the beam. In this work, a\ngenerative conditional diffusion-based approach to creating a virtual\ndiagnostic of all 15 unique 2D projections of a beam's 6D phase space is\ndeveloped. The diffusion process is guided by a combination of scalar\nparameters and images that are converted to low-dimensional latent vector\nrepresentation by a variational autoencoder (VAE). We demonstrate that\nconditional diffusion guided by VAE (cDVAE) can accurately reconstruct all 15\nof the unique 2D projections of a charge particle beam's 6 phase space for the\nHiRES compact accelerator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
