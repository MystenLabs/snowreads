It is implemented upon reflection of the beam from a\nlayered structure by simultaneously utilizing the effect of optical resonance\nand the spin Hall effect of light. As an example of a layered structure\nperforming this operation, we propose a three-layer metal-dielectric-metal\n(MDM) structure. We show that by choosing the parameters of the MDM structure,\nit is possible to achieve the so-called isotropic vectorial differentiation,\nfor which the intensity of the reflected optical beam (squared electric field\nmagnitude) is proportional to the squared absolute value of the gradient of the\nincident linearly polarized beam. The presented numerical simulation results\ndemonstrate high-quality vectorial differentiation and confirm the developed\ntheoretical description.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
