One\nproposed solution is the `thermal time hypothesis,' which defines time in terms\nof states representing systems in thermal equilibrium. On this view, time is\nsupposed to emerge thermodynamically even in a fundamentally timeless context.\nHere, I develop the worry that the thermal time hypothesis requires dynamics --\nand hence time -- to get off the ground, thereby running into worries of\ncircularity.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6DFy2GebSym6Wqn48iegzJRVPKhgVxcp_3wL1ctvxUk","pdfSize":"919894"}
