TGL-Lambda delivers a\nflexible approach to simultaneously estimating the {\\lambda} value for multiple\ntrap types, accommodating a common situation in ``Mark-release-recapture''\n(MRR) experiments in the field. Specifically, where researchers release a known\nnumber of marked insects in a field and count how many are recaptured in two to\nfive trap and lure types, and the trap and release locations are known,\nTGL-Lambda can be used to estimate the attractiveness ({\\lambda}) of each of\nthe trap types.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
