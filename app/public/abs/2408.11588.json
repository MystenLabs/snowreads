Utilizing high-energy probes at\nthe LHC, we probe these couplings in the context of single top quark production\nassociated with a W-boson and an ALP. We analyze the latest LHC Run II data on\n$t\\bar{t}$ spin correlation measurements to establish constraints on these\ncouplings. Additionally, we compare these constraints with those derived from\nloop-induced couplings and indirect searches involving B-meson decays.\nFurthermore, we derive two-dimensional limits on the ALP couplings with top\nquarks and gluons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dBVe1mEEKU9HdnkP2Q8-bpTKieUlVQhXl86NWNM9FJg","pdfSize":"628540"}
