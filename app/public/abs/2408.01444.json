The issues and challenges involved in the\nsuccessful utilization of LLMs can vary significantly depending on the size of\nthe organization. It is important to study and discuss these pertinent issues\nof LLM adaptation with a focus on the scale of the industrial concerns and\nbrainstorm possible solutions and prospective directions. Such a study has not\nbeen prominently featured in the current research literature. In this study, we\nadopt a threefold strategy: first, we conduct a case study with industry\npractitioners to formulate the key research questions; second, we examine\nexisting industrial publications to address these questions; and finally, we\nprovide a practical guide for industries to utilize LLMs more efficiently.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dTsWbcDtiJ0pHhv5Hsp_lzG3lavb7kT-kFK6qpUoSaE","pdfSize":"522764","txDigest":"9KwRFRkCiypA7HvYUNeHx9nKX4yXKcqV2ajwW99TDA2V","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
