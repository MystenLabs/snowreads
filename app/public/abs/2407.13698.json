Acknowledging the limitations\nof traditional models like the Gravity Model of Trade, this study introduces a\ntwo-stage approach combining explainable machine learning and factorization\nmodels. The first stage employs SHAP Explainer for effective variable\nselection, identifying key provisions in PTAs, while the second stage utilizes\nFactorization Machine models to analyze the pairwise interaction effects of\nthese provisions on trade flows. By analyzing comprehensive datasets, the paper\ndemonstrates the efficacy of this approach. The findings not only enhance the\npredictive accuracy of trade flow models but also offer deeper insights into\nthe complex dynamics of international trade, influenced by specific bilateral\ntrade provisions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
