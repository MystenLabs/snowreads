However, its practical\napplication in real-world traffic scenarios remains limited. Conversely, the\ntraffic flow dynamics at adaptive signalized intersections still need to be\nfully understood. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the queue length\ntime series from an adaptive signalized corridor and characterizing its\nself-similarity. The findings uncover a $1/f$ structure in the power spectrum\nof queue lengths, indicative of self-similarity. Furthermore, the paper\nestimates local scaling exponents $(\\alpha)$, a measure of self-similarity\ncomputed via detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and identifies a positive\ncorrelation with congestion patterns. Additionally, the study examines the\nfractal dynamics of queue length through the evolution of scaling exponent. As\na result, the paper offers new insights into the queue length dynamics of\nsignalized intersections, which might help better understand the impact of\nadaptivity within the system.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8yiajgh5GG3d0KKCzljb1RTnHq6nDFsOJ9CtlWDsWfI","pdfSize":"2535591","txDigest":"H9aAstJi6UxZ97JZYLwZd25MBTRPuSekWQgEqtqSkGz","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
