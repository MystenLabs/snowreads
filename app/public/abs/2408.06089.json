In this article, we focus on constructing rotations within the\nlight-front quantized collective field theory for the full set of spatial\ncoordinates in the dual bulk AdS spacetime. Two intricate aspects require\nattention: how rotations involving the emergent holographic coordinate are\nimplemented, and how rotations that involve the spatial coordinates\nparticipating in the construction of the light-cone coordinates $X^{\\pm}$ are\nrealized. Our construction is in agreement with Metsaev's construction directly\nin the gravity theory. Additionally, we derive the eigenfunctions of the AdS\nmass operator, which dictate the GKPW rule for the emergent higher-dimensional\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
