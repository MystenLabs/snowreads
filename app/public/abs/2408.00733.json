These types of games\nare necessarily potential, and the Nash equilibria obtained as the minimizers\nof the control problems are naturally related to the McKean-Vlasov equations of\nLangevin type. We provide several examples to motivate the general theory\nincluding the Cucker-Smale Flocking and Kuramoto mean-field games. The\ninvariance property of the value function of these control problems, utilized\nin our proof, is also proved.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
