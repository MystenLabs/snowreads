We propose a two-phase\nchannel estimation scheme with fractional power control-aided pilot assignment\nto improve the estimation accuracy and system performance of RIS-aided\ncell-free massive MIMO systems. Additionally, we derive the closed-form\nexpressions of the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) with conjugate beamforming\nto evaluate the impact of EMI among RIS elements on the system performance.\nNumerical results validate that the proposed two-phase scheme can compensate\nfor the performance degradation caused by EMI in terms of estimation accuracy\nand downlink SE. Moreover, the benefits of introducing RISs and increasing\naccess points (APs) are illustrated.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
