Process-based models simulate the\nphysical mechanisms of watershed hydrological processes, while data-driven\nmodels leverage large datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms. This\npaper reviewed and compared methods for assessing and enhancing the\nextrapolability of both model types, discussing their prospects and\nlimitations. Key strategies include the use of leave-one-out cross-validation\nand similarity-based methods to evaluate model performance in ungauged regions.\nDeep learning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation techniques are also\npromising in their potential to improve model predictions in data-sparse and\nextreme conditions. Interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous algorithmic\nadvancements are also important to strengthen the global applicability and\nreliability of hydrological models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KFwjUVa1jNcQ_cX4APEBwgLt1Bc2iA-5TYkSaAan9zg","pdfSize":"1493951"}
