However, this combination with their associated\ncosts and infrastructure demands, poses challenges for widespread adoption in\nmass-market applications. In this paper, we aim to use only a monocular camera\nto achieve comparable onboard localization performance by tracking\ndeep-learning visual features on a LiDAR-enhanced visual prior map. Experiments\nshow that the proposed algorithm can provide centimeter-level global\npositioning results with scale, which is effortlessly integrated and favorable\nfor low-cost robot system deployment in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
