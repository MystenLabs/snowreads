Crucially, the performance of\nsuch strategies is sensitive to various algorithm design choices. In this work,\nwe develop a framework for implementing model predictive controls on\nresidential water heaters for load shifting applications. We use this framework\nto analyze how four different design factors affect control performance and\nthermal comfort: (i) control model fidelity, (ii) temperature sensor\nconfiguration, (iii) water draw estimation methodology, and (iv) water draw\nforecasting methodology. We propose new methods for estimating water draw\npatterns without the use of a flow meter. MPC strategies are compared under two\ndifferent time-varying price signals through simulations using a high-fidelity\ntank model and real-world draw data. Results show that control model fidelity\nand the number of temperature sensors have the largest impact on electricity\ncosts, while the water draw forecasting methodology has a significant impact on\nthermal comfort and the frequency of runout events. Results provide practical\ninsight into effective MPC design for water heaters in home energy management\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
