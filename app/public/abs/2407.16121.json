However,\nas the number of antennas increases, ELAA systems face significant bottlenecks,\nsuch as excessive interconnection costs and high computational complexity.\nEfficient distributed signal processing (SP) algorithms show great promise in\novercoming these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview\nof distributed SP algorithms for ELAA systems, tailored to address these\nbottlenecks. We start by presenting three representative forms of ELAA systems:\nsingle-base station ELAA systems, coordinated distributed antenna systems, and\nELAA systems integrated with emerging technologies. For each form, we review\nthe associated distributed SP algorithms in the literature. Additionally, we\noutline several important future research directions that are essential for\nimproving the performance and practicality of ELAA systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
