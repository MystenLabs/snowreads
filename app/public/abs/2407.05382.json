This is because determining the optimal threshold on\nnon-separable outlier score functions is an ill-posed problem. However, the\nlack of predicted labels not only hiders some real applications of current\noutlier detectors but also causes these methods not to be enhanced by\nleveraging the dataset's self-supervision. To advance existing scoring methods,\nwe propose a multiple thresholding (Multi-T) module. It generates two\nthresholds that isolate inliers and outliers from the unlabelled target\ndataset, whereas outliers are employed to obtain better feature representation\nwhile inliers provide an uncontaminated manifold. Extensive experiments verify\nthat Multi-T can significantly improve proposed outlier scoring methods.\nMoreover, Multi-T contributes to a naive distance-based method being\nstate-of-the-art.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
