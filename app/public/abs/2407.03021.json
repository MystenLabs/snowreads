As\nresilient systems they should maintain a constantly high operational\nperformance whatever happens. We explore different levels and time scales of\ndecision making in energy systems, highlighting different uncertainty sources\nthat are relevant in different domains. We discuss how the uncertainties can be\nrepresented and how one can react to them. The article closes by summarizing,\nwhich uncertainties are already well examined and which ones still need further\nscientific inquiry to obtain resilient energy systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
