Yet, it requires continued scientific and technological\ndevelopment to realize its potential. The conditions necessary for fusion\nenergy gain in terms of the product of plasma pressure $P$ and confinement time\n$\\tau$ have been known for many decades. An underappreciated fact is that\npulsed magnetic fusion has demonstrated $P \\tau$ performance on par with\nlaser-driven ICF and tokamaks despite receiving only a small fraction of\ninvestment relative to those concepts. In light of this demonstrated\nperformance, well-established scaling relations, and opportunities for further\ninnovations, here we advocate for pulsed magnetic fusion as the most attractive\npath towards commercialization of fusion energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
