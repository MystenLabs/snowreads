Many people believe the\nflares may formed by the non-thermal particles, which can be a consequence of\nthe magnetic reconnection and shock waves. In this work, we use the larger\nmagnetic loop in the presence of pseudo-Newtonian potential which mimics\ngeneral relativistic effects. The simulation results show that the reconnection\nof magnetic field lines passes through a current sheet, which bifurcates into\ntwo pairs of slow shocks. We also find the shock waves heat the plasma,\nespecially when the plasma density is low. The shock wave heating effect by the\nmagnetic reconnection is confirmed by the simulation results, and thus the\nprocess of instantaneous brightening of the flares on the accretion disk can be\nexplained.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
