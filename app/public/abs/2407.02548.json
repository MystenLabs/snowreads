In this paper, we demonstrate speed-accuracy tradeoffs in the game of\ncricket, where 'batters' score runs on the balls bowled by the 'bowlers'. It is\nshown that the run scoring rate by a batter and the probability of dismissal\nfollow a power-law relation. Due to availability of extensive data, game of\ncricket is an excellent model for the study of the effect of speed-accuracy\ntradeoff on the overall performance of the system. It is shown that the\nexponent of the power-law governs the nature of the adaptability of the player\nin different conditions and can be used for their assessment. Further, it is\ndemonstrated that the players with extreme values of the power-law exponent are\nbetter suited for different playing conditions as compared to the ones with\nmoderate values. These findings can be utilized to identify the potential of\nthe cricket players for different game formats and can further help team\nmanagement in devising strategies for the best outcomes with a given set of\nplayers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Popular Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
