The geometrical characteristics of these states are\nexamined. We find that the velocity of quantum evolution is determined by the\nsum of the weighted degrees of the nodes in the graph, constructed by raising\nto the second power the weights in $G(V, E)$. The curvature depends on the sum\nof the weighted degrees of nodes in graphs constructed by raising the weights\nin $G(V, E)$ to the second and fourth powers. It also depends on the sum of the\nproducts of the weights of edges forming squares in graph $G(V, E)$. The\ntorsion in addition is related to the sum of the products of the weights of\nedges in graph $G(V, E)$ forming triangles $S_3$. Geometric properties of\nquantum graph states and the sum of the weighted degrees of nodes have been\ncalculated with quantum programming on IBM's quantum computer for the case of a\nspin chain.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
