Applying this procedure to\ntwo specific rings and one family of rings, we demonstrate that the resulting\nchain complex is indeed an exact chain complex and thus a free resolution.\nUtilizing this free resolution, we show that, for these rings, the injective\ndimension is infinite, as modules over itself. Finally, we propose the\nconjecture that this procedure always yields a free resolution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_x4VPAujDxhYbErmDav66kU_czxS4Ijpfq0IukUFdHE","pdfSize":"230901"}
