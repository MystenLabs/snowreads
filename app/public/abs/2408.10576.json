This work introduces the brookite\npolymorph of TiO2 as an active photocatalyst for photoreforming with an\nactivity higher than anatase and rutile polymorphs for both hydrogen production\nand plastic degradation. Commercial brookite successfully converts polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET) plastic to acetic acid under light. The high activity of\nbrookite is attributed to good charge separation, slow decay and moderate\nelectron trap energy, which lead to a higher generation of hydrogen and\nhydroxyl radicals and accordingly enhanced photo-oxidation of PET plastic.\nThese results introduce brookite as a stable and active catalyst for the\nphotoconversion of water contaminated with microplastics to value-added organic\ncompounds and hydrogen.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
