The goal is to estimate the posterior\nprobability distribution of the doping profile and to compute its posterior\nmean. This allows for the reconstruction of the doping profile from\nvoltage-current measurements. The well-posedness of the Bayesian inverse\nproblem is shown by proving boundedness and continuity properties of the\nsemiconductor model with respect to the unknown parameter. A preconditioned\nCrank-Nicolson Markov chain Monte-Carlo method for the Bayesian estimation of\nthe doping profile, using a physics-informed prior model, is proposed. The\nnumerical results for a two-dimensional diode illustrate the efficiency of the\nproposed approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
