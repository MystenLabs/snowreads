However,\nthe unique characteristics of EVs makes them more difficult to operate than\ndedicated BESSs. In this work, we apply a data-driven learning approach to\nleverage EVs as a BESS to provide capacity-related services to the grid. The\napproach uses machine learning to predict how to charge and discharge EVs while\nsatisfying their operational constraints. As a paradigm application, we use\nflexible energy commercialization in the wholesale markets, but the approach\ncan be applied to a broader range of capacity-related grid services. We\nevaluate the proposed approach numerically and show that when the number of EVs\nis large, we can obtain comparable objective values to CPLEX and approximate\ndynamic programming, but with shorter run times. These reduced run times are\nimportant because they allow us to (re)optimize frequently to adapt to the\ntime-varying system conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
