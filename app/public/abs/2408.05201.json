These integrals are relevant, for instance,\nfor the calculation of the second-order QCD corrections to the production of\ntwo heavy vector bosons in association with a jet or a photon at a hadron\ncollider. We construct pure bases for these integrals and reconstruct their\nanalytic differential equations in canonical form through numerical sampling\nover finite fields. The newly identified symbol alphabet, one of the most\ncomplex to date, provides valuable data for bootstrap methods. We then apply\nour results to initiate the study of double Lagrangian insertions in a\nfour-cusp Wilson loop in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory,\ncomputing it through two loops. We observe that it is finite, conformally\ninvariant in four dimensions, and of uniform transcendentality. Furthermore, we\nprovide numerical evidence for its positivity within the amplituhedron region\nthrough two loops.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
