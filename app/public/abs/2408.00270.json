However, because the\nestimators used in these tests are local minimizers of potentially non-convex\nfolded-concave penalized objectives, the solutions one computes in practice may\nnot coincide with the unknown local minima for which we have nice theoretical\nguarantees. To close this gap between theory and computation, we introduce\nlocal linear approximation (LLA) algorithms to compute the full and reduced\nmodel estimators for these tests and develop theory specifically for the LLA\nsolutions. We prove that our LLA algorithms converge to oracle estimators for\nthe full and reduced models in two steps with overwhelming probability. We then\nleverage this strong oracle result and the asymptotic properties of the oracle\nestimators to show that the partial penalized test statistics evaluated at the\ntwo-step LLA solutions are approximately chi-square in large samples, giving us\nguarantees for the tests using specific computed solutions and thereby closing\nthe theoretical gap. We conduct simulation studies to assess the finite-sample\nperformance of our testing procedures, finding that partial penalized tests\nusing the LLA solutions agree with tests using the oracle estimators, and\ndemonstrate our testing procedures in a real data application.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
