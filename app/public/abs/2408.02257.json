We use a corpus of problem\ndescriptions written by laypeople in English that is annotated by practising\nlawyers. Inherent subjectivity exists in our task because legal area\ncategorisation is a complex task, and lawyers often have different views on a\nproblem, especially in the face of legally-imprecise descriptions of issues.\nExperiments show that training on majority-voted spans outperforms training on\ndisaggregated ones.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
