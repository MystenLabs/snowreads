Most of the existing\nmethods assume the normal sample data clusters around a single central\nprototype while the real data may consist of multiple categories or subgroups.\nIn addition, existing methods always assume all unlabeled data are normal while\nthey inevitably contain some anomalous samples. To address these issues, we\npropose a reconstruction-based multi-normal prototypes learning framework that\nleverages limited labeled anomalies in conjunction with abundant unlabeled data\nfor anomaly detection. Specifically, we assume the normal sample data may\nsatisfy multi-modal distribution, and utilize deep embedding clustering and\ncontrastive learning to learn multiple normal prototypes to represent it.\nAdditionally, we estimate the likelihood of each unlabeled sample being normal\nbased on the multi-normal prototypes, guiding the training process to mitigate\nthe impact of contaminated anomalies in the unlabeled data. Extensive\nexperiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our\nmethod compared to state-of-the-art techniques.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
