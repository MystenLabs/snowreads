The existence of optimal control\nis proved through the Gamma convergence of the control problem of a regularized\nparticle control problem. The optimal control problem on the particle level is\nstudied by using the corresponding Liouville equation. Because of strong\naggregation effect, additional difficulties arises from control function in the\nwell-posedness theory, so that the known method for multi-dimensional\nKeller-Segel equation can not be directly applied. We use a combination of\nlocal existence result and boot-strap argument to obtain the global solution\nwith small initial data. Since we obtain a strong propagation of chaos result\nby combining the convergence in probability and relative entropy method, the\ncompact support requirement for control functions, which has been often used in\nthe literature, is not need.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
