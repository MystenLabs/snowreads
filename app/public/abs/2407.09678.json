The\nstudy of the depth-based $Q$ statistic, originally proposed by Liu and Singh\n(1993), has become increasingly popular when it can be used as a quality index\nto differentiate between two samples. Based on the existing theoretical\nfoundations, more and more variants have been developed for increasing power in\nthe two sample test. However, the asymptotic expansion of the $Q$ statistic in\nthe important foundation work of Zuo and He (2006) currently has an optimal\nrate $m^{-3/4}$ slower than the target $m^{-1}$, leading to limitations in\nhigher-order expansions for developing more powerful tests.\n  We revisit the existing assumptions and add two new plausible assumptions to\nobtain the target rate by applying a new proof method based on the Hoeffding\ndecomposition and the Cox-Reid expansion.\n  The aim of this paper is to rekindle interest in asymptotic data depth\ntheory, to place Q-statistical inference on a firmer theoretical basis, to show\nits variants in current research, to open the door to the development of new\ntheories for further variants requiring higher-order expansions, and to explore\nmore of its potential applications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
