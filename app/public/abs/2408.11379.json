Sc doped AlN (Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N) has attracted much\nattention for its enhanced piezoelectric and emerging ferroelectric properties,\nyet the commonly used sputtering results in polycrystalline Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N\nfilms with high leakage current. Here we report the pulsed laser deposition of\nsingle crystalline epitaxial Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films on sapphire and\n4H-SiC substrates. Pure wurtzite phase is maintained up to $x = 0.3$ with\nminimal oxygen contamination. Polarization is estimated to be 140 $\\mu$C/cm$^2$\nvia atomic scale microscopy imaging and found to be switchable via a scanning\nprobe. The piezoelectric coefficient is found to be 5 times of undoped one when\n$x = 0.3$, making it desirable for high frequency radiofrequency (RF) filters\nand three-dimensional nonvolatile memories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
