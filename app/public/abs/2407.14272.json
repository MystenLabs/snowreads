We define the global balance of a network\nstarting from a diffusive process that describes how the information spreads\nacross nodes in a network, providing an alternative derivation to the usual\ncombinatorial one. The steady state of this process is the solution of a linear\nsystem governed by the exponential of the replication matrix of the process. We\nprovide a bridge between the numerical stability of this linear system,\nmeasured by the condition number in an opportune norm, and the structural\npredictability of the underlying signed network. The link between the condition\nnumber and related systemic risk measures, such as the market rank indicators,\nallows the global balance index to be interpreted as a new systemic risk\nmeasure. A comprehensive empirical application to real financial data finally\nconfirms that the global balance index of the financial correlation network\nrepresents a valuable and effective systemic risk indicator.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
