We find that cTWA yields\nhighly accurate results over a wide parameter range. However, its accuracy\nhinges on a suitable choice of clusters. By using a clustering strategy\ninspired by the strong disorder renormalisation group (SDRG)/real-space\nrenormalization group (RSRG), clusters of two spins are sufficient to obtain\nessentially exact results in the regime of strong disorder. Surprisingly, even\nfor rather weak disorder, e.g.\\ in the presence of very long-range\ninteractions, this choice of clustering outperforms a naive choice of clusters\nof consecutive spins. Additionally, we develop a discrete sampling scheme for\nthe initial Wigner function, as an alternative to the originally introduced\nscheme based on Gaussian approximations. This sampling scheme puts cTWA on the\nsame conceptional footing as regular dTWA for single spins and yields some\nreduction in the Monte Carlo shot noise compared to the Gaussian scheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
