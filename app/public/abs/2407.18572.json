It allows to construct missingness indicators\nin a flexible and principled way via copulas and Bernoulli margins and to\nincorporate dependence in missingness patterns. Besides more classical\nmissingness models such as missing completely at random, missing at random, and\nmissing not at random, the approach is able to model structured missingness\nsuch as block missingness and, via mixtures, monotone missingness, which are\npatterns of missing data frequently found in real-life datasets. Properties\nsuch as joint missingness probabilities or missingness correlation are derived\nmathematically. The approach is demonstrated with mathematical examples and\nempirical illustrations in terms of a well-known dataset.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Other Statistics","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
