We present a Volterra\nseries for these nonlinear functionals, by applying nonlinear response theory\nin a path integral formalism, where the emerging kernels are shown to be\nexpressed in terms of connected equilibrium correlation functions. The first\ncumulant is the mean force, the second cumulant characterizes the\nnon-equilibrium force fluctuations (noise), and higher order cumulants quantify\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations. We discuss the interpretation of this formalism in\nrelation to Langevin dynamics. We highlight two example scenarios of this\nformalism: i) For a particle driven with prescribed trajectory, the formalism\nyields the non-equilibrium statistics of the interaction force with the fluid.\nii) For a particle confined in a moving trapping potential, the formalism\nyields the non-equilibrium statistics of the trapping force. In simulations of\na model of nonlinearly interacting Brownian particles, we find that nonlinear\nphenomena, such as shear-thinning and oscillating noise covariance, appear in\nthird or second order response, respectively.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
