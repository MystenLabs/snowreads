Some\ncross sections, such as 14N(n,p)14C, have added value for special applications,\nas these reactions may be responsible for possible contamination in industrial\nprocesses such as spent fuel reprocessing. For the validation of the evaluated\ncross sections, we can rely on the comparison of the calculated spectrum\naveraged cross sections (SACS) for the given neutron spectrum with the measured\nSACS value. The benchmark reference neutron field has been identified,\ncharacterized, and well validated in the LR-0 special core. A very large set of\nSACS measurements in the LR0 reference field is measured with low uncertainty,\nmaking it an excellent set for deconvolution codes validation. The impact of\nthe gamma-induced reaction on the production yield of neutron-induced reactions\nwas investigated for most of the benchmarked reactions. Gamma competition was\nfound to contribute at most 1% for the 197Au(n,2n) reaction, while being\nsubstantially lower for other target isotopes and neutron-induced activation\nreactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
