With\nthe Wilson coefficients including contributions beyond the standard model,\nlifetimes of $B$ meson as well as the $B^0_d-\\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing are\ninvestigated for clarifying correlations among the observables. We show that\nparameter regions for quasi-elastic rescattering, the size of color-suppressed\ntree amplitudes and new physics are constrained due to the lifetime data. As a\nconsequence, it is revealed that this scenario can be testable by the future\nLHCb measurement of width difference in $B^0_d-\\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing and\nsemi-leptonic CP asymmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
