We investigate magnetically charged black\nholes. The metric and mass functions and their asymptotic are obtained showing\nthat black holes may have one or two horizons. Thermodynamics in extended phase\nspace was studied and it was proven that the first law of black hole\nthermodynamics and the generalized Smarr relation hold. The magnetic potential\nand the vacuum polarization conjugated to coupling (NED parameter), are\ncomputed and depicted. We calculate the Gibbs free energy and heat capacity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
