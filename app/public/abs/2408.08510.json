In 2010, Vdovin conjectured that the base size of $G$ is at most 5.\nBurness proved this conjecture in the case of primitive $G$. The problem was\nreduced by Vdovin in 2012 to the case when $G$ is an almost simple group. Now\nthe problem is further reduced to groups of Lie type through work of Baykalov\nand Burness. In this paper, we prove the strong form of the conjecture for all\nalmost simple groups with socle isomorphic to $\\mathrm{PSL}_n(q).$\n  In the upcoming second paper, the analysis is extended to the unitary and\nsymplectic groups. The final third paper on orthogonal groups is in\npreparation. Together, these three paper will complete the proof of Vdovin's\nconjecture for all almost simple classical groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
