We show in detail that every model in this\nclass admits a Lax representation for its equations of motion, and that the\nPoisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, establishing the\nexistence of an infinite set of Poisson-commuting conserved charges. We argue\nthat the non-Abelian T-dual of any model in this family is classically\nintegrable, and that T-duality \"commutes\" with a general deformation in this\nclass, in a sense which we make precise. Finally, we demonstrate that these\nhigher-spin auxiliary field deformations can be extended to accommodate the\naddition of a Wess-Zumino term, and we exhibit the Lax connection in this case.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
