Tailored re-ranking system based on\nrelevance and engagement signals in E-commerce has often shown improvement on\nsales and gross merchandise value (GMV). Designing algorithms for this purpose\nis even more challenging when the shops are not restricted to domestic buyers,\nbut can sale globally to international buyers. Our solution needs to\nincorporate shopping preference and cultural traditions in different buyer\nmarkets. We propose the SEQ+MD framework, which integrates sequential learning\nfor multi-task learning (MTL) and feature-generated region-mask for\nmulti-distribution input. This approach leverages the sequential order within\ntasks and accounts for regional heterogeneity, enhancing performance on\nmulti-source data. Evaluations on in-house data showed a strong increase on the\nhigh-value engagement including add-to-cart and purchase while keeping click\nperformance neutral compared to state-of-the-art baseline models. Additionally,\nour multi-regional learning module is \"plug-and-play\" and can be easily adapted\nto enhance other MTL applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_pUZhpvOOa2zSW3QYIf-TaqU0Uyqf9pdpYk1RbrHdo4","pdfSize":"2105016"}
