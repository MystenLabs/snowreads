As the size of the internal map increases, so\ndoes the time required to compare new observations with all stored locations,\neventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop\nclosure detection approach for large-scale and long-term operation. The\napproach is based on a memory management method, which limits the number of\nlocations used for loop closure detection so that the computation time remains\nunder real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and\nfrequently observed locations in a Working Memory (WM) used for loop closure\ndetection, and transferring the others into a Long-Term Memory (LTM). When a\nmatch is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated\nlocations stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for additional loop\nclosure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and\nscalability using ten standard data sets from other appearance-based loop\nclosure approaches, one custom data set using real images taken over a 2 km\nloop of our university campus, and one custom data set (7 hours) using virtual\nimages from the racing video game ``Need for Speed: Most Wanted''.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
