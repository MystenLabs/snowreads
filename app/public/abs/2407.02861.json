This work proposes a novel\napproach leveraging Physics-Informed Real NVP neural networks, renowned for\ntheir ability to model complex and high-dimensional distributions, augmented\nwith a self-supervised task based on sensors' data permutation. It focuses on\nenhancing fault detection within the satellite multivariate time series. The\nexperiments involve various configurations, including pre-training with\nself-supervision, multi-task learning, and standalone self-supervised training.\nResults indicate significant performance improvements across all settings. In\nparticular, employing only the self-supervised loss yields the best overall\nresults, suggesting its efficacy in guiding the network to extract relevant\nfeatures for fault detection. This study presents a promising direction for\nimproving fault detection in space systems and warrants further exploration in\nother datasets and applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rB2L2ic0wtD8ZUG7qVfvfDE5iGym_O1VrDjYkyB-RlM","pdfSize":"619765"}
