We examine this issue when the feature dimension d is\nequal to the number of classes K. We demonstrate that two popular unconstrained\nfeature models are strict saddle functions, with every critical point being\neither a global minimum or a strict saddle point that can be exited using\nnegative curvatures. The primary findings conclusively confirm the conjecture\non the unconstrained feature models in previous articles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
