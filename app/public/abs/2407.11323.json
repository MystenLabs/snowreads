This method allows for continuous frequency tuning over 0.6 GHz\nby varying an applied external magnetic field. In the presence of the applied\nfield, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of an atomic\nvapor splits via the Zeeman effect according to the strength of the magnetic\nfield and the polarization of the pump and probe lasers. We show that the 480\nnm pump laser, responsible for transitions between the Zeeman sublevels of the\nintermediate state and the Rydberg state, can be locked to the Zeeman-split EIT\npeaks. The short-term frequency stability of the laser lock is 0.15 MHz and the\nlong-term stability is within 0.5 MHz. In addition, we show that in the absence\nof an applied magnetic field and adequate shielding, the frequency shift of the\nlock point has a peak-to-peak variation of 1.6 MHz depending on the\npolarization of the pump field, while when locked to Zeeman sublevels this\nvariation is reduced to 0.6 MHz. The proposed technique is useful for research\ninvolving Rydberg atoms, where large continuous tuning of the laser frequency\nwith stable locking is required.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
