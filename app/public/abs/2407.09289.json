To illustrate this, we propose a straightforward model based on the\nidea that city area is the result of people's desire to live close to one\nanother while also having sufficient living space. This leads to a more general\nform of fundamental allometry (relating area, population, and building height).\nOur argument is supported by empirical data from different countries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RTo5TtLvfkyBJupaRCE9aDJVQ05ok69PNsY5fHGNIMA","pdfSize":"656174"}
