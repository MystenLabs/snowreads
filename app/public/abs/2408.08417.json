{"id":"2408.08417","title":"Handling Pandemic-Scale Cyber Threats: Lessons from COVID-19","authors":"Adam Shostack and Josiah Dykstra","authorsParsed":[["Shostack","Adam",""],["Dykstra","Josiah",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 20:59:23 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-19","timestamp":1723755563000,"abstract":"  The devastating health, societal, and economic impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic illuminate potential dangers of unpreparedness for catastrophic\npandemic-scale cyber events. While the nature of these threats differs, the\nresponses to COVID-19 illustrate valuable lessons that can guide preparation\nand response to cyber events. Drawing on the critical role of collaboration and\npre-defined roles in pandemic response, we emphasize the need for developing\nsimilar doctrine and skill sets for cyber threats. We provide a framework for\naction by presenting the characteristics of a pandemic-scale cyber event and\ndifferentiating it from smaller-scale incidents the world has previously\nexperienced. The framework is focused on the United States. We analyze six\ncritical lessons from COVID-19, outlining key considerations for successful\npreparedness, acknowledging the limitations of the pandemic metaphor, and\noffering actionable steps for developing a robust cyber defense playbook. By\nlearning from COVID-19, government agencies, private sector, cybersecurity\nprofessionals, academic researchers, and policy makers can build proactive\nstrategies that safeguard critical infrastructure, minimize economic damage,\nand ensure societal resilience in the face of future cyber events.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
