[Goal] The primary aim of this research is to investigate\nthe benefits and limitations of migrating a real-world application to a\nmicro-frontends architecture from the perspective of the developers. [Method]\nBased on the action research approach, after diagnosis and planning, we applied\nan intervention of migrating the target web application to a micro-frontends\narchitecture. Thereafter, the migration was evaluated in a workshop involving\nthe remaining developers responsible for maintaining the application. During\nthe workshop, these developers were presented with the migrated architecture,\nconducted a simple maintenance task, discussed benefits and limitations in a\nfocus group to gather insights, and answered a questionnaire on the acceptance\nof the technology. [Results] Developers' perceptions gathered during the focus\ngroup reinforce the benefits and limitations reported in the literature. Key\nbenefits included enhanced flexibility in technology choices, scalability of\ndevelopment teams, and gradual migration of technologies. However, the\nincreased complexity of the architecture raised concerns among developers,\nparticularly in dependency and environment management, debugging, and\nintegration testing. [Conclusions] While micro-frontends represent a promising\ntechnology, unresolved issues still limit their broader applicability.\nDevelopers generally perceived the architecture as useful and moderately easy\nto use but hesitated to adopt it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QnGVjlVin-FVmGA0ObDlTvkB_1O1oh2c_dsLtHwhfSg","pdfSize":"623662"}
