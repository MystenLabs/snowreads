The concept of\n``upper periodic subsets'' can be considered as a generalized topic of ideals\nand sub-structures (e.g., subgroups, sub-semigroups, sub-magmas, sub-rings,\netc.). Hence, it can be improved to a theory in every algebraic structure which\nextends many basic concepts including the ideals. This paper follows the\nmentioned goals and studies related to algebraic and topological aspects. For\nthis purpose, first, we state an improved fundamental theorem about the unique\ndirect representation of left upper periodic subsets and then introduce some\nextensions and generalizations. As a result of the study, we classify\nsub-semigroups and subgroups of real numbers and introduce some related topics\nand concenterable upper periodic subsets. We end the study with many research\nprojects and some future directions of the theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
