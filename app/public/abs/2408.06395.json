Recent work has developed\nfast algorithms for approximating the John ellipsoid using sketching and\nleverage score sampling techniques. However, these algorithms do not provide\nprivacy guarantees for sensitive input data. In this paper, we present the\nfirst differentially private algorithm for fast John ellipsoid computation. Our\nmethod integrates noise perturbation with sketching and leverage score sampling\nto achieve both efficiency and privacy. We prove that (1) our algorithm\nprovides $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy, and the privacy guarantee\nholds for neighboring datasets that are $\\epsilon_0$-close, allowing\nflexibility in the privacy definition; (2) our algorithm still converges to a\n$(1+\\xi)$-approximation of the optimal John ellipsoid in\n$O(\\xi^{-2}(\\log(n/\\delta_0) + (L\\epsilon_0)^{-2}))$ iterations where $n$ is\nthe number of data point, $L$ is the Lipschitz constant, $\\delta_0$ is the\nfailure probability, and $\\epsilon_0$ is the closeness of neighboring input\ndatasets. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the algorithm's convergence and\nprivacy properties, providing a robust approach for balancing utility and\nprivacy in John ellipsoid computation. This is the first differentially private\nalgorithm for fast John ellipsoid computation, opening avenues for future\nresearch in privacy-preserving optimization techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
