We compare two\nalternative discretization schemes, one with a sine dispersion, the other with\na tangent dispersion, applied to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid with\nHubbard interaction. Both types of lattice fermions allow for an exact MPO\nrepresentation of low bond dimension, so they are efficiently computable, but\nonly the tangent dispersion gives a power law decay of the propagator in\nagreement with the continuum limit: The sine dispersion is gapped by the\ninteractions, evidenced by an exponentially decaying propagator. Our\nconstruction of a tensor network with an unpaired Dirac cone works around the\nfermion-doubling obstruction by exploiting the fact that the \\textit{nonlocal}\nHamiltonian of tangent fermions permits a \\textit{local} generalized\neigenproblem.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
