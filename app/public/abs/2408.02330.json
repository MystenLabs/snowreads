It is bathed in an\nextremely variable background of energetic ions and electrons which originate\nfrom a number of sources. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated in\nthe vicinity of the Sun, whereas shocks driven by solar disturbances are\nobserved to accelerate energetic storm particles (ESPs). Moreover, a dilute\npopulation with a distinct composition forms the anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs)\nwhich are of a mixed interstellar-heliospheric origin. Particles are also\naccelerated at planetary bow shocks. We will present recent observations of\nenergetic particles by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, as well as other\nspacecraft that allow us to study the acceleration and transport of energetic\nparticles at multiple locations in the inner heliosphere.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
