We analyze the X-ray spectra of the\nICM between the northwestern and the southeastern radio relics across a\nprominent cold front in A3667 to search for the ICM in a non-equilibrium\nionization (NEI) state. We find that the ICM inside the cold front exhibits an\nNEI state with an ionization parameter of\n$(2.5\\pm0.7)\\times10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{s\\,cm^{-3}}$ at the $90\\%$ confidence level,\nwhich is lower than that expected from a collisional ionization equilibrium\n(CIE) state of the ICM (i.e., $n_\\mathrm{e}t > 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s\\,cm^{-3}}$).\nThe timescale calculated from the ionization parameter of the ICM inside the\ncold front is $ 4.6\\pm1.2\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$, which is much shorter than the\nthermal equilibration timescale. A weak transonic sloshing motion might explain\nthe possibility that the ICM inside the cold front of A3667 is in the NEI\nstate. In addition, the NEI state of the ICM in A3667 seems to be associated\nwith the elongated radio halo bridging the region between the northwestern\nradio relic and the prominent cold front in A3667 across the cluster center.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
