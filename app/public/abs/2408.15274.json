We present a threshold quantum\ndistillation task where the same objective is achieved but using fewer parties\n'Q'. In particular, we give exact local filtering operations by the\nparticipating parties sharing a high-dimension multipartite GHZ or W state to\ndistil the perfect quantum correlation. Specifically, an arbitrary GHZ state\ncan be distilled using just one party in the network, as both the success\nprobability of the distillation protocol and the fidelity after the\ndistillation are independent of the number of parties. However, for a general\nW-state, at least 'P-1' parties are required for the distillation, indicating a\nstrong relationship between the distillation and the separability of such\nstates. Further, we connect threshold entanglement distillation and quantum\nsteering distillation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
