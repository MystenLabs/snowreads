Jacod and Rosenbaum (2013)\nstudied a plug-in type of estimator based on a Riemann sum approximation of the\nintegrated functional and a spot volatility estimator with a forward uniform\nkernel. Motivated by recent results that show that spot volatility estimators\nwith general two-side kernels of unbounded support are more accurate, in this\npaper, an estimator using a general kernel spot volatility estimator as the\nplug-in is considered. A biased central limit theorem for estimating the\nintegrated functional is established with an optimal convergence rate. Unbiased\ncentral limit theorems for estimators with proper de-biasing terms are also\nobtained both at the optimal convergence regime for the bandwidth and when\napplying undersmoothing. Our results show that one can significantly reduce the\nestimator's bias by adopting a general kernel instead of the standard uniform\nkernel. Our proposed bias-corrected estimators are found to maintain remarkable\nrobustness against bandwidth selection in a variety of sampling frequencies and\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5RfG0ueb8S9R_z3-kQwJLp2Z76VroUOa7MAzPh0Gxw4","pdfSize":"1539423"}
