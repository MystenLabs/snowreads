We scale task-centric data\ncollection in the real world using a hand-held gripper (UMI), providing a cheap\nway to demonstrate task-relevant manipulation skills without a robot.\nSimultaneously, we scale robot-centric data in simulation by training\nwhole-body controller for task-tracking without task simulation setups. The\ninterface between these two policies is end-effector trajectories in the task\nframe, inferred by the manipulation policy and passed to the whole-body\ncontroller for tracking. We evaluate UMI-on-Legs on prehensile, non-prehensile,\nand dynamic manipulation tasks, and report over 70% success rate on all tasks.\nLastly, we demonstrate the zero-shot cross-embodiment deployment of a\npre-trained manipulation policy checkpoint from prior work, originally intended\nfor a fixed-base robot arm, on our quadruped system. We believe this framework\nprovides a scalable path towards learning expressive manipulation skills on\ndynamic robot embodiments.
