To\nmaintain the orthogonality among different OAM modes at the receiver, the\nstrict alignment between transmit and receive antennas is highly demanded.\nHowever, it is not practical to guarantee the transceiver alignment in wireless\ncommunications. The phase turbulence, resulting from the misaligned\ntransceivers, leads to serious inter-mode interference among different OAM\nmodes and therefore fail for signals detection of multiple OAM modes at the\nreceiver. To achieve practical OAM based wireless communications, in this paper\nwe investigate the radio vortex wireless communications with misaligned\ntransmit and receive antennas. We propose a joint Beamforming and Pre-detection\n(BePre) scheme, which uses two unitary matrices to convert the channel matrix\ninto the equivalent circulant matrix for keeping the orthogonality among\nOAM-modes at the receiver. Then, the OAM signals can be detected with the\nmode-decomposition scheme at the misaligned receiver. Extensive simulations\nobtained validate and evaluate that our developed joint BePre scheme can\nefficiently detect the signals of multiple OAM-modes for the misaligned\ntransceiver and can significantly increase the spectrum efficiency.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
