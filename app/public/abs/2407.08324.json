The proposed metric is well-defined and can be efficiently approximated\ngiven a finite horizon. Then, we provide numerical evidences that the latter\nmetric can lead to interesting applications in the field of reinforcement\nlearning. In particular, we show that it could be used for forecasting the\nperformance of transfer learning algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
