Here, we drive the van der Pol oscillator with an\nexternal time-dependent force to reach the limit cycle in a given finite time.\nSpecifically, we are interested in minimising the non-conservative contribution\nto the work when driving the system from a given initial point on the phase\nplane to any final point belonging to the limit cycle. There appears a speed\nlimit inequality, which expresses a trade-off between the connection time and\ncost -- in terms of the non-conservative work. We show how the above results\ncan be { generalized to the broader family of non-linear oscillators given by}\nthe Li\\'enard equation. Finally, we also look into the problem of minimising\nthe total work done by the external force.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
