In introducing sock\norderings and the foot-sorting algorithm, Defant and Kravitz ask whether there\nis some list of patterns which all foot-sortable sock orderings must avoid,\nthus characterizing which sock orderings are foot-sortable. We enumerate this\nlist, the basis of foot-sortable sock orderings, and show that this basis is\ninfinite. We also describe a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for\nsorting socks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
