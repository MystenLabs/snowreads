By rigorously analyzing their derivations, central extensions,\nand automorphism groups, we seek to uncover potential synergies and\napplications linking these distinct algebraic frameworks. The exploration\nincludes detailed proofs, derivations, and calculations, providing new insights\ninto the representation theory of Lie algebras with potential applications in\nconformal field theory and symplectic geometry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IcmTVsl6EX0L0DILI--BSb6nGGZhG3fT5qvVYcUF2PM","pdfSize":"103018"}
