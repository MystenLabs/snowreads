An especially interesting one is the ferroelectric smectic A phase\n(SmAF) with spontaneous polarization along the layer normal observed in a few\nmaterials of the NF realm. Here, we present a mean-field molecular model that\nsuccessfully captures the rich phase diagrams experimentally observed in the\nliterature in terms of two parameters. Additionally, we carry out second\nharmonic generation, X-ray diffraction and birefringence measurements in a\ncompound exhibiting the SmAF phase to determine the appropriate order\nparameters and compare with the model predictions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
