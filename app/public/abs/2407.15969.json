The proposed scheme replicates the leakage using an in-phase and\nquadrature mixer (IQ-mixer) and performs leakage cancellation in the\nradio-frequency (RF) domain. This approach utilizes a Wilkinson power combiner\nafter the RX antenna to subtract the replicated leakage signal from the\nreceived signal, ensuring that only the true target signal reaches the\nlow-noise amplifier (LNA). This scheme enhances the dynamic range and the\nreceiver's ability to discern proximate targets from previously\nindistinguishable low beat-frequency clutter. In addition, the proposed\ntechnique incorporates a second IQ-mixer based complex modulator in the\ntransmitter to tune the leakage beat frequency. This allows for accurate\nestimation of the leakage amplitude and phase without additional hardware.\nSimulation results show more than 20 dB of leakage cancellation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
