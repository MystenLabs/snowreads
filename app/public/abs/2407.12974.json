Especially in a multi-messenger context, there\nare also opportunity costs to follow-up observations on any detection claims.\nSo in searching for the still elusive lensed gravitational waves, care needs to\nbe taken in controlling false positives. In particular, many methods for\nidentifying strong lensing rely on some form of parameter similarity or\nwaveform consistency, which under rapidly growing catalog sizes can expose them\nto false positives from coincident but unlensed events if proper care is not\ntaken. And searches for waveform deformations in all lensing regimes are\nsubject to degeneracies we need to mitigate between lensing, intrinsic\nparameters, insufficiently modelled effects such as orbital eccentricity, or\neven deviations from general relativity. Robust lensing studies also require\nunderstanding and mitigating glitches and non-stationarities in the detector\ndata. This article reviews sources of possible false positives (and their flip\nside: false negatives) in gravitational-wave lensing searches and the main\napproaches the community is pursuing to mitigate them.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
