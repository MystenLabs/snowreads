Since experimental\norientation data are subject to errors, directions of axes obtained from such\ndata are also inaccurate. A natural question arises: given a resolution of\ninput rotations, what is the average error of the rotation axes? Assuming that\nrotation data characterized by rotation angle $\\omega$ deviate from actual data\nby error rotations with fixed angle $\\delta$ but otherwise random, the average\nerror of rotation axes of the data is expressed analytically as a function of\n$\\omega$ and $\\delta$. Moreover, a scheme for using this formula in practical\ncases when rotation errors $\\delta$ follow the von Mises-Fisher distribution is\ndescribed. Finally, the impact of crystal symmetry on determination of average\nerrors of axis directions is discussed. The presented results are important for\nassessing the reliability of rotation axes in studies where directions of\ncrystal rotations play a role, e.g. in identifying deformation slip mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"75I-y8AUDi5bvr8G5jfovEFDc8E2m0uJqtvVrV_RfBQ","pdfSize":"247641"}
