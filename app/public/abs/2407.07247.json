Despite spuriously breaking\nBRST-invariance in intermediate steps, it is the only scheme which handles the\nwell-known $\\gamma_5$-problem mathematically consistently. We begin with a\nbrief motivation, followed by an exposition of our methodology. Specifically,\nwe illustrate the symmetry restoration procedure to obtain the required\nsymmetry-restoring counterterms and provide insights into our computational\nsetups, including recent developments. Building up on this, we present recent\nresults and advances for the multi-loop renormalization of Abelian and\nnon-Abelian chiral gauge theories, before concluding this article with a\ndiscussion on prospective implementations of the BMHV regularization in SM-like\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
