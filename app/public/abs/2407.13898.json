In wireless communication systems, channel\nimpairments such as signal fading present challenges in the effective\nimplementation and analysis of covert communication systems. This paper\ngeneralizes early work in the covert communication field by considering\nasymptotic results for the number of bits that can be covertly transmitted in\n$n$ channel uses on a block fading channel. Critical to the investigation is\ncharacterizing the performance of optimal detectors at the adversary. Matching\nachievable and converse results are presented.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
