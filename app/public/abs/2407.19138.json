We solved the field-aligned\nequations of motion for flows inside the current sheet with finite thickness.\nWe find that flows coming into the vicinity of a Y-point become super fast. The\ncentrifugal acceleration takes place efficiently, and most of the Poynting\nenergy is converted into kinetic energy. However, the super fast flow does not\nprovide enough centrifugal drift current to open the magnetic field. Opening of\nthe magnetic field is possible by the plasmas that are accelerated in the\nazimuthal direction with a large Lorentz factor in the closed field region. We\nfind that this acceleration takes place if the field strength increases toward\nthe Y-point from inside. The accelerated plasma is transferred from the closed\nfield region to the open field region by magnetic reconnection with plasmoid\nemission. We also estimate the Lorentz factor to be reached in the centrifugal\nwind.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tzALA7taAujt70bzuCn-lUcCo9f1pavti6EdxLCBBVo","pdfSize":"6995773"}
