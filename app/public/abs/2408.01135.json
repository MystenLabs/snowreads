As consequences we show that\n$\\mathcal{F}(X)$ enjoys the weak Banach-Saks property and that every subspace\nof $\\mathcal{F}(X)$ with nontrivial type is superreflexive. Further, weakly\ncompact subsets of $\\mathcal{F}(X)$ are super weakly compact and hence have\nmany strong properties. To prove the result, we use a modification of the proof\nof weak sequential completeness of $\\mathcal{F}(X)$ by Kochanek and Perneck\\'a\nand an appropriate version of compact reduction in the spirit of Aliaga,\nNo\\^us, Petitjean and Proch\\'azka.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
