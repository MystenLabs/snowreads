This paper introduces Larp, a novel path planning framework\nthat leverages the concept of restrictive potential fields to forge routes\ndemonstrably safer than those derived from existing methods. The algorithm\nachieves it by segmenting a potential field into a hierarchy of cells, each\nwith a designated restriction zone determined by obstacle proximity. While the\nprimary impetus behind Larp is to enhance the safety of aerial pathways for\ncargo-carrying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), its utility extends to a wide\narray of path planning scenarios. Comparative analyses with both established\nand contemporary potential field-based methods reveal Larp's proficiency in\nmaintaining a safe distance from restrictions and its adeptness in\ncircumventing local minima.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_cd99cSsY7ap6gSfZZ5gKsMkc7UwCqDcTI5tiZ_vLfM","pdfSize":"2657019"}
