Here, we introduce a lasing spectroscopy method\nthat can visualise the gain profiles of the modes in complex lasers using an\nartificial neural network. The spatial gain distributions of different lasing\nmodes in a disorderly coupled microring array are reconstructed without prior\nknowledge of the laser topology. We further extend the neural network to a\ntandem neural network that can control the laser emission by matching the modal\ngain/loss profile to selectively enhance the targeted modes. This mode\nvisualisation method offers a new approach to extracting hidden spatial mode\nfeatures from photonic structures, which could improve our understanding and\ncontrol of complex photonic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
