Our measurements clearly detect additional peaks\nin the low-temperature phase, which disappear nearly completely when heated\nabove $T_c$. Proposed $\\sqrt{3}$a \\times $\\sqrt{3}$a lattice reconstruction\nexplains these new Raman peaks by the Brillouin zone folding. The experiment,\non the one hand, confirms that the symmetry of the non-magnetic phase is not\nlower than trigonal, but, on another hand, our thermal cycling study suggests\npossible stacking faults. This agrees with results of the density functional\ntheory calculations, which show that the energy difference between different\ntypes of stacking does not exceed 1 K per formula unit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
