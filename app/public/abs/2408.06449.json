It presents a practical implementation of the\nsystem exploring the realm of musical haptics through the translation of MIDI\ndata from a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) into haptic sensations, from a set\nof haptic actuators, in real-time. It also includes a suitable music-to-haptic\nmapping strategy to translate notes from musical instruments to haptic\nfeedback. The haptic actuators, placed strategically on the palmar surface of\nthe hand allowed users to perceive music and were able to identify melody and\nrhythm of different musical compositions. A pilot user study conducted intended\nto assess the accuracy of the interface by testing the participants to select\nthe correct audio presentation from the haptic presentation of the same musical\ncomposition. It presents a comparative study, differentiating between those\nwith prior musical background and those without, in identifying the correct\naudio counterpart solely through haptic inputs. This pilot study delves into\nhow users perceive and interpret haptic feedback within the context of musical\ncompositions. The study showed promising results in enriching our understanding\nof user responses to haptic feedback in musical scenarios and exploring the\nintricacies of user experience with the system and its impact on musical\ninterpretation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
