The production-plane\npolarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons, defined w.r.t. the $\\Lambda$ momentum and\nthe beam, can track the \"vortex-ring\" feature in the event, a characteristic\nvortical structure generated by longitudinal flow gradients. We make\ncomprehensive model predictions for the rapidity-dependent vortex-ring\nobservables for different collision system sizes at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} =\n200$ and 72 GeV. Our predictions at the latter energy can be explored in the\nfuture LHCb fixed-target experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mq4bpegpxNiwNuwxrMUUY1O6dpp43H3xTzSOuidR6VM","pdfSize":"972184"}
