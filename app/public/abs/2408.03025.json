In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 351 million learning\nactivities from 0.8 million unique learners enrolled in over 1.6 thousand\ncourses within two years. Specifically, we mine and identify the learning\npatterns of the crowd from both temporal and course enrollment perspectives\nleveraging mutual information theory and sequential pattern mining methods.\nFrom the temporal perspective, we find that the time intervals between\nconsecutive learning activities of learners exhibit a mix of power-law and\nperiodic cosine function distribution. By qualifying the relationship between\ncourse pairs, we observe that the most frequently co-enrolled courses usually\nfall in the same category or the same university. We demonstrate these findings\ncan facilitate manifold applications including recommendation tasks on courses.\nA simple recommendation model utilizing the course enrollment patterns is\ncompetitive to the baselines with 200$\\times$ faster training time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
