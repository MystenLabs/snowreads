Rev. B, 107,075116(20230]. We probe this relationship in\ndomain where conformal symmetry is broken using 1D Kitaev model with pairing\nterm which decays with distance as a power-law with exponent $\\alpha$. We\nanalytically show that for $\\alpha=1$, this relationship persists with same\nslope as found in $\\alpha \\to \\infty$ case where conformal symmetry is\nunbroken. We recall that conformal symmetry is broken for $\\alpha<3/2$ [Phys.\nRev. Lett., 113,156402(2014)]. We numerically show that linearity persists for\nintermediate values of $\\alpha$. The presence of long range pairing helps in\nextracting more energy for the work i.e. ergotropy. We show analytically that\nergotropy increases logarithmically with system size for $\\alpha=1$ and becomes\nproportional to system size for $\\alpha=0$ (numerically).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
