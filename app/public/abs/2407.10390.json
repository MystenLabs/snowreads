In this work we derive a\nfamily of TURs that explores higher order moments of the entropy production and\nis valid in any situation a Fluctuation Theorem holds. The resulting bound\nholds in both classical and quantum regimes and can always be saturated. These\nTURs are shown in action for a two level system weakly coupled to a bath\nundergoing a non time-symmetric drive, where we can use the Tasaki-Crooks\nfluctuation theorem. Finally, we draw a connection between our TURs and the\nexistence of correlations between the entropy production and the thermodynamic\nquantity under consideration.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
