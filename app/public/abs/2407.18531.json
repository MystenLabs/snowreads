We provide a\nspectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for both the\ncentralized and distributed processing schemes with bilinear equalizer\n(BE)-structure combining schemes applied. The BE-structured combining is a set\nof schemes that are constructed by the multiplications of channel\nstatistics-based BE matrices and instantaneous channel estimates. Notably, we\nderive closed-form achievable SE expressions for centralized and distributed\nBE-structured combining schemes. We propose one centralized and two distributed\nOBE schemes: Centralized OBE (C-OBE), Distributed OBE based on Global channel\nstatistics (DG-OBE), and Distributed OBE based on Local channel statistics\n(DL-OBE), which maximize their respective SE expressions. OBE matrices in these\nschemes are tailored based on varying levels of channel statistics. Notably, we\nobtain new and insightful closed-form results for the C-OBE, DG-OBE, and DL-OBE\ncombining schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed OBE schemes\ncan achieve excellent SE, even in scenarios with severe pilot contamination.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
