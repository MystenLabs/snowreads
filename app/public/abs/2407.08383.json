Jin, Z. Ma, and K. Wu,\nJ. Sci. Comput., 94 (2023), pp. 57], we provide a rigorous error analysis for\nPINNs in approximating the solution of the Boltzmann equation near a global\nMaxwellian. The challenge arises from the nonlocal quadratic interaction term\ndefined in the unbounded domain of velocity space. Analyzing this term on an\nunbounded domain requires the inclusion of a truncation function, which demands\ndelicate analysis techniques. As a generalization of this analysis, we also\nprovide proof of the asymptotic preserving property when using micro-macro\ndecomposition-based neural networks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
