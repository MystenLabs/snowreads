By taking\ninto the account of the previously proposed principle driven fiber model, the\nreduced basis expansion method and transforming the parameterized inputs into\nparameterized coefficients of the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations, universal\nsolutions with respect to inputs corresponding to different bit rates can all\nbe obtained without the need of re-training the whole model. This model, once\nadopted, can have prominent advantages in both computation efficiency and\nphysical background. Besides, this model can still be effectively trained\nwithout the needs of transmitted signals collected in advance. Tasks of on-off\nkeying signals with bit rates ranging from 2Gbps to 50Gbps are adopted to\ndemonstrate the fidelity of the model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
