In\nthis work, motivated by one-loop vacuum-polarization effects on curved\nspacetime, we investigate a gravitational theory with non-minimal\ncurvature-electromagnetic coupling terms of the form $\\xi R\nF_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$, where $R$ is the scalar curvature and $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ the\nFaraday tensor, which can be responsible for the generation of primordial\nelectromagnetic fields. We study then the GW signatures of such coupling terms\nderiving in particular for the first time to the best of our knowledge the\nmodified tensor modes equation of motion. Remarkably, we find a universal\ninfrared (IR) frequency scaling $f^5$ of the electromagnetically induced GW\n(EMIGW) signal, which, depending on the energy scale of inflation, the duration\nof inflation and reheating as well as the dynamical behaviour of the gauge\ncoupling function $\\xi$, can be well within the detection sensitivity bands of\nGW experiments such as SKA, LISA, ET and BBO, being thus potentially detectable\nin the future by GW observatories.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
