We analyze the system's\ntrajectory comprehensively, examining both local and global dynamics. Our\nanalysis begins by establishing the invariance of the positive trajectory\nwithin the first quadrant. We then investigate the existence of fixed points\nwithin this region. Following this, we perform a stability analysis to\ndetermine both local and global asymptotic stability of the identified fixed\npoints. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and applicability of our\ntheoretical results through numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
