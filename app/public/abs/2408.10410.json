Our approach leverages a\nchannel-based segmentation method with an advanced angular data repair\ntechnique and a cross-eight-way flood-fill algorithm. This innovative approach\nsignificantly reduces the number of iterations while ensuring the high accuracy\nof the segmented ground plane, which makes the stream-based hardware\nimplementation possible.\n  To validate the proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on the\nSemanticKITTI dataset. We introduced a bird's-eye view (BEV) evaluation metric\ntailored for the area representation of LiDAR segmentation tasks. Our method\ndemonstrated superior performance in terms of BEV areas when compared to the\nexisting approaches. Moreover, we presented an optimized hardware architecture\ntargeted on a Zynq-7000 FPGA, compatible with LiDARs of various channel\ndensities, i.e., 32, 64, and 128 channels. Our FPGA implementation operating at\n160 MHz significantly outperforms the traditional computing platforms, which is\n12 to 25 times faster than the CPU-based solutions and up to 6 times faster\nthan the GPU-based solution, in addition to the benefit of low power\nconsumption.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
