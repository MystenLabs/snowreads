The bounds we obtain\ndepend on the length of a shortest multi-geodesic disconnecting the surfaces\ninto connected components each containing a boundary component and the rate of\ndependency on it is sharp. Our result also identifies situations when the bound\nis independent of the length of this multi-geodesic. The bounds also hold when\nthe Gaussian curvature is bounded between two negative constants and can be\nviewed as a counterpart of the well-known Schoen-Wolpert-Yau inequality for\nLaplace eigenvalues. The proof is based on analysing the behaviour of the\n{corresponding Steklov} eigenfunction on an adapted version of thick-thin\ndecomposition for hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary. Our results\nextend and improve the previously known result in the compact case obtained by\na different method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
