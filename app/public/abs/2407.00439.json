Here we note that since many pullers have \"outboard\" cilia\nor flagella displaced laterally from the cell centerline on both sides of the\norganism, there are two important subclasses whose far-field is that of a\nstresslet, but whose near field is qualitatively more complex. The ciliary beat\ncreates not only a propulsive force but also swirling flows that can be\nrepresented by paired rotlets with two possible senses of rotation, either\n\"feeders\" that sweep fluid toward the cell apex, or \"expellers\" that push fluid\naway. Experimental studies of the rotifer $Brachionus~plicatilis$ in\ncombination with earlier work on the green algae $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$\nshow that the two classes have markedly different interactions with surfaces.\nWhen swimming near a surface, expellers such as $C.~reinhardtii$ scatter from\nthe wall, whereas a feeder like $B.~plicatilis$ stably attaches. This results\nin a stochastic \"run-and-stick\" locomotion, with periods of ballistic motion\nparallel to the surface interrupted by trapping at the surface.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
