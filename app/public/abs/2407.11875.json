We employ the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as the\nperformance metric of sensing, thus a joint beamforming design and MAs'\nposition optimizing problem is formulated to minimize the CRB. However the\nresulting optimization problem is NP-hard and the variables are highly coupled.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework\nby adopting semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation\n(SCA) technique. Numerical results reveal that the proposed MA-assisted ISAC\nsystem achieves lower estimation CRB compared to the fixed-position antenna\n(FPA) counterpart.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
