Combining the\nPOD with the empirical interpolation method, we also propose a POD-empirical\ninterpolation method with entropy-based convergence analysis for simultaneously\napproximating parametrized target functions by separable approximants. Several\nnumerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm compared to traditional methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
