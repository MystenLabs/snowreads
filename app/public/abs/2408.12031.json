In the last decade, it has been applied to various fields, including\ncancer biology, neuroscience, and, especially, developmental biology. This rise\nin popularity has been accompanied with creation of modern software,\ndevelopment of new pipelines and design of new algorithms. Many established\nalgorithms have also been applied with varying levels of effectiveness.\nCurrently, there is an abundance of algorithms for all steps of the general\nworkflow. While some scientists use ready-made pipelines (such as Seurat),\nmanual analysis is popular, too, as it allows more flexibility. Scientists who\nperform their own analysis face multiple options when it comes to the choice of\nalgorithms. We have used two different datasets to test some of the most\nwidely-used algorithms. In this paper, we are going to report the main\ndifferences between them, suggest a minimal number of algorithms for each step,\nand explain our suggestions. In certain stages, it is impossible to make a\nclear choice without further context. In these cases, we are going to explore\nthe major possibilities, and make suggestions for each one of them.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"UAaToFT9oEpxe1fQW31Rd0iIMwJ3-SNqXQT_kUW5BvI","pdfSize":"2595874"}
