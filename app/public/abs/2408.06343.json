As most of their axioms are algebraic\nin nature, this approach has a clear algebraic flavor. On the other hand, it is\nhighly natural to take the geometric viewpoint and consider a distance\n(understood in a broad sense) on the cone of positive operators, and define the\nmean of positive operators by an appropriate notion of the center of mass. This\nstrategy often leads to a fixed point equation that characterizes the mean. The\naim of this survey is to highlight those cases where the algebraic and the\ngeometric approaches meet each other.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
