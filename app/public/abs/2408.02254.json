Boroun and P.Ha, Phys.\nRev. D {\\bf 109} (2024) 094037] using Laplace transform techniques. Our results\nare compared with the HERA I (H1) data and extended to the Large Hadron\nelectron Collider (LHeC) domain. We also examine the ratio $F_{L2}(x,\nQ^2)=F_{L}(x, Q^2)/F_{2}(x, Q^2)$ obtained from our work, comparing it with\nboth the H1 data and the color dipole (CDP) bounds. We find that our results\nfor the reduced cross section and the ratio $F_{L2}(x, Q^2)$ agree with the H1\ndata. Finally, our evaluation of the gluon distribution functions $G(x,Q^2)$ in\nmomentum space shows very good concordance with the NNPDF3.0LO gluon structure\nfunctions for moderate $Q^2$ in the range $10^{-5}{\\leq}x{\\leq}1$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RWDcbTdHCHd8cTXHedZV0mupvMVCiSKhp-LRndnBIHw","pdfSize":"611424","txDigest":"8EJYKUen5jYCufU49bTh796TJuNfRmHoUdFR9PKyUSNq","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
