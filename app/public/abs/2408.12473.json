For\ncomparison, the best known classical upper bound in this case just to decide\n$st$-connectivity is $\\mathsf{DSPACE}(O(\\log^2 n/ \\log \\log n))$. The result\nestablishes a new relationship between $\\mathsf{BQL}$ and unambiguity and\nfewness subclasses of $\\mathsf{NL}$. Further, some preprocessing in our\napproach also allows us to verify whether there are at most polynomially many\npaths between any two nodes in $\\mathsf{BQSPACE}(O(\\log n))$. This yields the\nfirst natural candidate for a language problem separating $\\mathsf{BQL}$ from\n$\\mathsf{L}$ and $\\mathsf{BPL}$. Until now, all candidates separating these\nclasses were promise problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LJ-CEfhaqruHODb9-bTahI9dtGR82InnIxqKbHGwa4A","pdfSize":"255588"}
