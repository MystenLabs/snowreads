This property, known as the curse\nof dimensionality, restricts the application of such estimators to models with\nmoderately few random coefficients. This paper proposes a scalable\nnonparametric estimator for high-dimensional random coefficient models. The\nestimator uses a truncated tensor product of one-dimensional hierarchical basis\nfunctions to approximate the underlying random coefficients' distribution. Due\nto the truncation, the number of parameters increases at a much slower rate\nthan in the regular tensor product basis, rendering the nonparametric\nestimation of high-dimensional random coefficient models feasible. The derived\nestimator allows estimating the underlying distribution with constrained least\nsquares, making the approach computationally simple and fast. Monte Carlo\nexperiments and an application to data on the regulation of air pollution\nillustrate the good performance of the estimator.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
