This concept has\nsignificant applications both within mathematics -- where it allows for\nsynthetic (higher) category theory -- and programming languages -- where it\nleads to a directed version of the structure identity principle. In this work,\nwe construct the first types in simplicial type theory with non-trivial\nhomomorphisms. We extend simplicial type theory with modalities and new\nreasoning principles to obtain triangulated type theory in order to construct\nthe universe of discrete types $\\mathcal{S}$. We prove that homomorphisms in\nthis type correspond to ordinary functions of types i.e., that $\\mathcal{S}$ is\ndirected univalent. The construction of $\\mathcal{S}$ is foundational for both\nof the aforementioned applications of simplicial type theory. We are able to\ndefine several crucial examples of categories and to recover important results\nfrom category theory. Using $\\mathcal{S}$, we are also able to define various\ntypes whose usage is guaranteed to be functorial. These provide the first\ncomplete examples of the proposed directed structure identity principle.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TAe61MYu_wmDn7IXb1wbFpVOTBmiKJsr2DUdJCf9Jeo","pdfSize":"940269"}
