We model this transition using\nfirst principles Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations. Simulation results\nyield the temperature-dependent energy, entropy, heat capacity, occupancy\nfluctuations, and diffraction patterns. The contribution of chemical disorder\nto the entropy is calculated on the basis of point and pair cluster\nfrequencies. The simulated structures exhibit compensated ferrimagnetism, and\nthe Fermi level lies in a pseudogap. Sensitivity of structure and magnetism to\nthe exchange-correlation functional is discussed, and neutron diffraction\nexperiments are proposed to help resolve the true chemical order.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
