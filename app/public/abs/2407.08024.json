Foundational to our approach are two\nmathematical constructions with classical roots: the Borel isomorphism and the\nHaar basis. Here, these constructions are intertwined to establish an\nidentification between $L_2(0,1]$ and the Hilbert space of an infinite array of\nqubits and to enable analysis of operators that act on arrays of qubits (either\nfinite or infinite). The fusion of these two concepts empowers us to represent\nquantum operations and observables through geometric operators. As an\nunexpected upshot, we observe that the fundamental concept of calculus is\ninherent in an infinite array of qubits; indeed, the antiderivative arises as a\nnatural and indispensable operator in this context.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
