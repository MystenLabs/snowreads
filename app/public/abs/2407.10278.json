It introduces a sliding Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) methodology integrated with Battery Energy Storage\nSystems (BESS), emphasizing extending battery life and prioritizing critical\nloads during HILP events. This approach focuses on extending the sustainability\nof battery operation by linearizing the battery lifecycle within the\noptimization framework. Furthermore, this research proposed a straightforward\nmethod to mitigate communication disruptions during HILP events, thereby\nensuring operational integrity. This focused approach enhances isolated\nmicrogrid resilience and sustainability, offering a strategic response to\ncontemporary environmental challenges.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_Etl_mRRFb_QAleQJBjwHDrDdphCt4XhxgyQy6H6Bjc","pdfSize":"1055455","objectId":"0x62c0b42602b6de2d828a365df228b452a5fccf451b0a7129400a2038d168724d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
