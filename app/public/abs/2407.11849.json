We give\nevidence by deriving the pure spinor superspace expression of the massive\nfield-theory n-point tree amplitude with one first-level massive and n-1\nmassless states in two ways: 1) from BRST cohomology arguments in pure spinor\nsuperspace and 2) from the ${\\alpha^\\prime}^2$ correction to the massless\nstring amplitudes by inverting the unitarity constraint in superspace.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
