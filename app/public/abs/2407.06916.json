For such a half-line problem, the Poisson brackets of the corresponding\nscattering data are computed, and the variables of action-angle type are\nconstructed. These action-angle variables completely trivialize the dynamics of\nthe NLS equation on the half-line.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
