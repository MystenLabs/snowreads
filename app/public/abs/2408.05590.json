We demonstrate a proof of concept of using a data-driven supervised\nclassification framework on a multivariate time series data set covering solar\ncycles 22, 23, and 24. We implement ensemble modeling that merges the results\nfrom three proton channels (E$\\geq$10 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV) and the long\nband X-ray flux (1-8{\\AA}) channel from the Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellite missions. Our task is binary classification, such that\nthe aim of the model is to distinguish strong SEP events from nonevents. Here,\nstrong SEP events are those crossing the Space Weather Prediction Center's \"S1\"\nthreshold of solar radiation storm and proton fluxes below that are weak SEP\nevents. In addition, we consider periods of non-occurrence of SEPs following a\nflare with magnitudes $\\geq$C6.0 to maintain a natural imbalance of sample\ndistribution. In our data set, there are 244 strong SEP events comprising the\npositive class. There are 189 weak events and 2,460 \"SEP-quiet\" periods for the\nnegative class. We experiment with summary statistic classifier, one-nearest\nneighbor and supervised time series forest (STSF), and compare their\nperformances to validate our methods for prediction windows from 5 min up to 60\nmin. We find STSF to perform better under all circumstances. For an optimal\nclassification threshold of $\\approx$0.3 and a 60 min prediction window, we\nobtain: TSS = 0.850, HSS = 0.878, GSS = 0.783.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
