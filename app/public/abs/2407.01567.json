In this paper we demonstrate a new\napproach that takes a single robot and its controller as input and produces a\nset of modular controllers for each of these assemblies such that when a new\nrobot is built from the same parts, its control can be quickly learned by\nreusing the modular controllers. We achieve this with a framework called MeMo\nwhich learns (Me)aningful, (Mo)dular controllers. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel modularity objective to learn an appropriate division of labor among the\nmodules. We demonstrate that this objective can be optimized simultaneously\nwith standard behavior cloning loss via noise injection. We benchmark our\nframework in locomotion and grasping environments on simple to complex robot\nmorphology transfer. We also show that the modules help in task transfer. On\nboth structure and task transfer, MeMo achieves improved training efficiency to\ngraph neural network and Transformer baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
