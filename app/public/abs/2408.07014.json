In the gas phase, the low-spin (LS, S=0)\nstate is found to be energetically favorable for U(Fe) $\\leq$ 3 eV, whereas the\nhigh-spin (HS, S=2) state is stabilized for U(Fe) > 3 eV. Interaction with the\nAu(111) substrate is found to elevate the critical U for the spin-state\ntransition to 3.5 eV. Additionally, we perform L-edge X-ray absorption\nspectroscopy (XAS) calculations based on time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for both\nHS and LS states. The calculated XAS suggests that the HS state more closely\naligns with the experimental observations, indicating the potential coexistence\nof the HS state as the initial state during the X-ray excitation process. These\nfindings enrich our understanding of spin-state dynamics in\n[Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"treE2XsOp1U98GpBGMRZ8Zc8Ev3-fqYtguUVcQLxDos","pdfSize":"6955204"}
