As in the classical case we introduce an\nEulerian variational formulation which, despite the non convexity of the\ninteraction, still gives a weak solution to the MFG model. The problem can be\nreformulated in Lagrangian terms and solved numerically by a Sinkhorn-like\nscheme. We present numerical results based on this approach, these simulations\nexhibit different behaviours depending on the nature (repulsive or attractive)\nof the non-local interaction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
