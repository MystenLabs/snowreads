Many foundational network\nstudies made use of the abundant data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb)\nto test network methodologies. This survey focuses more specifically on\nexamining research that employs network analysis to evaluate the film industry\nitself, revealing the social and business relationships involved in film\nproduction, distribution, and consumption. The paper adopts a classification\napproach based on node type and conducts network analyses of the reviewed\nliterature, mapping citation and co-authorship networks. The findings provide\ninsights into the structure and interconnectedness of the field, offering\npotential clusters of debates and shedding light on the institutional,\ngeographical, and demographic characteristics shaping this field. In addition,\nthis survey contributes to understanding film industry network analysis and\ninforms researchers interested in network methods within the film industry and\nrelated cultural sectors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U2XgUYe3AiWQ-TdHTB3PAlRoyvBSO6YkgCPQ1qLoO_0","pdfSize":"1959315"}
