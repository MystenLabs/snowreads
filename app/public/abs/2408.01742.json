In the linearized regime, dispersion\nrelations become describeable by polynomials with random coefficients. We give\na short review of this theory and perform a numerical study of the distribution\nof the roots of polynomials whose coefficients are of the order of a Knudsen\nseries but fluctuate in accordance with canonical fluctuations of temperature.\nWe find that, remarkably, the analytic structure of the poles of fluctuating\ndispersion relations is very different from deterministic ones, particularly\nregarding the distribution of imaginary parts with respect to real components.\nWe argue that this provides evidence that hydrodynamic behavior persists, and\nis enhanced, by non-perturbative background fluctuations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2_pI5hsdH_1W53-IUJ4hKMHPpu53Nl2YUbaOP7hzAMc","pdfSize":"2780363","txDigest":"GHWeH2SZ5cVx7RE2MS8hHs8XfPhSZW9tNsV6NukVfV6f","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
