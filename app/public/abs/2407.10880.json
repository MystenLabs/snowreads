We focus on analytical and\nnumerical methods developed for calculating, computing, and tracking drop\ndeformation en route to developing constitutive models for flowing emulsions.\nWe identify material properties and dimensionless parameters, collate the small\ndeformation theories and resulting expressions for viscometric quantities, list\ntheoretical and numerical methods, and take stock of challenges for capturing\nconnections between drop deformation, morphology, and rheology of emulsions. We\nhighlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of\nthe rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and\npowerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological\nproperties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics\nof non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the\ninterfacial properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t0CPti9HUqMvwcYXdmDar_02wyIWPWFMFCfhKL3iKuk","pdfSize":"3506996"}
