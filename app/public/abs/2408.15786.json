A crucial step is the definition of the BPS sheaf as a\ncomplex of monodromic mixed Hodge modules. We prove the purity of the BPS sheaf\nwhen the situation arises from a smooth affine weakly symplectic algebraic\nvariety with a weak moment map. This situation gives local models for 1-Artin\nderived stacks with self-dual cotangent complex. We then apply these results to\nprove a conjecture of Halpern-Leistner predicting the purity of the Borel-Moore\nhomology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks (or more generally, derived stacks\nwith self-dual cotangent complex) having a proper good moduli space. One\nstriking application is the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of the moduli\nstack of principal Higgs bundles over a smooth projective curve for a reductive\ngroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
