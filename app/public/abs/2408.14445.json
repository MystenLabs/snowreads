We\nprove, however, that if a symmetric critical point exists, those adjacent to it\nare generically symmetry breaking. This mathematical mechanism is shown to\ncarry important implications for our ability to efficiently minimize invariant\nnonconvex functions, in particular those associated with neural networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
