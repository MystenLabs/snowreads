To discover\ncrystalline materials, traditional experimental and computational approaches\nare often time-consuming and expensive. In these years, thanks to the explosive\namount of crystalline materials data, great interest has been given to\ndata-driven materials discovery. Particularly, recent advancements have\nexploited the expressive representation ability of deep learning to model the\nhighly complex atomic systems within crystalline materials, opening up new\navenues for fast and accurate materials discovery. These works typically focus\non four types of tasks, including physicochemical property prediction,\ncrystalline material synthesis, aiding characterization, and accelerating\ntheoretical computations. Despite the remarkable progress, there is still a\nlack of systematic research to summarize their correlations, distinctions, and\nlimitations. To fill this gap, we systematically investigated the progress made\nin deep learning-based material discovery in recent years. We first introduce\nseveral data representations of the crystalline materials. Based on the\nrepresentations, we summarize various fundamental deep learning models and\ntheir tailored usages in material discovery tasks. We also point out the\nremaining challenges and propose several future directions. This review offers\ncomprehensive and valuable insights, and fosters progress in the intersection\nof artificial intelligence and material science.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
