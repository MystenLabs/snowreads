However, some of the generated images exhibit significant\nunrealistic artifacts, commonly known as \"hallucinations\". To address this\nissue, we trained various computer vision models on a dataset composed of 60%\nhuman-approved generated images and 40% experimental images to detect\nunrealistic images. The classified images were then reviewed and corrected by\nhuman experts, and subsequently used to further refine the classifiers in next\nrounds of training and inference. Our evaluations demonstrate the feasibility\nof generating high-fidelity, domain-specific images using a fine-tuned\ndiffusion model. We anticipate that generative AI will play a crucial role in\nenhancing data augmentation and driving the development of digital twins in\nscientific research facilities.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
