For these groups, we\nprove a generalization of the results of Laudenbach and\nBrendle-Broaddus-Putman, producing a $3$-manifold $M_{\\Gamma}$ whose mapping\nclass group surjects onto $\\text{Map}(\\Gamma)$ with kernel a compact abelian\ngroup of sphere twists so that the corresponding short exact sequence splits.\nAlong the way we obtain an induced faithful action of $\\text{Map}(\\Gamma)$ on\nthe sphere complex $\\mathcal{S}(M_{\\Gamma})$ of $M_{\\Gamma}$, which is the\nsimplicial complex whose simplices are isotopy classes of finite collections of\nspheres in $M_{\\Gamma}$ which are pairwise disjoint. When $\\Gamma$ has finite\nrank, we further show that the action of $\\text{Map}(\\Gamma)$ on a certain\nnatural subcomplex has elements with positive translation length, and also\nconsider a candidate for an Outer space of such a graph. As another\napplication, we prove that for many $\\Gamma$, $\\text{Map}(\\Gamma)$ is\nquasi-isometric to a particular subgraph of $\\mathcal{S}(M_{\\Gamma})$,\nfollowing Schaffer-Cohen. We also deduce analogs of the results of\nDomat-Hoganson-Kwak.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
