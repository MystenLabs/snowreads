In particular we show that if such a smooth\nfibration is equivariant with respect to a representation of a closed surface\ngroup, the representation is quasi-isometrically embedded, and even Anosov if\nthe pencils in the image contain only non-degenerate quadrics. We use this to\ncharacterize maximal representations among representations of a closed surface\ngroup into $\\text{Sp}(2n,\\mathbb{R})$ by the existence of an equivariant\ncontinuous fibration of the associated symmetric space, satisfying an\nadditional technical property. These fibrations extend to fibrations of the\nprojective structures associated to maximal representations by bases of pencils\nof quadrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
