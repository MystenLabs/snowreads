Whereas the presence\nof a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to\nquenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero\ntemperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial\nstate, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present.\nMoreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection\nof this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite\ntemperature phase diagram.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
