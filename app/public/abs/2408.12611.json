This task, however, is effort-,\nlabor-intensive and costly. In this paper, we address the problem of\nidentifying similarities, dissimilarities and discussion points using large\nlanguage models. In a design science research study, we work with one of the\norganizations which leads several workgroups in the 3GPP standard. Our goal is\nto understand how well the language models can support the standardization\nprocess in becoming more cost-efficient, faster and more reliable. Our results\nshow that generic models for text summarization correlate well with domain\nexpert's and delegate's assessments (Pearson correlation between 0.66 and\n0.98), but that there is a need for domain-specific models to provide better\ndiscussion materials for the standardization groups.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
