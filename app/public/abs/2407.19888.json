To address these challenges, we introduce\nYucca, an open-source AI framework available at\nhttps://github.com/Sllambias/yucca, designed specifically for medical imaging\napplications and built on PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning. Yucca features a\nthree-tiered architecture: Functional, Modules, and Pipeline, providing a\ncomprehensive and customizable solution. Evaluated across diverse tasks such as\ncerebral microbleeds detection, white matter hyperintensity segmentation, and\nhippocampus segmentation, Yucca achieves state-of-the-art results,\ndemonstrating its robustness and versatility. Yucca offers a powerful,\nflexible, and user-friendly platform for medical image analysis, inviting\ncommunity contributions to advance its capabilities and impact.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
