{"id":"2408.02344","title":"Machine Learning Applications in Medical Prognostics: A Comprehensive\n  Review","authors":"Michael Fascia","authorsParsed":[["Fascia","Michael",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2024 09:41:34 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-06","timestamp":1722850894000,"abstract":"  Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized medical prognostics by integrating\nadvanced algorithms with clinical data to enhance disease prediction, risk\nassessment, and patient outcome forecasting. This comprehensive review\ncritically examines the application of various ML techniques in medical\nprognostics, focusing on their efficacy, challenges, and future directions. The\nmethodologies discussed include Random Forest (RF) for sepsis prediction,\nlogistic regression for cardiovascular risk assessment, Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) for cancer detection, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nnetworks for predicting clinical deterioration. RF models demonstrate robust\nperformance in handling high-dimensional data and capturing non-linear\nrelationships, making them particularly effective for sepsis prediction.\nLogistic regression remains valuable for its interpretability and ease of use\nin cardiovascular risk assessment. CNNs have shown exceptional accuracy in\ncancer detection, leveraging their ability to learn complex visual patterns\nfrom medical imaging. LSTM networks excel in analyzing temporal data, providing\naccurate predictions of clinical deterioration. The review highlights the\nstrengths and limitations of each technique, the importance of model\ninterpretability, and the challenges of data quality and privacy. Future\nresearch directions include the integration of multi-modal data sources, the\napplication of transfer learning, and the development of continuous learning\nsystems. These advancements aim to enhance the predictive power and clinical\napplicability of ML models, ultimately improving patient outcomes in healthcare\nsettings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1kGJEFUuMKZrXBFtx1-AO9G4l8RUW1PDTbCBWvVAwjA","pdfSize":"227977"}
