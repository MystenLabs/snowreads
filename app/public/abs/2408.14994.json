Pomerantz Professor Emeritus of\nPhysics at the University of Delaware. Tom was one of the most prominent\nscientists in cosmic-ray and astroparticle physics, and also one of the\nfounding editors of this very journal. A theoretical particle physicist by\ntraining, he dedicated his career to cosmic-ray physics. He worked on the\nphenomenology of high-energy particle interactions in the atmosphere, modeling\nextensive air showers, including the famous 'Gaisser-Hillas' function\ndescribing their longitudinal profile. A focus of his work were muon and\nneutrino fluxes resulting from cosmic-ray showers in the atmosphere, and their\nmeasurement with specialized experiments at the South Pole.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
