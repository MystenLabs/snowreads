To prevent\nthe loss of these cues, we propose unifying these two stages into an end-to-end\nsolution that addresses the 2D-3D correspondence problem. This solution enables\nback-propagation from camera space outputs to the rest of the network through a\nnew differentiable global positioning module. We also introduce an image\nrectification step that harmonizes both the training dataset and the input\nimage as if they were acquired with the same camera, helping to alleviate the\ninherent scale-depth ambiguity of the problem. We validate the effectiveness of\nour framework in evaluations against several baselines and state-of-the-art\napproaches across three public benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i0zFj6fT79oK2_ok2Ac4kKSjp9SvAKG5K2W2cghRriI","pdfSize":"3272659","objectId":"0xe8ce565ed33553a0bccd2b329ac037eae6ed1f3e930dba026b92afa4e941a47e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
