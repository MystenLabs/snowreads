A common assumption is that the\nlandscape is rigid; however, in principle it can be altered by radiation\npressure, a concept that has found fruitful application in the field of quantum\noptomechanics. Here we explore active imaging of a mechanical resonator with an\neye to generalizing the concept of radiation pressure backaction to spatially\nmultimode light. As a thought experiment, we consider imaging the flexural\nmodes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its\nsurface. We show that backaction in this setting arises from spatial photon\nshot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We\nalso derive the imprecision-backaction product for coherent illumination in the\nlimit of purely spatial backaction, revealing it to be equivalent to the\nstandard quantum limit for purely dispersive, single-mode optomechanical\ncoupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatial\nbackaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light. In conjunction with\nhigh-$Q$ nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the\ninterface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks\nenhanced by spatial mode entanglement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
