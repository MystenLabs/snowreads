We apply it to transversely polarized\nlight vector meson production, $\\gamma^{*} p \\rightarrow V (\\rho, \\varphi\n,\\omega) \\; p$, which starts at the next-to-leading power and for which a\npurely collinear treatment leads to end-point singularities. The result is\nobtained in the most general kinematics, including both forward and non-forward\ncases by preserving the full impact parameter dependence in the\nnon-perturbative correlators, in both momentum and coordinate space\nrepresentations. A systematic expansion of the Wilson lines in terms of\nReggeized gluon fields is performed in order to obtain the results in the\nweak-field BFKL approximation. These new results will allow for investigating\nthe dilute-to-dense regime transition of QCD for a wide class of observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
