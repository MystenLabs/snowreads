This paper presents a study on the design and impedance\nmatching of long-range NFC coils, focusing on optimizing antenna performance\nover distances exceeding one meter. Through numerical analyses of various coil\ngeometries, including single-turn and multi-wire configurations, we explore the\neffects of coil size, wire separation, and current distribution on magnetic\nfield generation. Additionally, an adaptive impedance matching approach is\nproposed to maintain efficient power transfer, significantly improving field\nstrength and system performance. The proposed designs demonstrate superior\ninterrogation distances compared to existing configurations, highlighting the\npotential for enhanced long-range NFC applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
