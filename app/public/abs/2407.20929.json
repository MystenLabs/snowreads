In this\npaper, we aim to define an index allowing to discriminate between populations\nwhen the observations are functional data belonging to a Hilbert space. We\ndiscuss some of the problems arising when estimating optimal directions defined\nto maximize the area under the curve of a projection index and we construct the\ncorresponding ROC curve. We also go one step forward and consider the case of\npossibly different covariance operators, for which we recommend a quadratic\ndiscrimination rule. Consistency results are derived for both linear and\nquadratic indexes, under mild conditions. The results of our numerical\nexperiments allow to see the advantages of the quadratic rule when the\npopulations have different covariance operators. We also illustrate the\nconsidered methods on a real data set.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
