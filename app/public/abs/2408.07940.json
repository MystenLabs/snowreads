The equation derived is\na complex version of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, in which the\nnon-electrostatic interactions are transformed to complex random fields by the\nfield theory. Thus, the non-electrostatic interactions of the ions in the\ncharged liquids can be simulated easily by generating random numbers according\nto the random fields. To solve the equation, the finite element method has been\napplied. The non-electrostatic interactions treated in the equation are\ngeneral. In this study, we take the steric effect of ions as an example.\nResults show that the steric effect can be clearly caught by the equation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
