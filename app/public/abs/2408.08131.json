However, little is known about the extent to which financial fraud\nimpacts victims psychologically, how victims detect the fraud, which detection\nmethods are most efficient, and how the fraud detection and reporting processes\ncan be improved. To answer these questions, we conducted a 150-participant\nsurvey of debit/credit card fraud victims in the US. Our results show that\nsignificantly more participants reported that they were impacted\npsychologically than financially. However, we found no relationship between the\namount of direct financial loss and psychological impact, suggesting that\npeople are at risk of being psychologically impacted regardless of the amount\nlost to fraud. Despite the fact that bank or card issuer notifications were\nrelated to faster detection of fraud, more participants reported detecting the\nfraud after reviewing their card or account statements rather than from\nnotifications. This suggests that notifications may be underutilized. Finally,\nwe provide a set of recommendations distilled from victims' experiences to\nimprove the debit/credit card fraud detection and reporting processes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
