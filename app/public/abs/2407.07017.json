We calculate the photon sphere\nand shadow radii and, corroborating our results, we constrain them from\nobservational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), particularly\nfocusing on the shadow images of Sagittarius $A^{*}$. Additionally, we analyze\nthe greybody factors, emission rate, and partial absorption cross section. We\nalso examine the topological charge and its application to the deflection\nangle. Finally, we conduct the analysis of the heat capacity and phase\ntransitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
