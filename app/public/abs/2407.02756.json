The existing literatures have studied the\nKrylov complexity in the low temperature limit in quantum field theory. In this\npaper, we extend and systematically study the Krylov complexity and Krylov\nentropy in a scalar field theory with general temperatures. To this end, we\npropose a new method to calculate the Wightman power spectrum which allows us\nto compute the Lanczos coefficients and then to study the Krylov complexity\n(entropy) extensively. Compared to the previous studies in the low temperature\nlimit, we find that the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity (entropy) in\nthe high temperature limit will behave somewhat differently. Finally, we also\ndiscuss the Krylov complexity (entropy) in the symmetry breaking phase with the\nHiggs scalar field at finite temperatures.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yQU0cyajfDWWgs5yTb4-EdG3-TiWErbj7lOmyGMU9hg","pdfSize":"1216463","objectId":"0x3870361addf4bb05652748560141557bc47160ceb02131f1cc438686ed46b6be","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
