Our discussion focuses mostly on the case of a long-ranged\nmassless real scalar field.\n  Our results indicate that in this case, depending on the coupling constants,\nthe resonant hairy dyonic black holes may bifurcate from Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nblack holes at maximal chemical potential, while the limiting solutions at\nminimal chemical potential may be related to the Penney solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
