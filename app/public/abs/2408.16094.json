On-chain\ncomputations can be prohibitively expensive, making many CPU-intensive\ncomputations infeasible. Inspired by the structure of IBM's token ring\nnetworks, we propose a lightweight consensus protocol called Monadring to\naddress these issues. Monadring allows nodes within a large blockchain network\nto form smaller subnetworks, enabling faster and more cost-effective\ncomputations while maintaining the security guarantees of the main blockchain\nnetwork.\n  To further enhance Monadring's security, we introduce a node rotation\nmechanism based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and blind voting using\nFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) within the smaller subnetwork. Unlike the\ncommon voting-based election of validator nodes, Monadring leverages FHE to\nconceal voting information, eliminating the advantage of the last mover in the\nvoting process.\n  This paper details the design and implementation of the Monadring protocol\nand evaluates its performance and feasibility through simulation experiments.\nOur research contributes to enhancing the practical utility of blockchain\ntechnology in large-scale application scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
