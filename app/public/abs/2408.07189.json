We explore how\ndifferent compositions and patterns of terminal groups affect the stability and\nelectronic properties of these 2D materials. The bond dissociation energies and\ncohesion energies show a clear preference for F-terminations in Sc$_{2}$C,\nwhile Ti- and V-based MXenes prefer O-terminations. The data indicates that\nterminal groups on opposite sides of the MXene have little to no influence on\neach other's electronic structure, allowing for independent chemical\nenvironments on each side. Semiconducting forms of studied MXenes\n(Sc$_{2}$CF$_{2}$, Sc$_{2}$C(OH)$_{2}$ and Ti$_{2}$CO$_{2}$) showed very high\nsensitivity to conduction-inducing terminations (O, O, and F, respectively)\nwith even minuscule amounts ($\\approx$1%) causing the materials to become\nconductive. This high sensitivity of the band gap to surface terminations may\noffer an explanation for the challenges in synthesizing semiconducting forms of\nMXenes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
