In contrast to traditional\napproaches that often require specifications of underlying market dynamics or\nassumptions on an option pricing model, our models depart fundamentally from\nthe need for these prerequisites, directly learning non-trivial mappings from\nmarket data to optimal trading signals. Backtesting on more than a decade of\noption contracts for equities listed on the S&P 100, we demonstrate that deep\nlearning models trained according to our end-to-end approach exhibit\nsignificant improvements in risk-adjusted performance over existing rules-based\ntrading strategies. We find that incorporating turnover regularization into the\nmodels leads to further performance enhancements at prohibitively high levels\nof transaction costs.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
