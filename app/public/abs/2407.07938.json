We show that the quantum Hall\nbilayer at filling $\\nu=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{3}{4}$ with interlayer separation $d$\ncan be well-described in terms of these composite particles. At small $d$ the\nsystem can be understood as interlayer paired electrons and holes, whereas at\nlarge $d$ the system is best understood in terms of composite fermions with\nfour vortices attached to each electron. By computing the overlaps of trial\nwavefunctions with the ground state from exact diagonalization, we find that as\n$d$ increases, the number of vortices that attach to each electron increases.\nWe also construct trial states for two types of excitation, the Goldstone mode\nand a meron excitation. These two trial states have good overlaps with the\nlowest excited states in the exact diagonalization spectrum for small and\nintermediate $d$ respectively.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
