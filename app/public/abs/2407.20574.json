Both the nearest-neighbor exchange\ninteraction and the magnetic dipolar interactions are included in the model.\nThe model with only the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange interaction\nis known to show the layered 120 degree spin structure. On the other hand, the\nmodel with only the magnetic dipolar interactions is known to exhibit a\ncontinuous degeneracy expressed by six sublattice spin vectors, which is\nreduced by an order-by-disorder process with thermal fluctuations. In the\npresent study, other ordered states appear for various values of relative\nstrength of the two kinds of the interactions. A vortex spin structure on\nhexagonal lattice points in the kagomeplanes is a novel one. Another ordered\nstate may be glassy state in which apparent translational symmetry cannot be\nseen. Layered 120 degree spin structures but not uniform in the direction\nperpendicular to the kagome planes with various period in the direction appear\ndepending on the relative strength of the two kinds of the interactions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qWQmcG6PavLFlg5tMsLOhlaNP-O67TKsqZj_bPoaBRU","pdfSize":"1901509"}
