We introduce a new class of solutions where these two forms\nare equal, which we term the self-excited instantons, and advocate for their\nuse over the self-dual instantons of Eguchi and Hanson. These new self-excited\ninstantons exhibit striking similarities to BPST instantons in Yang-Mills\ntheory, as their action reduces to a topological Nieh-Yan term, which allows us\nto identify the axial torsion as a topological current and to define a\ntopological charge.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dblIbd8UDYhGSox67z1OkOjhZNU0mQ1LvLGBWKihrcs","pdfSize":"142235"}
