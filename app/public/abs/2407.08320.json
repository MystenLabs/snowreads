Specifically, in this new frame, known as the Einstein frame,\nBrans-Dicke gravity is reformulated as General Relativity supplemented by an\nadditional scalar field. In 1959, Hans Adolf Buchdahl utilized an elegant\ntechnique to derive a set of solutions for the vacuum field equations within\nthis gravitational framework. In this paper, we extend Buchdahl's method to\nincorporate the cosmological constant and to the scalar-tensor cases beyond the\nBrans-Dicke archetypal theory, thereby, with a conformal transformation of the\nmetric, obtaining solutions for a version of Brans-Dicke theory that includes a\nquadratic potential. More specifically, we obtain synchronous solutions in the\nfollowing contexts: in scalar-tensor gravity with massless scalar fields,\nBrans-Dicke theory with a quadratic potential, where we obtain specific\nsynchronous metrics to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, the Nariai solution,\nand a hyperbolically foliated solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
