However, growing privacy concerns have recently\nemerged as a major issue, prompting a shift towards LiDAR-based PDT as a viable\nalternative. Within this domain, \"Tracking-by-Detection\" (TBD) has become a\nprominent methodology. Despite its effectiveness, LiDAR-based PDT has not yet\nachieved the same level of performance as camera-based PDT. This paper examines\nkey components of the LiDAR-based PDT framework, including detection\npost-processing, data association, motion modeling, and lifecycle management.\nBuilding upon these insights, we introduce SpbTrack, a robust person tracker\ndesigned for diverse environments. Our method achieves superior performance on\nnoisy datasets and state-of-the-art results on KITTI Dataset benchmarks and\ncustom office indoor dataset among LiDAR-based trackers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
