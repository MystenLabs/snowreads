They can, under\nstrong assumptions, emulate RCTs or help refine their focus. Our approach to\ncausal inference uses causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We are motivated\nby a concern that many observational studies in medicine begin without a clear\ndefinition of their objectives, without awareness of the scientific potential,\nand without tools to identify the necessary in itinere adjustments. We present\nand illustrate methods that provide \"midway insights\" during study's course,\nidentify meaningful causal questions within the study's reach and point to the\nnecessary data base enhancements for these questions to be meaningfully\ntackled. The method hinges on concepts of identification and positivity.\nConcepts are illustrated through an analysis of data generated by patients with\naneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (aSAH) halfway through a study, focusing in\nparticular on the consequences of external ventricular drain (EVD) in strata of\nthe aSAH population. In addition, we propose a method for multicenter studies,\nto monitor the impact of changes in practice at an individual center's level,\nby leveraging principles of instrumental variable (IV) inference.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
