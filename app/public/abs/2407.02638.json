This conjecture has been confirmed on many small\npatterns, specifically all $P$ with weight at most 5, and all but two with\nweight 6.\n  The main result of this paper is a clean refutation of the Pach-Tardos\nconjecture. Specifically, we prove that $\\mathrm{Ex}(S_0,n),\\mathrm{Ex}(S_1,n)\n\\geq n2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$, where $S_0,S_1$ are the outstanding weight-6\npatterns. We also prove sharp bounds on the entire class of alternating\npatterns $(P_t)$, specifically that for every $t\\geq 2$,\n$\\mathrm{Ex}(P_t,n)=\\Theta(n(\\log n/\\log\\log n)^t)$. This is the first proof of\nan asymptotically sharp bound that is $\\omega(n\\log n)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
