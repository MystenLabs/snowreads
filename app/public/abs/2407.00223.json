The GAVRT Solar Patrol project uses a 34 m\ndiameter antenna to produce raster-scan maps of the Sun simultaneously at 4\nfrequencies ranging from approximately 3 GHz to 14 GHz. On 2024 May 14, as part\nof regular GAVRT Solar Patrol observations, raster maps were produced when an\nX8.7 solar flare occurred in active region AR13664. Here we present the GAVRT\nmaps of the May 14 flare along with microwave flux density spectra showing the\nnon-thermal microwave burst emission from mildly relativistic electrons\nproduced in this largest flare of Solar Cycle 25 to date. AR13664 reappeared as\nAR13697 and continued to be very active, producing X flares while GAVRT\nmonitored its activity. GAVRT microwave data provide a powerful complement to\nthe energetic electrons tracked by X-ray, millimeter-wave and {\\gamma}-ray\nemissions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ktmJXoXFXmy2_7hFiwXxkoYRk1ltP1u7hTz7tmfVhas","pdfSize":"300481","objectId":"0x2d69ca59be5f6f434669c48e4bf4c8288ef728ebfa5ff04c8d9829b3fc5bdd32","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
