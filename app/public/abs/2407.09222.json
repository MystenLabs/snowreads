We partially extend the super-critical weak well-posedness result for\nenergy solutions from [GP24] by allowing a mixture of the regularity regimes\ntreated therein: Outside of environments of a small (and compared to [GP24]\n''time-dependent'') set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}_+ \\times \\mathbb{R}^d$, the\nantisymmetric matrix field $A$ with $b^i = \\nabla\\cdot A_i$ is assumed to be in\na certain supercritical $L^q_T H^{s, p}$-type class that allows a direct link\nbetween the PDE and the SDE from a-priori estimates up to the stopping time of\nvisiting $K$. To establish this correspondence, and thus uniqueness, globally\nin time we then show that $K$ is actually never visited which requires us to\nimpose a relation between the dimension of $K$ and the H\\\"older regularity of\n$X$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
