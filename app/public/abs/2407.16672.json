The ever-expanding\nhorizons of the space exploration missions, and the need for establishing\nsustainable space communication and navigation infrastructure necessitate to\nthink this question thoroughly. In this article, we examine how some of the\nconcepts of 6G technologies developed for terrestrial networks can be relevant\nin the context of cislunar networks. We discuss how 6G concepts, such as\nreconfigurable intelligent surfaces, quantum-resistant physical layer security,\nprivate information read/write/cache networks, semantic and goal-oriented\ncommunications, information freshness based quality of communication metrics,\nmulti-relay and cooperative networks, hold the potential to shape the future of\ncislunar communications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
