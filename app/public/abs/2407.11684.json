Furthermore,\n$\\alpha$-SGHN preserves all conservation laws during trajectory prediction.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our model, incorporating structural\ninformation, outperforms baseline models based on conventional neural networks\nin predicting lattice systems. We anticipate that the results presented will be\napplicable beyond the specific onsite and inter-site interaction lattices\nstudied, including the Frenkel-Kontorova model, the rotator lattice, and the\nToda lattice.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
