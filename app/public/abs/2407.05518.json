Existing\nstate-of-the-art trackers in computer vision integrate sophisticated\narchitectures, attention mechanisms, and multi-modal fusion to enhance tracking\naccuracy across diverse environments. However, the challenges posed by\nsatellite imagery, such as background variations, atmospheric disturbances, and\nlow-resolution object delineation, significantly impede the precision and\nreliability of traditional Single Object Tracking (SOT) techniques. Our study\ndelves into these challenges and proposes prompt engineering methodologies,\nleveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and TAPIR (Tracking Any Point with\nper-frame Initialization and temporal Refinement), to create a training-free\npoint-based tracking method for small-scale objects on satellite videos.\nExperiments on the VISO dataset validate our strategy, marking a significant\nadvancement in robust tracking solutions tailored for satellite imagery in\nremote sensing applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
