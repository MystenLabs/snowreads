In this paper, we firstly proposed a zero-discord criterion\nfor two-qubit system based on the partial transposition of density matrix, and\nthen extended it to the qubit-qudit system. By detailed examples we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of these criteria in detecting discord. Moreover, we provide\nan analytical lower bound of geometric quantum discord(GQD) using eigenvalue\nvectors of density matrix. Finally, we presented a one-way work deficit lower\nbound based on our lower bound of GQD.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-mbzj09wKfqEh0sf7jSLK5Ynzn3uTfZdnq7yiaS3ifs","pdfSize":"181145"}
