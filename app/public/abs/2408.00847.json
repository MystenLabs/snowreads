By focusing on new physics\nin the muon-electron sector, we show that CP violation can make its first\nappearance in lepton flavor violating muon decays rather than in the electric\ndipole moment of the electron, further motivating the experimental program of\nMu3e. We tackle this issue by performing the full one-loop running and matching\nfrom the low energy observables at the muon scale, including the T-odd\nasymmetry in $\\mu\\to3e$ decays, to the Standard Model effective field theory\nabove the electroweak scale. We then sketch a simple UV model that can give\nrise to these patterns.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
