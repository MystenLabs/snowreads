Leveraging this analogy, we\nconduct pole analysis on the total correlation functions in the two-replica\nsystem where the inter-replica field will eventually be switched off. By\nsynthesizing discussions grounded in the pole analysis with a hierarchical view\nof the free-energy landscape, we derive an analytical form of the mean overlap\nbetween two replicas within the mean field approximation of the Gaussian core\nmodel. This formula elucidates novel numerical findings observed in the cluster\nglass phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XcMTw5F9ttwzL_QS366juH_9f8eaBNul6bBJK66o8l4","pdfSize":"1858189"}
