We find a sub-linear dependence of the SFR on L$_{\\rm IR}$. Below\n$\\log(\\hbox{L}_{\\rm IR}/\\hbox{L}_\\odot)\\simeq 10$ or $\\hbox{SFR}\\simeq\n1\\,\\hbox{M}_\\odot\\,\\hbox{yr}^{-1}$, the SFR/L$_{\\rm IR}$ ratio substantially\nexceeds the standard ratio for dust-enshrouded star formation, and the\ndifference increases with decreasing L$_{\\rm IR}$ values. This implies that the\neffect of unobscured star formation overcomes that of dust heating by old\nstars, at variance with results based on the $\\textit{Planck}$ ERCSC galaxy\nsample. We also find that the relations between the L$_{\\rm CO}$ and L$_{\\rm\nIR}$ or the SFR are consistent with those obtained at much higher luminosities.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
