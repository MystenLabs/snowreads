{"id":"2407.19896","title":"Meson-nucleus bound states in quark meson coupling model","authors":"Arpita Mondal and Amruta Mishra","authorsParsed":[["Mondal","Arpita",""],["Mishra","Amruta",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2024 11:18:58 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-30","timestamp":1722251938000,"abstract":"  The formations of the $K(\\bar{K})$, $D(\\bar{D})$, and $B(\\bar{B})$\nmeson-nucleus bound states in $^{16}O$, $^{40}Ca$, $^{90}Zr$, $^{197}Au$, and\n$^{208}Pb$ nucleus are investigated using the quark meson coupling model. The\nmodel relies on a mean field description of non-overlapping nucleon bags bound\nby the self-consistent interactions of scalar ($\\sigma$, $\\delta$) and vector\n($\\omega$, $\\rho$) mesons with the (anti)quarks inside the bags, which is\nfurther extended to explore the properties of nuclei. We estimate the\nmeson-nucleus bound state energies by solving the Klein-Gordon equations with\nthe real potentials calculated self-consistently within the model, using a\ncoordinate space approach. The calculations are carried out for different\nnuclear interactions. The effects of Coulomb interaction are considered in the\npresent study for the charged mesons. Our study indicates the formation of\nrather deeply bound $B$-mesic states at the very central region of the nuclei,\ncompared to the $D$ and $K$ mesons, offering a more promising probe to explore\nsubtle nuclear medium effects. The investigations of such bound states are of\nparticular interest for the upcoming $\\rm{\\bar{P}ANDA}$ at FAIR, J-PARC-E29 and\nJLab experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
