In the present paper, we complete the calculation by working out all\nremaining three-loop diagrams (of order $\\alpha_s^2$) associated with the\ncurrent-current operators $O_1$ and $O_2$ at the physical value of the\ncharm-quark mass $m_c$. Using the programs AMFlow and DiffExp to solve the\ndifferential equations for the master integrals, we obtained precise numerical\nresults at 23 values for $z=m_c^2/m_b^2$, ranging from $z=1/1000$ to $z=1/5$,\nalong with asymptotic expansions around $z=0$. For certain diagrams, the\nasymptotic expansion breaks down in the physical $z$-range, necessitating a\nTaylor expansion (which we do around $z=1/10$). In all expansions, we retained\npower terms up to $z^{20}$ and included the accompanying $\\log(z)$ terms to all\npowers for asymptotic expansions. Numerical results for the sum of all diagrams\n(including those calculated in the previous paper) are presented in tabular\nform, while the mentioned expansions of individual diagram classes are provided\nelectronically. We note that our results for the asymptotic expansions around\n$z=0$ are in good agreement with those recently published by Fael et al. and\nCzaja et al..\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
