This has hindered systematic investigations into\nthe effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer for this important NLP application.\nTo address this gap, we introduce ANHALTEN, a new evaluation dataset that\nextends the English hallucination detection dataset to German. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first work that explores cross-lingual transfer for\ntoken-level reference-free hallucination detection. ANHALTEN contains gold\nannotations in German that are parallel (i.e., directly comparable to the\noriginal English instances). We benchmark several prominent cross-lingual\ntransfer approaches, demonstrating that larger context length leads to better\nhallucination detection in German, even without succeeding context.\nImportantly, we show that the sample-efficient few-shot transfer is the most\neffective approach in most setups. This highlights the practical benefits of\nminimal annotation effort in the target language for reference-free\nhallucination detection. Aiming to catalyze future research on cross-lingual\ntoken-level reference-free hallucination detection, we make ANHALTEN publicly\navailable: https://github.com/janekh24/anhalten\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"SPryziDc7KAU12GgwOxJ9DbvlQtWuZrX-MRW87ymIGc","pdfSize":"262219"}
