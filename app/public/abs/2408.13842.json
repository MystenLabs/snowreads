We assess the quality of\nstellar velocity dispersion measurements from DESI spectroscopic data. These\nmeasurements, along with photometric data from the Legacy Survey, establish the\nFundamental Plane relation and determine distances and peculiar velocities of\nearly-type galaxies. During Survey Validation, we obtain spectra for 6698\nunique early-type galaxies, up to a photometric redshift of 0.15. 64\\% of\nobserved galaxies (4267) have relative velocity dispersion errors below 10\\%.\nThis percentage increases to 75\\% if we restrict our sample to galaxies with\nspectroscopic redshifts below 0.1. We use the measured central velocity\ndispersion, along with photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, to fit\nthe Fundamental Plane parameters using a 3D Gaussian maximum likelihood\nalgorithm that accounts for measurement uncertainties and selection cuts. In\naddition, we conduct zero-point calibration using the absolute distance\nmeasurements to the Coma cluster, leading to a value of the Hubble constant,\n$H_0 = 76.05 \\pm 0.35$(statistical) $\\pm 0.49$(systematic FP) $\\pm\n4.86$(statistical due to calibration) $\\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. This\n$H_0$ value is within $2\\sigma$ of Planck Cosmic Microwave Background results\nand within $1\\sigma$, of other low redshift distance indicator-based\nmeasurements.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
