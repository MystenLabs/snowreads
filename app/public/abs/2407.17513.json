In this paper, we introduce a GLCT based on chirp\nmultiplication-chirp convolution-chirp multiplication decomposition\n(CM-CC-CM-GLCT), which irrelevant to sampling periods and without oversampling\noperation. Various properties and special cases of the CM-CC-CM-GLCT are\nderived and discussed. In terms of computational complexity, additivity, and\nreversibility, we compare the CM-CC-CM-GLCT and the GLCT based on the central\ndiscrete dilated Hermite function (CDDHFs-GLCT). Theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates that the computational complexity of the CM-CC-CM-GLCT is\nsignificantly reduced. Simulation results indicate that the CM-CC-CM-GLCT\nachieves similar additivity to the CDDHFs-GLCT. Notably, the CM-CC-CM-GLCT\nexhibits better reversibility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
