First, we present the solution to the\nelectro-hydrodynamic equation for the electro-osmotic velocity profile, which\nis derived for an ionic system composed of cations immersed in uncharged\nsolvent particles. The system (solution and walls) is kept electrically neutral\nusing negatively charged walls and will here be referred to as a\n\"counterion-only\" system. The theory predicts the existence of a counterion\nconcentration that results in a maximum electro-osmotic flow rate, but only if\nthe wall-fluid friction, or equivalently the slip length, is correlated with\nthe system electrostatic screening length. Through equilibrium molecular\ndynamics simulations we precisely determine the hydrodynamic slip from the\nwall-fluid friction, and this is then used as input to the theoretical\npredictions. Comparison between the theory and independent non-equilibrium\nmolecular dynamics simulation data confirms the existence of the maximum. Also,\nwe find that standard hydrodynamic theory quantitatively agrees with simulation\nresults for charged nanoscale systems for sufficiently small charge densities\nand ion charges, if the correct slip boundaries are applied.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
