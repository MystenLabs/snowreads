The\nquasi-single helicity state has a dominant helical component of the magnetic\nfield that is known to improve the RFP confinement. For the initial\nparamagnetic pinch, linear calculations indicate that the tearing mode growth\nrate decreases with the plasma $\\beta$. The initial QSH state arises from the\ndominant linear instability of the initial force-free paramagnetic pinch. The\nplasma's self-organization towards the second QSH state after the relaxation of\nthe initial QSH state is found to depend on $\\beta$. Specifically, when\n$\\beta<4\\%$, the plasma relaxes to an MH state; when $4\\% \\leq \\beta \\leq 8\\%$,\nthe plasma first transitions from a double axis (DAx) to a single helical axis\n(SHAx) state, and eventually return to the DAx state. The existence of such an\noptimal $\\beta$ regime that is beneficial to the formation and maintenance of\nthe QSH state, suggests an experimental scheme for the QSH formation based on\n$\\beta$ tuning and control.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
