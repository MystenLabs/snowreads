Physical\ngroup-contribution (GC) methods are widely employed for this purpose but suffer\nfrom historically grown, incomplete parameterizations, limiting their\napplicability and accuracy. In this work, we overcome these limitations by\ncombining GC with matrix completion methods (MCM) from machine learning. We use\nthe novel approach to predict a complete set of pair-interaction parameters for\nthe most successful GC method: UNIFAC, the workhorse for predicting activity\ncoefficients in liquid mixtures. The resulting new method, UNIFAC 2.0, is\ntrained and validated on more than 224,000 experimental data points, showcasing\nsignificantly enhanced prediction accuracy (e.g., nearly halving the mean\nsquared error) and increased scope by eliminating gaps in the original model's\nparameter table. Moreover, the generic nature of the approach facilitates\nupdating the method with new data or tailoring it to specific applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
