Some properties are pointing out such that\ntranslation homotheticity and others ones allowing to consider the case of\ndiscrete production sets that are related to some specific dual forms. Along\nthis line a general class of mathematical programs are derived and it is shown\nthat they can be computed using standard methods. The proposed approach allows\nto deal with efficiency measures (output oriented or input oriented) on\ncontinuous and discrete data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X-TP5SfUICfJtiLZHoPf67yJ2uH2QAYCiGXw9o7AhVI","pdfSize":"441189"}
