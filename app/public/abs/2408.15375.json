We obtain energy inequalities, or upper\nbounds, lower bounds on energy in a number of specific cases, including\nparameter spaces of Gaussians and spaces of configurations of points. We\ndiscuss the role of time as well as graph embeddings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
