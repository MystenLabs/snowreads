It not only has a\nsegregation coefficient close to 1, which can achieve highly efficient and\nuniform doping of Th, but also ensures a high transmittance (~69% at 150 nm)\nwhile achieving extremely high doping concentration (232Th>6*10^20 cm^(-3). In\naddition, SrF2 crystal will not be irradiated-colored under strong {\\alpha}\nradiation like CaF2 crystal, Th:SrF2 crystal is expected to fully unleash its\nhigh concentration doping characteristics while ensuring its transmission\nperformance in nuclear transition band not be severely affected by 229Th\nradiation damage.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
