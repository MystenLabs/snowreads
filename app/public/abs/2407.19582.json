Laser induced graphitisation results in a\nconductive amorphous carbon surface, rich in oxygen and nitrogen terminations.\nThis results in an electrode with a high specific capacitance of 182 uF/cm2, a\nwide water window of 3.25 V, and a low electrochemical impedance of 129\nOhms/cm2 at 1 kHz. The electrodes surface exhibited a good level of\nbiocompatibility with hMSCs, supporting cell adhesion and proliferation. The\ncells cultured on the electrode displayed significant elongation and alignment\nalong the direction of the laser patterned microgrooves. Because of its\nfavourable electrochemical performance and biocompatibility, the\nlaser-patterned diamond electrodes create a potential for a versatile platform\nin stem cell therapeutics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
