A simple example is a\ndimer scaffold, upon which two monomers meet and create another dimer, while\ndimers and larger aggregates undergo in irreversible aggregation with\nmass-independent rates. In the mean-field approximation, templating aggregation\nhas unusual kinetics in which the cluster and monomer densities, $c(t)$ and\n$m(t)$ respectively, decay with time as $c\\sim m^2\\sim t^{-2/3}$. These starkly\ncontrast to the corresponding behaviors in conventional aggregation, $c\\sim\n\\sqrt{m}\\sim t^{-1}$. We then treat three natural extensions of templating: (a)\nthe reaction in which $L$ monomers meet and react on an $L$-mer scaffold to\ncreate two $L$-mers, (b) multistage scaffold reactions, and (c) templated\nligation, in which clusters of all masses serve as scaffolds and binary\naggregation is absent.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
