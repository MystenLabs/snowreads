To support the exploration of these sites, we\npresent ReachBot, a robot that uses extendable booms as appendages to\nmanipulate itself with respect to irregular rock surfaces. The booms terminate\nin grippers equipped with microspines and provide ReachBot with a large\nworkspace, allowing it to achieve force closure in enclosed spaces such as the\nwalls of a lava tube. To propel ReachBot, we present a contact-before-motion\nplanner for non-gaited legged locomotion that utilizes internal force control,\nsimilar to a multi-fingered hand, to keep its long, slender booms in tension.\nMotion planning also depends on finding and executing secure grips on rock\nfeatures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to inform gripper design and predict\ngrasp strength and variability. Additionally, we use a two-step perception\nsystem to identify possible grasp locations. To validate our approach and\nmechanisms under realistic conditions, we deployed a single ReachBot arm and\ngripper in a lava tube in the Mojave Desert. The field test confirmed that\nReachBot will find many targets for secure grasps with the proposed kinematic\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
