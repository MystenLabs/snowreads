However, the proximate mechanisms\nunderlying this adaptive behavior are largely unknown. In this study, we\nanalyze how three Goffin's cockatoos learn to solve a specific mechanical\npuzzle, a lockbox. The observed behavior results from the interaction between a\ncomplex environment (the lockbox) and different processes that jointly govern\nthe animals' behavior. We thus jointly analyze the parrots' (1) engagement, (2)\nsensorimotor skill learning, and (3) action selection. We find that neither of\nthese aspects could solely explain the animals' behavioral adaptation and that\na plausible model of proximate mechanisms (including adaptation) should thus\nalso jointly address these aspects. We accompany this analysis with a\ndiscussion of methods that may be used to identify such mechanisms. A major\npoint we want to make is, that it is implausible to reliably identify a\ndetailed model from the limited data of one or a few studies. Instead, we\nadvocate for a more coarse approach that first establishes constraints on\nproximate mechanisms before specific, detailed models are formulated. We\nexercise this idea on the data we present in this study.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
