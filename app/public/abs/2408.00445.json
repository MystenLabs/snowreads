Bending sliding ferroelectrics inevitably leads to interlayer sliding\nmotion, thus altering stacking orders and polarization properties. Here, by\nusing machine-learning force field, we investigate the effects of bending\ndeformation on geometries, stackings, energies, and polarizations in sliding\nferroelectric bilayer h-BN and 3R-MoS2. We predict that bent ferroelectric\nbilayer forms irreversible kinks instead of arc when the bending angle exceeds\na critical value. We demonstrate that the kinks originate from the competition\nbetween bending energy and interlayer van der Waals energy. The kink contains a\nferroelectric domain wall that reverses the polarization, effectively inducing\na flexoelectric effect. We term this phenomenon \"sliding flexoelectricity\" to\ndistinguish it from conventional strain-gradient-induced flexoelectricity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
