We model the\ninteractions between individuals in an internally consistent manner via a game\ntheoretic approach based on discrete Bayesian games. This introduces a\nsubstantial computational burden in estimation which we address through a\nsequential version of the nested fixed point algorithm. We also provide some\nrelevant treatment effects, and procedures for their estimation, which capture\nthe impact on both the individual and the total sample. Our empirical\napplication examines the impact of an individual's exercise frequency on her\nlevel of self-esteem. We find that an individual's exercise frequency is\ninfluenced by her expectation of her friends'. We also find that an\nindividual's level of self-esteem is affected by her level of exercise and, at\nrelatively lower levels of self-esteem, by the expectation of her friends'\nself-esteem.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
