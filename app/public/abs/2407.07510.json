The attack is stealthy because the\nstripes on the traffic sign are invisible to human. For the attack to be\nthreatening, the recognition results need to be stable over consecutive image\nframes. To achieve this, we design and implement GhostStripe, an attack system\nthat controls the timing of the modulated light emission to adapt to camera\noperations and victim vehicle movements. Evaluated on real testbeds,\nGhostStripe can stably spoof the traffic sign recognition results for up to\n94\\% of frames to a wrong class when the victim vehicle passes the road\nsection. In reality, such attack effect may fool victim vehicles into\nlife-threatening incidents. We discuss the countermeasures at the levels of\ncamera sensor, perception model, and autonomous driving system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
