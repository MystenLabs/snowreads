By a $\\mathsf{Q}$-map\nwe mean a left adjoint in the quantaloid of sets and $\\mathsf{Q}$-relations,\nand by a partial $\\mathsf{Q}$-map we refer to a Kleisli morphism with respect\nto the maybe monad on the category $\\mathsf{Q}\\text{-}\\mathbf{Map}$ of sets and\n$\\mathsf{Q}$-maps. It is shown that every $\\mathsf{Q}$-map is symmetric if and\nonly if $\\mathsf{Q}$ is weakly lean, and that every $\\mathsf{Q}$-map is exactly\na map in $\\mathbf{Set}$ if and only $\\mathsf{Q}$ is lean. Moreover, assuming\nthe axiom of choice, it is shown that the category of sets and partial\n$\\mathsf{Q}$-maps is monadic over $\\mathsf{Q}\\text{-}\\mathbf{Map}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
