Traditional\nmethods struggle with the diversity and heterogeneity of cells within tissues.\nTo address this, we introduce the Spatial Interaction Potential (SIP) and the\nCo-Localization Index (CLI), leveraging deep learning classification\nprobabilities. SIP assesses the potential for cell-to-cell interactions,\nsimilar to an electric field, while CLI incorporates distances between cells,\naccounting for dynamic cell movements. Our approach enhances traditional\nmethods, providing a more sophisticated analysis of cellular interactions. We\nvalidate SIP and CLI through simulations and apply them to colorectal cancer\nspecimens, demonstrating strong correlations with actual biological data. This\ninnovative method offers significant improvements in understanding cellular\ninteractions and has potential applications in various fields of digital\npathology.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
