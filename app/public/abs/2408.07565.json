In fact, usually, basins of attraction\nboundaries are composed of unstable solutions and their stable manifolds. This\nstudy proposes a method for estimating unstable limit cycles surrounding stable\nequilibrium points. The method exploits the shape of the decrement of\ntrajectories converging towards the equilibrium. For the method, trajectories\nobtained from small perturbations from the equilibrium state are sufficient to\nestimate the unstable limit cycle roughly. No mathematical model of the system\ndynamics is needed for the computation, which requires only a single trajectory\nin the phase space. As such, the method is computationally very rapid and\npotentially implementable in real structures.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
