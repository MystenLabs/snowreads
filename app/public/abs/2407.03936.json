In this paper, we propose a novel way\nof formulating this general optimization problem, which we call factorized\nbinary polynomial optimization. In this formulation, we assume that the\nvariables are partitioned into a fixed number of sets, and that the objective\nfunction is written as a sum of r products of linear functions, each one\ninvolving only variables in one set of the partition. Our main result is an\nalgorithm that solves factorized binary polynomial optimization in strongly\npolynomial time, when r is fixed. This result provides a vast new class of\ntractable instances of binary polynomial optimization, and it even improves on\nthe state-of-the-art for quadratic objective functions, both in terms of\ngenerality and running time. We demonstrate the applicability of our result\nthrough the binary tensor factorization problem, which arises in mining\ndiscrete patterns in data, and that contains as a special case the rank-1\nBoolean tensor factorization problem. Our main result implies that these\nproblems can be solved in strongly polynomial time, if the input tensor has\nfixed rank, and a rank factorization is given. For the rank-1 Boolean matrix\nfactorization problem, we only require that the input matrix has fixed rank.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
