We present an automated mapping and optimization framework for\nmolecular simulation (AMOFMS), which is designed to streamline and improve the\nforce field optimization process. It features a neural-network-based mapping\nfunction, DSGPM-TP (Deep Supervised Graph Partitioning Model with Type\nPrediction). This model can accurately and efficiently convert atomistic\nstructures to CG mappings, reducing the need for manual intervention. By\nintegrating bottom-up and top-down methodologies, AMOFMS allows users to freely\ncombine these approaches or use them independently as optimization targets.\nMoreover, users can select and combine different optimizers to meet their\nspecific mission. With its parallel optimizer, AMOFMS significantly accelerates\nthe optimization process, reducing the time required to achieve optimal\nresults. Successful applications of AMOFMS include parameter optimizations for\nsystems such as POPC and PEO, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.\nOverall, AMOFMS provides a general and flexible framework for the automated\ndevelopment of high-precision CG force fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V01_6iq1Y3xv9teEGWFDpt31vUeFHKOoKNCwRjbBPYI","pdfSize":"4170664"}
