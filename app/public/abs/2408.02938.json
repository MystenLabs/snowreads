The ability of DRL agents to learn from experience and utilize\nreal-time data for making decisions makes it an ideal candidate for dealing\nwith the complexities associated with the problem of workflow scheduling in\nhighly dynamic cloud and edge computing environments. Despite the benefits of\nDRL, there are multiple challenges associated with the application of DRL\ntechniques including multi-objectivity, curse of dimensionality, partial\nobservability and multi-agent coordination. In this paper, we comprehensively\nanalyze the challenges and opportunities associated with the design and\nimplementation of DRL oriented solutions for workflow scheduling in cloud and\nedge computing environments. Based on the identified characteristics, we\npropose a taxonomy of workflow scheduling with DRL. We map reviewed works with\nrespect to the taxonomy to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Based on\ntaxonomy driven analysis, we propose novel future research directions for the\nfield.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"APKbP226zspSh0xadMNyt80ZY5BNfHL4ZHGBNJhgPOw","pdfSize":"757934"}
