These processes\nare studied for energies of the incident beams in the range 18-30 MeV, in order\nto have a sufficient energy to produce such a boson, whose mass is estimated to\nbe around 17 MeV. We first analyze them as a purely electromagnetic processes,\nin the context of a state-of-the-art approach to nuclear strong-interaction\ndynamics and nuclear electromagnetic currents, derived from chiral effective\nfield theory chiEFT. Next, we examine how the exchange of a hypothetical\nlow-mass boson would impact the cross sections for such processes. We consider\nseveral possibilities, that this boson is either a scalar, pseudoscalar,\nvector, or axial particle. The main aim of the study is to exploit the specular\nstructure of the 3He and 3H nuclei to investigate the isospin dependency of the\nX17-nucleon interaction, as the alleged \"proto-phobicity\".\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
