Here, we\nre-evaluate the overspinning and overcharging problems incorporating the self\nenergy of the perturbations due to the induced increase in the angular velocity\nand the electrostatic potential of the event horizon described in a seminal\nwork by Will. We show that Kerr-Sen black holes cannot be overspun or\novercharged by perturbations satisfying the null energy condition in a complete\nsecond order analysis which comprises the self-energy of the perturbations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
