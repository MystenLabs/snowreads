Despite the absence of a weakly curved black hole\ndual, the two point function decomposes into a sum over a discrete set of\nquasinormal modes. To compute the spectrum of modes, we analytically solve the\nSchwinger-Dyson equations to a high order in perturbation theory, and then\nnumerically fit to a sum of exponentials using a technique analogous to the\ndouble cone construction. The resulting spectrum has a tree-like structure\nwhich is reminiscent of AdS black holes with curvature singularities. We\npresent a simple toy model of stringy black holes that qualitatively reproduces\nsome aspects of this structure.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
