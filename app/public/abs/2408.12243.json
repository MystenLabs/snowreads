We find that the steady state exhibits a sharp transition as a\nfunction of the pumping strength, between fully depopulated and fully populated\nstates. We devise a metrological protocol for measuring system parameters by\nscanning the pumping around the critical point, finding that the sensitivity\nscales as 1/N , thus beating the standard quantum limit thanks to the buildup\nof correlations. Crucially, our theoretical analysis, verified numerically,\ngoes beyond the adiabatic regime of an infinite scan time: we study\nnon-equilibrium relaxation dynamics around the transition and their effect on\nthe sensitivity, revealing that the favorable 1/N scaling survives well beyond\nadiabaticity. Apart from its direct impact on metrology with superradiant\natomic systems, our general analysis provides new perspectives for studying the\nmetrological utility of dissipative phase transitions in realistic finite-time\nprotocols.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
