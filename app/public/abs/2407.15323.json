However, a microscopic theory to\nexplain these experimental results is still lacking. Here, we develop an\neffective medium theory that incorporates the effects of contact damping. The\ntheory explains experimentally observed viscoelastic properties, particularly\nattributing the anomalous viscous loss to marginal stability in amorphous\nsystems. This work establishes a microscopic theory for describing the impact\nof damping on soft jammed solids and their viscoelastic behaviors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
