In this study, we propose a generalized\nentropic uncertainty relation for arbitrary multiple-observable in multipartite\nsystem, and further derive a tighter lower bound by considering Holevo quality\nand mutual information. Importantly, we detailedly discuss the proposed\nuncertainty relations and quantum coherence in the context of Schwarzschild\nspace-time. It is interesting to find that Hawking radiation will damage the\ncoherence of the physically accessible region and increase the uncertainty.\nFurthermore, we argue that the properties of the uncertainty in Schwarzschild\nspace-time can be explained from the systems' purity and the information\nredistribution of the different regions. Therefore, it is believed that our\nfindings provide the generalized entropic uncertainty relations in multipartite\nsystems, which may facilitate us deeper understanding of quantumness and\ninformation paradox of the black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
