The underlying BIE method used is based on a hybrid\nNystr\\\"{o}m-collocation method using Chebyshev polynomials. It is well known\nthat such an approach produces a dense linear system, which requires $O(N^2)$\noperations in each step of an iterative solver. In this work, we propose an\napproach using the recently introduced Interpolated Factored Green's Function\n(IFGF) acceleration strategy to reduce the cost of each iteration to $O(N\\log\nN)$. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first ever\napplication of the IFGF method to fully-vectorial 3D Maxwell problems. The\nChebyshev-based integral solver and IFGF method are first introduced, followed\nby the extension of the scalar IFGF to the vectorial Maxwell case. Several\nexamples are presented verifying the $O(N\\log N)$ computational complexity of\nthe approach, including scattering from spheres, complex CAD models, and\nnanophotonic waveguiding devices. In one particular example with more than 6\nmillion unknowns, the accelerated IFGF solver runs 42x faster than the\nunaccelerated method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
