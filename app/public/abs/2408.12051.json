They\nall extend to the Cuntz algebra $\\mathcal{O}$ and conversely all\nrepresentations of $\\mathcal{O}$ are of this form. Via this approach we\nintroduce a tensor product for a large class of representations of\n$F,T,V,\\mathcal{O}$. We prove that a sub-category forms a tensor category and\nperform a number of explicit computations of fusion rules.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
