This\nfamily is called the star centered at $x$. In this paper, we formulate and\nprove an EKR theorem for intersecting families of subgraphs of the perfect\nmatching graph, the graph consisting of $n$ disjoint edges. This can be\nconsidered a generalization not only of the aforementioned EKR theorem but also\nof a signed variant of it, first stated by Meyer (1974), and proved separately\nby Deza--Frankl (1983) and Bollob\\'as--Leader (1997). The proof of our main\ntheorem relies on a novel extension of Katona's beautiful cycle method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
