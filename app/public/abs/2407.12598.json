In practice, not\nall trajectory data corresponding to the population estimated by epidemic\nmodels can be obtained, and some observed trajectories are noisy. Learning\nPINNs to estimate unknown epidemiological parameters using such partial\nobservations is challenging. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic\nobservability into PINNs. The validity of the proposed PINN, named as an\nalgebraically observable PINNs, in terms of estimation parameters and\nprediction of unobserved variables, is demonstrated through numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
