We\nprove the limit exists and characterize the leading order via planar graphs\nthat result to be trees. We prove these graphs can be counted by the set of\nnon-crossing partitioned permutations which permit us to express the moments\n$\\alpha_{m_1,\\dots,m_r}$ in terms of simpler quantities\n$\\overline{\\kappa}_{m_1,\\dots,m_r}$ which we call the pseudo-cumulants. We\nprove the pseudo-cumulants coincide with the higher order free cumulants up to\n$r=4$ which permit us to find the higher order free cumulants\n$\\kappa_{m_1,\\dots,m_r}$ associated to the moment sequence\n$\\alpha_{m_1,\\dots,m_r}$ up to order 4.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MITRv0BpjhCj9j__9O1Ijm8t5ZqwKlLLHgF7-DEqKoU","pdfSize":"4005079"}
