We first propose that a reliable\nevaluation method should not uncritically rely on model preferences for\npairwise evaluation, but rather assess the confidence of judge models and\nselectively decide when to trust its judgement. We then show that under this\nselective evaluation framework, human agreement can be provably guaranteed --\nsuch that the model evaluation aligns with that of humans to a user-specified\nagreement level. As part of our framework, we also introduce Simulated\nAnnotators, a novel confidence estimation method that significantly improves\njudge calibration and thus enables high coverage of evaluated instances.\nFinally, we propose Cascaded Selective Evaluation, where we use cheaper models\nas initial judges and escalate to stronger models only when necessary -- again,\nwhile still providing a provable guarantee of human agreement. Experimental\nresults show that Cascaded Selective Evaluation guarantees strong alignment\nwith humans, far beyond what LLM judges could achieve without selective\nevaluation. For example, on a subset of Chatbot Arena where GPT-4 almost never\nachieves 80% human agreement, our method, even while employing substantially\ncost-effective models such as Mistral-7B, guarantees over 80% human agreement\nwith almost 80% test coverage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FgS2D-u0ANQ5nLE5W-leoZKX9qbrrlyS3YckhJD8VXo","pdfSize":"2021535","objectId":"0x2f8d13682016df1c4a55d7a055b0ba3026e83a99af59b993ced5fd173aa76b3f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
