By digitizing data throughout the product life\ncycle, Digital Twins (DTs) in ICPSs enable a shift from current industrial\ninfrastructures to intelligent and adaptive infrastructures. Thanks to data\nprocess capability, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) can drive the\nconstruction and update of DTs to improve predictive accuracy and prepare for\ndiverse smart manufacturing. However, mechanisms that leverage sensing\nIndustrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices to share data for the construction\nof DTs are susceptible to adverse selection problems. In this paper, we first\ndevelop a GAI-driven DT architecture for ICPSs. To address the adverse\nselection problem caused by information asymmetry, we propose a contract theory\nmodel and develop the sustainable diffusion-based soft actor-critic algorithm\nto identify the optimal feasible contract. Specifically, we leverage the\ndynamic structured pruning technique to reduce parameter numbers of actor\nnetworks, allowing sustainability and efficient implementation of the proposed\nalgorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed scheme.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
