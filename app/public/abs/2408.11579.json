To facilitate improving the theory, we critically test\nthe approximations inherent in MCT for a supercooled mixture using Brownian\ndynamics simulations. Although each MCT approximation significantly impacts the\npredicted dynamics, our findings show that long-time cancellations of errors\noccur due to static and dynamic approximations of four-point correlation\nfunctions, with the validity of these approximations remaining relatively\nconstant across different temperatures. Notably, the MCT form of the memory\nfunctional maintains remarkably high accuracy even in the supercooled regime\nwhen evaluated with the intermediate scattering function from simulations. The\nprimary discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results\narise from the self-consistent nature of the MCT equations, which amplify minor\nerrors in the memory kernel. This suggests that minor corrections to the memory\nfunctional could substantially enhance the theory's predictive accuracy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
