In this work, we construct\nexplicit LCPs of codes and LCD codes from function fields of genus $g \\geq 1$.\nTo accomplish this, we present pairs of suitable divisors giving rise to\nnon-special divisors of degree $g-1$ in the function field. The results are\napplied in constructing LCPs of algebraic geometry codes and LCD algebraic\ngeometry (AG) codes in Kummer extensions, hyperelliptic function fields, and\nelliptic curves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
