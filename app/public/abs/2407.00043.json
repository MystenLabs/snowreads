Experimentally, we use various glass plates, registering each reflected\nand transmitted outcome. Thus, we find the condition to form a common pattern,\nnamely, randomly scratched plates produce the halos. We engineer other optical\npatterns by means of the specular holography method. Using the Defocusing\nMicroscopy technique, we study the geometric properties of the glass,\nestablishing the physical and mathematical model for a simulation. Our\ncomputational results agree well with the experimental ones, leading us to\nconclude that the pattern formation is governed by specular reflection on\nvarious points along the scratches. Our findings give an initial explanation\nfor the pattern formation on glass, in particular for the halo design.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
