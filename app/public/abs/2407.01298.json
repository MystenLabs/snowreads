These truncations may involve either\nfinite or infinite sets of modes. We provide their global description using\nexceptional generalised geometry to construct a `deformed' generalised\nparallelisation starting with that on $\\mathbb{M}$. This allows us to\nexplicitly embed known consistent truncations directly into exceptional\ngeneralised geometry/exceptional field theory, and to obtain the equations\ngoverning situations where the consistent truncation retains an infinite tower\nof modes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
