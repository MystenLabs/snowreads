We theoretically\nand experimentally demonstrate that the PB phase can emerge in surface sound\nwaves (SSWs) carrying transverse spin. The phase differs for the SSWs\npropagating in opposite directions due to spin-momentum locking. We further\nrealize acoustic PB metasurfaces for nearly arbitrary wavefront manipulation.\nOur work provides the missing piece of acoustic geometric phases, offering new\ninsights into the fundamental properties of sound waves and opening a new\navenue for sound manipulation based on the PB phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
