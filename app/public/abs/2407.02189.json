We treat separately the case of $J$-invariant nilradical and non\n$J$-invariant nilradical. A classification of such SKT Lie algebras in\ndimension six is provided. In particular, we give a general construction to\nextend SKT nilpotent Lie algebras to SKT solvable Lie algebras of higher\ndimension, and we construct new examples of SKT and generalized K\\\"ahler\ncompact solvmanifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZHyfPdtprS51wXPi6a4gzS38EeD3rhoKScaUcs3qevg","pdfSize":"365169"}
