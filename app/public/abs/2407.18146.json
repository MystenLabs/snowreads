However, significant advances in sensor technology (e.g., higher\nresolution, multiple spectrums beyond visible light) in combination with\nchallenging channel characteristics lead to a communication bottleneck when\ntransmitting the collected data to Earth. Recently, joint source coding,\nchannel coding, and modulation based on neuronal networks has been proposed to\ncombine image compression and communication. Though this approach achieves\npromising results when applied to standard terrestrial channel models, it\nremains an open question whether it is suitable for the more complicated and\nquickly varying satellite communication channel. In this paper, we consider a\ndetailed satellite channel model accounting for different shadowing conditions\nand train an encoder-decoder architecture with realistic Sentinel-2 satellite\nimagery. In addition, to reduce the overhead associated with applying multiple\nneural networks for various channel states, we leverage attention modules and\ntrain a single adaptable neural network that covers a wide range of different\nchannel conditions. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach\nachieves similar performance when compared to less space-efficient schemes that\nutilize separate neuronal networks for differing channel conditions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
