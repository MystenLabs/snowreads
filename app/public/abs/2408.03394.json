However, the complexity of the system,\nsuch as non-convex and non-differentiable cost functions and prolonged planning\nhorizons often drastically increases the computation time, limiting MPC's\nreal-world applicability. Prior works in speeding up the optimization have\nlimitations on solving convex problem and generalizing to hold out domains. To\novercome this challenge, we develop a novel framework aiming at expediting\noptimization processes. In our framework, we combine offline self-supervised\nlearning and online fine-tuning through reinforcement learning to improve the\ncontrol performance and reduce optimization time. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on a novel, challenging Formula-1-track driving\ntask, achieving 3.9\\% higher performance in optimization time and 3.6\\% higher\nperformance in tracking accuracy on challenging holdout tracks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
