These are basically the\nlocations where ligands bind with proteins. Actual detection of such locations\nis all-important to succeed in the entire drug design process. This study\nproposes a Voronoi Tessellation based novel cavity detection model that is used\nto detect cavities on the structure of proteins. As the atom space of protein\nstructure is dense and of large volumes and the DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial\nClustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm can handle such type of data\nvery well as well as it is not mandatory to have knowledge about the numbers of\nclusters (cavities) in data as priori in this algorithm, this study proposes to\nimplement the proposed algorithm with the DBSCAN algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
