For each equilibrium, assuming that the $H^2$ norm of the\ninitial data $(f_0,B_0,U_0)$ is sufficient small and $f_0(x,v)$ has a compact\nsupport in the position $x$ and the velocity $v$, we construct the global\nwell-posedness and decay rates of strong solutions near the equilibrium in the\nwhole space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. And the solution decays polynomially. The global\nexistence result still holds for the torus $\\mathbb{T}^3$ case without the\ncompact support assumption in $x$. In addition, the decay rates are\nexponential. Lack of dissipation structure in the Vlasov equation and the\nstrong trilinear coupling term $((u-v)\\times B)f$ in the model are two main\nimpediments in obtaining our results. To surround these difficulties, we assume\nthat $f_0(x,v)$ has a compact support and utilize the method of characteristics\nto calculate the size of the supports of $f$. Thus, we overcome the difficulty\nin estimating the integration $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\big((u-v)\\times\nB\\big)f\\mathrm{d}v$ and obtain the global existence of strong solutions by\ntaking advantage of a refined energy method. Moreover, by making full use of\nthe Fourier techniques, we obtain the optimal time decay rate of the gradient\nof the solutions. This is the first result on strong solutions to the\nVlasov-MHD model containing nonlinear Lorentz forces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pPeRBcP5s-pd59TSiXm7dXci68_SCCHX3icE6TwF2E4","pdfSize":"380331"}
