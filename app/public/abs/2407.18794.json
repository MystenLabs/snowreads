It is shown that the inclusion of a relevant\ntwo-derivative term in the action significantly modifies some of the results\nobtained by neglecting this operator, and the final picture is substantially\ndifferent from the one describing the phase diagram associated with the\ntwo-dimensional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The study is\ncarried out with the help of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow equations,\ndetermined for a set of three parameters, and numerically solved both for a\ntruncated series expansion approximation, and for the complete set of\nequations. In both cases, a continuous line of fixed points, terminating at a\nparticular point presenting universal properties, is found, together with a\nmanifold that separates two phases, roughly characterized by the sign of the\ncoupling $\\widetilde z_k$ associated with this newly included operator. While\nthe phase corresponding to $\\widetilde z_k>0$ shows some pathologies, the one\nwith $\\widetilde z_k<0$ has a well-behaved infrared limit, where the system\nreduces to a Gaussian-like model. We also briefly comment about the possibility\nthat our model could capture some of the qualitative features of the\nultraviolet (UV) critical manifold of conformally reduced gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Y4XDXAdiFaQVHQAWoyy4vWr-gkj9AstIWycfx1EaTRo","pdfSize":"7494434"}
