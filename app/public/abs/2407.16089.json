Given extensive literature both in theory and\napplications of classic wavelet frames, it is legitimate to ask about the\nfeasibility of building empirical wavelet frames. We address this question in\nthis paper. We prove several results which provide conditions on the existence\nof empirical wavelet frames taking into account the above mentioned\nadaptability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iXnc1wMh1YXd3GpKrkCk7yHD8TM2XwfexZG2B3Nrrn8","pdfSize":"658214","objectId":"0x7ec30cfc7d3fbc5c99216eddb0e61c2c8b097d00a409bcfcf36b21b616537450","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
