The\nfirst two ($\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $q_\\mu$) emerge due to the inclusion of the\nantisymmetric part in the energy-momentum tensor, which, in turn, governs the\nconservation of spin angular momentum ($\\Sigma^{\\alpha\\mu\\nu}$). As a result,\nnew thermodynamic forces, generated due to the antisymmetric part of $T_{\\mu\n\\nu}$, contains the spin chemical potential. In this work, we have also taken\nthe spin density ($S^{\\mu \\nu}$) as an independent thermodynamic variable, in\naddition to the energy density and particle density, thereby resulting in an\nadditional transport coefficient given by the correlation between $S^{\\mu \\nu}$\nand $\\tau^{\\mu \\nu}$. The newly found terms in $\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $\\Pi$ are the\nartifacts of the new thermodynamic forces that arise due to the antisymmetric\npart of $T^{\\mu \\nu}$. Finally we have derived the evolution equations for the\naforesaid tensors - $\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$, $q_\\mu$, $\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$, and $\\Pi$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
