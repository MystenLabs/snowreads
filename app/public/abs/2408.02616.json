Motivated by our results we conjecture a\nformula for the perverse Hodge numbers of the compactified Jacobian fibration\nof linar systems on Enriques surfaces in terms of its Betti numbers. This leads\nto an asymptotic for said Hodge numbers and raises questions about the\nbehaviour of the extremal Hodge numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
