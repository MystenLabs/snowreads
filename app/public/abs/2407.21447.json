We begin by proving Hecke equivariance of the divisor lifting with\nrespect to sesquiharmonic Mass functions, which maps an integral weight\nmeromorphic modular form to the holomorphic part of the Fourier expansion of a\nweight 2 sesquiharmonic Maass form. Using this Hecke equivariance, we show that\nthe sesquiharmonic Maass functions, whose images under the hyperbolic Laplace\noperator are the Faber polynomials $J_n$ of the $j$-function, form a Hecke\nsystem analogous to $J_n$. By combining the Hecke equivariance of the divisor\nlifting with that of the Borcherds isomorphism, we extend Matsusaka's finding\non the twisted traces of sesquiharmonic Maass functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
