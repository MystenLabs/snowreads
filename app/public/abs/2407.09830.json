The convergence of the\nregularized integrals is shown with an improved version of iterative\nintegration by parts that generates additional decaying factors and hence leads\nto better integrability properties. The general abstract results are then\napplied to the Cauchy problem for the one dimensional time dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, where the solution is expressed for C^n-regular initial\nconditions with polynomial growth at infinity via the Green's function as an\noscillatory integral.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
