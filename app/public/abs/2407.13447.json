We are interested in finding the HEE of a bath (system-B) in contact\nwith a central subsystem-A. We assume that the net size of systems A and B\ntogether remains fixed while allowing variation in individual sizes. This\nassumption is simply guided by the conservation laws. It is found that for\nlarge bath size the island entropy term are important. However other subleading\n(icebergs) terms do also contribute to bath entropy. The contributions are\ngenerally not separable from each other and all such contributions add together\nto give rise a fixed quantity. Further when accounted properly all such\ncontributions will form part of higher entropy branch for the bath.\nNevertheless the HEE of bath system should be subjected to minimality\nprinciple. The quantum minimality principle $ S_{quantum}[B]=\\{S[A],\nS_{total}+S[A]\\}_{min}$, is local in nature and gives rise to the Page curve.\nIt is shown that the changes in bath entropy do capture Kaluza-Klein\ndiscreteness. The minimality principle would be applicable in finite\ntemperature systems as well.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T0NJ4eNVImJyq-414NcdarprNhRdJpAnRiTLTaR4APY","pdfSize":"428297","objectId":"0xfc8276203fc16b603ed2c72125e24bdec01b5676d35d558df97fa8edcd367f5f","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
