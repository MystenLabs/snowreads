We developed simulations of the response of accretion discs\nto events of enhanced mass transfer, in the context of the MTIM, and applied\nthem to model the light curve and variations in the radius of the EX Dra disc\nthroughout the outburst. We obtain the first modeling of a dwarf nova outburst\nby using $\\chi^2$ to select, from a grid of simulations, the best-fit\nparameters to the observed EX Dra outbursts. The observed time evolution of the\nsystem brightness and the changes in the radius of the outer disc along the\noutburst cycle are satisfactorily reproduced by a model of the response of an\naccretion disc with a viscosity parameter $\\alpha = 4.0$ and a quiescent mass\ntransfer rate $\\dot{M}_2 (\\textrm{quiescence}) = 4.0 \\times 10^{16}$ g/s to an\nevent of width $\\Delta t = 6.0 \\times 10^5$ s ($\\sim 7$ d) where the\nmass-transfer rate increases to $\\dot{M}_2 (\\textrm{outburst}) = 1.5 \\times\n10^{18}$ g/s.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
