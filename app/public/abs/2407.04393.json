However, the\ndetails of the Hamiltonian function surface obtained by factorization machine\n(FM) have been overlooked. This study shows that in the widely common case\nwhere real numbers are represented by a combination of binary variables, the\nfunction surface of the Hamiltonian obtained by FM can be very noisy. This\nnoise interferes with the inherent capabilities of quantum annealing and is\nlikely to be a substantial cause of problems previously considered unsolvable\ndue to the limitations of FMQA performance. The origin of the noise is\nidentified and a simple, general method is proposed to prevent its occurrence.\nThe generalization performance of the proposed method and its ability to solve\npractical problems is demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
