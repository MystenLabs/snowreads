Yet a comprehensive scientific explanation\nof the variability of the 1 keV feature has remained largely elusive. In this\npaper, we explain for the first time the origin and variability of the 1 keV\nfeature in XRBs using the spectral synthesis code \\textsc{Cloudy}. We\nconstructed line blends for the emission and absorption lines and study the\nvariability of these blends with ionization parameters, temperature, and column\ndensity. We conducted a sample study involving five XRBs including two\nultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs): NGC 247 ULX-1, NGC 1313 X-1, a binary X-ray\npulsar: Hercules X-1, and two typical low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs): Cygnus\nX-2, and Serpens X-1, providing a comprehensive explanation of the 1 keV\nfeature observed across these targets.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
