A polycube layer is the section\nof the polycube that lies between two horizontal cross-sections of the polycube\nat unit distance from each other. An edge unfolding of a polycube involves\ncutting its surface along any of the constituent cube edges and flattening it\ninto a single, non-overlapping planar piece. We show that any polycube with\northogonally convex layers can be edge unfolded.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
