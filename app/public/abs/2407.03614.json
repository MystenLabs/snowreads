The origin of these scaling relations still\ncontains significant ambiguities and requires comprehensive exploration for\ncomplete understanding. Utilising the correlation between the concentration and\nmass of dark matter haloes inferred from cosmological $N$-body simulations\nbased on the cold dark matter paradigm ($c$-$M$ relation), we derive\ntheoretical scaling relations among other physical quantities such as the\nsurface mass density, the maximum circular velocity, and the scale radius of\nthe dark matter halo. By comparing theoretical and observed scaling relations\nat various mass scales, it is found that the scaling relations observed in\ndwarf galaxies and galaxies originate in the $c$-$M$ relation of the dark\nmatter halo. We predict that this theoretical scaling relation is also\nestablished in galaxy clusters. Moreover, we propose a novel theoretical\nscaling relation that incorporates the effects of the cusp-to-core transition,\nwhich is supposed to occur in cold dark matter haloes. Our discussion concludes\nwith the exploration of potential observational verification of the\ncusp-to-core transition process in dark matter haloes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
