Here, we present one of the first studies\nexamining the relative orientations between magnetic ($B$) fields and the dust\nemission, gas column density, and velocity centroid gradients on the 0.02 pc\n(core) scales, using the BISTRO and VLA+GBT observations of the NGC 1333\nstar-forming clump. We quantified these relative orientations using the Project\nRayleigh Statistic (PRS) and found preferential global parallel alignment\nbetween the $B$ field and dust emission gradients, consistent with large-scale\nstudies with Planck. No preferential global alignments, however, are found\nbetween the $B$ field and velocity gradients. Local PRS calculated for\nsubregions defined by either dust emission or velocity coherence further\nrevealed that the $B$ field does not preferentially align with dust emission\ngradients in most emission-defined subregions, except in the warmest ones. The\nvelocity-coherent structures, on the other hand, also showed no preferred $B$\nfield alignments with velocity gradients, except for one potentially\nbubble-compressed region. Interestingly, the velocity gradient magnitude in NGC\n1333 ubiquitously features prominent ripple-like structures that are indicative\nof magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Finally, we found $B$ field alignments with\nthe emission gradients to correlate with dust temperature and anticorrelate\nwith column density, velocity dispersion, and velocity gradient magnitude. The\nlatter two anticorrelations suggest that alignments between gas structures and\n$B$ fields can be perturbed by physical processes that elevate velocity\ndispersion and velocity gradients, such as infall, accretions, and MHD waves.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
