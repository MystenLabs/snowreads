We analyse the\nbehaviour of the method under the depolarizing channel and derive an estimator\nfor the depolarization rate in terms of the ancilla purity and postselection\nprobability. We also highlight the sensitivity of this probability to noise, a\npotential bottleneck for the technique. We subsequently consider a more general\nnoise channel consisting of arbitrary Pauli errors, which reveals a linear\nrelationship between the error rates and the estimation of expectation values,\nsuggesting the learnability of noise in EV by regression techniques. Finally,\nwe present a practical demonstration of Echo Verified Clifford Data Regression\n(EVCDR) on a superconducting quantum computer and observe accurate results for\nthe time evolution of an Ising model over a spin-lattice consisting of up to 35\nsites and circuit depths in excess of 1,000.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
