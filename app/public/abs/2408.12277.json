Consequently, it\nprovides a powerful tool for data-driven analysis, prediction, and control of\nnonlinear dynamical (control) systems. In this work, we propose a novel\nmodularized EDMD scheme tailored to interconnected systems. To this end, we\nutilize the structure of the Koopman generator that allows to learn the\ndynamics of subsystems individually and thus alleviates the curse of\ndimensionality by considering observable functions on smaller state spaces.\nMoreover, our approach canonically enables transfer learning if a system\nencompasses multiple copies of a model as well as efficient adaption to\ntopology changes without retraining. We provide finite-data bounds on the\nestimation error using tools from graph theory. The efficacy of the method is\nillustrated by means of various numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RwfcnooYIyZKt8ZPnwh3_Bzlcw5aTw_k0FQz-dA9rpI","pdfSize":"1030661"}
