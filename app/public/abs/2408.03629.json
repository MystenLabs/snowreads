AUDFs covers\n$\\sim 236$ arcmin$^{2}$ of the sky area, including the Great Observatories\nOrigins Deep Survey (GOODS) South field in F154W and N242W filters. The deep\nand shallow parts of AUDFs have exposure time $\\sim 62000$ and $\\sim31000$ sec\nrespectively, in the F154W filter, while in the N242W filter, they are $\\sim\n64000$ and $\\sim34000$ sec. These observations reached a $3\\sigma$ depth of\n27.2 and 27.7 AB mag with a $50\\%$ completeness limit of 27 and 27.6 AB mag in\nthe F154W and N242W filters, respectively. With the acquired depth, AUDFs is\nthe deepest far and near-UV imaging data covering the largest area known to\ndate at 1.2\" - 1.6\" spatial resolution. Two primary catalogs were constructed\nfor the F154W and N242W filters, each containing 13495 and 19374 sources\nbrighter than the 3$\\sigma$ detection limit, respectively. Our galaxy counts\npower-law slope $\\sim0.43$~dex~mag$^{-1}$ in the N242W filter matches well with\nHST/WFC3/UVIS observations.\n  A wide range of extra-galactic science can be achieved with this unique data,\nsuch as providing a sample of galaxies emitting ionizing photons in the\nredshift range $z \\sim 1 - 3$ and beyond; constraining the UV luminosity\nfunction, investigating the extended-UV (XUV) emission around star-forming\ngalaxies and UV morphologies for $z < 1$. The UV catalog will enhance the\nlegacy value of the existing optical/IR imaging and spectroscopic observations\nfrom ground and space-based telescopes on the GOODS South field.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JOL6dI5_GaBUjNR4am5LdRxnxf9w85zjaT4kAYu-wSU","pdfSize":"8730978"}
