This\nderivation encompasses fluctuations via both non-magnetic $4f^0$ and magnetic\n$4f^2$ virtual states, and its accuracy is confirmed through comparison with\nexperimental data obtained from CeIn$_3$. The significant agreement observed\nbetween experimental results and theoretical predictions underscores the\npotential of deriving minimal models from first-principles calculations for\nachieving a quantitative description of $4f$ materials. Moreover, our\nmicroscopic derivation unveils the underlying origin of anisotropy in the\nexchange interaction between Kramers doublets, shedding light on the conditions\nunder which this anisotropy may be weak compared to the isotropic contribution.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c4MK0CB2crsoroRVixl7lRAF94d0AFHx93tSju59vt0","pdfSize":"1269949"}
