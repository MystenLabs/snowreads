However, it can be difficult to effectively\nimplement on platforms that leverage spoken language due to distinct biomarkers\npresent in the human voice. In this work, we explore the use of voice\nanonymization methods within the context of a technology-enhanced civic\ndialogue network based in the United States, whose purpose is to increase\nfeelings of agency and being heard within civic processes. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the use of two different speech transformation and synthesis\nmethods for anonymization: voice conversion (VC) and text-to-speech (TTS).\nThrough a series of two studies, we examine the impact that each method has on\n1) the empathy and trust that listeners feel towards a person sharing a\npersonal story, and 2) a speaker's own perception of being heard, finding that\nvoice conversion is an especially suitable method for our purposes. Our\nfindings open up interesting potential research directions related to anonymous\nspoken discourse, as well as additional ways of engaging with voice-based civic\ntechnologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sfOJfSZPNXffux0TlDaBDS1K4UdbI6GhW9zn6Pb2ZUE","pdfSize":"1796956"}
