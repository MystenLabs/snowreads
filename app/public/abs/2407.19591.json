The two cell populations phase\nseparate over time. While phase separation strengthens monotonically with an\nincreasing magnitude of contractile activity, the dependence on extensile\nactivity is non-monotonic, so that sufficiently high values reduce the extent\nof sorting. We interpret this by showing that extensile activity renders the\nsystem motile, enabling cells to undergo neighbour exchanges. Contractile cells\nthat come into contact as a result are then more likely to stay connected due\nto an effective attraction arising from contractile activity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
