Weakening it, is however less harmless and has been payed attention\nby some authors. Affine continuous logic is the fragment of continuous logic\nobtained by avoiding the connectives $\\wedge,\\vee$. This reduction leads to the\naffinization of most basic tools and technics of continuous logic such as the\nultraproduct construction, compactness theorem, type, saturation etc. The\naffine variant of the ultraproduct construction is the ultramean construction\nwhere ultrafilters are replaced with maximal finitely additive probability\nmeasures. A consequence of this relaxation is that compact structures with at\nleast two elements have now proper elementary extensions. In particular, they\nhave non-categorical theories in the new setting. Thus, a model theoretic\nframework for study of such structures is provided. A more remarkable aspect of\nthis logic is that the type spaces are compact convex sets. The extreme types\nthen play a crucial role in the study of affine theories. In this text, we\npresent the foundations of affine continuous model theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
