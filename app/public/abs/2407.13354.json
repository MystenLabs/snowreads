Despite the vast amount of experimental efforts, the phase diagram\nthat includes ZIF-4 and its related polymorphs has not yet been fully\ndetermined. For example, the crystalline phase called ZIF-4-cp is not\nexperimentally observed when high pressure ramps are applied. Our simulations\nshed light into the phase diagram topology and allow us to further look into\nthe collective degrees of freedom that drive the phase transitions in the\nT=150-450 K and P=0-200 MPa region. The porous ZIF-4 phase transforms into\nZIF-4-cp through pore closure, while the latter has a phase transition at\nhigher pressures regimes to ZIF-4-cp-II, a transformation which involves subtle\nchanges in swing dihedral angles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RFQecuLy448vvwyCPP4-fI-g1amBfDE7RD6mqM-4TmU","pdfSize":"6782388","objectId":"0x8b4419ae4f83df9475778a4a124777871a04c2300d1910cae80b6a050b8a6b63","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
