Despite being a widely known and accepted\nresult for the standard $\\pi$-calculus, this assertion has never been\nrigorously proven, formally or informally. Hence, its validity may not be\nimmediately apparent when considering extensions of the $\\pi$-calculus.\nContributing to the second challenge of the Concurrent Calculi Formalization\nBenchmark -- a set of challenges tackling the main issues related to the\nmechanization of concurrent systems -- we present a formalization of this\nresult for the fragment of the $\\pi$-calculus examined in the Benchmark. Our\nformalization is implemented in Beluga and draws inspiration from the HOAS\nformalization of the LTS semantics popularized by Honsell et al. In passing, we\nintroduce a couple of useful encoding techniques for handling telescopes and\nlexicographic induction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
