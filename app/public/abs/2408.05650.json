The proof is based on an iterative\nscheme which can be considered as a local (in the energy and the phase) and\nconvergent version of KAM-type diagonalization, whose result is a covariant\nfamily of uniformly localized eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We also proof that\nthe spectra of such operators contain infinitely many gaps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
