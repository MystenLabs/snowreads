Their low luminosity, however, makes determining abundance\ndistributions of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the water snowline\nchallenging. However, the excitation conditions sampled by differing molecular\ndistributions may produce substantive changes in the resulting emission. Thus,\nmolecular excitation may recover spatial information from spatially unresolved\ndata. By analyzing spatially-unresolved NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array\n(NOEMA) observations of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN, we aim to determine if CH$_3$OH\nand CH$_3$CN are distributed differently in the protostellar disk around\nHOPS-370, a highly-luminous intermediate mass protostar. Rotational diagram\nanalysis of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN yields rotational temperatures of $198 \\pm\n1.2$ K and $448 \\pm 19$ K, respectively, suggesting the two molecules have\ndifferent spatial distributions. Source-specific 3D LTE radiative transfer\nmodels are used to constrain the spatial distribution of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN\nwithin the disk. A uniform distribution with an abundance of $4\\times10^{-8}$\nreproduces the CH$_3$OH observations. In contrast, the spatial distribution of\nCH$_3$CN needs to be either more compact (within $\\sim120$ au versus $\\sim240$\nau for CH$_3$OH) or exhibiting a factor of $\\gtrsim 15$ increase in abundance\nin the inner $\\sim55$ au. A possible explanation for the difference in spatial\nabundance distributions of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN is carbon-grain sublimation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZFapgIC2V0PYPshcmy6-tYeYvNRdeQ2mxB2b_9I54qY","pdfSize":"6320269"}
