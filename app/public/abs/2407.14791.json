Non-minimal coupling is introduced via an additional\nterm $\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g} \\mathcal{G}({\\cal L}_{m}) f_2(R)$ in the\nEinstein-Hilbert action. To obtain observational constraints, we use an\nexponential-type fluid-pressure profile $p = p_0e^{ak}$ characterized by the\ndimensionless parameter $k$ and parameterize $f_2(R)$ as $R^n$ with another\ndimensionless parameter $n$. Two additional parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in\nthe functional form of $\\mathcal{G}({\\cal L}_{m})$ determine the coupling\nstrength. We identify significant regions in the $(n, k)$-parameter space for\nfixed coupling strength values where non-minimally coupled models align with\nobserved late-time cosmic evolution. Additionally, we explore and discuss\nfeatures of energy transfer between the curvature and matter sectors using\nobservational data.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
