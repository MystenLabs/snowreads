An archetypal example of such a quantum phase\nof matter is the Haldane phase, containing the spin-1 Heisenberg chain. The\nintrinsic quantum nature of such phases, however, often makes it challenging to\nstudy them using classical means. Here, we use trapped-ion qutrits to natively\nengineer spin-1 chains within the Haldane phase. Using a scalable,\ndeterministic procedure to prepare the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state\nwithin the Haldane phase, we study the topological features of this system on a\nqudit quantum processor. Notably, we verify the long-range string order of the\nstate, despite its short-range correlations, and observe spin fractionalization\nof the physical spin-1 particles into effective qubits at the chain edges, a\ndefining feature of this system. The native realization of Haldane physics on a\nqudit quantum processor and the scalable preparation procedures open the door\nto the efficient exploration of a wide range of systems beyond spin-1/2\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
