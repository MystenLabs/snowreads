In specific, we propose three frequency shift keying\n(FSK) based backscatter modulation schemes to shift the primary signal, i.e.,\nthe OFDM symbols transmitted from a base station (BS), in the frequency domain\nto transmit its information. Symbiotically, the BS empties specific subcarriers\nwithin the band so that the received frequency-shifted signals from the\nbackscatter device and the primary signal are always orthogonal. The first\nscheme relies on the combination of on-off keying (OOK) within the FSK\nmodulation while the second and the third schemes are based on the conventional\nFSK modulation with different in-band null-subcarrier allocation. These schemes\nallow the use of non-coherent detection at the receiver which addresses the\nchannel estimation challenge for the signals arriving from a backscatter\ndevice. We derive the bit-error rate performance of the detector theoretically.\nThe comprehensive simulations show that the proposed approach achieves a lower\nbit-error rate up to 10-4 at 30 dB with BC by eliminating direct link\ninterference.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
