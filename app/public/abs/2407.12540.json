In the present work\nwe extend the Patankar-type approach to linear multistep methods and prove that\nthe resulting discretizations retain, with no restrictions on the step size,\nthe positivity of the solution and the linear invariant of the continuous-time\nsystem. Moreover, we provide results on arbitrarily high order of convergence\nand we introduce an embedding technique for the Patankar weight denominators to\nachieve it.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
