{"id":"2407.15696","title":"History of confluent Vandermonde matrices and inverting them algorithms","authors":"Jerzy S Respondek","authorsParsed":[["Respondek","Jerzy S",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2024 15:01:48 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-23","timestamp":1721660508000,"abstract":"  The author was encouraged to write this review by numerous enquiries from\nresearchers all over the world, who needed a ready-to-use algorithm for the\ninversion of confluent Vandermonde matrices which works in quadratic time for\nany values of the parameters allowed by the definition, including the case of\nlarge root multiplicities of the characteristic polynomial. Article gives the\nhistory of the title special matrix since 1891 and surveys algorithms for\nsolving linear systems with the title class matrix and inverting it. In\nparticular, it presents, also by example, a numerical algorithm which does not\nuse symbolic computations and is ready to be implemented in a general-purpose\nprogramming language or in a specific mathematical package.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
