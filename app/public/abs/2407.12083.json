We\npresent a protocol that constrains quantum states by experimentally measured\ncorrelation functions which only scales polynomially with system size. This\nmethod enables measurement of a quantum state's entanglement structure, opening\na new route to study entanglement-related phenomena. Our approach extends\nGaussian state parameterizations by systematically incorporating higher-order\ncorrelations. We show the protocol's usefulness in conjunction with current and\nforthcoming experimental capabilities, focusing on weakly interacting fermions\nas a proof of concept. Here, the lowest non-trivial expansion quantitatively\npredicts early time thermalization dynamics, including signaling the on-set of\nquantum chaos indicated by the entanglement Hamiltonian.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
