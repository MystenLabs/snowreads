Based on the Dual-minus partial order, we introduce the Dual-minus\nsharp partial order and the Dual-minus star partial order, which are also\nDual-minus-type partial orders. In addition, we discuss relationships among the\nDual-minus sharp partial order, the D-sharp partial order and the G-sharp\npartial order(the Dual-minus star partial order, the D-star partial order and\nthe P-star partial order).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
