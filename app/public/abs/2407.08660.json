In the leading order,\nthe BK equation is conformally invariant and the eigenfunctions of the\nlinearized BFKL equation are powers. It is a common belief that at $d\\neq 4$\nthe BFKL equation is useless since unlike $d=4$ case it cannot be solved by\nusual methods. However, we demonstrate that at critical Wilson-Fisher point of\nQCD the relevant part of NLO BK restores the conformal invariance so the\nsolutions are again powers. As a check of our approach to high-energy\namplitudes at the Wilson-Fisher point, we calculate the anomalous dimensions of\ntwist-2 light-ray operators in the Regge limit $j\\rightarrow 1$.}\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
