Spanning Tree-based\nGraph Generation (STGG) is a promising approach to ensure the generation of\nvalid molecules, outperforming state-of-the-art SMILES and graph diffusion\nmodels for unconditional generation. In the real world, we want to be able to\ngenerate molecules conditional on one or multiple desired properties rather\nthan unconditionally. Thus, in this work, we extend STGG to\nmulti-property-conditional generation. Our approach, STGG+, incorporates a\nmodern Transformer architecture, random masking of properties during training\n(enabling conditioning on any subset of properties and classifier-free\nguidance), an auxiliary property-prediction loss (allowing the model to\nself-criticize molecules and select the best ones), and other improvements. We\nshow that STGG+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution conditional generation, and reward maximization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
