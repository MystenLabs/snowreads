To facilitate this process, the\nProcedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) framework has\nrecently been effectively used to improve the balance of existing game levels.\nThis approach, however, only assesses balance heuristically, neglecting actual\nhuman perception. For this reason, this work presents a survey to empirically\nevaluate the created content paired with human playtesting. Participants in\nfour different scenarios are asked about their perception of changes made to\nthe level both before and after balancing, and vice versa. Based on descriptive\nand statistical analysis, our findings indicate that the PCGRL-based balancing\npositively influences players' perceived balance for most scenarios, albeit\nwith differences in aspects of the balancing between scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
