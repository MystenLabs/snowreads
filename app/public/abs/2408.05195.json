However, current methods do not\nexplicitly characterize distributional differences between patch sets within\nWSIs. We introduce HistoKernel, a novel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) kernel\nthat measures distributional similarity between WSIs for enhanced prediction\nperformance on downstream prediction tasks.\n  Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates HistoKernel's effectiveness across\nvarious machine learning tasks, including retrieval (n = 9,362), drug\nsensitivity regression (n = 551), point mutation classification (n = 3,419),\nand survival analysis (n = 2,291), outperforming existing deep learning\nmethods. Additionally, HistoKernel seamlessly integrates multi-modal data and\noffers a novel perturbation-based method for patch-level explainability. This\nwork pioneers the use of kernel-based methods for WSI-level predictive\nmodeling, opening new avenues for research.
