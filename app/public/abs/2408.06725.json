However, previous VD methods\noften treat the entire dialog history as a simple text input, disregarding the\ninherent conversational information flows at the round level. In this paper, we\nintroduce Multi-round Dialogue State Tracking model (MDST), a framework that\naddresses this limitation by leveraging the dialogue state learned from dialog\nhistory to answer questions. MDST captures each round of dialog history,\nconstructing internal dialogue state representations defined as 2-tuples of\nvision-language representations. These representations effectively ground the\ncurrent question, enabling the generation of accurate answers. Experimental\nresults on the VisDial v1.0 dataset demonstrate that MDST achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art performance in generative setting. Furthermore, through a\nseries of human studies, we validate the effectiveness of MDST in generating\nlong, consistent, and human-like answers while consistently answering a series\nof questions correctly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
