This paper explores the periodicity and perfect state transfer\nof Grover walks on quadratic unitary Cayley graphs. We determine all periodic\nquadratic unitary Cayley graphs. From our results, it follows that there are\ninfinitely many integral as well as non-integral graphs that are periodic.\nAdditionally, we also determine the values of $n$ for which the quadratic\nunitary Cayley graph $\\mathcal{G}_{\\Zl_n}$ exhibits perfect state transfer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
