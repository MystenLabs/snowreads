However, the\nsignificance of TLS loss in superconducting transmission lines at liquid helium\ntemperatures remains unclear. This study investigates TLS loss in amorphous\n$SiO_2$ at liquid helium temperatures (about 4 K) within a frequency range of\n130-170 GHz, using niobium microstrip and coplanar waveguide resonators. Our\nresults demonstrate notable power and temperature dependence of dielectric\nloss, with the dielectric loss and quasiparticle loss exchanging dominance at\naround 4 K. These findings are consistent with TLS models and provide crucial\ninsights for the design of superconducting devices operating at liquid helium\ntemperatures.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fvN4yhNLX6g_wSQr7vHj-_rTdvDt7CCRjGLsHpnw-4g","pdfSize":"3000687"}
