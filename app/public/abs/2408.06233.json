Related to Voevodsky's\nhomotopy $t$-structure on motivic complexes, generic motives are also central\nto the conjectural motivic $t$-structure, as was shown by Beilinson. Morphisms\nof generic motives are closely related to the functoriality of Rost's cycle\nmodules. e obtain some new computations of generic motives, and deduce\ncomputations of morphisms of generic motives, which draw a conjectural picture.\n  The structure of generic motives reflects into that of motivic cohomology of\nfields. After giving a new argument for determining weights in the K-theory of\nnumber fields using Borel's isomorphism, we deduce that many motivic cohomology\ngroups of fields have infinite rank, usually of the same cardinality as the\nfield itself. As an example motivic cohomology groups of the real or complex\nnumbers are shown to be uncountable in many degrees and twists. Despite these\nresults, we formulate a hope on their behavior with respect to transcendental\nelements, providing a counterpart to the Beilinson-Soul\\'e vanishing\nconjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
