The treatment of final\nstate interactions is based upon an earlier analysis of pion-nucleon scattering\nwithin Hamiltonian effective field theory, supplemented by incorporating\ncontributions from the $N^*(1650)$ and the $K\\Lambda$ coupled channel. The\ncontribution from the bare state corresponding to the $N^*(1650)$ significantly\nenhances our results. Additionally, we also compute the multipole amplitude\n$M_{1-}$, which is of direct relevance to the Roper resonance. The results are\ncomparable with other dynamical coupled channel models, even though the\ncontribution from the bare state (interpreted as a 2s excitation) in this\nchannel is small because of its large mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
