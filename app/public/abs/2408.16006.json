This\nnew finding provides a tool for spatially resolving UV-visible fluorescent\nsources in minerals. Using a unique combination of harmonic generation and\nfluorescence, we explore applications to mineralogical investigations of\nterrestrial rocks and astromaterials. We report first-order demonstrations for\n3D imaging of fluid inclusions in minerals and radiation-induced luminescence\nin meteorites. Nonlinear optical mineralogy, enabled by multiphoton microscopy,\nprovides unique insights in mineralogic samples and holds the potential to\nrevolutionize the analysis of geologic and astromaterials samples in the coming\nyears.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ItXGoltc5Lexx0vT8x2-ToOMkMIEzW38CNbBGSbkUpA","pdfSize":"1942928"}
