However,\nthe complex and dynamic maritime environment, along with diverse and\nheterogeneous large-scale data sources, present challenges for real-time\ndecision-making in intelligent maritime. In this paper, We propose KUNPENG, the\nfirst-ever embodied large model for intelligent maritime in the smart ocean\nconstruction, which consists of six systems. The model perceives multi-source\nheterogeneous data for the cognition of environmental interaction and make\nautonomous decision strategies, which are used for intelligent vessels to\nperform navigation behaviors under safety and emergency guarantees and\ncontinuously optimize power to achieve embodied intelligence in maritime. In\ncomprehensive maritime task evaluations, KUNPENG has demonstrated excellent\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
