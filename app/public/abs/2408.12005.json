Addressing this critical issue, this paper introduces a novel diagnostic\nmethod for gait symmetry analysis through the use of an assistive robotic Smart\nWalker equipped with an innovative asymmetry detection scheme. This method\nanalyzes sensor measurements capturing the interaction torque between user and\nwalker. By applying a seasonal-trend decomposition tool, we isolate\ngait-specific patterns within these data, allowing for the estimation of stride\ndurations and calculation of a symmetry index. Through experiments involving 5\nexperimenters, we demonstrate the Smart Walker's capability in detecting and\nquantifying gait asymmetry by achieving an accuracy of 84.9% in identifying\nasymmetric cases in a controlled testing environment. Further analysis explores\nthe classification of these asymmetries based on their underlying causes,\nproviding valuable insights for gait assessment. The results underscore the\npotential of the device as a precise, ready-to-use monitoring tool for\npersonalized rehabilitation, facilitating targeted interventions for enhanced\npatient outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
