A common scenario\nis when the source and the receiver are in different rooms without a clear line\nof sight. For such source-receiver configurations, an initial increase in\nenergy is observed, referred to as the \"fade-in\" of reverberation. Based on\nrecent work of representing inhomogeneous and anisotropic reverberation with\ncommon decay times, this work proposes an extended parametric model that\nenables the modelling of the fade-in phenomenon. The method performs fitting on\nthe envelopes, instead of energy decay functions, and allows negative\namplitudes of decaying exponentials. We evaluate the method on simulated and\nmeasured multi-room environments, where we show that the proposed approach can\nnow model the fade-ins that were unrealisable with the previous method.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"60IULXMz7GQuNlalNTH7Aoxu0FIIe8XL_W3dPK2kiWc","pdfSize":"1086917","objectId":"0xeebf99da36678eedb8947e8208b5c039df4882f155f33e9d96e1bbc81e57e878","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
