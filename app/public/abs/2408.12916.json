We apply the\nanalysis to an hypothetical system with a central object with its mass of the\norder of solar mass and a detector located at an Earth-like distance from the\nsource. We find that the deformation parameters of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric\ncan have significant impact on the oscillation probabilities of the neutrinos.\nWe also investigate the role of decoherence on flavor oscillations of the\nlensed neutrinos and show that the parameters of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric\ndoes not have significant effects on the decoherence length.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LysgXsKYruCPq9rrNKySJ6J8ZFxclKeXndq5YQPDTGE","pdfSize":"1098891"}
