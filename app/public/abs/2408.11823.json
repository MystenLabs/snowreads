This\npaper introduces Mamba-Spike, a novel neuromorphic architecture that integrates\na spiking front-end with the Mamba backbone to achieve efficient and robust\ntemporal data processing. The proposed approach leverages the event-driven\nnature of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to capture and process asynchronous,\ntime-varying inputs, while harnessing the power of the Mamba backbone's\nselective state spaces and linear-time sequence modeling capabilities to model\ncomplex temporal dependencies effectively. The spiking front-end of Mamba-Spike\nemploys biologically inspired neuron models, along with adaptive threshold and\nsynaptic dynamics. These components enable efficient spatiotemporal feature\nextraction and encoding of the input data. The Mamba backbone, on the other\nhand, utilizes a hierarchical structure with gated recurrent units and\nattention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies and selectively process\nrelevant information. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, a\ncomprehensive empirical study is conducted on both neuromorphic datasets,\nincluding DVS Gesture and TIDIGITS, and standard datasets, such as Sequential\nMNIST and CIFAR10-DVS. The results demonstrate that Mamba-Spike consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy, lower\nlatency, and improved energy efficiency. Moreover, the model exhibits\nrobustness to various input perturbations and noise levels, highlighting its\npotential for real-world applications.
