While much progress has\nbeen made towards characterizing and controlling excitons in TMDs, manipulating\ntheir properties during the course of their lifetime - a key requirement for\nmany optoelectronic device and information processing modalities - remains an\noutstanding challenge. Here we combine long-lived interlayer excitons in\nangle-aligned MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with fast electrical control to\nrealize dynamical control schemes, in which exciton properties are not\npredetermined at the time of excitation but can be dynamically manipulated\nduring their lifetime. Leveraging the out-of-plane exciton dipole moment, we\nuse electric fields to demonstrate dynamical control over the exciton emission\nwavelength. Moreover, employing a patterned gate geometry, we demonstrate rapid\nlocal sample doping and toggling of the radiative decay rate through\nexciton-charge interactions during the exciton lifetime. Spatially mapping the\nexciton response reveals charge redistribution, offering a novel probe of\nelectronic transport in twisted TMD heterostructures. Our results establish the\nfeasibility of dynamical exciton control schemes, unlocking new directions for\nexciton-based information processing and optoelectronic devices, and the\nrealization of excitonic phenomena in TMDs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
