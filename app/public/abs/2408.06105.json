To\nintegrate new user preferences in a zero-shot manner, our proposed\nText2Interaction framework invokes large language models to generate a task\nplan, motion preferences as Python code, and parameters of a safe controller.\nBy maximizing the combined probability of task completion and user satisfaction\ninstead of a weighted sum of rewards, we can reliably find plans that fulfill\nboth requirements. We find that 83% of users working with Text2Interaction\nagree that it integrates their preferences into the robot's plan, and 94%\nprefer Text2Interaction over the baseline. Our ablation study shows that\nText2Interaction aligns better with unseen preferences than other baselines\nwhile maintaining a high success rate.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6BwAx8HTvGUWq2tySfXXDgb9Q-CN57Np4UYpAeZ247U","pdfSize":"1601089"}
