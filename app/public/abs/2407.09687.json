In this work, we present \"deepECpr,\" which combines\nexpectation-consistent (EC) approximation with deep denoising networks to\nsurpass state-of-the-art phase-retrieval methods in both speed and accuracy. In\naddition to applying EC in a non-traditional manner, deepECpr includes a novel\nstochastic damping scheme that is inspired by recent diffusion methods. Like\nexisting phase-retrieval methods based on plug-and-play priors, regularization\nby denoising, or diffusion, deepECpr iterates a denoising stage with a\nmeasurement-exploitation stage. But unlike existing methods, deepECpr requires\nfar fewer denoiser calls. We compare deepECpr to the state-of-the-art prDeep\n(Metzler et al., 2018), Deep-ITA (Wang et al., 2020), and Diffusion Posterior\nSampling (Chung et al., 2023) methods for noisy phase-retrieval of color,\nnatural, and unnatural grayscale images on oversampled-Fourier and\ncoded-diffraction-pattern measurements and find improvements in both PSNR and\nSSIM with 5x fewer denoiser calls.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VwlpLFCAco-B0RcWI4A0_5SOV26rusOEKXbU2TIbTx0","pdfSize":"14277404","objectId":"0x420d2dca1c9508fd3b2eead8a3cce104780e226785d89414a51b3e37a99d6771","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
