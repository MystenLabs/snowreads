This\nmodel represents a communication channel where two linear filters are separated\nby a non-linear function modelling an amplifier. The algorithm enables to\nrecover each parameter of the model, namely the two linear filters and the\nnon-linear function. This is to be opposed with estimation algorithms which\nidentify the equivalent Volterra system. The algorithm is composed of three\nmain steps and uses three distinct pilot sequences. The estimation of the\nparameters is done in the time domain via several instances of the least-square\nalgorithm. However, arguments based on the spectral representation of the\nsignals and filters are used to design the pilot sequences. We also provide an\nanalysis of the proposed algorithm. We estimate, via the theory and\nsimulations, the minimum required size of the pilot sequences to achieve a\ntarget mean squared error between the output of the true channel and the output\nof the estimated model. We obtain that the new method requires reduced-size\npilot sequences: The sum of the length of the pilot sequences is approximately\nthe one needed to estimate the convolutional product of the two linear filters\nwith a back-off. A comparison with the Volterra approach is also provided.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
