This\ntask is challenging due to the need for robust models that can generalize to a\ndiverse set of driver behaviors without requiring extensive annotated datasets.\nIn this paper, we propose KiD3, a novel method for distracted driver detection\n(DDD) by infusing auxiliary knowledge about semantic relations between entities\nin a scene and the structural configuration of the driver's pose. Specifically,\nwe construct a unified framework that integrates the scene graphs, and driver\npose information with the visual cues in video frames to create a holistic\nrepresentation of the driver's actions.Our results indicate that KiD3 achieves\na 13.64% accuracy improvement over the vision-only baseline by incorporating\nsuch auxiliary knowledge with visual information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
