However, in practical scenarios, there are often domain\nvariations within the datasets, leading to derivative scenarios like\nsemi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised\nmedical domain adaptation (UMDA). In this paper, we aim to develop a generic\nframework that masters all three tasks. We notice a critical shared challenge\nacross three scenarios: the explicit semantic knowledge for segmentation\nperformance and rich domain knowledge for generalizability exclusively exist in\nthe labeled set and unlabeled set respectively. Such discrepancy hinders\nexisting methods from effectively comprehending both types of knowledge under\nsemi-supervised settings. To tackle this challenge, we develop a Semantic &\nDomain Knowledge Messenger (S&D Messenger) which facilitates direct knowledge\ndelivery between the labeled and unlabeled set, and thus allowing the model to\ncomprehend both of them in each individual learning flow. Equipped with our S&D\nMessenger, a naive pseudo-labeling method can achieve huge improvement on six\nbenchmark datasets for SSMIS (+7.5%), UMDA (+5.6%), and Semi-MDG tasks\n(+1.14%), compared with state-of-the-art methods designed for specific tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
