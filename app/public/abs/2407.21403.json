The model enables direct transactions between\nparties within an open and distributed system and integrates unused capacity\nwhile respecting network constraints. We evaluate the model through simulations\nof different scenarios (normal operating conditions and extreme conditions) for\n24-hour time blocks. Our simulations highlight the benefits of our model in a\ndecentralized energy system, notably its ability to deal with high-trade\nvolumes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zneUt_OoUuWlV6_Xsw81HJTZ0DVd4BO5C7n1B4V1Z_8","pdfSize":"487578"}
