First-principles calculations were\nperformed on these prospective superconductors across the pressure range of\n50-200 GPa, revealing their electronic band structures, phonon dispersions,\nelectron-phonon interactions, and superconducting properties. Several compounds\nwere identified as dynamically stable, with ScYbH$_{12}$ and LuYbH$_{12}$\nremaining stable at 70 GPa, and ScLuH$_{12}$ at 100 GPa. Notably, Eliashberg\ntheory and electron-phonon coupling calculations predict CaLuH$_{12}$ to\nexhibit a remarkable $T_{c}$ of up to 294 K at 180 GPa. These findings unveil\nternary hydrides as a promising class of high-temperature superconductors and\nprovide insights for achieving superconductivity at lower or ambient pressures\nthrough material design and exploration.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7KwPgVTMhdESxMToAXGd6hFTo2zEXiiRsUZDY5dBX8c","pdfSize":"2632820"}
