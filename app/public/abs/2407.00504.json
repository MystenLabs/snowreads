These mainly utilize Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) to detect periodic dips in lightcurve data. While having\napproximately 5% lower accuracy than CNNs, the results of this study show that\nOne-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be fitted to data up to 84 times\nfaster than simple CNNs and make predictions over 3 times faster on the same\ndatasets using the same hardware. In addition, One-Class SVMs can be run\nsmoothly on unspecialized hardware, removing the need for Graphics Processing\nUnit (GPU) usage. In cases where time and processing power are valuable\nresources, One-Class SVMs are able to minimize time spent on transit detection\ntasks while maximizing performance and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
