Many network embedding methods have been\nproposed, among which factorization of the Personalized PageRank (PPR for\nshort) matrix has been empirically and theoretically well supported recently.\nHowever, several fundamental issues cannot be addressed. (1) Existing methods\ninvoke a seminal Local Push subroutine to approximate \\textit{a single} row or\ncolumn of the PPR matrix. Thus, they have to execute $n$ ($n$ is the number of\nnodes) Local Push subroutines to obtain a provable PPR matrix, resulting in\nprohibitively high computational costs for large $n$. (2) The PPR matrix has\nlimited power in capturing the structural similarity between vertices, leading\nto performance degradation. To overcome these dilemmas, we propose PSNE, an\nefficient spectral s\\textbf{P}arsification method for \\textbf{S}caling\n\\textbf{N}etwork \\textbf{E}mbedding, which can fast obtain the embedding\nvectors that retain strong structural similarities. Specifically, PSNE first\ndesigns a matrix polynomial sparser to accelerate the calculation of the PPR\nmatrix, which has a theoretical guarantee in terms of the Frobenius norm.\nSubsequently, PSNE proposes a simple but effective multiple-perspective\nstrategy to enhance further the representation power of the obtained\napproximate PPR matrix. Finally, PSNE applies a randomized singular value\ndecomposition algorithm on the sparse and multiple-perspective PPR matrix to\nget the target embedding vectors. Experimental evaluation of real-world and\nsynthetic datasets shows that our solutions are indeed more efficient,\neffective, and scalable compared with ten competitors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t_rZVL59eu-gHJfodNPb3tXgcyn39r-EOtSYGvKuPME","pdfSize":"1770769","txDigest":"AtxFDPPDy6VzYhZTnLkfYDmiRb7jDb8GuorMH5Wvybh7","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
