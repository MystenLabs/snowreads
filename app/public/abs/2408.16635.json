We classify, in terms of the Seifert\ncoefficients, SU(2)-abelian 3-manifolds among the family of graph manifolds\nobtained by gluing two Seifert spaces both fibred over a disk and with two\nsingular fibers. Finally, we prove that these SU(2)-abelian manifolds are\nHeegaard Floer homology L-spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ACuBZln-5IEnE56TQH8GVD-o3b-I9mwv9EEw6M-HIR0","pdfSize":"487217"}
