In future microwave-based\noperations, however, the joule heat produced by large microwave currents\nflowing through narrow microwave electrodes would potentially hinder\nimprovements in gate speed and fidelity. Moreover, scalability, particularly in\ncryogenic trapped ion systems, is impeded by the excessive joule heat. To\naddress these challenges, we present a novel approach: superconducting surface\ntrap chips that integrate high-$Q$ microwave resonators with large current\ncapacities. Utilizing sub-ampere microwave currents in superconducting Nb\nresonators, we generate substantial magnetic field gradients with significantly\nreduced losses compared to conventional metal chips. By harnessing the high $Q$\nfactors of superconducting resonators, we propose a power-efficient two-qubit\ngate scheme capable of achieving a sub-milliwatt external microwave input power\nat a gate Rabi frequency of 1 kHz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
