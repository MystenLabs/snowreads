Under these assumptions, we show that the dimension of the manifold,\nthe (constant negative) Ricci curvature and the screened parameter are related\nthrough a quadratic equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
