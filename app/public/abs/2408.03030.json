This study\naddresses the issue of suboptimal single-spectral nighttime pedestrian\ndetection performance under low-light conditions by incorporating background\ninformation into the channel attention mechanism. Despite numerous studies\nfocusing on the development of efficient channel attention mechanisms, the\nrelevance of background information has been largely disregarded. By adopting a\ncontrast learning approach, we reexamine channel attention with regard to\npedestrian objects and background information for nighttime pedestrian\ndetection, resulting in the proposed Fore-Background Contrast Attention (FBCA).\nFBCA possesses two primary attributes: (1) channel descriptors form remote\ndependencies with global spatial feature information; (2) the integration of\nbackground information enhances the distinction between channels concentrating\non low-light pedestrian features and those focusing on background information.\nConsequently, the acquired channel descriptors exhibit a higher semantic level\nand spatial accuracy. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that FBCA significantly\noutperforms existing methods in single-spectral nighttime pedestrian detection,\nachieving state-of-the-art results on the NightOwls and TJU-DHD-pedestrian\ndatasets. Furthermore, this methodology also yields performance improvements\nfor the multispectral LLVIP dataset. These findings indicate that integrating\nbackground information into the channel attention mechanism effectively\nmitigates detector performance degradation caused by illumination factors in\nnighttime scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
