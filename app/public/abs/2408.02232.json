Such program improvement can be accomplished by a\ncombination of large language model (LLM) and program analysis capabilities, in\nthe form of an LLM agent. Since program repair or program improvement typically\nrequires a specification of intended behavior - specification inference can be\nuseful for producing high quality program patches. In this work, we examine\nefficient and low-cost workflows for iterative specification inference within\nan LLM agent. Given a GitHub issue to be resolved in a software project, our\ngoal is to conduct iterative code search accompanied by specification inference\n- thereby inferring intent from both the project structure and behavior. The\nintent thus captured is examined by a reviewer agent with the goal of vetting\nthe patches as well as providing a measure of confidence in the vetted patches.\nOur approach SpecRover (AutoCodeRover-v2) is built on the open-source LLM agent\nAutoCodeRover. In an evaluation on the full SWE-Bench consisting of 2294 GitHub\nissues, it shows more than 50% improvement in efficacy over AutoCodeRover.\nCompared to the open-source agents available, our work shows modest cost ($0.65\nper issue) in resolving an average GitHub issue in SWE-Bench lite. The\nproduction of explanation by SpecRover allows for a better \"signal\" to be given\nto the developer, on when the suggested patches can be accepted with\nconfidence. SpecRover also seeks to demonstrate the continued importance of\nspecification inference in automated program repair, even as program repair\ntechnologies enter the LLM era.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9MEvTwUiesg1j4ny-HMGCVdN8M0rGvqJDl9H1gynW9Y","pdfSize":"824480","txDigest":"KeFafmbrBvADEkuZx68Qiie4HZBTx8x4CBDBHsvD1mu","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
