This paper presents an empirical\nstudy on Geometric Graph Neural Networks for 3D atomic systems, focusing on the\nimpact of different (1) canonicalization methods, (2) graph creation\nstrategies, and (3) auxiliary tasks, on performance, scalability and symmetry\nenforcement. Our findings and insights aim to guide researchers in selecting\noptimal modeling components for molecular modeling tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J29CxNzu5Tx5S_ZZhHJZyIuLVgjUwWY0UrugXOvpib4","pdfSize":"1791637"}
