We consider equations posed in punctured balls centered\nat the origin, and we prove that all radial solutions are singular around the\norigin, by providing a complete classification in dependence of p of their\nasymptotic behavior near the singularity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
