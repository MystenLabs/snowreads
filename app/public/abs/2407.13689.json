Vulnerable groups, especially pedestrians\nand cyclists on sun-exposed sidewalks, motivate the development of a route\nplanning method that incorporates somatosensory temperature effects through\nshade ratio consideration. This paper is the first to introduce a pipeline that\nutilizes segmentation foundation models to extract shaded areas from\nhigh-resolution satellite images. These areas are then integrated into a\nmulti-layered road map, enabling users to customize routes based on a balance\nbetween distance and shade exposure, thereby enhancing comfort and health\nduring outdoor activities. Specifically, we construct a graph-based\nrepresentation of the road map, where links indicate connectivity and are\nupdated with shade ratio data for dynamic route planning. This system is\nalready implemented online, with a video demonstration, and will be\nspecifically adapted to assist travelers during the 2024 Olympic Games in\nParis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
