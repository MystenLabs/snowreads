Cell biology has largely\navoided this debate and is now in a quantitation crisis. In experimental cell\nbiology, statistical analysis has grown to mean testing the null hypothesis\nthat there was no experimental effect. This weak form of hypothesis testing\nneglects effect size, is universally misinterpreted, and is disastrously prone\nto error when combined with high-throughput cell biology. The first part of the\nsolution proposed here is to limit statistical hypothesis testing to the small\nsubset of experiments where a biologically meaningful null hypotheses can be\ndefined prior to the experiment. The second part of the solution is to make\nconfidence intervals the default statistic in cell biology.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qloq6t1xfZUuXvbAU2-tzhxzpTm1jJputANuFPm1dro","pdfSize":"453513"}
