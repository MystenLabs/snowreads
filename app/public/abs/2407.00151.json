The attractive force between the two\nblack holes is balanced by the addition of a background electric field, sourced\nat the conformal boundary. There is a continuous family of bulk solutions for a\ngiven boundary profile and temperature, suggesting there is continuous\nnon-uniqueness. We investigate the charges of the solutions and verify\nnumerically that they satisfy a first law of black hole mechanics relation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
