We utilize a new discrete reproducing formula, that is, the\nbuilding blocks are differences of the Dunkl-Poisson kernel which involves both\nthe Euclidean metric and the Dunkl metric. To introduce the Besov spaces in the\nDunkl setting, new test functions and distributions are introduced, and a new\ndecomposition is established.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
