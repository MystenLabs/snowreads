The autoresonant interaction\nbetween the oscillatory motion of the ion and the RF voltage causes an increase\nin the amplitude of certain confined ions, allowing their selective extraction.\nNumerical modelling shows that the extraction of ions with a given mass occurs\nnot only at the fundamental frequency but also at its harmonics. This effect\nreduces the selective properties of devices of this type because along with the\nmain mass component for a given frequency, it is possible to enter the detector\nchannel of ions with another mass, for which this frequency corresponds to the\nsecond or higher harmonics, even a superposition of some of these harmonics of\ndifferent ions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
