Assume that $X$ admits an effective\nHamiltonian action of an $n$-dimensional algebraic torus $T^n$, compatible with\nthe conical $\\mathbf{C}^*$-action. A typical example of $X$ is a toric\nhyperkahler variety $Y(A,0)$.\n  In this article, we prove that this property characterizes $Y(A,0)$ with $A$\nunimodular. More precisely, if $(X, \\omega)$ is such a conical symplectic\nvariety, then there is a $T^n$-equivariant (complex analytic) isomorphism\n$\\varphi: (X, \\omega) \\to (Y(A,0), \\omega_{Y(A,0)})$ under which both moment\nmaps are identified. Moreover $\\varphi$ sends the center $0_X$ of $X$ to the\ncenter $0_{Y(A,0)}$ of $Y(A,0)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"efMUt--KznKuPlaBXu-Ym98zBufKTh7tAvNoq_vppYQ","pdfSize":"350349"}
