We include acoustic phonons via the Migdal approximation and we use\nreal-space Floquet dynamical mean-field theory to address the nonequilibrium\nFloquet steady-state. The so-called auxiliary master equation approach is\nemployed as impurity solver. We find that impact ionization is only weakly\naffected by dissipation by acoustic phonons at low bias voltages. For higher\nbiases instead, the Hartree shift considerably alters the on-site energies of\nthe Hubbard bands and suppresses the photocurrent for intermediate\nelectron-phonon coupling strengths. Impact ionization processes play a\nfundamental role in enhancing the electrical output power, which decreases when\nelectron-phonon interaction is considered.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
