Our example consists of a pair of two arrangements with $13$ lines.\nMoreover, we use the newly discovered singular matroid realization spaces to\nconstruct new examples of pairs of line arrangements having the same underlying\nmatroid but different free resolutions of the Milnor algebras. Such rare\narrangements are called Ziegler pairs in the literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
