{"id":"2407.02523","title":"Inverting the wedge map and Gauss composition","authors":"Kok Seng Chua","authorsParsed":[["Chua","Kok Seng",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2024 12:20:53 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-04","timestamp":1719490853000,"abstract":"  Let $1 \\le k \\le n,$ and let $v_1,\\ldots,v_k$ be integral vectors in\n$\\mathbb{Z}^n$. We consider the wedge map $\\alpha_{n,k} : (\\mathbb{Z}^n)^k\n/SL_k(\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow \\wedge^k(\\mathbb{Z}^n)$, $(v_1,\\ldots,v_k)\n\\rightarrow v_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge v_k $. In his Disquisitiones, Gauss proved\nthat $\\alpha_{n,2}$ is injective when restricted to a primitive system of\nvectors when defining his composition law for binary quadratic forms. He also\ngave an algorithm for inverting $\\alpha_{3,2}$ in a different context on the\nrepresentation of integers by ternary quadratic forms. We give here an explicit\nalgorithm for inverting $\\alpha_{n,2}$, and observe via Bhargava's composition\nlaw for $\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}^2 $ cube that\ninverting $\\alpha_{4,2}$ is the main algorithmic step in Gauss's composition\nlaw for binary quadratic forms. This places Gauss's composition as a special\ncase of the geometric problem of inverting a wedge map which may be of\nindependent interests. We also show that a given symmetric positive definite\nmatrix $A$ induces a natural metric on the integral Grassmannian\n$G_{n,k}(\\mathbb{Z})$ so that the map $X \\rightarrow X^TAX$ becomes norm\npreserving.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"N2wnyZHkvni8kEMeMni1_Xnvz25m6F1NL4UHycDlbGM","pdfSize":"160299"}
