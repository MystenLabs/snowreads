However, despite its attractive\ntheoretical properties, implementing DP in practice remains challenging,\nespecially when it comes to survey data. In this paper we present some results\nfrom an ongoing project funded by the U.S. Census Bureau that is exploring the\npossibilities and limitations of DP for survey data. Specifically, we identify\nfive aspects that need to be considered when adopting DP in the survey context:\nthe multi-staged nature of data production; the limited privacy amplification\nfrom complex sampling designs; the implications of survey-weighted estimates;\nthe weighting adjustments for nonresponse and other data deficiencies, and the\nimputation of missing values. We summarize the project's key findings with\nrespect to each of these aspects and also discuss some of the challenges that\nstill need to be addressed before DP could become the new data protection\nstandard at statistical agencies.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9XsmahvRySecRpPAvWZUDPOR5CpJjQT8VHmN3sw7IdM","pdfSize":"413364"}
