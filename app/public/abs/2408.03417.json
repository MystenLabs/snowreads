This framework\nencompasses the overall structure of the non-minimally coupled scalar field\nfunctions for both the torsion scalar ($T$) and the boundary term ($B$). We\nhave examined three well-motivated forms of potential functions and constrained\nthe model parameters through dynamical system analysis. This analysis has\nplayed a crucial role in identifying cosmologically viable models. We have\nanalysed the behaviour of dynamical parameters such as equation-of-state\nparameters for dark energy and the total, as well as all the standard density\nparameters for radiation, matter, and dark energy to assess their compatibility\nwith current observational data. The phase space diagrams are presented to\nsupport the stability conditions of the corresponding critical points. The\nUniverse is apparent in its late-time cosmic acceleration phase via the dark\nenergy-dominated critical points. Additionally, we compare our findings with\nthe most prevailing $\\Lambda$CDM model. The outcomes are further inspected\nusing the cosmological data sets of Supernovae Ia and the Hubble rate H(z).\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
