The electron kinetic energy spectra depend on\ncoincidentally produced ion species, OCS$^+$ or S$^+$. The observed electron\nmomentum distribution shows a clear asymmetry along the laser polarization\ndirection with a 2$\\pi$-oscillation period as a function of the phase\ndifference in $\\omega + 2\\omega$ laser fields. The asymmetry of the electron\nemission in the OCS$^+$ channel flips at the electron kinetic energy of 8.2 eV\nwhere the dominant scattering direction switches from forward to backward. In\nthe S$^+$ channel, the asymmetry flip occurs at the lower kinetic energy of 4.2\neV, and this shift corresponds to an inelastic scattering process. In\ncomparison with a classical trajectory Monte-Carlo simulation, it has been\nclarified that the shift of the electron kinetic energy at which the asymmetry\nflip occurs corresponds to the excitation energy of the parent ion and\nindicates contributions of electron recollisional excitation to form the\nfragment ion in intense laser fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
