It is a special point in the three-parameter space of\ndouble-scaled $\\gamma_i$-deformed N = 4 SYM, preserving N = 1 supersymmetry.\nThe Feynman diagrams of the general three-parameter models form a \"dynamical\nfishnet\" that is much harder to analyze than the original one-parameter\nfishnet, where major progress in uncovering the model's integrable structure\nhas been made in recent years. Here we show that by applying N = 1 superspace\ntechniques to the $\\beta$-deformed model the dynamical nature of its Feynman\ngraph expansion disappears, and we recover a regular lattice structure of brick\nwall (honeycomb) type. As a first application, we compute the zero-mode-fixed\nthermodynamic free energy of this model by applying Zamolodchikov's method of\ninversion to the supersymmetric brick wall diagrams.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
