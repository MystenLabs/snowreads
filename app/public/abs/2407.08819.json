Given the\nlimited amount of parallel data available for this language (only 18k\nLadin-Italian sentence pairs), we investigate the performance of a multilingual\nneural machine translation model fine-tuned for Ladin-Italian. In addition to\nthe available authentic data, we synthesise further translations by using three\ndifferent models: a fine-tuned neural model, a rule-based system developed\nspecifically for this language pair, and a large language model. Our\nexperiments show that all approaches achieve comparable translation quality in\nthis low-resource scenario, yet round-trip translations highlight differences\nin model performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
