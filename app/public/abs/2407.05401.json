Monodisperse nano-rods, with aspect\nratios typical of cellulose nano-crystals (CNCs) are grafted randomly with\noligomers at different grafting densities. LC ordering depends non-trivially on\ngrafting density as the effective nano-rod shape and softness is modified.\nUngrafted rods exhibit Nematic and tilted Smectic-C phases. At 25\\% grafting,\nthe addition of a few side chains entirely suppresses Smectic order and instead\na persistent Nematic phase is favoured. Intermediary grafting, around 50\\%,\nresults in a Nematic and the reappearance of tilted Smectic-F phases. Heavier\ngrafting facilitates direct transitions to either Smectic-I with extreme tilt\n(75\\%) or an un-tilted Smectic-B (100\\%). Such behaviour falls outside of\ncurrent hard or soft-rod descriptions of phase-transitions in rod-like LC\nsystems and points to undiscovered LC behaviour in both shape-purified\ngrafted/un-grafted CNCs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
