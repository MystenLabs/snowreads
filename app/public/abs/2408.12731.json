Beaton and Brown verified this conjecture for paths and\ncycles. Here we extend this to arbitrary powers of paths and cycles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9IxtA7327xLmV6adGdZGnjHNcml1uQ5SxH-x3nkUDCI","pdfSize":"174450"}
