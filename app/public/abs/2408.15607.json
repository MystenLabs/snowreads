An alternative to the hazard ratio as effect measure\nis the difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) that does not rely on\nmodel assumptions. Although an asymptotic test for two-sample comparisons of\nthe RMST exists, it has been shown to suffer from an inflated type I error rate\nin samples of small or moderate sizes. Recently, permutation tests, including\nthe studentized permutation test, have been introduced to address this issue.\nIn this paper, we propose two methods based on pseudo-observations (PO)\nregression models as alternatives for such scenarios and assess their\nproperties in comparison to previously proposed approaches in an extensive\nsimulation study. Furthermore, we apply the proposed PO methods to data from a\nclinical trail and, by doing so, point out some extension that might be very\nuseful for practical applications such as covariate adjustments.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
