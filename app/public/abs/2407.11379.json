By analyzing\nthe power spectrum density of both pre-trained and fine-tuned model gradients,\nas well as artificially generated frequency shortcuts, we observe notable\ndifferences in learning priorities between models pre-trained on natural vs\nmedical images, which generally persist during fine-tuning. We find that when a\nmodel's learning priority aligns with the power spectrum density of an\nartifact, it results in overfitting to that artifact. Based on these\nobservations, we show that source data editing can alter the model's resistance\nto shortcut learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
