Based on a method-of-regions analysis, we identify three-loop\ncontributions from perturbative active-active Glauber-gluon exchanges with the\nright structure to render the cross section consistent with PDF factorization\nbelow the gap veto scale. The Glauber contributions we identify are\nunambiguously defined without regulators beyond dimensional regularization.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
