While iterative retrieval\nmethods improve performance by gathering additional information, current\napproaches often rely on multiple calls of large language models (LLMs). In\nthis paper, we introduce EfficientRAG, an efficient retriever for multi-hop\nquestion answering. EfficientRAG iteratively generates new queries without the\nneed for LLM calls at each iteration and filters out irrelevant information.\nExperimental results demonstrate that EfficientRAG surpasses existing RAG\nmethods on three open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
