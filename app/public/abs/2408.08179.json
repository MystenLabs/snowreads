Our approach employs a ResNet network to simultaneously detect\nthe modulation type and accurately locate the cyclic prefix. Specifically,\nafter eliminating the environmental impact from the signal and accurately\nextracting the OFDM symbols, we convert these symbols into scatter plots. Due\nto their unique shapes, these scatter plots are then classified using ResNet.\nAs a result, our proposed modulation classification method can be applied to\nany OFDM-based technology without prior knowledge of the transmitted signal. We\nevaluate its performance across various modulation schemes and subcarrier\nnumbers. Simulation results show that our method achieves a modulation\ndetection accuracy exceeding $80\\%$ at an SNR of $10$ dB and $95\\%$ at an SNR\nof $25$ dB.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
