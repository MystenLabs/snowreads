However, due to limited\nsample sizes and significant data loss during collection for various reasons,\nsome machine learning methods have been proposed to address the issue of\nmissing data. These methods have not fully utilized the known clinical\ninformation of patients to enhance the accuracy of data imputation. Therefore,\nwe introduce mbVDiT, a novel pre-trained conditional diffusion model for\nmicrobiome data imputation and denoising, which uses the unmasked data and\npatient metadata as conditional guidance for imputating missing values. It is\nalso uses VAE to integrate the the other public microbiome datasets to enhance\nmodel performance. The results on the microbiome datasets from three different\ncancer types demonstrate the performance of our methods in comparison with\nexisting methods.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
