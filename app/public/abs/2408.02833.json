In a recent work, linear\nregression was formulated as a quadratic binary optimization problem that can\nbe solved via quantum annealing. Although this approach promises a\ncomputational time advantage for large datasets, the quality of the solution is\nlimited by the necessary use of a precision vector, used to approximate the\nreal-numbered regression coefficients in the quantum formulation. In this work,\nwe focus on the practical challenge of improving the precision vector encoding:\ninstead of setting an array of generic values equal for all coefficients, we\nallow each one to be expressed by its specific precision, which is tuned with a\nsimple adaptive algorithm. This approach is evaluated on synthetic datasets of\nincreasing size, and linear regression is solved using the D-Wave Advantage\nquantum annealer, as well as classical solvers. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the largest dataset ever evaluated for linear regression on a quantum\nannealer. The results show that our formulation is able to deliver improved\nsolution quality in all instances, and could better exploit the potential of\ncurrent quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
