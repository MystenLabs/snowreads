Our approach is based on a new\nconvex training program for ReLU shallow neural networks which allows us to\ncast the problem as an exact, tractable reformulation of its order-1\nWasserstein distributionally robust equivalent. Our training procedure is\nconservative by design, has low stochasticity, is solvable with open-source\nsolvers, and is scalable to large industrial deployments. We provide\nout-of-sample performance guarantees and show that hard convex physical\nconstraints can be enforced in the training program. WaDiRo-SCNN aims to make\nneural networks safer for critical applications, such as in the energy sector.\nFinally, we numerically demonstrate the performance of our model on a synthetic\nexperiment and a real-world power system application, i.e., the prediction of\nnon-residential buildings' hourly energy consumption. The experimental results\nare convincing and showcase the strengths of the proposed model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
