Thus, in this context our goal is evaluating how the\nsystem reacts to investment perturbations due to changes in the investment\nstrategy and its impact on the visibility of specific campaigns. To do so, we\nfit the model using a set of real marketing data with different investment\ncampaigns over the same geographic territory. By employing forecast error\nvariance decomposition, our findings indicate that clicks and impressions have\na significant impact on session generation. Also, we evaluate our approach\nthrough a comprehensive simulation study that considers different processes.\nThe results indicate that our proposal has substantial capabilities in terms of\nestimability and accuracy.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_Icxy6LfGk2fDHB4TM9HFZQmo6mRCi_D9Bqz86D-EWc","pdfSize":"2610555"}
