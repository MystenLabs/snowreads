Recent studies have shown that, in the\nquasi-static limit, the mechanical response of disordered solids to external\nperturbations is anomalous and can be accurately predicted by the theory of\nodd-dipole-screening. In this work, we investigate responsive granular matter,\nwhere grains change size in response to stimuli such as humidity, temperature,\nor other factors. We develop a geometric theory of odd dipole-screening,\nincorporating the growth field into the equilibrium equation. Our theory\npredicts an anomalous displacement field in response to non-uniform growth\nfields, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations of granular matter.\nAlthough the screening parameters in our theory are phenomenological and not\nderived from microscopic physics, we identify a surprising relationship between\nthe odd parameter and Poissons ratio. This theory has implications for various\nexperimental protocols, including non-uniform heating or wetting, which lead to\nspatially varying expansion field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
