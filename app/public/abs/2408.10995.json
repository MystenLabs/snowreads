Despite the significant human and financial costs of bringing a drug to\nmarket, less than 20% of drugs in testing will make it from the first phase to\nfinal approval. Recent literature indicates that the design of the trial\nprotocols significantly contributes to trial performance. We investigated\nClinical Trial Outcome Prediction (CTOP) using trial design documents to\npredict phase transitions automatically. We propose CTP-LLM, the first Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) based model for CTOP. We also introduce the\nPhaseTransition (PT) Dataset; which labels trials based on their progression\nthrough the regulatory process and serves as a benchmark for CTOP evaluation.\nOur fine-tuned GPT-3.5-based model (CTP-LLM) predicts clinical trial phase\ntransition by analyzing the trial's original protocol texts without requiring\nhuman-selected features. CTP-LLM achieves a 67% accuracy rate in predicting\ntrial phase transitions across all phases and a 75% accuracy rate specifically\nin predicting the transition from Phase~III to final approval. Our experimental\nperformance highlights the potential of LLM-powered applications in forecasting\nclinical trial outcomes and assessing trial design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"t7Ox1DD0MGrxPi1EAmRgvR4YkWnO4lJgPNEOMZfy9wc","pdfSize":"700463"}
