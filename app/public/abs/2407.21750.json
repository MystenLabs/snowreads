Based\non the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), we apply an optimization called here\nthe LMN method to achieve fast and robust re-sampling. In addition to\nperformance comparisons with some other popular methods, we illustrate the\neffectiveness of this LMN method in a particle physics experiment: re-sampling\nof waveforms from Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
