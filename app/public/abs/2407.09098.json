Inspired by quantum mechanics, the von Neumann\nentropy (vNE) and the entanglement entropy(EE) are derived from a density\nmatrix for the turbulence state in terms of the multi-field singular value\ndecomposition (MFSVD). Applying the information-theoretic entropy analyses to\nspatio-temporal dynamics in turbulent plasmas with phase-transition-like\nbehavior, we discover a new nontrivial transition threshold regarding the vNE,\nwhich significantly deviates from the transition threshold of the field energy\nconsidered in the conventional approaches. These findings provide us with new\nclassifications of the turbulence state in terms of combined energy and\ninformation. It is also shown that the EE for nonlinear interactions in\nturbulence simultaneously describes not only the information for the strength\nof nonlinear mode couplings but also the direction of net energy transfer.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
