We dissect the underlying algorithms, evaluate their\nstrengths and tradeoffs, and project future research trajectories in this\nrapidly evolving field. We provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental\nin DL-driven 3D scene reconstruction, offering insights into their potential\napplications and limitations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2dDSNrwxxeyUaf6EtwDPgU2GDW_fg5s0hy_XqPXlwhg","pdfSize":"9480570"}
