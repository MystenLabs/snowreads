These systems exhibit spatio-temporal\npatterns akin to active turbulence, driven by internal energy injection. While\nbacterial turbulence in dense suspensions is well studied, the dynamics in\ngrowing bacterial suspensions are less understood. This work presents a\nphenomenological coarse-grained model for growing bacterial suspensions,\nincorporating hydrodynamic equations for bacterial density, orientation, and\nfluid velocity, with birth and death terms for colony growth. Starting with low\ndensity and random orientations, the model shows the development of local\nordering as bacterial density increases. As density continues to rise, the\nmodel captures four distinct phases; dilute, clustered, turbulent, and trapped\nbased on structural patterns and dynamics, with the turbulent phase\ncharacterized by spatio-temporal vortex structures, aligning with observations\nin dense bacterial suspensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7djy1aPgqO3-ym8xG3dojw6-I-jK72tu3Zow53FBJvE","pdfSize":"3544276"}
