The success and spread of such tools came from the\nability to exploit proxy variables rather than explicit geotechnical ones, as\nthe latter are prohibitive to acquire over broad landscapes. Our work\nimplements a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach, thereby adding to\na standard data-driven architecture, an intermediate constraint to solve for\nthe permanent deformation typical of Newmark slope stability methods. This\ntranslates into a neural network tasked with explicitly retrieving geotechnical\nparameters from common proxy variables and then minimize a loss function with\nrespect to the available coseismic landside inventory. The results are very\npromising, because our model not only produces excellent predictive performance\nin the form of standard susceptibility output, but in the process, also\ngenerates maps of the expected geotechnical properties at a regional scale.\nSuch architecture is therefore framed to tackle coseismic landslide prediction,\nsomething that, if confirmed in other studies, could open up towards PINN-based\nnear-real-time predictions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
