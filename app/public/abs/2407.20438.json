This often reflects and perpetuates harmful stereotypes present in\nsociety. With MT user interfaces in mind that allow for resolving gender\nambiguity in a frictionless manner, we study the problem of generating all\ngrammatically correct gendered translation alternatives. We open source train\nand test datasets for five language pairs and establish benchmarks for this\ntask. Our key technical contribution is a novel semi-supervised solution for\ngenerating alternatives that integrates seamlessly with standard MT models and\nmaintains high performance without requiring additional components or\nincreasing inference overhead.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
