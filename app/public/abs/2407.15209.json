We found attractor behaviors for 1+1D viscous\nhydrodynamics with general rapidity distribution based on MIS theory.\nMeanwhile, we also observe that a rapid expansion in the fluid velocity is\nessential for a rapid early time attractor.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
