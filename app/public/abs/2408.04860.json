The random embedding Bayesian optimization algorithm is commonly\nused to address high-dimensional BO challenges. However, this method relies on\nthe effective subspace assumption on the optimization problem's objective\nfunction, which limits its applicability. In this paper, we introduce\nCondensing-Expansion Projection Bayesian optimization (CEPBO), a novel random\nprojection-based approach for high-dimensional BO that does not reply on the\neffective subspace assumption. The approach is both simple to implement and\nhighly practical. We present two algorithms based on different random\nprojection matrices: the Gaussian projection matrix and the hashing projection\nmatrix. Experimental results demonstrate that both algorithms outperform\nexisting random embedding-based algorithms in most cases, achieving superior\nperformance on high-dimensional BO problems.
