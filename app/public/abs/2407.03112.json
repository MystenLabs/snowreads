Consequently, managing and analyzing\ntrajectory data has seen significant interest from the research community. The\nchallenges presented by trajectory data arise from their spatio-temporal nature\nas well as the uncertainty regarding locations between sampled points. In this\npaper, we present a data model that treats trajectories as first-class\ncitizens, thus fully capturing their spatio-temporal properties. We also\nintroduce a predicate logic that enable query processing under different\nuncertainty assumptions. Finally, we show that our predicate logic is\nexpressive enough to capture all spatial and temporal relations put forward by\nprevious work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
