Nevertheless, the LoRa MAC layer adopts pure ALOHA for medium access\ncontrol, which may suffer from severe packet collisions as the network scale\nexpands, consequently reducing the system energy efficiency (EE). To address\nthis issue, it is critical to carefully allocate transmission parameters such\nas the channel (CH), transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) to each\nend device (ED). Owing to the low duty cycle and sporadic traffic of LoRa\nnetworks, evaluating the system EE under various parameter settings proves to\nbe time-consuming. Consequently, we propose an analytical model aimed at\ncalculating the system EE while fully considering the impact of multiple\ngateways, duty cycling, quasi-orthogonal SFs and capture effects. On this\nbasis, we investigate a joint CH, SF and TP allocation problem, with the\nobjective of optimizing the system EE for uplink transmissions. Due to the\nNP-hard complexity of the problem, the optimization problem is decomposed into\ntwo subproblems: CH assignment and SF/TP assignment. First, a matching-based\nalgorithm is introduced to address the CH assignment subproblem. Then, an\nattention-based multiagent reinforcement learning technique is employed to\naddress the SF/TP assignment subproblem for EDs allocated to the same CH, which\nreduces the number of learning agents to achieve fast convergence. The\nsimulation outcomes indicate that the proposed approach converges quickly under\nvarious parameter settings and obtains significantly better system EE than\nbaseline algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
