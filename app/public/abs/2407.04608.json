We formulate a non-convex SNL problem as\na multi-player non-convex potential game and investigate the existence and\nuniqueness of a Nash equilibrium (NE) in both the ideal setting without\nmeasurement noise and the practical setting with measurement noise. We first\nshow that the NE exists and is unique in the noiseless case, and corresponds to\nthe precise network localization. Then, we study the SNL for the case with\nerrors affecting the anchor node position and the inter-node distance\nmeasurements. Specifically, we establish that in case these errors are\nsufficiently small, the NE exists and is unique. It is shown that the NE is an\napproximate solution to the SNL problem, and that the position errors can be\nquantified accordingly. Based on these findings, we apply the results to case\nstudies involving only inter-node distance measurement errors and only anchor\nposition information inaccuracies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
