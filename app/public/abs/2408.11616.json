These datasets encompass a\ndiverse range of jet sources, including quark/gluon jets, jets from the decay\nof W bosons, top quarks, and heavy new-physics particles. The datasets provide\ndetailed substructure information, including jet kinematics, constituent\nkinematics, and track displacement details, enabling a wide range of\napplications in jet tagging, anomaly detection, and generative modelling.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MuE6_jneOiaKd8xqF8EIHvPtJuAxZnKeSgJOOeID51M","pdfSize":"1079122"}
