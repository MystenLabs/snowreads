Additional\nenhancements within the ID paradigm can be realized through supplementary\nresources such as quantum entanglement, common randomness (CR), and feedback.\nJoint transmission and sensing demonstrate significant benefits over\nseparation-based methods. Inspired by the significant impact of feedback on the\nID capacity, our work delves into the realm of joint ID and sensing (JIDAS) for\nstate-dependent multiple access channels (SD-MACs) with noiseless strictly\ncasual feedback. Here, the senders aim to convey ID messages to the receiver\nwhile simultaneously sensing the channel states. We establish a lower bound on\nthe capacity-distortion region of the SD-MACs. An example shows that JIDAS\noutperforms the separation-based approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
