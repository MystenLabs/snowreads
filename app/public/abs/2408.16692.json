Given\nan $n$-vertex $m$-edge simple graph $G$ of maximum degree $\\Delta$, we present\na randomized $O\\left(m\\,\\log^3 \\Delta\\,/\\,\\epsilon^2\\right)$-time algorithm\nthat computes a proper $(1+\\epsilon)\\Delta$-edge-coloring of $G$ with high\nprobability. This improves upon the best known results for a wide range of the\nparameters $\\epsilon$, $n$, and $\\Delta$. Our approach combines a flagging\nstrategy from earlier work of the author with a shifting procedure employed by\nDuan, He, and Zhang for dynamic edge-coloring. The resulting algorithm is\nsimple to implement and may be of practical interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
