This allows\nto build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical\nbehavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising\nquestions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work,\nwe demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single\nspin qubit efficiently, while also addressing critical aspects related to the\noptimization of experimental parameters.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
