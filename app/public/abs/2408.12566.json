Building upon the previously developed\nOptimized Mean Trajectory (OMT) approximation that has been used to compute\nlinear and nonlinear spectra, we borrow some ideas from filtering trajectory\nmethods to obtain a novel semiclassical method for the dynamical propagation of\ndensity matrices. This new approximation is tested rigorously against standard\nmultistate electronic models, spin-boson model, and models of the\nFenna-Matthews-Olson complex. In all instances, the current method is\nsignificantly better or as good as many other semiclassical methods available,\nespecially in low-temperature. All results are tested against the numerically\nexact Hierarchical Equations of Motion method. The new method shows excellent\nagreement across various parameter regimes with numerically exact results,\nhighlighting the robustness and accuracy of our approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"12TUVfi47u11xh42tAov_sgs1FuCLgd9m6X577efbgc","pdfSize":"885830"}
