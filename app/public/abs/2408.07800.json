This paper is a companion to [Lifshitz: Completing the\nproof of the Liebeck-Nikolov-Shalev conjecture] and together they prove the\nconjecture. In this paper we prove the conjecture in the regime where\n$|A|>|S|^c$ for an absolute constant c>0.\n  We also prove that the following Skew Product Theorem holds for all finite\nsimple groups. Namely we show that either the product of two conjugates of A\nhas size at least $|A|^{1.49}$, or S is the product of boundedly many\nconjugates of A.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
