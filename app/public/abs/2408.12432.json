We focused on carbon- and oxygen-bearing species\nthat trace photon-dominated regions (PDRs) and warm molecular cloud surfaces in\norder to understand the effect of UV radiation from the exciting stars on the\ncloud structure. We mapped four regions around the most prominent BRCs at\nscales of 4--10 arcmin in the HII region IC 1396 in [CII] 158 micron with\n(up)GREAT on board SOFIA. IC 1396 is predominantly excited by an O6.5V star.\nToward IC 1396A, we also observed [OI] 63 micron and 145 micron. We combined\nthese observations with JCMT archive data, which provide the low-J transitions\nof CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. All spectra are velocity-resolved. The line\nprofiles show a variety of velocity structures, which we investigated in detail\nfor all observed emission lines. We find no clear sign of photoevaporating\nflows in the [CII] spectra, although the uncertainty in the location of the\nBRCs along the line of sight makes this interpretation inconclusive. Our\nanalysis of the [$^{13}$CII] emission in IC 1396A suggests that the [CII] is\nlikely mostly optically thin. The heating efficiency, measured by the\n([CII]+[OI] 63 micron)/far-infrared intensity ratio, is higher in the northern\npart of IC 1396A than in the southern part, which may indicate a difference in\nthe dust properties of the two areas. The complex velocity structures\nidentified in the BRCs of IC 1396, which is apparently a relatively simple HII\nregion, highlight the importance of velocity-resolved data for disentangling\ndifferent components along the line of sight and thus facilitating a detailed\nstudy of the dynamics of the cloud. We also demonstrate that the optically thin\n[$^{13}$CII] and [OI] 145 micron emission lines are essential for a conclusive\ninterpretation of the [CII] 158 micron and [OI] 63 micron line profiles.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
