Due to the high\nfrequency and necessity of rescue services, there is always an increasing\ndemand for quick, accurate, and coordinated responses from rescue personnel to\nsave lives and mitigate damage. This paper introduces a rescue health\nmanagement software solution designed to improve the efficiency and\neffectiveness of rescue situational awareness by rapidly assessing the health\nstatus of emergency patients using AI-driven decision support systems. The\nnovelty in this software approach is it's user-centered design principles to\nensure that its solutions are specifically tailored to meet the unique\nrequirements of emergency responders. It used pre-trained machine learning\nmodels with rescue data and accepted new patient's input data to provide a\nprobability of the major health complications so that rescue personnel can\nexpedite treatment plan following the outcome. The paper focuses primarily on\nthe software development and implementation steps with three use cases, while\nalso providing a short overview of the previous machine learning-based\ndevelopment phases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
