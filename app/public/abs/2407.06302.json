However significant\ntechnology barriers exist in transporting weakly coherent photon states over\nthese distances: primarily photon loss and phase errors. Quantum telescopy,\nusing entangled states to link spatially separated apertures, offers a possible\nsolution to the loss of photons. We report on an initiative launched by NSF\nNOIRLab in collaboration with the Center for Quantum Networks and Arizona\nQuantum Initiative at the University of Arizona, Tucson, to explore these\nconcepts further. A brief description of the quantum concepts and a possible\ntechnology roadmap towards a quantum-enhanced very long baseline optical-NIR\ninterferometric array is presented. An on-sky demonstration of measuring\nspatial coherence of photons with apertures linked through the simplest\nGottesman protocol over short baselines and with limited phase fluctuations is\nenvisaged as the first step.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
