We focus on light\ncurves of RRLyrae type variables, in the Galactic globular cluster $\\omega$\nCentauri. Light curves are thus summarized by a handful of complex eigenvalues,\ncorresponding to oscillatory or fading dynamical modes. We find that variable\nstars of the RRc subclass can be summarized in terms of fewer ($\\approx 8$)\neigenvalues, while RRab need comparatively more ($\\approx 12$). This result can\nbe leveraged for classification and reflects the simpler structure of RRc light\ncurves. We then consider variable stars displaying secular variations due to\nthe Tseraskaya-Blazhko effect and find a change in relevant eigenvalues with\ntime, with possible implications for the physical interpretation of the effect.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
