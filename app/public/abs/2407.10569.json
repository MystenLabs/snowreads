The previously known algorithm has time complexity $O(n)$ for all\nranks $r>2$, however in case $r=2$ it was estimated only as $O(n^2)$. Here we\napply a new approach, based on explicit basis expansion and weighted rectangles\nsummation, which allows us to construct a much simpler algorithm with time\ncomplexity $O(n)$ for any $r\\geq 2$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
