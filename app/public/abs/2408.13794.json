Namely, for any spatial\ndimension except 1 and 4, any nontrivial solution of the Cauchy problem blows\nup in a finite time (except in special cases), whereas for dimensions 1 and 4\nthere exists a neighborhood of trivial initial data in the $C^1$ - norm such\nthat the respective solution preserves the initial smoothness globally. For\ndimension 1, the criterion of the singularity formation in terms of initial\ndata was known, i.e. this neighborhood can be found exactly.\n  For the case of dimension 4, there was no similar result. In this paper, we\nclose this gap and obtain such a criterion for the case of a more technically\ncomplicated case of dimension 4.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
