While most\nchange detection methods detect all changes, there is a growing need for\nspecialized methods targeting specific changes relevant to particular\napplications while discarding the other changes. For instance, urban management\nmight prioritize detecting the disappearance of buildings due to natural\ndisasters or other reasons. Furthermore, while most supervised change detection\nmethods require large-scale training datasets, in many applications only one or\ntwo training examples might be available instead of large datasets. Addressing\nsuch needs, we propose a focused CD approach using the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), a versatile vision foundation model. Our method leverages a binary mask\nof the object of interest in pre-change images to detect their disappearance in\npost-change images. By using SAM's robust segmentation capabilities, we create\nprompts from the pre-change mask, use those prompts to segment the post-change\nimage, and identify missing objects. This unsupervised approach demonstrated\nfor building disappearance detection, is adaptable to various domains requiring\nspecialized CD. Our contributions include defining a novel CD problem,\nproposing a method using SAM, and demonstrating its effectiveness. The proposed\nmethod also has benefits related to privacy preservation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
