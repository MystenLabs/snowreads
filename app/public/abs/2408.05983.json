DW solitons\nare formed in the nonlinear DW-ZF interactions and are confined between\nradially spaced micro-barriers. The resulting radial structures in the\nnonlinear DW-ZF interactions exhibit similar pattern to the ExB \"staircase\"\nobserved in numerical simulations. These micro-barriers are generated by the\nrepulsive response due to spontaneously excited ZF, which, as a general\nproperty demonstrated in this work, also generate an attractive nonlinear\npotential in DW equation. Meanwhile, the nonlinear potential due to beat-driven\nZF is always attractive and, as such, always serve as potential well to\ncontribute to soliton formation. For spontaneously excited ZF from initial\nnoise, the simultaneous excitation of solitons and micro-barriers is found to\nbe universal, due to the zero frequency nature of ZF and spatial structure of\nthe Reynolds stress. The present analysis, thus, provides a potential\nfirst-principle-based interpretation of the ExB staircase observed in\nsimulations, which may contribute to micro transport barriers formation and\nenhance plasma confinement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
