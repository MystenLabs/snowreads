This shift presents notable\nchallenges for the delineation of originality due to the varying degrees of\nhuman contribution in AI-assisted works. This study raises the research\nquestion of measuring human contribution in AI-assisted content generation and\nintroduces a framework to address this question that is grounded in information\ntheory. By calculating mutual information between human input and AI-assisted\noutput relative to self-information of AI-assisted output, we quantify the\nproportional information contribution of humans in content generation. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed measure effectively\ndiscriminates between varying degrees of human contribution across multiple\ncreative domains. We hope that this work lays a foundation for measuring human\ncontributions in AI-assisted content generation in the era of generative AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
