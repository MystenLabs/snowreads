We show that, in the presence of a coupling between the gauge boson and\nneutrinos, these transverse modes affect the propagation of neutrinos in the\ngalactic core. Neutrinos emitted from galactic or extra-galactic supernovae\ncould be delayed by $\\delta t = \\left(10^{-8}\\textrm{--}10^1\\right)$\\,s for the\ngauge boson masses $m_{A'} = \\left(10^{-23}\\textrm{--}10^{-19}\\right)$\\,eV and\nthe coupling with the neutrino $g= 10^{-27}\\textrm{--}10^{-20}$. While we do\nnot focus on a specific formation mechanism for the gauge boson as the dark\nmatter in the early Universe, we comment on some possible realizations. We\ndiscuss model-dependent current bounds on the gauge coupling from fifth-force\nexperiments, as well as future explorations involving supernovae neutrinos.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
