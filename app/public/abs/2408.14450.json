This issue can be\nmitigated by using OBC in conjunction with computationally efficient reduced\norder models (ROM). To demonstrate the potential of this combination, in this\npaper we develop an optimization-based ROM-ROM coupling for a transient\nadvection-diffusion transmission problem. The main challenge in this\nformulation is the generation of adjoint snapshots and reduced bases for the\nadjoint systems required by the optimizer. One of the main contributions of the\npaper is a new technique for efficient adjoint snapshot collection for\ngradient-based optimizers in the context of optimization-based ROM-ROM\ncouplings. We present numerical studies demonstrating the accuracy of the\napproach along with comparison between various approaches for selecting a\nreduced order basis for the adjoint systems, including decay of snapshot\nenergy, iteration counts, and timings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
