All categories and\nfunctors are assumed to be $\\Bbbk$-linear. We define a $G$-invariant bimodule\n${}_SM_R$ over $G$-categories $R, S$ and a $G$-graded bimodule ${}_BN_A$ over\n$G$-graded categories $A, B$, and introduce the orbit bimodule $M/G$ and the\nsmash product bimodule $N\\# G$. We will show that these constructions are\ninverses to each other. This will be applied to Morita equivalence, stable\nequivalences of Morita type, singular equivalences of Morita type, and singular\nequivalences of Morita type with level.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
