Results of the dynamo model show the strong impact of the radial\nturbulent diffusion on the surface evolution of the large-scale poloidal\nmagnetic field and on the hemispheric magnetic flux generation rate. To process\nthe observational data set we employ the parameters of the meridional\ncirculation and turbulent diffusion from the Surface Flux-Transport (SFT)\nmodels. We find that the observed evolution of the axisymmetric vector\npotential contains the time--latitude patterns which can result from the effect\nof turbulent diffusion of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field in the radial\ndirection. We think that, the SFT models can reconcile the observed rate of\nhemispheric magnetic flux generation by considering radial turbulent diffusion\nand lower values of the diffusion coefficient.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
