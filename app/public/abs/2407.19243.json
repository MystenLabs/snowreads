In\nthis work we examine this assumption, for which we propose a setup to study\nhard processes and bulk nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions on the same\nfooting using the Glauber modelling of heavy nuclei. To exemplify this\napproach, we calculate the leading-order corrections to azimuthal decorrelation\nin Drell-Yan and boson-jet processes due to cold nuclear matter effects, not\nconsidering radiation. At leading order in both the hard momentum scale and the\nnuclear size, the impact-parameter dependent cross section is found to\nfactorize for both processes. The factorization formula involves a convolution\nof the hard cross section with the medium-modified parton distributions, and,\nfor boson-jet production, the medium-modified jet function.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3GrHFK1bYWKZxXwb10pnjK6JkwWCfH_zKxuNWV_7uJw","pdfSize":"922908"}
