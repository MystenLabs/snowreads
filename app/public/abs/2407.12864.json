Developing\ntechniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph\nstructures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing\nspectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical\ncorrelation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based\non this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal\ngraph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these\nconcepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the\nadvantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing\nmethods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear\ninterpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and\nundirected graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
