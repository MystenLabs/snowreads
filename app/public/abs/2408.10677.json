The effect of active force on the\npolymer adsorption behavior and the combined effect of chain mobility, length\nN, rigidity \\k{appa}, and cylinder radius, R, on phase diagrams are\nsystemically investigated. We find that complete adsorption is replaced by\nirregular alternative adsorption/desorption process at a large driving force.\nThree typical (spiral, helix-like, rod-like) conformations of the active\npolymer are observed, dependent on N, \\k{appa}, and R. Dynamically, the polymer\nshows rotational motion in spiral state, snake-like motion in the intermediate\nstate, and straight translational motion without turning back in the rod-like\nstate. In the spiral state, we find that rotation velocity {\\omega} and chain\nlength follows a power-law relation {\\omega}~N^(-0.42), consistent with the\ntorque-balance theory of general Archimedean spirals. And the polymer shows\nsuper-diffusive behavior along the cylinder at long time in the helix-like and\nrod-like states. Our results highlight the mobility, rigidity, as well as\ncurvature of surface can be used to regulate the polymer behavior.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
