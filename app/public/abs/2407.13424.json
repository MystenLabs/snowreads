It\nmanifests in the power-law scaling of the transition time with $\\tau_{q}$ as\nthe system appears to enter the adiabatic regime, even though the ramp is\nalready terminated and the final quench value is held constant. This\nintermediate regime, which we dub as the delayed KZM, emerges due to the\ndissipation preventing the system from freezing in the impulse regime. This\nresults in a large delay between the actual time the system undergoes a phase\ntransition and the time inferred from a threshold-based criterion for the order\nparameter, as done in most experiments. We demonstrate using the open Dicke\nmodel and its one-dimensional lattice version that this phenomenon is a generic\nfeature of open systems that can be mapped onto an effective coupled oscillator\nmodel. We also show that the phenomenon becomes more prominent near\ncriticality, and its effects on the transition time measurement can be further\nexacerbated by large threshold values for an order parameter. Due to this, we\npropose an alternative method for threshold-based criterion which uses the\nspatio-temporal information, such as the system's defect number, for\nidentifying the transition time.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
