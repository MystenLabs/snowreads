Besides the\nbarriers of any programming language, users face challenges inherent to 3D\nspatial interaction. Scripting simple operations, such as moving an element in\n3D space, can be significantly more challenging than performing the same task\nusing direct manipulation. We introduce the concept of bidirectional\nprogramming for Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) CAD tools, informed by\ninterviews we performed with programmatic interface users. We describe how\nusers can navigate and edit the 3D model using direct manipulation in the view\nor code editing while the system ensures consistency between both spaces. We\nalso detail a proof-of-concept implementation using a modified version of\nOpenSCAD.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yHXlY4obQy6X313hvWCjPZCFMA689t6Bc4t7mjXDlsA","pdfSize":"3655405"}
