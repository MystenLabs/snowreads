However, the high costs and limited availability of certain\nmodalities pose significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper\nproposed the Condition-Aligned Temporal Diffusion (CATD) framework for\nend-to-end cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging, enabling the generation of\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-detected Blood Oxygen Level\nDependent (BOLD) signals from more accessible Electroencephalography (EEG)\nsignals. By constructing Conditionally Aligned Block (CAB), heterogeneous\nneuroimages are aligned into a potential space, achieving a unified\nrepresentation that provides the foundation for cross-modal transformation in\nneuroimaging. The combination with the constructed Dynamic Time-Frequency\nSegmentation (DTFS) module also enables the use of EEG signals to improve the\ntemporal resolution of BOLD signals, thus augmenting the capture of the dynamic\ndetails of the brain. Experimental validation demonstrated the effectiveness of\nthe framework in improving the accuracy of neural activity prediction,\nidentifying abnormal brain regions, and enhancing the temporal resolution of\nBOLD signals. The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal\nsynthesis of neuroimaging by unifying heterogeneous neuroimaging data into a\npotential representation space, showing promise in medical applications such as\nimproving Parkinson's disease prediction and identifying abnormal brain\nregions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
