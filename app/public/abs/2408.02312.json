Based on the factor graph framework, we\ndesign a joint channel estimation and detection scheme that combines the\nexpectation maximization (EM) algorithm and the ubiquitous belief propagation\n(BP) algorithm. Interweaving the iterations of both schemes significantly\nreduces the EM algorithm's computational burden while retaining its excellent\nperformance. To this end, we apply simple yet effective model-based learning\nmethods to find a suitable parameter update schedule by introducing momentum in\nboth the EM parameter updates as well as in the BP message passing. Numerical\nsimulations verify that the proposed method can learn efficient schedules that\ngeneralize well and even outperform coherent BP detection in high\nsignal-to-noise scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
