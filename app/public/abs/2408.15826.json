Based\non the topological invariant, the behaviors of the localization length of the\nzero-energy modes, and quantum transport, we identify its existence in several\nall-band-flat models with the disordered potentials or hopping including the\n$\\pi$-flux Creutz ladder, the fully dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, and\n$\\pi$-flux diamond chain. Unlike the topological Anderson insulator, where\ndisorder induces localization and exponential suppression of transport, the\ndisorder-assisted quantum ballistic coherent transport can appear in the\ntopological inverse Anderson insulator. In addition, our proposal and results\ncould be realized by the current experimental techniques.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DjkWRdEHUwKiGJ0R-JkQCLDfj0uac83xUu199TZIBkg","pdfSize":"1599073"}
