Despite its popularity,\ndeploying a production-ready Kubernetes cluster on-premises can be challenging\nfor system administrators. Many of the proprietary integrations that\napplication developers take for granted in commercial cloud environments must\nbe replaced with alternatives when deployed locally. This article will compare\nthree popular deployment strategies for sites deploying Kubernetes on-premise:\nKubeadm with Kubespray, OpenShift / OKD and Rancher via K3S/RKE2.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
