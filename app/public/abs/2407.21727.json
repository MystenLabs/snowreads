Within these fields, a broad range of\napplications needs to be covered. These applications range from solids to\nmolecular systems, from organic to inorganic chemistry, or even from electrons\nto other fermions such as protons or muons. This is emphasized by the plethora\nof density functional approximations that have been developed for various\ncases. In this work, a new local hybrid exchange-correlation density functional\nis constructed from first principles, promoting generality and transferability.\nWe show that constraint satisfaction can be achieved even for admixtures with\nfull exact exchange, without sacrificing accuracy. The performance of the new\nfunctional for electronic structure theory is assessed for thermochemical\nproperties, excitation energies, M\\\"ossbauer isomer shifts, NMR spin-spin\ncoupling constants, NMR shieldings and shifts, magnetizabilities, EPR hyperfine\ncoupling constants, and EPR g-tensors. The new density functional shows a\nrobust performance throughout all tests and is numerically robust only\nrequiring small grids for converged results. Additionally, the functional can\nbe easily generalized to arbitrary fermions as shown for electron-proton\ncorrelation energies. Therefore, we outline that density functionals generated\nin this way are general purpose tools for quantum mechanical studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
