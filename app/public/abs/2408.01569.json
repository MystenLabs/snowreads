Still, state-of-the-art methods are challenged by\nlow-texture environments, which is common for underwater settings. This makes\nit difficult to use existing methods in diverse, real-world scenes. In this\npaper, we present TURTLMap, a novel solution that focuses on textureless\nunderwater environments through a real-time localization and mapping method. We\nshow that this method is low-cost, and capable of tracking the robot\naccurately, while constructing a dense map of a low-textured environment in\nreal-time. We evaluate the proposed method using real-world data collected in\nan indoor water tank with a motion capture system and ground truth reference\nmap. Qualitative and quantitative results validate the proposed system achieves\naccurate and robust localization and precise dense mapping, even when subject\nto wave conditions.
