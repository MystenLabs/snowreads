We study the proportion\nof irreducible characters of $\\mathrm{GL}(n,q)$ whose values evaluated on a\nfixed matrix $g$ are divisible by $d$. As $n$ approaches infinity, this\nproportion tends to $1$ when $q$ is coprime to $d$. When $q$ and $d$ are not\ncoprime, and $g=1$, this proportion is bounded above by $\\frac{1}{q}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"picis1LSm3wrnxl9HMUZoIZE-sW_8PgMNAq5irFNdN0","pdfSize":"224278"}
