Their progenitors are believed\nto contain a low-mass H envelope before explosion. This work reports the\ndiscovery of a progenitor candidate in pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope\nimages for the Type IIb SN~2017gkk. With detailed analysis of its spectral\nenergy distribution and local environment, we suggest that the progenitor is\nmost likely a yellow supergiant with significant circumstellar extinction and\nhas an initial mass of about 16 $M_\\odot$, effective temperature log($T_{\\rm\neff}/K)=3.72\\pm0.08$ and luminosity log($L/L_{\\odot})=5.17\\pm0.04$. This\nprogenitor is not massive enough to strip envelope through stellar wind, and it\nsupports an interacting binary progenitor channel and adds to the growing list\nof direct progenitor detections for Type~IIb SNe. Future late-time observations\nwill confirm whether this progenitor candidate has disappeared and reveal the\nputative binary companion that has survived the explosion.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
