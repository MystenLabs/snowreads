They are commonly and historically determined via\ndispersion relations using a vast catalogue of experimentally measured,\nlow-energy $e^+e^-\\to \\,\\rm{hadrons}$ cross section data as input. These\ndispersive estimates result in a SM prediction that exhibits a muon $g$$-$$2$\ndiscrepancy of more than $5\\sigma$ when compared to experiment. However, recent\nlattice QCD evaluations of the HVP and a new hadronic cross section measurement\nfrom the CMD-3 experiment favor a no-new-physics scenario and, therefore,\nexhibit a common tension with the previous $e^+e^-\\to \\,\\rm{hadrons}$ data.\nThis study explores the current and future implications of these two scenarios\non other observables that are also sensitive to the HVP contributions in the\nhope that they may provide independent tests of the current tensions observed\nin the muon $g$$-$$2$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
