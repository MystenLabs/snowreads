We show that the solutions of\nthese TBA equations agree with the quantum periods of the corresponding quantum\nSeiberg-Witten curves defined in the Nekrosov-Shatashvili limit of the Omega\nbackground, including a centrifugal correction. We study the variety of TBA\nsystems across the Coulomb branch moduli space and find that they correspond to\nthe Dynkin diagrams of $D_n$ Lie algebras in the minimal chamber, and reproduce\nthe TBA equations for reflectionless D scattering theories at the maximally\nsymmetric point. Numerical computations demonstrate that the quantum periods\nobtained from the Borel-Pad\\'e resummation and their WKB expansions are in\nagreement with the solutions of the TBA equations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
