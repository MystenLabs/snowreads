In this\nsetting, the adversary (only) controls their own application client, which they\nuse to \"inject\" chosen payloads to a victim's client via, for example, sharing\ncredentials with them. The injections are interleaved with adversarial\nobservations of some form of protected state (such as encrypted vault exports\nor the network traffic received by the application servers), from which the\nadversary backs out confidential information. We uncover a series of general\ndesign patterns in popular password managers that lead to vulnerabilities\nallowing an adversary to efficiently recover passwords, URLs, usernames, and\nattachments. We develop general attack templates to exploit these design\npatterns and experimentally showcase their practical efficacy via analysis of\nten distinct password manager applications. We disclosed our findings to these\nvendors, many of which deployed mitigations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RiJWIk-oGDDjMd02ruE8q2_7Ou2dChqaMk3BmXKUdUU","pdfSize":"442580"}
