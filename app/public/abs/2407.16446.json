In our observational review, we attempt to collect some fundamental new\nresults, which can largely be linked to the Big data era that has arrived due\nto the expansion of space photometric observations of the last two decades. We\nlist the different types of stars showing flare activity, their observation\nstrategies, and discuss how their main stellar properties relate to the\ncharacteristics of the flares (or even CMEs) they emit. Our goal is to focus,\nwithout claiming to be complete, on those results that may in one way or\nanother challenge the \"standard\" flare model based on the solar paradigm.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
