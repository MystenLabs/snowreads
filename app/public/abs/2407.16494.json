This\ncoarse geometric framework, grounded in physical principles, offers a natural\nsetting for the bulk-boundary correspondence, reproduces physical knowledge,\nand leads to an efficient and tractable numerical approach for calculating\ninvariants. As a showcase, we give a detailed discussion of the framework for\nthree-dimensional systems with time-reversal symmetry. We numerically reproduce\nthe known disorder-free phase diagram of a tunable, effective tight-binding\nmodel and analyze the evolution of the topological phase under disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
