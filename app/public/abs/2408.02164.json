Previous studies claim continuous performance improvements, but our\nfindings challenge such assertions. Using these insights, we propose a unified\nprotocol for database partitioning that ensures fairness and comparability. We\nprovide detailed demographic annotations (in terms of race, gender and age),\nevaluation metrics, and a common framework for expression recognition, action\nunit detection and valence-arousal estimation. We also rerun the methods with\nthe new protocol and introduce a new leaderboards to encourage future research\nin affect recognition with a fairer comparison.
