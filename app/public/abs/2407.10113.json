This way, it enables for a lower energy consumption\ncompared to the original sub-optimal sliding mode (SM) algorithm, both\ncommutating a discontinuous control signal. In this paper, the energy-saving\nsub-optimal SM control is experimentally benchmarked against a standard\nsecond-order SM controller which also has a discontinuous control action. Here\nthe so-called terminal second-order SM algorithm is used. The controlled plant\nis affected by the matched bounded disturbances which are unknown, and the\noutput is additionally subject to the sensor noise. Moreover, a first-order\nactuator dynamics can lead to chattering, which is parasitic for SM\napplications. For a fair comparison, the same quadratic terminal surface is\ndesigned when benchmarking both SM controllers. Both experimentally compared SM\nalgorithms have the same (bounded) control magnitude and states initial\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
