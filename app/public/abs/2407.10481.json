Natural language serves as\na flexible interface for controlling these models, allowing expert and\nnon-expert users to quickly create and edit their animations. Many recent\nphysics-based animation methods, including those that use text interfaces,\ntrain control policies using reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling\nthese methods beyond several hundred motions has remained challenging.\nMeanwhile, kinematic animation models are able to successfully learn from\nthousands of diverse motions by leveraging supervised learning methods.\nInspired by these successes, in this work we introduce SuperPADL, a scalable\nframework for physics-based text-to-motion that leverages both RL and\nsupervised learning to train controllers on thousands of diverse motion clips.\nSuperPADL is trained in stages using progressive distillation, starting with a\nlarge number of specialized experts using RL. These experts are then\niteratively distilled into larger, more robust policies using a combination of\nreinforcement learning and supervised learning. Our final SuperPADL controller\nis trained on a dataset containing over 5000 skills and runs in real time on a\nconsumer GPU. Moreover, our policy can naturally transition between skills,\nallowing for users to interactively craft multi-stage animations. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that SuperPADL significantly outperforms RL-based\nbaselines at this large data scale.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
