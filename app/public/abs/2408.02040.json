We introduce a second set of\n\"martial\" operators {\\martial_i} that generate the full commutant, and show how\na Hopf-algebraic approach naturally reproduces the operators $\\xi^\\nu$ from\n[Nenashev]. We then pause to study Klyachko's homomorphism $H^*(Fl(n)) \\to\nH^*($the permutahedral toric variety$)$, and extract the part of it relevant to\nSchubert calculus, the \"affine-linear genus''. This genus is then re-obtained\nusing Leibniz combinations of the {\\martial_i}. We use Nadeau-Tewari's\n$q$-analogue of Klyachko's genus to study the equidistribution of $\\ell$ and\ncomaj on $[n]\\choose k$, generalizing known results on $S_n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
