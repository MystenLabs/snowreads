Replacing the spacelike with a timelike\nhypersurface, we construct one-particle states of massive Klein-Gordon theory\nthat are localized on the hypersurface in the temporal as well as two spatial\ndirections. This addresses the longstanding problem of a \"time operator\" in\nquantum theory. It is made possible by recent advances in quantization on\ntimelike hypersurfaces and the introduction of evanescent particles. As a first\napplication of time-localized states, we consider the time-of-arrival problem.\nOur results are in accordance with semiclassical expectations of causal\npropagation of massless and massive particles. As in the Newton-Wigner case,\nlocalization is not perfect, but apparent superluminal propagation is\nexponentially suppressed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
