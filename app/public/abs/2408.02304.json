In order to reduce memory costs and\nimprove efficiency, various approaches are proposed to compress the embedding\ntables. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of embedding\ncompression approaches in recommender systems. We first introduce deep learning\nrecommendation models and the basic concept of embedding compression in\nrecommender systems. Subsequently, we systematically organize existing\napproaches into three categories, namely low-precision, mixed-dimension, and\nweight-sharing, respectively. Lastly, we summarize the survey with some general\nsuggestions and provide future prospects for this field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
