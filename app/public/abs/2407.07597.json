The generalization of\nthe EM polarizabilities to non-zero four-momentum transfer opens up a powerful\npath to study the internal structure of the proton. They map out the spatial\ndistribution of the polarization densities in the proton, provide access to key\ndynamical mechanisms that contribute to the electric and the magnetic\npolarizability effects, and allow to determine fundamental characteristics of\nthe system, such as the electric and the magnetic polarizability radii. This\narticle reviews the knowledge of the proton EM generalized polarizabilities. An\nintroduction is given to the basic concepts and to the theoretical framework,\nthat is then followed by a discussion that emphasizes the recent developments\nand findings of the Virtual Compton scattering experiments and future\nperspectives on the topic.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
