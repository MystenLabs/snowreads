The dynamic issues in ISTNs, arising from\nthe movement of low Earth orbit satellites (LEOSats) and the mobility of users\n(UEs), are addressed. The goal is to maximize the sum rate by optimizing link\nselection for UEs over time. To tackle this challenge, an efficient iterative\nalgorithm is developed. Simulations using a realistic 3D map provide valuable\ninsights into the impact of urban environments on ISTNs and also demonstrates\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
