The efficiency\nin their execution has a crucial business impact since shell commands very\noften aim to execute critical operations, such as the resolution of system\nfaults. However, many shell commands involve long parameters that make them\nhard to remember and type. Additionally, the experience and knowledge of SREs\nusing these commands are almost always not preserved. In this work, we propose\nSHREC, a SRE behaviour knowledge graph model for shell command recommendations.\nWe model the SRE shell behaviour knowledge as a knowledge graph and propose a\nstrategy to directly extract such a knowledge from SRE historical shell\noperations. The knowledge graph is then used to provide shell command\nrecommendations in real-time to improve the SRE operation efficiency. Our\nempirical study based on real shell commands executed in our company\ndemonstrates that SHREC can improve the SRE operation efficiency, allowing to\nshare and re-utilize the SRE knowledge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
