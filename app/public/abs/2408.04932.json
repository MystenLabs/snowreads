Deep learning (DL)\ntechniques provide new opportunities for accurate impedance prediction by\nestablishing a nonlinear mapping between seismic data and impedance. However,\nexisting methods primarily use time domain seismic data, which limits the\ncapture of frequency bands, thus leading to insufficient resolution of the\ninversion results. To address these problems, we introduce a new\ntime-frequency-phase (TFP) mixed-domain closed-loop seismic inversion network\n(TFP-CSIN) to improve the identification of thin layers and reservoirs. First,\nthe inversion network and closed-loop network are constructed by using\nbidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) and convolutional neural network\n(CNN) architectures, enabling bidirectional mapping between seismic data and\nimpedance data. Next, to comprehensive learning across the entire frequency\nspectrum, the Fourier transform is used to capture frequency information and\nestablish frequency domain constraints. At the same time, the phase domain\nconstraint is introduced through Hilbert transformation, which improves the\nmethod's ability to recognize the weak reflection region features. Both\nexperiments on the synthetic data show that TFP-CSIN outperforms the\ntraditional supervised learning method and time domain semi-supervised learning\nmethods in seismic inversion. The field data further verify that the proposed\nmethod improves the identification ability of weak reflection areas and thin\nlayers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
