However, real-world point cloud data inevitably contains\nnoise, impacting model robustness. While recent efforts focus on enhancing\nrobustness through various strategies, there still remains a gap in\ncomprehensive analyzes from the standpoint of network architecture design.\nUnlike traditional methods that rely on generic techniques, our approach\noptimizes model robustness to noise corruption through network architecture\ndesign. Inspired by the token-mixing technique applied in 2D images, we propose\nSet-Mixer, a noise-robust aggregation module which facilitates communication\namong all points to extract geometric shape information and mitigating the\ninfluence of individual noise points. A sorting strategy is designed to enable\nour module to be invariant to point permutation, which also tackles the\nunordered structure of point cloud and introduces consistent relative spatial\ninformation. Experiments conducted on ModelNet40-C indicate that Set-Mixer\nsignificantly enhances the model performance on noisy point clouds,\nunderscoring its potential to advance real-world applicability in 3D\nrecognition and perception tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
