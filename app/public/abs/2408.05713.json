However, these generative models are\nprone to generating visual artifacts and false image structures, resulting in\nunnatural Real-ISR results. Based on the fact that natural images exhibit high\nself-similarities, i.e., a local patch can have many similar patches to it in\nthe whole image, in this work we propose a simple yet effective self-similarity\nloss (SSL) to improve the performance of generative Real-ISR models, enhancing\nthe hallucination of structural and textural details while reducing the\nunpleasant visual artifacts. Specifically, we compute a self-similarity graph\n(SSG) of the ground-truth image, and enforce the SSG of Real-ISR output to be\nclose to it. To reduce the training cost and focus on edge areas, we generate\nan edge mask from the ground-truth image, and compute the SSG only on the\nmasked pixels. The proposed SSL serves as a general plug-and-play penalty,\nwhich could be easily applied to the off-the-shelf Real-ISR models. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that, by coupling with SSL, the performance of many\nstate-of-the-art Real-ISR models, including those GAN and DM based ones, can be\nlargely improved, reproducing more perceptually realistic image details and\neliminating many false reconstructions and visual artifacts.
