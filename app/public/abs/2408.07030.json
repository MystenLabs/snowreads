We show that the arising concept of $r$-realizabilty has\nthe property that all axioms of Kripke-Platek set theory are $r$-realizable and\nthat the set of $r$-realizable statements is closed under intuitionistic\nprovability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
