However, this is at\nthe expense of memory and compute requirements, which also need to be\nincreased. Various efficiency techniques have been proposed to rein in hardware\ncosts, one being the use of low precision numerics. Recent accelerators have\nintroduced several different 8-bit data types to help accommodate DNNs in terms\nof numerics. In this paper, we identify a metric driven methodology to aid in\nthe choice of numerics. We demonstrate how such a methodology can help scale\ntraining of a language representation model. The technique can be generalized\nto other model architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
