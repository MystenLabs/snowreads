The observation of the\nzero-frequency fluctuation is consistent with theoretical and numerical\npredictions of zonal modes pumped by Alfv\\'en modes, and is correlated with an\nincrease in the deep core ion temperature, temperature gradient, and\nconfinement factor $H_{89,P}$. Despite the energetic particle transport induced\nby the Alfv\\'en eigenmodes, the generation of a zero-frequency fluctuation that\ncan suppress the turbulence leads to an overall improvement of confinement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
