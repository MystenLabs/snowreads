However,\nalthough the theory for wavelength in the RW metric includes the cosmological\nredshift, the same is not simply deduced for frequency (the inverse of time).\nInstead, cosmological time dilation $T_{0} = T_{\\text{emit}} (1+z)$ is an\nadditional assumption made to uphold the hypothesis of constant speed of light\nrather than a relation directly derived from the RW metric. Therefore,\nverifying cosmological time dilation observationally is crucial. The most\nrecent data employing supernovae for this purpose was released recently by the\nDark Energy Survey. Results from the i-band specifically support variations in\nthe speed of light within 1-$\\sigma$. We used these observations to investigate\nvariations in various physical quantities, including $c$ and $G$, using the\nminimally extended varying speed of light model. The speed of light was $0.4$\\%\nto $2.2$\\% slower, and Newton's constant may have decreased by $1.7$\\% to\n$8.4$\\% compared to their current values at redshift $2$. These findings,\nconsistent with previous studies, hint at resolving tensions between different\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological backgrounds but are not yet conclusive evidence of a\nvarying speed of light, as the full-band data aligns with standard model\ncosmology.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
