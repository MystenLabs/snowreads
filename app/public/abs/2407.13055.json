However, FHE introduces tremendous computational overhead for\nprocessing encrypted data, causing FHE workloads to become 2-6 orders of\nmagnitude slower than their unencrypted counterparts. To mitigate the overhead,\nwe propose Cheddar, an FHE library for CUDA GPUs, which demonstrates\nsignificantly faster performance compared to prior GPU implementations. We\ndevelop optimized functionalities at various implementation levels ranging from\nefficient low-level primitives to streamlined high-level operational sequences.\nEspecially, we improve major FHE operations, including number-theoretic\ntransform and base conversion, based on efficient kernel designs using a small\nword size of 32 bits. By these means, Cheddar demonstrates 2.9 to 25.6 times\nhigher performance for representative FHE workloads compared to prior GPU\nimplementations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
