To mitigate this issue, we\nopen-source the details of a universally applicable data processing pipeline\nand validate its effectiveness and potential by introducing a competitive LLM\nbaseline. Specifically, the data processing pipeline consists of broad\ncollection to scale up and reweighting to improve quality. We then pretrain a\n7B model BaichuanSEED with 3T tokens processed by our pipeline without any\ndeliberate downstream task-related optimization, followed by an easy but\neffective supervised fine-tuning stage. BaichuanSEED demonstrates consistency\nand predictability throughout training and achieves comparable performance on\ncomprehensive benchmarks with several commercial advanced large language\nmodels, such as Qwen1.5 and Llama3. We also conduct several heuristic\nexperiments to discuss the potential for further optimization of downstream\ntasks, such as mathematics and coding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
