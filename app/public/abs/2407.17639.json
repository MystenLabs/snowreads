We obtain\nresults on existence and stability of the equilibria of the system, in terms of\nthe basic reproduction number~$R_0$. Under light constraints, we show that the\nbasic reproduction number~$R_0$ is equivalent to the basic reproduction number\nof the NIMFA model on static networks. Based on numerical simulations, we\ndemonstrate that with just two communities periodic behaviour can occur, which\ncontrasts the case with only a single community, in which periodicity was ruled\nout analytically. We also find that breaking connections between communities is\nmore fruitful compared to breaking connections within communities to reduce the\ndisease outbreak on dense networks, but both strategies are viable to networks\nwith fewer links. Finally, we emphasise that our method of modelling adaptivity\nis not limited to SIS models, but has huge potential to be applied in other\ncompartmental models in epidemiology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
