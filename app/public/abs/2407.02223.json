In this paper, we apply a novel approach based on\nsparse Bayesian deep learning for the system identification of lettuce\ngreenhouse models. The method leverages the power of deep neural networks while\nincorporating Bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty in the weights of\na Neural ODE. The simulation results show that the generated model can capture\nthe intrinsic nonlinear behavior of the greenhouse system with probabilistic\nestimates of environmental variables and lettuce growth within the greenhouse.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
