This paper models the\nrelationship between the utility company and flexible electricity users as a\nStackelberg game. Based on this model, we present a series of analytical\nresults under certain conditions. First, we give an analytical Stackelberg\nequilibrium, namely the optimal pricing formula for utility company, as well as\nthe unique and strict Nash equilibrium for users' electricity demand under this\npricing scheme. To our best knowledge, it is the first optimal pricing formula\nin the research of price-based DR strategies. Also, if there exist prediction\nerrors for the supply and demand of electricity, we provide an analytical\nexpression for the energy supply cost of utility company. Moreover, a\nsufficient condition has been proposed that all electricity demands can be\nsupplied by renewable energy. When the conditions for analytical results are\nnot met, we provide a numerical solution algorithm for the Stackelberg\nequilibrium and verify its efficiency by simulation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
