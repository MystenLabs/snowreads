A composite defect is\nconstructed in the $(3-\\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\\text{O}(N)$ vector model\nwith line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to\nnon-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group\n$\\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\\text{O}(m)\\times\\text{O}(N-m)$ on the\nline defect, there is an $\\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while\ntwo additional $\\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\\ge 23$. We\nalso examine a $\\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the\nsub-defect and show that the $\\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by\nperturbative calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
