Since the\nPoisson mean must be nonnegative, the mixing distribution is typically assumed\nto have nonnegative support. We show this assumption is unnecessary and\nreal-valued mixing distributions are also possible. Informally, the mixing\ndistribution merely needs to have a light (subexponential) left tail and a\nsmall amount of probability mass on negative values. We provide several\nconcrete examples, including the mixed Poisson-extreme stable family, where the\nmixing distribution has a power law tail.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
