The\npaper gives a comprehensive account of the problem of weak operator stability,\ncontaining a few new results and some unanswered questions. It also gives an\nupdated review of the literature on the weak stability of operators over the\npast sixty years, including present-day research trends. It is verified that\nthe majority of the weak stability literature is concentrated on Hilbert-space\noperators. We discuss why this preference occurs and also why the weak\nstability of unitary operators is central to the Hilbert-space stability\nproblem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
