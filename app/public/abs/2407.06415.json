Simulating quantum circuits requires\ngeometric time and space complexities, impacting the size of the quantum\ncircuit that can be simulated as well as the respective time required to\nsimulate a particular circuit. Applying the parallelism inherent in the\nsimulation and crafting custom architectures, larger quantum circuits can be\nsimulated. A scalable accelerator architecture is proposed to provide a high\nperformance, highly parallel, accelerator. Among the challenges of creating a\nscalable architecture is managing parallelism, efficiently routing quantum\nstate components for gate evaluation, and measurement. An example is\ndemonstrated on an Intel Agilex field programmable gate array (FPGA).\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
