The Mermin-Wagner theorem states that\nlong-range correlations in reduced dimensions are stabilized and controlled by\nmagnetic anisotropy. In this study, we meticulously create and control the\nin-plane easy-axis magnetic anisotropy within two-dimensional (2D) van der\nWaals antiferromagnet MnPSe3 via a novel method involving topography and\ntherefore strain control by using a micro-patterned substrate. By transposing\nthe MnPSe3 thin flakes onto a substrate patterned with micro-scale grooves, we\nintroduce local uniaxial strain pattern, which not only locks the spin\ndirection to the strain direction but also replicates the groove pattern in the\nspin orientation distribution. Our approach generates spin orientations that\ncorrespond to the substrate patterns, therefore having the potential to\nsignificantly advance spintronic devices by offering a unique method for\nmanipulating and designing spin textures in easy-plane magnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
