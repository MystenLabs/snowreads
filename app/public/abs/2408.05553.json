Key parameters explored include the differential\nblend ratio of NH3/H2 fuels, ignition conditions, flow dynamics, and the\nbalance between accuracy and computational cost using reduced chemical kinetic\nmechanisms. The numerical simulation findings suggest optimal operational\nconditions for enhancing thermal efficiency and controlling NOx emissions for\nexperimental setups, scaling up combustion platforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
