We compute these\nuniversal building blocks -- known as splitting amplitudes -- for two collinear\nQCD partons up to third loop order in QCD. Our results describe arbitrary\ntime-like splitting processes. Due to the violation of strict collinear\nfactorization in space-like splitting processes, we specifically present\nspace-like splitting amplitudes for three-parton QCD scattering amplitudes at\nthird loop order. To achieve our results, we perform a collinear expansion of\nthree-loop scattering amplitudes using a new expansion-by-subgraph technology,\nwhich is based on the method of regions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
