However, studies have shown\nthat, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViTs are also susceptible to\nadversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations in the input can fool the model\ninto making false predictions. This paper studies the transferability of such\nan adversarial vulnerability from a pre-trained ViT model to downstream tasks.\nWe focus on \\emph{sample-wise} transfer attacks and propose a novel attack\nmethod termed \\emph{Downstream Transfer Attack (DTA)}. For a given test image,\nDTA leverages a pre-trained ViT model to craft the adversarial example and then\napplies the adversarial example to attack a fine-tuned version of the model on\na downstream dataset. During the attack, DTA identifies and exploits the most\nvulnerable layers of the pre-trained model guided by a cosine similarity loss\nto craft highly transferable attacks. Through extensive experiments with\npre-trained ViTs by 3 distinct pre-training methods, 3 fine-tuning schemes, and\nacross 10 diverse downstream datasets, we show that DTA achieves an average\nattack success rate (ASR) exceeding 90\\%, surpassing existing methods by a huge\nmargin. When used with adversarial training, the adversarial examples generated\nby our DTA can significantly improve the model's robustness to different\ndownstream transfer attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p4pC5EPS1oCDIj09ek_TM9EraaU7PiAHNG1LboHX2aA","pdfSize":"901017","txDigest":"GWeW7g1CQSC8ThsBKddbnqLNFQiLz7b8KN9tmwpwcTmQ","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
