More\nspecifically, we focus on solving the Wasserstein-distance-based\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for the problem, which\nmaximizes the worst-case expected objective over an uncertainty set including\nall distributions closed enough to a nominal distribution with respect to the\nWasserstein distance. We develop a stochastic gradient descent algorithm based\non the idea of data augmentation to solve the model efficiently. The algorithm\niteratively a) does a bootstrapping sample from the nominal distribution; b)\nperturbs the adversarially and c) updates decisions. Accordingly, the\ncomputational time of the algorithm is only determined by the number of\niterations and the complexity of computing the gradient of a single sample.\nExcept for efficiently solving the model, the algorithm provide additional\nadvantages that the proposed algorithm can cope with any nominal distributions\nand therefore is extendable to solve the problem in an online setting. We also\nprove that the algorithm converges to the optimal solution of the DRO model at\na rate of a $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations of\nbootstrapping. Consequently, the performance guarantee of the algorithm is that\nof the DRO model plus $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$. Through extensive numerical experiments,\nwe demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm to several\nbenchmarks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
