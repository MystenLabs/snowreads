This problem\nis important for applications in various domains including ecology, economics,\nand sociology. The problem is computationally challenging due to the\nexponential number of regional colocation patterns and candidate regions.\nPreviously, we proposed a miner \\cite{10.1145/3557989.3566158} that finds\nstatistically significant regional colocation patterns. However, the numerous\nsimultaneous statistical inferences raise the risk of false discoveries (also\nknown as the multiple comparisons problem) and carry a high computational cost.\nWe propose a novel algorithm, namely, multiple comparisons regional colocation\nminer (MultComp-RCM) which uses a Bonferroni correction. Theoretical analysis,\nexperimental evaluation, and case study results show that the proposed method\nreduces both the false discovery rate and computational cost.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vAoMFTkL0imk2kGDuGts8Ja5rOgwzc4DcTagMftEjow","pdfSize":"29139477"}
