Beam Steering is an essential\ntask for light sources. The Linac To Undulator is very difficult to steer and\naim due to the changes of each use of the accelerator there must be\nre-calibration of magnets. However with each use of the Beamline its current\nmethod of steering runs into issues when faced with calibrating angles and\npositions. Human operators spend a substantial amount of time and resources on\nthe task. We developed multiple different feed-forward-neural networks with\nvarying hyper-parameters, inputs, and outputs, seeking to compare their\nperformance. Specifically, our smaller models with 33 inputs and 13 outputs\noutperformed the larger models with 73 inputs and 50 outputs. We propose the\nfollowing explanations for this lack of performance in larger models. First, a\nlack of training time and computational power limited the ability of our models\nto mature. Given more time, our models would outperform SVD. Second, when the\ninput size of the model increases the noise increases as well. In this case\nmore inputs corresponded to a greater length upon the LINAC accelerator. Less\nspecific and larger models that seek to make more predictions will inherently\nperform worse than SVD.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
