It asks whether the ring structure of\nthe twisted group ring determines the group up to isomorphism. In this article,\nwe study the TGRIP for direct product and central product of groups. We provide\nsome criteria to answer the TGRIP for groups by answering the TGRIP for the\nassociated quotients. As an application of these results, we provide several\nexamples. Finally, we answer the TGRIP for extra-special p-groups, and for the\ngroups of order $p^5$, where $p \\geq 5$ is a prime, except a list of five\ngroups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
