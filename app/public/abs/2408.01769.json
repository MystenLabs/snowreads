A key challenge is identifying the optimal code construction that\nmaximizes both dimension and distance. Recent advancements have produced\nseveral constructions, but these either depend on specific good quantum\nlow-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes or are limited to three dimensions. In\nthis work, we introduce a construction that can transform any good qLDPC code\ninto an optimal geometrically local quantum code. Our approach hinges on a\nnovel procedure that extracts a two-dimensional structure from an arbitrary\nthree-term chain complex. We expect that this procedure will find broader\napplications in areas such as weight reduction and the geometric realization of\nchain complexes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EISko7DxhIGbCXAl2Dik-VJ22QkzfhKcXgcha_tqzQ4","pdfSize":"1020948"}
