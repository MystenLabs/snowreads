This implies that the coarse moduli space\n$\\mathcal{M}_{\\frac{1}{3}, 2}$, parametrizing all canonical $3$-folds with\ncanonical volume $\\frac{1}{3}$ and geometric genus $2$, is an irreducible\nvariety of dimension $189$. Parallel studies show that $\\mathcal{M}_{1, 3}$ is\nirreducible as well and is of dimension $236$, and that $\\mathcal{M}_{2, 4}$ is\nirreducible and is of dimension $270$. As being conceived, every member in\nthese 3 families is simply connected. Additionally, our method yields the\nexpected Noether inequality $\\textrm{Vol}>\\frac{4}{3}p_g-\\frac{10}{3}$ for\n$3$-folds of general type with $p_g=5$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0IawraNMOIfy7XWtb8NmEprvAoHAlXq2Y_dGLthn3bg","pdfSize":"381847"}
