By using\ncompactness and perturbation arguments, we give a complete characterization of\nthe regularity of viscosity solutions according to different diffusion orders.\nMore precisely, when the order of the fractional diffusion is sufficiently\nclose to 2, we obtain H\\\"{o}lder continuity for the gradient of any viscosity\nsolutions and further derive an improved gradient regularity estimate at the\norigin. For the order of the fractional diffusion in the interval $(1, 2)$, we\nprove that there is at least one solution of class $C^{1, \\alpha}_{\\rm loc}$.\nAdditionally, if the order of the fractional diffusion is in the interval\n$(0,1]$, the local H\\\"{o}lder continuity of solutions is inferred.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aTzwfGq73_554sRp2psueaiHY8AMduCtoIcVdbfUH1U","pdfSize":"325859"}
