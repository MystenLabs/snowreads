We were able to identify a class of\nfluctuations, which is known as the ``minimal universal class'' that is\nindependent of the background data and saturates the bound on the mass related\nto the field theory unitarity bound. These operators have conformal dimension\n$\\Delta = 2(\\ell+1)$, with $\\ell$ being the quantum number of the angular\nmomentum on the $\\text{S}^2$. We also computed the normalisation of the\n$2$-point function of stress-energy tensors from the effective $3$-dimensional\ngraviton action. We comment on the relation of our results to the related\n$\\text{AdS}_3$ and $\\text{AdS}_2$ solutions in massive type IIA and type IIB\ntheories respectively.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_fa3vCSVc_qL8OwjoQEgLHP2ryr67M0y81yzL3DlXQg","pdfSize":"1369426"}
