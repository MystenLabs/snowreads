The Risks of Rising Atmospheric CO$_2$\n  Levels on Human Health and on the Stability of the Biosphere","authors":"Ugo Bardi","authorsParsed":[["Bardi","Ugo",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 16:48:16 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-19","timestamp":1723740496000,"abstract":"  Carbon dioxide is a chemically active molecule that plays a vital role in\nEarth's ecosphere. CO$_2$ affects the acidity of seawater and has multiple\nnegative effects on marine organisms. It is also a fundamental component of the\nphotosynthesis and respiration reactions. There is evidence that higher CO$_2$\nconcentration can make the photosynthetic reaction faster in some plants, but\nalso negatively impact the respiration reaction in aerobic lifeforms. The\neffects of this chemical and biochemical perturbation on the biosphere and on\nhuman health may be more important than generally highlighted in the discussion\non CO$_2$, usually focused on thermal effects only. These considerations stress\nthe importance of rapidly reducing CO$_2$ emissions and, whenever possible,\nremove the excess from the atmosphere. They also show that geoengineering\ntechnologies based on Solar Radiation Management (SRM) alone cannot be\nsufficient to contrast the negative effects of CO$_2$ anthropogenic emissions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o7EAcwt5fhWonO2QEEjW1SIYs74GjxsPypFzzfxrma8","pdfSize":"276577"}
