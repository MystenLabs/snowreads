Through qualitative\nmethodologies, the research examines the factors contributing to AI guilt, its\nsocial and psychological impacts, and its implications for educational\npractices. The findings revealed three main dimensions for AI guilt - perceived\nlaziness and authenticity, fear of judgment, and identity and self-efficacy\nconcerns. The findings suggest a need to redefine academic integrity and shift\nour mindset to reconsider what we should value in education. The study also\nemphasizes the importance of ethical guidelines and educational support and\nprovides implications to help students navigate the complexities of AI in\neducation, reducing feelings of guilt while enhancing learning outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"g55bLkl5fIdAGWc8xJeDA88jgbh7jtq7N1o3XrGzpyA","pdfSize":"333063"}
