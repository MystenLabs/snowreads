The reconstruction pipeline -- currently under\ndevelopment in the France/IAP working group -- relies on a model of spherical\nwavefront emission for arrival times, which is possible because the radio\nsignals are generated far away from the antenna stations. The amplitude\ndistribution of the signals at the antenna level is described by an Angular\nDistribution Function that considers various asymmetries in the data, including\ngeomagnetic effects. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from\ntesting our EAS reconstruction procedure using realistic mock observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
