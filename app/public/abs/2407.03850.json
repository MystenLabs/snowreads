We propose an approach enriching\nLanguage Models such as RoBERTa with embeddings produced by triples (subject ;\npredicate ; object) extracted from the text sentences. Our analysis of the\ndevelopmental data shows that this method improves the performance of Language\nModels alone. On the evaluation data, its best performance was in English,\nwhere it achieved an F1 score of 71.1 and ranked 12th out of 27 candidates. On\nthe other languages (Dutch and Arabic), it obtained more mixed results. Future\nresearch tracks are identified toward adapting this processing pipeline to more\nrecent Large Language Models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
