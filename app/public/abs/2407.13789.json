The merging of\ntwo such kind exceptional points are constrained by their dynamical structure,\nmeaning two order-1/2 exceptional points with same dynamical structure can\nmerge to one order-1 one while those with opposite dynamical structure can not.\nWe show they exist in Floquet bipartite lattices, and the order-1 Floquet $\\pi$\nexceptional points appear at the phase transition point between quasimomentum\ngap phases and quasienergy gap phases. The scattering properties around the\norder-1 Floquet $\\pi$ exceptional points is quite novel, which is perfect\ntransparency but detectable in reflection for one of two sides.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
