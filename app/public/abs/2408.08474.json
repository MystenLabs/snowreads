Neutrino telescope\nreconstruction algorithms are limited by the sparse sampling of photons by the\noptical modules due to the relatively large spacing ($10-100\\,{\\rm m})$ between\nthem. In this letter, we propose a novel technique that learns photon transport\nthrough the detector medium through the use of deep learning-driven\nsuper-resolution of data events. These ``improved'' events can then be\nreconstructed using traditional or ML techniques, resulting in improved\nresolution. Our strategy arranges additional ``virtual'' optical modules within\nan existing detector geometry and trains a convolutional neural network to\npredict the hits on these virtual optical modules. We show that this technique\nimproves the angular reconstruction of muons in a generic ice-based neutrino\ntelescope. Our results readily extend to water-based neutrino telescopes and\nother event morphologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ebjfET-w-uQ3iWYP1fA0-k7ovmllcNr41ayEn9C2Nxw","pdfSize":"2400416"}
