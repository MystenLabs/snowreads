We use a free fermionic\nrepresentation of the correlation kernel to study its asymptotic behavior and\nderive the uniform convergence to a limit shape of Young diagrams in the limit\n$n,k \\to \\infty$. More specifically, we show the bulk is the discrete sine\nkernel with boundary fluctuations generically given by the Tracy-Widom\ndistribution with the Airy kernel. When our limit shape touches the boundary\ncorner of the rectangle, the fluctuations with a second order correction are\ngiven by the discrete Hermite kernel, and we recover the discrete distribution\nof Gravner-Tracy-Widom (2001) [arXiv:math/0005133] restricting to the leading\norder. Finally, we demonstrate our limit shapes can have sections with no or\nfull density of particles, where the Pearcey kernel appears when such a section\nis infinitely small.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
