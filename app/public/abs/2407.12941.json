The ability to learn from both visual and proprioceptive examples,\ncreating algorithms that scale to high-dimensional state-spaces, and mastering\nstrong dynamics models are the main obstacles. In this work, we provide a\ngradient-based inverse reinforcement learning framework that learns cost\nfunctions purely from visual human demonstrations. The shown behavior and the\ntrajectory is then optimized using TD visual model predictive control(MPC) and\nthe learned cost functions. We test our system using fundamental object\nmanipulation tasks on hardware.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KLGq77Hi5XvBVMMjPFNMWU5LvBTEpErVP7Txly_Xzr8","pdfSize":"1136837"}
