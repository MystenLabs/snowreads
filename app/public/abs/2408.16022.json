To improve our understanding of regional disparities in care\ndelivery, we introduce a novel application of curvature, a\ngeometrical-topological property of networks, to Physician Referral Networks.\nOur initial findings reveal that Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvature\nmeasures, which are known for their expressive power in characterizing network\nstructure, offer promising indicators for detecting variations in healthcare\nefficacy while capturing a range of significant regional demographic features.\nWe also present APPARENT, an open-source tool that leverages Ricci curvature\nand other network features to examine correlations between regional Physician\nReferral Networks structure, local census data, healthcare effectiveness, and\npatient outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
