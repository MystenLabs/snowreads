We find that biases in hydroxyl\n(OH) radical concentrations and reactivity in current atmospheric chemistry\nmodels may cause a 20% overestimate of the hydrogen Global Warming Potential\n(GWP). A better understanding of OH chemistry is critical for reliable\nestimates of the hydrogen GWP.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WtGkW6zNSu5RzbxBy5zol3x6YQmIzr1WjPtEE894sm0","pdfSize":"900308"}
