Most existing studies\nfocus on attribution-based methods that explain an argument's strength by\nassigning importance scores to other arguments but fail to explain how to\nchange the current strength to a desired one. To solve this issue, we introduce\ncounterfactual explanations for QBAFs. We discuss problem variants and propose\nan iterative algorithm named Counterfactual Explanations for Quantitative\nbipolar Argumentation frameworks (CE-QArg). CE-QArg can identify valid and\ncost-effective counterfactual explanations based on two core modules, polarity\nand priority, which help determine the updating direction and magnitude for\neach argument, respectively. We discuss some formal properties of our\ncounterfactual explanations and empirically evaluate CE-QArg on randomly\ngenerated QBAFs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YxZhr9WYSp1UaAKeV81SWE4aciSNaOlEcKa6l-8ViRk","pdfSize":"1079211"}
