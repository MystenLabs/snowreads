If these structures have\nalready been part of sophisticated computational models, they have rarely been\ndirectly studied as an immediate model of execution traces of programs. This\npaper offers such an analysis. We propose a simple imperative operational\nframework and show how to derive soundness and adequacy results with event\nstructures considered as a semantics. We show how event structures naturally\nhandle non-deterministic, probabilistic and quantum effects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
