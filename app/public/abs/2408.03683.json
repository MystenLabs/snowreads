To evaluate the credibility of the model, we applied a Bayesian\nMCMC technique using late-time cosmic observations to impose limitations on the\nfree parameters of the theory. Our results suggest that the $f(\\mathcal{G})$\nmodel can reproduce the low-redshift behavior of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel, but there are significant differences at high redshifts, leading to the\nabsence of a standard matter-dominated epoch. We also examined the profiles of\ncosmographic parameters using the model parameter values from the standard\nrange to verify the intermediate epochs. Our analysis shows that the highly\npromising $f(\\mathcal{G})$ model is a feasible candidate for explaining the\ncurrent epochs. We presented a dynamical system analysis framework to examine\nthe stability of the model. Our study identified critical points depicting\nvarious phases of the Universe and explained the evolutionary epochs. We\ndemonstrated that the model effectively captures the evolution of energy\ncomponents over cosmic time, supporting its validity as an alternate\nexplanation for the observed acceleration of the Universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
