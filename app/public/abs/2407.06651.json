Using this description, we construct an explicit section\nin the derived category of (duals of) finite length admissible locally\n$K$-analytic representations of $\\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ to the canonical morphism of\ncomplexes $\\Omega^\\bullet \\twoheadrightarrow H^{n-1}(\\Omega^\\bullet)[-(n-1)]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
