Visual localization is a\ncost-effective alternative in such cases, leveraging the cameras already\nequipped on inspection vehicles to estimate poses from images of the\nsurrounding scene. Amongst these, machine learning-based pose estimation from\nimages shows promise in underwater environments, performing efficient\nrelocalization using models trained based on previously mapped scenes. We\nexplore the efficacy of learning-based pose estimators in both clear and turbid\nwater inspection missions, assessing the impact of image formats, model\narchitectures and training data diversity. We innovate by employing novel view\nsynthesis models to generate augmented training data, significantly enhancing\npose estimation in unexplored regions. Moreover, we enhance localization\naccuracy by integrating pose estimator outputs with sensor data via an extended\nKalman filter, demonstrating improved trajectory smoothness and accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
