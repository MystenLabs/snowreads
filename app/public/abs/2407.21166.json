For noncommutative rings, the notion of\nmultiplicity first appeared in the context of modules for the Weyl algebra in\nBernstein's solution of the problem of analytic continuation posed by I.\nGelfand. The notion was shown to be useful to many more noncommutative rings,\nespecially enveloping algebras, rings of differential operators, and quantum\ngroups. In all these cases, the existence of multiplicity is related to the\nexistence of Hilbert-Samuel polynomials. In this work we give an axiomatic\ndefinition of algebras with a notion of multiplicity, which we call very nice\nand modest algebras. We show, in an abstract setting, how the existence of\nHilbert-Samuel polynomials implies the existence of a notion of multiplicity.\nWe apply our results for the category of min-holonomic modules -- a notion\nwhich coincides with holonomic modules for simple algebras -- and that shares\nmany similarities with it. In particular, we generalize the usual results in\nthe literature that are stated for Ore domains, in the more general context of\nprime algebras, and we show that rational Cherednik algebras admit a notion of\nmultiplicity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
