This supercritical mean-field limit may also be interpreted as a combined\nmean-field and quasineutral limit, and our assumptions on the rates of these\nrespective limits are shown to be optimal. Our work provides a mathematical\nbasis for the universality of the Lake equation in this scaling limit -- a new\nobservation -- in the sense that the dependence on the interaction and\nconfinement is only through the limiting spatial density of the particles. Our\nproof is based on a modulated-energy method and takes advantage of regularity\ntheory for the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
