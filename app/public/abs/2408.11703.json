In this work, a cavity-length-insensitive\nfrequency stabilization scheme is implemented using strong dispersion in a\n$21\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ long cavity with a europium-ion-doped spacer of yttrium\northosilicate. A number of limiting factors for slow light laser stabilization\nare evaluated, including the inhomogeneous and homogeneous linewidth of the\nions, the deterioration of spectral windows, and the linewidth of the cavity\nmodes. Using strong dispersion, the cavity modes were narrowed by a factor\n$1.6\\cdot 10^5$, leading to a cavity linewidth of $3.0\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and a $Q$\nfactor of $1.7\\cdot 10^{11}$. Frequency stabilization was demonstrated using a\ncavity mode in a spectral transparency region near the center of the\ninhomogeneous profile, showing an overlapping Allan deviation below $6\\cdot\n10^{-14}$ and a linear drift rate of $3.66\\,\\mathrm{Hz}/\\mathrm{s}$.\nConsidering improvements that could be implemented, this makes the\neuropium-based slow light laser frequency reference a promising candidate for\nultra-precise tabletop frequency stabilization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cTSE8Zm8DQwx9rKdkJJbKrOZ-EXpnjxHEf4ErVogYzQ","pdfSize":"1288415"}
