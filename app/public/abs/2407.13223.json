Importantly, the coupling constants are\nindependent of the gauge choice, so these results are valid across different YM\ngauge choices.\n  In this work, we explore the cosmological reduction of these couplings when\nthe YM gauge fields belong to the Cartan subalgebra of $SO(32)$ or $E_8 \\times\nE_8$. We demonstrate that after applying appropriate one-dimensional field\nredefinitions and total derivative terms, the couplings can be expressed in a\nproposed $O(9,25)$-invariant canonical form, which is the extension of the\ncanonical $O(9,9)$-invariant form for just the NS-NS fields proposed by Hohm\nand Zwiebach. This $O(9,25)$-invariant expression is in terms of the trace of\nthe first time derivative of the generalized metric, which encompasses both the\nYM field and the NS-NS fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
