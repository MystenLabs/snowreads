We\nconsider a stochastic formulation of these problems, and unlike most previous\nwork, we take into account the complex Markov nature of the noise. We also\nconsider the geometry of the problem in an arbitrary non-Euclidean setting, and\npropose four methods based on the Mirror Descent iteration technique.\nTheoretical analysis is provided for smooth and convex minimization problems\nand variational inequalities with Lipschitz and monotone operators. The\nconvergence guarantees obtained are optimal for first-order stochastic methods,\nas evidenced by the lower bound estimates provided in this paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
