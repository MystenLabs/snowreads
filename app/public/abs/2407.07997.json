As new models are being\ndeveloped, there is a need for larger datasets. However, ICD codes are intended\nfor billing. We aim to determine how suitable ICD codes are for creating\ndatasets to train ML models. We focused on a rare and common disease using the\nAll of Us database. First, we compared the patient cohort created using ICD\ncodes for Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis, CM) with that identified via\nserological confirmation. Second, we compared two similarly created patient\ncohorts for myocardial infarction (MI) patients. We identified significant\ndiscrepancies between these two groups, and the patient overlap was small. The\nCM cohort had 811 patients in the ICD-10 group, 619 patients in the\npositive-serology group, and 24 with both. The MI cohort had 14,875 patients in\nthe ICD-10 group, 23,598 in the MI laboratory-confirmed group, and 6,531 in\nboth. Demographics, rates of disease symptoms, and other clinical data varied\nacross our case study cohorts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
