To this\ndate, characterization of ongoing accretion processes in stellar pairs at\n5-50\\,au scales has been challenging, high angular resolution spectrographs are\nrequired to extract the spectral features of each component. We present the\nanalysis of spectroscopic observations of the tight (160mas, 25au) T-Tauri\nsystem HT Lup A/B, obtained with MUSE at VLT in March and July of 2021. We\nfocus on constraining the accretion/ejection processes and variability of the\nsecondary component HT Lup B, by searching for accretion tracers applying\nHigh-Resolution Spectral Differential Imaging techniques. We retrieve strong\n(SNR $>$ 5) $H\\alpha, H\\beta$ and [OI]$\\lambda6300$ emission in both epochs.\nThe $H\\alpha$ and $H\\beta$ line fluxes showcase high variability, with\nvariations up to 400-500\\% between epochs. The fluxes are consistent with\naccretion rates of $8\\times10^{-9} M_\\odot \\, yr^{-1}$ and $2\\times10^{-9}\nM_\\odot \\, yr^{-1}$ for the first and second epoch, respectively. We attribute\nthe increased accretion activity during the first night to a \"burst\" like\nevent, followed by a relaxation period more representative of the common\naccretion activity of the system. The [OI]$\\lambda6300$ line profiles remain\nrelatively similar between epochs and suggest ejection rates on the order of\n$10^{-9}-10^{-10} M_\\odot \\, yr^{-1}$, compatible with moderate disk winds\nemission. Our results also indicate that the accretion processes of HT Lup B\nare compatible with Classical T Tauri Stars, unlike previous classifications\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
