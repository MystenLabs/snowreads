In particular, we exploit the two-fluid\nformalism of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations as generic framework for dark\nmatter admixed neutron stars. The fluids couple to each other only by gravity.\nIn particular, the baryonic sector is described by the BSk22 equation of state,\nwhereas we employ a relativistic mean field model for the dark matter, where we\ninclude the interaction of dark massive fermions with light dark scalar and\nvector mediators. We consider both the linear and the quadratic scalar\ninteractions with the dark fermion. In the quadratic scalar scenario, we take\ninto account a quartic self-interaction that significantly affects the stellar\nproperties. Interestingly, in both cases, the effect of the scalar coupling is\nsmaller than that of the vector, though quantitative differences arise. We also\ncompute the sound speed of DM, finding that the scalar and quadratic couplings\nhave an important influence on it. We compare our results with GW1708017,\nGW190425 and NICER data and constrain DM couplings and mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
