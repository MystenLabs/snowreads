First, we\nanalyze the SSEP with a defect site under the periodic boundary conditions. We\nderive the exact expression for the second moment of the current and observe\ndeviations from that of the homogeneous system. Notably, the second moment of\nthe current shows asymmetric density dependence around a density of 1/2 and\nsurpassing that of the homogeneous system in the low-density region.\nFurthermore, based on the finding from the SSEP with a defect site, we present\nan approximate derivation of the second moment of the current in the SSEP on a\nquenched random energy landscape using a partial-mean-field approach. The\nsecond moment of the current is heavily influenced by the energy landscape,\nrevealing unique effects arising from the interplay between the heterogeneous\nenvironment and the many-body system. Our findings provide valuable insights\nthat can be applied to control current fluctuations in systems involving the\ninteractions of many particles, such as biological transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
