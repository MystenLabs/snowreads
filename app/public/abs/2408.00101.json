We reveal that photostriction in these\nheterostructures quantitatively and qualitatively depends on the chemical\nperiod $n$. Specifically, we show that by changing the chemical period, we can\ninduce $\\textit {positive}$ or $\\textit {negative}$ photostriction. We also\npresent a simple analytical model to account for the calculated deformations.\nOur findings indicate that superlattices architectures may be key to design\nnovel optomechanical applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
