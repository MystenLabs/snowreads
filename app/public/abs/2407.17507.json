While $q=2$ corresponds to the Ising model, the\n$q\\to\\infty$ limit corresponds to the well-known $XY$ model. It is known that\nup to $q=4$, the two-dimensional (2D) clock model exhibits a symmetry-breaking\nphase transition. On the other hand, the 2D $XY$ model only shows a topological\n(Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless or BKT) phase transition. Interestingly, the\nmodel with finite $q$ (with $q\\ge 5$) is predicted to show two different phase\ntransitions. There are varying opinions about the actual characters of the\ntransitions, especially the one at the lower temperature. In this work we\ndevelop mean-field theory (basic and higher order) to study the $q$-state clock\nmodel systematically. Using the mean-field theory, we show that the phase\ntransition at the higher temperature is of the BKT type. We find that this\ntransition temperature ($T_{BKT}$) does not depend on the $q$ values, and our\nbasic (zeroth order) mean-field calculation shows that $T_{BKT} = 2J/k_B$,\nwhere $J$ is the nearest-neighbor exchange constant and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann\nconstant. Our analysis shows that the other phase transition is a spontaneous\nsymmetry-breaking (SSB) type. The corresponding transition temperature\n($T_{SSB}$) is found to decrease with increasing $q$ value; it is found that\n$T_{SSB} \\propto 1/q^2$ with a weak logarithmic correction. To better\nunderstand the model, we also perform the first-order mean-field calculations\n(here, the interaction between two targeted nearest neighbors is treated\nexactly). This calculation gives us $T_{BKT} = 1.895J/k_B$, which is slightly\ncloser to the reported value of $0.893J/k_B$. The main advantage of this\nhigher-order mean-field theory is that one can now estimate the spin-spin\ncorrelation, whose change in the properties indicates the phase transition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bzgfBnv40XfMiTtEmmZSPnxJPnciAiR8erJHtLscU0I","pdfSize":"1264555"}
