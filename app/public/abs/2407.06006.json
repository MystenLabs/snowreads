We find\nthat for Gaussian prior phase distributions with arbitrary widths, the optimal\ninitial state can be approximated with products of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\nstates with varying number of qubits. Using local, adaptive measurements\noptimized for the prior distribution and the initial state, we show that\nHeisenberg scaling is achievable and that the proposed scheme outperforms known\nschemes in the literature that utilize a similar set of initial states. For an\nexample prior width, we present a detailed comparison and find that is also\npossible to achieve Heisenberg scaling with a scheme that employs non-adaptive\nmeasurements, with the right allocation of copies per GHZ state and\nsingle-qubit rotations. We also propose an efficient phase unwinding protocol\nto extend the dynamic range of the proposed scheme, and show that it\noutperforms existing protocols by achieving an enhanced precision with a\nsmaller number of additional atoms. Lastly, we discuss the impact of noise and\nimperfect gates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
