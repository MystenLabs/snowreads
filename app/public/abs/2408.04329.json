Our findings reveal that when the quantum\nparameter is at its critical value, both the excess excitation density at the\nend of linear quench and the subsequent free relaxation behavior exhibit\nuniversal scaling behaviors. The scaling laws observed upon quenching to the\nzero-temperature quantum critical point and non-zero temperature points exhibit\ndistinct scaling exponents, which are all intimately related to the dynamical\ncritical exponents of the quantum phase transition. Additionally, for the case\nof linear quench to finite temperatures, we have also discovered an intrinsic\nuniversal dynamical behavior that is independent of quantum criticality. Our\nresearch offers profound insights into the relationship between quantum\ncriticality and nonequilibrium dynamics from two perspectives:\nKibble-Zurek-like scaling behavior and free relaxation dynamics. Notably, the\nKibble-Zurek-like scaling behavior in this context differs from the standard\nKibble-Zurek mechanism. These two aspects jointly open up a new avenue for us\nto understand quantum criticality through real-time dynamical behavior, even at\nfinite temperatures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mk_grK00HZKWlZGo87gDSpNF1P1RArV6AJ_ea6Ww228","pdfSize":"848374"}
