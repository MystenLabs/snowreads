We then use\nthe individual properties of stocks within the network along with the global\nones, to find correlations with the future returns of individual S&P 500\nstocks. Applying these properties as input variables for forecasting, we find a\n50% improvement on the R2score in the prediction of stock returns on long time\nscales (per year), and 3% on short time scales (2 days), relative to baseline\nmodels without network variables.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WpaGRlqTgtnG5735T8C4nWCpVy0tP1ka95saayhf-5s","pdfSize":"14946141"}
