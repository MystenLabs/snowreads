Index modulation offers a trade-off balance between the SE and\nperformance reliability. In this paper, we propose an MH with OAM-based index\nmodulation scheme, where several OAM-modes are activated for hopping, to\nachieve high SE at a given bit error rate in radio vortex wireless\ncommunications. Based on the proposed scheme, we derive the upper bound and\nlower bound of achievable SEs. Furthermore, in order to take advantage of index\ninformation, we derive the optimal hopped OAM-modes to achieve the maximum SE.\nNumerical results show that our proposed MH with index modulation scheme can\nachieve high SE while satisfying a certain reliability of radio vortex wireless\ncommunications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
