In particular we present explicit constructions of Poncelet $n$-gons\nfor certain $n$ and derive algebraic characterisations in terms of bracket\npolynomials. Via the connections of Poncelet polygons and\n$(N_4)$-configurations, the results of this article can be used to construct a\nlarge class of specific movable $(N_4)$-configurations, the trivial celestial\n4-configurations, which up to this point were all thought to be rigid and to\nrequire regular polygons for their construction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
