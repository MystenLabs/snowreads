Concretely, we find\nformulas for the p-adic valuation, the number-of-divisors function, the\nsum-of-divisors function, Euler's totient function, the modular inverse, the\ninteger part of the root, the integer part of the logarithm, the multiplicative\norder and the discrete logarithm. Although these are very complicated, they\nonly involve elementary operations, and to our knowledge no other closed form\nof this kind is known for the aforementioned functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
