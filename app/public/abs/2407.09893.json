However, generating\nfactually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a\nchallenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring\nlong-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces\nSMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to\nenhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated\nresponses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific\nsub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose\na multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which\nensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained\nexecution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive\ntasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted\nknowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can\nextend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios.
