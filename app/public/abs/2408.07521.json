In\nthis paper, we present an application in which ASP has been successfully used\nin the context of dynamic traffic distribution for urban networks, within a\nmore general framework devised for solving such a real-world problem. In\nparticular, ASP has been employed for the computation of the \"optimal\" routes\nfor all the vehicles in the network. We also provide an empirical analysis of\nthe performance of the whole framework, and of its part in which ASP is\nemployed, on two European urban areas, which shows the viability of the\nframework and the contribution ASP can give.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pfsV1DCtHoWyeUiLhkHrP8ew_1XK8TByr4sZUEBKIJc","pdfSize":"1057213"}
