This study addresses this gap by investigating the attractiveness\nhalo effect using AI-based beauty filters. We conduct a large-scale online user\nstudy involving 2,748 participants who rated facial images from a diverse set\nof 462 distinct individuals in two conditions: original and attractive after\napplying a beauty filter. Our study reveals that the same individuals receive\nstatistically significantly higher ratings of attractiveness and other traits,\nsuch as intelligence and trustworthiness, in the attractive condition. We also\nstudy the impact of age, gender, and ethnicity and identify a weakening of the\nhalo effect in the beautified condition, resolving conflicting findings from\nthe literature and suggesting that filters could mitigate this cognitive bias.\nFinally, our findings raise ethical concerns regarding the use of beauty\nfilters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
