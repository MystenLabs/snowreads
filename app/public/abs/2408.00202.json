Motivated by the\nexperimental observation of parallel spin-momentum locking in chiral\ntopological semimetals, we find that parallel spin-momentum locking leads to\nhelicoid-arc surface states. We also investigate the potential intrinsic\ntopological phases in a superconducting chiral topological semimetal with\n$s_\\pm$- wave pairing. We find that a first-order time-reversal invariant\ntopological superconductor can host one Majorana cone for closed Fermi\nsurfaces. Interestingly, there are two Majorana cones when the Fermi surfaces\nbecome open. In addition, a second-order topological superconductor with chiral\nMajorana states can be realized in the presence of a mixture of $s\\pm$- and\n$id$-wave pairing. We show that chiral topological semimetals are fascinating\nplatforms for exploring intrinsic unconventional superconductivity and\ntopological superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
