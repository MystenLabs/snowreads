Using\nmatrix-product-state techniques we determine the global ground-state phase\ndiagram in the thermodynamic limit for the half-filled band case, and show that\nin particular the curvature of the bare phonon band has a significant effect,\nnot only on the transport properties characterized by the conductance and the\nLuttinger liquid parameter, but also on the phase space structure of the model\nas a whole. While a downward curved (convex) dispersion of the phonons only\nshifts the Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid to charge-density-wave quantum phase\ntransition towards stronger EP coupling, an upward curved (concave) phonon band\nleads to a new phase-separated state which, in the case of strong dispersion,\ncan even completely cover the charge-density wave. Such phase separation does\nnot occur in the related Edwards fermion-boson model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
