Despite the increasing number of publications, some fundamental\nquestions, such as ``what do we measure'' or ``what can we measure'', have not\nbeen answered conclusively. In this study, we hypothesize that laser distance\nsensors are able to measure the concentration of entrapped air, which we\ndemonstrate using two seminal air-water flow types, namely a submerged\nhydraulic jump and flows down a stepped spillway. By converting our\nfree-surface signals into time series of instantaneous air concentrations, we\nalso show that a dual laser triangulation setup enables the extraction of basic\nair-water flow parameters of the upper flow region, comprising interface count\nrates, interfacial velocities, and turbulence levels, while we acknowledge that\nsome sensor characteristics, such as beam diameters, can lead to measurement\nbiases. Overall, this study represents a major advancement in the remote\nmeasurement of air-water flow properties. Future collective research effort is\nrequired to overcome remaining challenges.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"DWRt4_DkvgzrMHWqmGuUn8O1v8bidITxvzWPR-a_tx8","pdfSize":"5588378"}
