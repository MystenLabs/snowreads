However, to make these data useful, sensor data must\nbe integrated effectively. This paper focuses on the integration of image data\nand vehicle-to-vehicle communication data. More specifically, our goal is to\nidentify the locations of vehicles sending messages within images, a challenge\ntermed the vehicle identification problem. In this paper, we employ a\nsupervised learning model to tackle the vehicle identification problem.\nHowever, we face two practical issues: first, drivers are typically unwilling\nto share privacy-sensitive image data, and second, drivers usually do not\nengage in data labeling. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a\ncomprehensive solution to the vehicle identification problem, which leverages\nfederated learning and automatic labeling techniques in combination with the\naforementioned supervised learning model. We have validated the feasibility of\nour proposed approach through experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
