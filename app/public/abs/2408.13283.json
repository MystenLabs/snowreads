We perform\nphase space analysis of the autonomous system obtained from the cosmological\ngoverning equations by a suitable transformation of variables. Linear stability\ntheory is employed to characterise the stability criteria for hyperbolic\ncritical points. Numerical investigation is carried out for non-hyperbolic\npoints. Our study reveals that modified chaplygin fluid dominated solutions\ncannot provide the late-time evolution. Late-time accelerated evolution is\nobtained only when the solution is dominated by tachyon fluid. This study also\nyields a late-time scaling attractor providing similar order of energy\ndensities in its evolution. The adiabatic sound speed is evaluated for both the\nfluids and test the stability of the models independently. Further, we perform\ncosmographic analysis in the model independent way by evaluating all the\ncosmographic parameters and then $Om$ diagnostic is also found to compare our\nmodel with $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
