The agents move instantaneously towards a weighted barycenter of the\nensemble according to the 2-Wasserstein metric. We mathematically describe the\nevolution as a system of measure differential inclusions and show the existence\nof solutions for compactly supported initial data. Inspired by the\nconsensus-based optimization, we apply the multi-agent system to solve a\nminimization problem over the space of probability measures. In the small\nnumerical example, each agent is described by a particle approximation and aims\nto approximate a target measure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
