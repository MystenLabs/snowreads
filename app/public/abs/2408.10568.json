Despite its rapid\ndevelopment, it is still affected by limited field of view where accumulation\nof sensors and joint noise bring compounding errors. In this paper, we\nintroduced geometrically and historically constrained behavior cloning (GHCBC)\nto dominantly consider high-level state information inspired by\nneuroscientists, wherein the geometrically constrained behavior cloning were\nused to geometrically constrain predicting poses, and the historically\nconstrained behavior cloning were utilized to temporally constrain action\nsequences. The synergy between these two types of constrains enhanced the BC\nperformance in terms of robustness and stability. Comprehensive experimental\nresults showed that success rates were improved by 29.73% in simulation and\n39.4% in real robot experiments in average, respectively, compared to\nstate-of-the-art BC method, especially in long-term operational scenes,\nindicating great potential of using the GHCBC for robotic learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
