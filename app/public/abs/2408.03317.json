If\nthe two nest algebras are distance less than 1\n($d(\\mathcal{T}(\\mathcal{M}),\\mathcal{T}(\\mathcal{N})) < 1$), then the nests\nare distance less than 1 ($d(\\mathcal{M},\\mathcal{N})<1$). If the nests are\ndistance less than 1 apart, then the nest algebras are similar, i.e. there is\nan invertible $S$ such that $S\\mathcal{M} = \\mathcal{N}$, so that $S\n\\mathcal{T}(\\mathcal{M})S^{-1} = \\mathcal{T}(\\mathcal{N})$. However there are\nexamples of nests closer than 1 for which the nest algebras are distance 1\napart.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
