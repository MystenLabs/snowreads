The adoption of MBE in Maintenance and\nEvolution (MBM&E), however, is still limited due to poor tool support and a\nlack of perceived benefits. We argue that Generative Artificial Intelligence\n(GenAI) can be used as a means to address the limitations of MBM&E. In this\nsense, we argue that GenAI, driven by Foundation Models, offers promising\npotential for enhancing MBM&E tasks. With this possibility in mind, we\nintroduce a research vision that contains a classification scheme for GenAI\napproaches in MBM&E considering two main aspects: (i) the level of augmentation\nprovided by GenAI and (ii) the experience of the engineers involved. We propose\nthat GenAI can be used in MBM&E for: reducing engineers' learning curve,\nmaximizing efficiency with recommendations, or serving as a reasoning tool to\nunderstand domain problems. Furthermore, we outline challenges in this field as\na research agenda to drive scientific and practical future solutions. With this\nproposed vision, we aim to bridge the gap between GenAI and MBM&E, presenting a\nstructured and sophisticated way for advancing MBM&E practices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
