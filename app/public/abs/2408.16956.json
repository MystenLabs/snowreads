The fast cadence, good resolution, and high polarimetric sensitivity of\nViSP data provide a unique opportunity to explore the photospheric magnetic\nfields before and during the flare. We infer the magnetic field vector in the\nphotosphere from the Fe I 6302 line using Milne-Eddington inversions. Combined\nanalysis of the inverted data and VBI images reveals the presence of two\noppositely-polarity pores exhibiting rotational motion both prior to and\nthroughout the flare event. Data-driven simulations further reveal a complex\nmagnetic field topology above the rotating pores, including a null-point-like\nconfiguration. We observed a 30% relative change in the horizontal component\n($\\delta F_h$) of Lorentz force at the flare peak time and roughly no change in\nthe radial component. We find that the changes in $\\delta F_h$ are the most\nlikely driver of the observed pore rotation. These findings collectively\nsuggest that the back-reaction of magnetic field line reconfiguration in the\ncorona may influence the magnetic morphology and rotation of pores in the\nphotosphere on a significantly smaller scale.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
