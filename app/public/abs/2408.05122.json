Thanks to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the\ndetection of astrophysical neutrinos was proved to be practical. However, no\nsource has been significantly identified due to the lack of statistics and\nuncovered field of view. The next generation of high-energy neutrino telescope\nis in high demand. We propose the NEutrino Observatory in the Nanhai (NEON),\nlocated in the South China Sea to be complementary for the global neutrino\ndetectors. This proposal describes the design and layout of the array and\nreports on comprehensive simulations conducted to assess its performance. The\nNEON project, with a volume of 10 km$^3$, achieves an angular resolution of\n0.1$^\\circ$ at 100 TeV. With 10 years of operation, the project's 5$\\sigma$\nsensitivity is estimated as $E^2\\Phi \\sim 2 \\times 10^{-10}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ for a source spectrum index of -2. We found that the variation in\ndepth from 1700 to 3500 meters does not significantly influence the sensitivity\nto steady sources.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5PsHNCobhMRXqvdDbOBj29j4pp9yhHXCVQ-C5MTVBBI","pdfSize":"6465179"}
