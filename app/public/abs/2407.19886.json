However, we argue that existing multi-modal recommender systems\ntypically use isolated processes for both feature extraction and modality\nmodelling. Such isolated processes can harm the recommendation performance.\nFirstly, an isolated extraction process underestimates the importance of\neffective feature extraction in multi-modal recommendations, potentially\nincorporating non-relevant information, which is harmful to item\nrepresentations. Second, an isolated modality modelling process produces\ndisjointed embeddings for item modalities due to the individual processing of\neach modality, which leads to a suboptimal fusion of user/item representations\nfor effective user preferences prediction. We hypothesise that the use of a\nunified model for addressing both aforementioned isolated processes will enable\nthe consistent extraction and cohesive fusion of joint multi-modal features,\nthereby enhancing the effectiveness of multi-modal recommender systems. In this\npaper, we propose a novel model, called Unified Multi-modal Graph Transformer\n(UGT), which firstly leverages a multi-way transformer to extract aligned\nmulti-modal features from raw data for top-k recommendation. Subsequently, we\nbuild a unified graph neural network in our UGT model to jointly fuse the\nuser/item representations with their corresponding multi-modal features. Using\nthe graph transformer architecture of our UGT model, we show that the UGT model\ncan achieve significant effectiveness gains, especially when jointly optimised\nwith the commonly-used multi-modal recommendation losses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
