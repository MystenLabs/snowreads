A relevant parameter in CSD\nis the maximum order $l_{max}$ used in the spherical harmonics series,\ninfluencing the angular resolution of the Fiber Orientation Distributions\n(FODs). Lower $l_{max}$ values produce smoother and more stable estimates, but\nresult in reduced angular resolution. Conversely, higher $l_{max}$ values, as\nemployed in the Super-Resolved CSD variant, are essential for resolving narrow\ninter-fiber angles but lead to spurious lobes due to increased noise\nsensitivity. To address this issue, we propose a novel Spatially Regularized\nSuper-Resolved CSD (SR$^2$-CSD) approach, incorporating spatial priors into the\nCSD framework. This method leverages spatial information among adjacent voxels,\nenhancing the stability and noise robustness of FOD estimations. SR$^2$-CSD\nfacilitates the practical use of Super-Resolved CSD by including a J-invariant\nauto-calibrated total variation FOD denoiser. We evaluated the performance of\nSR$^2$-CSD against standard CSD and Super-Resolved CSD using phantom numerical\ndata and various real brain datasets, including a test-retest sample of six\nsubjects scanned twice. In phantom data, SR$^2$-CSD outperformed both CSD and\nSuper-Resolved CSD, reducing the angular error (AE) by approximately half and\nthe peak number error (PNE) by a factor of three across all noise levels\nconsidered. In real data, SR$^2$-CSD produced more continuous FOD estimates\nwith higher spatial-angular coherency. In the test-retest sample, SR$^2$-CSD\nconsistently yielded more reproducible estimates, with reduced AE, PNE, mean\nsquared error, and increased angular correlation coefficient between the FODs\nestimated from the two scans for each subject.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
