Here, we\npresent the first consistent joint Bayesian inference of the isotropic BAO\nscale, jointly varying the initial conditions as well as all bias coefficients,\nbased on the EFT-based field-level forward model $\\texttt{LEFTfield}$. We apply\nthis analysis to mock data generated with a much higher cutoff (resolution),\nresulting in a significant model mismatch between mock data and the model used\nin the inference. We demonstrate that the remaining systematic bias in the BAO\nscale is below 2% for all data considered and below 1% when Eulerian bias is\nused for inference. Furthermore, we find that the inferred error on the BAO\nscale is up to 1.6 times smaller compared to that from a replication of the\nstandard power-spectrum reconstruction approach, using the same scales as in\nthe field-level inference, with the improvement growing towards smaller scales\n(higher $k$). Thus, a field-level approach to BAO not only allows for a\nconsistent inference of the BAO scale, but promises to achieve more precise\nmeasurements on the same data as well.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
