A pairing is a binary operation that relates the derivative of a\ncurve's norm to the radius-vector of the curve and its tangent. This\nrelationship, known as the curve norm derivative formula, is crucial when using\nthe norm as a Lyapunov function. Another important property of the pairing,\nused in stability and contraction criteria, is the so-called Lumer inequality,\nwhich relates the pairing to the induced logarithmic norm. We prove that the\ncurve norm derivative formula and Lumer's inequality are, in fact, equivalent\nto each other and to several simpler properties. We then introduce and\ncharacterize regular pairings that satisfy all of these properties. Our results\nunify several independent theories of pairings (semi-inner products) developed\nin previous work on functional analysis and control theory. Additionally, we\nintroduce the polyhedral max pairing and develop computational tools for\npolyhedral norms, advancing contraction theory in non-Euclidean spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
