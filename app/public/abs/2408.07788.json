Using\nKeck/HIRES, we observed a partial transit of the planet and detected an\nassociated radial velocity anomaly. By modeling the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)\neffect, we derived a sky-projected obliquity of\n$\\left|\\lambda\\right|=24^{+14}_{-14}$ degrees, indicating TOI-942c is in a\nprograde and likely aligned orbit. Upon incorporation of the star's inclination\nand the planet's orbital inclination, we determined a true obliquity for\nTOI-942c of $\\psi< 43$ degrees at 84\\% confidence, while dynamic analysis\nstrongly suggests TOI-942c is aligned with stellar spin and coplanar with the\ninner planet. Furthermore, TOI-942c is also a suitable target for studying\natmospheric loss of young Neptunian planets that are likely still contracting\nfrom the heat of formation. We observed a blueshifted excess absorption in the\nH-alpha line at 6564.7 \\AA, potentially indicating atmospheric loss due to\nphotoevaporation. However, due to the lack of pre-ingress data, additional\nobservations are needed to confirm this measurement.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2mUTlBWvHSgKWKwFPmYGbqGKQnYdm8b-vS1_69zPp2g","pdfSize":"2355147"}
