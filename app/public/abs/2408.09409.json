However,\nthese methods are not specifically designed for healthcare purposes and face\nchallenges in real-world applications. Human pose estimation methods often lack\nthe accuracy needed for detecting fine-grained, subtle body movements, while\noptical flow-based methods struggle with poor lighting conditions and unseen\nreal-world data. These issues result in human body motion estimation errors,\nparticularly during critical medical situations where the body is motionless,\nsuch as during unconsciousness. To address these challenges and improve the\naccuracy of human body motion estimation for healthcare purposes, we propose\nthe OPPH operator designed to enhance current vision-based motion estimation\nmethods. This operator, which considers human body movement and noise\nproperties, functions as a multi-stage filter. Results tested on two real-world\nand one synthetic human motion dataset demonstrate that the operator\neffectively removes real-world noise, significantly enhances the detection of\nmotionless states, maintains the accuracy of estimating active body movements,\nand maintains long-term body movement trends. This method could be beneficial\nfor analyzing both critical medical events and chronic medical conditions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
