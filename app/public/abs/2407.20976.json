This opens up an avenue for transversal logical CNOT gates\nbetween distant logical qubits, whereby physical CNOT gates are performed\nbetween each corresponding physical qubit on the control and target logical\nqubits. However, the transversal CNOT can propagate errors from one logical\nqubit to another, leading to correlated errors between logical qubits. We have\ndeveloped a multi-pass iterative decoder that decodes each logical qubit\nseparately to deal with this correlated error. We show that under circuit-level\nnoise and only $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ code cycles, a threshold can still persist, and\nthe logical error rate will not be significantly degraded, matching the\nsub-threshold logical error rate scaling of $p^{\\lfloor\\frac{d}{2}\\rfloor}$ for\na distance $d$ rotated surface code.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ij8r8j5YKA2taK_emhOiB7e0Noq9uzVQrrm9r9j133o","pdfSize":"1764139"}
