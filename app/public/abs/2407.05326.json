These differentials can be used to construct spectral\nsequences that start with the cohomology of the standard complexes. We focus on\none such sequence that relates cohomology classes of graphs with different\nnumbers of hairs and compute its limit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
