LED trees can be used in computational phylogeny,\nsince they are a natural representative of the time evolution of a set of\nspecies in a feature space. This work is focused on LED trees that are length\nminimizers for a given set of leaves (species) and a given isomorphism type\n(the hierarchical structure of ancestors). The underlying minimization problem\ncan be seen as a variant of the classical Euclidean Steiner tree problem. Even\nthough it has a convex objective function, it is rather non-trivial, since it\nhas a non-convex feasible set. The main contribution of this paper is that we\nprovide a uniqueness result for this problem. Moreover, we explore some\ngeometrical and topological properties of the feasible set and we prove several\ngeometrical characteristics of the length minimizers that are analogical to the\nproperties of Steiner trees. At the end, we show a simple example of an\napplication in historical linguistics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EKN2s9ykeXdrCvdsLRBuE_7XWZ8WDkEMHu01N0yaeYo","pdfSize":"2038736"}
