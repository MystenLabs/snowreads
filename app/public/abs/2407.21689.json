SQUIDs are often paired with other detectors as a readout\nmechanism to obtain quantitative insight. SQUIDs have impacted many fields but\nmuch less addressed is its impact on the field of fundamental physics,\nparticularly in the search for dark matter. Dark matter is believed to make up\naround 27% of all mass-energy content of the universe and will provide critical\ninsight into understanding large-scale structures of the universe. Axions and\nWIMPs are the prominent two dark matter candidates whose search has been fueled\nby the usage of SQUID read-outs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
