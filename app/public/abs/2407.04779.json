Using a combined\nnumerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no\nthermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is\nsignalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is\ndriven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and\nthermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The\ndefects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant,\ncause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via\nbulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a\nwell-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike\nzero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions\nlack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum\nsystems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
