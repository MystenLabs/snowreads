To account for the observed orbital-period derivative, it\nrequires a mass transfer rate of $\\sim200\\dot{M}_{\\rm edd}$ ($\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nedd}$ is the Eddington accretion rate) from the donor star to the accreting\nneutron star. However, other potential models cannot be completely excluded. In\nthis work, we propose an anomalous magnetic braking (AMB) model to interpret\nthe detected orbital decay of M82 X-2. If the donor star is an Ap/Bp star with\nan anomalously strong magnetic field, the magnetic coupling between strong\nsurface magnetic field and irradiation-driven wind from the surface of the\ndonor star could cause an efficient angular-momentum loss, driving a rapid\norbital decay observed in M82 X-2. The AMB mechanism of an Ap/Bp star with a\nmass of $5.0-15.0~M_{\\odot}$ and a surface magnetic field of $3000-4500~\\rm G$\ncould produce the observed $\\dot{P}$ of M82 X-2. We also discuss the\npossibility of other alternative models including the companion star expansion\nand a surrounding circumbinary disk.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
