The\nlimiting factor in these systems is often the spin dephasing caused by\ninteractions and couplings with the vibrational motions of the molecular\nframework. This work introduces a systematic projection/embedding scheme to\nanalyze spin-phonon dynamics in molecular magnets. This scheme consolidates all\nspin/phonon couplings into a few collective degrees of freedom. quantum\nmechanically. Using parameters obtained from ab initio methods for spin/phonon\ncoupling via Zeeman interaction, we apply this approach to compute the\nelectronic spin relaxation times for a single-molecule qubit \\ce{VOPc(OH)8},\nwhich features a single unpaired electron localized on the central vanadium\natom. However, our general embedding scheme can be applied to any\nsingle-molecule magnet or qubit MOF with any coupling/interaction Hamiltonian.\nThis development offers a crucial tool for simulating spin relaxation in\ncomplex environments with significantly reduced computational complexity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
