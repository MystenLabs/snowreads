No assumptions whatsoever are\nmade of any relationship between the $X_i$:s and $Y_i$:s. We shall refer to\neach pairing of $X_i$ and $Y_i$ as an environment. We form the square risk\nfunctions $R_i(\\beta)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_i-\\beta X_i)^2\\right]$ for every\nenvironment and consider $m$ affine combinations of these $k$ risk functions.\nNext, we define a parameter space $\\Theta$ where we associate each point with a\nsubset of the unique elements of the covariance matrix of $(X_i,Y_i)$ for an\nenvironment. Then we study estimation of the $\\arg\\min$-solution set of the\nmaximum of a the $m$ affine combinations the of quadratic risk functions. We\nprovide a constructive method for estimating the entire $\\arg\\min$-solution set\nwhich is consistent almost surely outside a zero set in $\\Theta^k$. This method\nis computationally expensive, since it involves solving polynomials of general\ndegree. To overcome this, we define another approximate estimator that also\nprovides a consistent estimation of the solution set based on the bisection\nmethod, which is computationally much more efficient. We apply the method to\nworst risk minimization in the setting of structural equation models.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ADzRhLlbXK-hQc08VRBSbugc5nXtSRDvPANl_kcgBKs","pdfSize":"285713"}
