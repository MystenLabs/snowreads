However, most machine learning\nmodels identify correlations in data rather than inferring causation, making it\ndifficult to systematically plan for better outcomes. In this article, we\npropose and evaluate the use of causal machine learning for developing supply\nchain risk intervention models, and demonstrate its use with a case study in\nsupply chain risk management in the maritime engineering sector. Our findings\nhighlight that causal machine learning enhances decision-making processes by\nidentifying changes that can be achieved under different supply chain\ninterventions, allowing \"what-if\" scenario planning. We therefore propose\ndifferent machine learning developmental pathways for for predicting risk, and\nplanning for interventions to minimise risk and outline key steps for supply\nchain researchers to explore causal machine learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hHMjvB3xyqc5ffijx2hurqmPE4p5q7gq6AUaqoQgvY8","pdfSize":"1947171"}
