Resolution degradation reduces the recognition\nperformance of deep learning models trained by high-resolution images. Using\nvarious-resolution images for training can improve the model's robustness while\nsacrificing recognition performance for high-resolution images. To achieve\nhigher recognition performance at various resolutions, we propose a method of\nresolution-adaptive feature extraction with automatically switching networks.\nOur framework includes resolution expert modules specialized for different\nresolution degradations, including down-sampling and out-of-focus blurring. The\nframework automatically switches them depending on the degradation condition of\nan input image. Lower-resolution experts are trained by knowledge-distillation\nfrom the high-resolution expert in such a manner that both experts can extract\ncommon identity features. We applied our framework to three conventional neural\nnetwork models. The experimental results show that our method enhances the\nrecognition performance at low-resolution in the conventional methods and also\nmaintains their performance at high-resolution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
