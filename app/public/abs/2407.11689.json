Notions similar to chain complexes are developed to\nallow this form of integration to define notions of exterior derivative for\ndifferential forms, and of derivatives of functions as well. Resulting\nconclusions on integration, orientation, dimension, and differentiation are\ndiscussed. Applications include calculus on fractals, stochastic analysis,\ndiscrete analysis, and other novel forms of calculus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YpbilhLN6Yv6EcnCUkroCfePLsDTXMD84qizVSeUooE","pdfSize":"377585"}
