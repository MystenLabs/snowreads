Various\nimplementations of balancing the currents of a multiphase DC-DC converter are\ndiscussed, with a focus on achieving accurate current regulation without\nintroducing additional delay in the control system. Stochastic particle swarm\noptimization method is used to find optimal values of the PID controller\nparameters. An automatic constraint-handling in optimization are also discussed\nas relevant techniques in the field.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uZV9w6dTj-thgouISbP1oFs6EVQ6oEuCUfhYlSy5w0k","pdfSize":"1447218"}
