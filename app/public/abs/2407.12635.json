This paper introduces the novel concept of the dual\ncomplex adjoint matrices for dual quaternion matrices. We delve into exploring\nthe properties of this matrix, utilizing it to study eigenvalues of dual\nquaternion matrices and defining the concept of standard right eigenvalues.\nNotably, we leverage the properties of the dual complex adjoint matrix to\ndevise a direct solution to the Hand-Eye calibration problem. Additionally, we\napply this matrix to solve dual quaternion linear equations systems, thereby\nadvancing the Rayleigh quotient iteration method for computing eigenvalues of\ndual quaternion Hermitian matrices, enhancing its computational efficiency.\nNumerical experiments have validated the correctness of our proposed method in\nsolving the Hand-Eye calibration problem and demonstrated the effectiveness in\nimproving the Rayleigh quotient iteration method, underscoring the promising\npotential of dual complex adjoint matrices in tackling dual quaternion-related\nchallenges.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
