The proposed model exploits multiple representations\nof the wireless signal as inputs to the network and the feature extraction\nprocess combines convolutional and BiLSTM layers for processing the spatial and\ntemporal features of the signal, respectively. An attention layer is used after\nthe BiLSTM layer to emphasize the important temporal features. The experimental\nresults on the recent and realistic RML22 dataset demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed model with an accuracy up to around 99%. The model\nis compared with other benchmark models in the literature in terms of\nclassification accuracy, computational complexity, memory usage, and training\ntime to show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3_OHxnIOrLwxCwC1b1nVDt41qqUxYK2vtVipV4bKiH0","pdfSize":"616029"}
