For this, a\ncorrect estimation of the pKa values of the protonation sites of molecules is\nrequired. In this work, we present pKAce, a new web application for the\nprediction of micro-pKa values of the molecules' protonation sites. We adapt\nthe state-of-the-art, equivariant, TensorNet model originally developed for\nquantum mechanics energy and force predictions to the prediction of micro-pKa\nvalues. We show that an adapted version of this model can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance comparable with established models while trained\non just a fraction of their training data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
