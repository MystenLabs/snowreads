To address\nthis growing problem, several possible approaches have been proposed in the\nliterature: creating alternative blockchain consensus mechanisms, applying\nredundancy reduction techniques, utilizing renewable energy sources, and\nemploying energy-efficient devices, etc. In this paper, we follow the second\navenue and propose an efficient approach based on reinforcement learning that\nimproves the block broadcasting scheme in blockchain networks. The analysis and\nexperimental results confirmed that the proposed improvement of the block\npropagation scheme could cleverly handle network dynamics and achieve better\nresults than the default approach. Additionally, our technical integration of\nthe simulator and developed RL environment can be used as a complete solution\nfor further study of new schemes and protocols that use RL or other ML\ntechniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
