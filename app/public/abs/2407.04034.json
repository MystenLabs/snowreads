In this study, we propose a novel\nspoofing-robust ASV back-end classifier, optimized directly for the recently\nintroduced, architecture-agnostic detection cost function (a-DCF). We combine\na-DCF and binary cross-entropy (BCE) losses to optimize the network weights,\ncombined by a novel, straightforward detection threshold optimization\ntechnique. Experiments on the ASVspoof2019 database demonstrate considerable\nimprovement over the baseline optimized using BCE only (from minimum a-DCF of\n0.1445 to 0.1254), representing 13% relative improvement. These initial\npromising results demonstrate that it is possible to adjust an ASV system to\nfind appropriate balance across the contradicting aims of user convenience and\nsecurity against adversaries.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
