In this\nwork, we incorporate epistemic abilities of agents to refine the formal\ndefinition of distributed knowledge and introduce a formal characterization of\nfield knowledge. We propose that field knowledge serves as a dual to\ndistributed knowledge. Our approach utilizes epistemic logics with various\ngroup knowledge constructs, interpreted through weighted models. We delve into\nthe eight logics that stem from these considerations, explore their relative\nexpressivity and develop sound and complete axiomatic systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A1keGbHyovRJmZfKAgcuGB4h2H1nqux5_kXDSXnNyIw","pdfSize":"264690"}
