Identifying and\nremoving them is crucial to speed up the computation. Algorithms for SLG\nresolution offer the possibility of returning the residual program which can be\nused for computing answer sets for normal programs that do have a total\nwell-founded model. The residual program does not contain the parts of the\nprogram that do not influence the probability. In this paper, we propose to\nexploit the residual program for performing inference. Empirical results on\ngraph datasets show that the approach leads to significantly faster inference.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
