This discovery reflects and refines earlier questions such as, why\nand how are entire hydromagnetic structures only intermittently loaded with\nbright coronal plasma Litwin & Rosner (1993)? The present work scrutinizes more\nchromospheric and coronal data, with the aim of finding reproducible\nobservational constraints on coronal heating mechanisms. Six independent scans\nof chromospheric active region magnetic fields are investigated and correlated\nto overlying hot plasma loops. For the first time, the footpoints of over 30\nbright plasma loops are thus related to scalar proxies for the Poynting fluxes\nmeasured from the upper chromosphere. Although imperfect, the proxies all\nindicate a general lack of correlation between footpoint Poynting flux and loop\nbrightness. Our findings consolidate the claim that unobserved physical\nprocesses are at work which govern the heating of long-lived coronal loops.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
