The\nBTZ solutions corresponding to black holes, point particles and overspinning\nparticles can be considered either as objects in their own right, or as the\nexterior solution of compact objects with a given mass $M$ and spin $J$, such\nas rotating fluid stars. We compare and contrast the metric approach to the\ngroup-theoretical one of characterising the BTZ solutions as identifications of\n2+1-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime under an isometry. We then move on to\nthe two-body problem. In this paper, we restrict the two objects to the point\nparticle range $|J|-1\\le M<-|J|$, or their massless equivalents, obtained by an\ninfinite boost. (Both anti-de Sitter space and massless particles have $M=-1$,\n$J=0$). We derive analytic expressions for the total mass $M_\\text{tot}$ and\nspin $J_\\text{tot}$ of the system in terms of the six gauge-invariant\nparameters of the two-particle system: the rest mass and spin of each object,\nand the impact parameter and energy of the orbit. Based on work of Holst and\nMatschull on the case of two massless, nonspinning particles, we conjecture\nthat the black hole formation threshold is $M_\\text{tot}=|J_\\text{tot}|$. The\nthreshold solutions are then extremal black holes. We determine when the global\ngeometry is a black hole, an eternal binary system, or a closed universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
