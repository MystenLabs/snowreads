In general, such a graph may also have embeddings on different\nsurfaces. Enami focused on cubic graphs and showed that a 3-connected cubic\nplanar graph can be re-embedded on a surface of non-negative Euler\ncharacteristic if and only if the dual graph contains a specific subgraph.\nMotivated by applications to triangulated surfaces, we investigate strong\nre-embeddings and show that these are characterised by a subset of Enami's\nsubgraphs. Additionally, we provide criteria for when a graph does not possess\na strong re-embedding on the projective plane, the torus or the Klein bottle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
