YIG has 20 magnon bands, including 8 higher-energy bands denoted as\n$\\alpha_{1\\sim8}$, and 12 lower-energy bands denoted as $\\beta_{1\\sim12}$.\nHere, we study the impact of the complex intraband and interband magnon\ncouplings on the transport coefficients of YIG. Four-magnon processes in YIG\nare considered, and a self-consistent mean-field approximation is made for\nthese interaction terms. We find that the $\\beta$ bands exhibit minimal\nvariation with increasing temperature, whereas the $\\alpha$ bands undergo a\nnoticeable decline as the temperature rises. These counterintuitive results\nagree well with the observation of earlier inelastic neutron scattering\nexperiments and the results of the theoretical calculations in recent years. We\nalso find it sufficient to include only the contribution of magnons on the\nacoustic band $\\beta_1$ when studying the spin conductivity ($\\sigma_m$).\nHowever, when calculating the spin Seebeck coefficient ($S_m$) and the magnon\nthermal conductivity ($\\kappa_m$), the results calculated using only\n$\\beta_{1}$ show noticeable deviations over a large temperature range compared\nto the full band calculations. These deviations are well mitigated when the\n$\\beta_{2}$ and $\\beta_{3}$ bands are considered.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
