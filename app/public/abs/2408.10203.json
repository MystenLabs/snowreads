The penta-layer rhombohedral graphene/hBN moire\nsuperlattice has been shown to host fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect\n(FQAHE) at ~400 mK, triggering discussions around the underlying mechanism and\nthe role of moire effects. In particular, novel electron crystal states with\nnon-trivial topology have been proposed. Here we report DC electrical transport\nmeasurement in rhombohedral penta- and tetra-layer graphene/hBN moire\nsuperlattices at electronic temperatures down to ~40 mK. We observed two more\nFQAH states in the penta-layer devices than previously reported. In a new\ntetra-layer device, we observed FQAHE at filling factors v = 3/5 and 2/3 at 300\nmK. With a small bias current and the lowest temperature, we observed a new\nextended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) state and magnetic hysteresis, where Rxy\n= h/e2 and vanishing Rxx span a wide range of moire filling factor v from 0.5\nto up to 1.3. By increasing the temperature or current, FQAHE can be recovered\n-- suggesting the break-down of the EQAH states and a phase transition into the\nfractional quantum Hall liquid. Furthermore, we observed displacement\nfield-induced quantum phase transitions from the EQAH states to Fermi liquid,\nFQAH liquid and the likely composite Fermi liquid. Our observation establishes\na new topological phase of electrons with quantized Hall resistance at zero\nmagnetic field, and enriches the emergent quantum phenomena in materials with\ntopological flat bands.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3uAdVhRNVdf5JKWEzgm-XVqSQtawUbxl12156AbeeQg","pdfSize":"19786158"}
