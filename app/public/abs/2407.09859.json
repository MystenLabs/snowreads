The\nnotes assume a basic familiarity with equilibrium thermodynamics of phase\nseparation, and thus focus on three separate themes, which were discussed in\nthree separate lectures: (i) The kinetics of phase separation, including the\nearly-stage dynamics of spinodal decomposition and the late-stage dynamics of\nOstwald ripening. (ii) Transition state theory as a simple,\nthermodynamically-consistent kinetic theory of chemical reactions, which\npermits explicit driving in open systems. (iii) The combination of phase\nseparation and reactions, leading to active droplets. We discuss the two\nfundamental classes of internally-maintained and externally-maintained\ndroplets. A simple version of externally-maintained droplets permits an\neffective electrostatic analogy, which indicates how the reaction-diffusion\nsystem mediates long-ranged interactions. All these aspects are discussed in\nthe context of biomolecular condensates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
