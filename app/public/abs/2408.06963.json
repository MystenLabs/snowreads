This\nlimitation makes it difficult for diffusion models to remove noise from complex\nstructures effectively. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel convolutional\nattention mechanism Multi-head Self-attention mechanism based on Deformable\nconvolution (DCMSA) achieving efficient fusion of diffusion models with\nconvolutional attention. The implementation of DCMSA is as follows: First, we\nintegrate DCMSA into the UNet architecture to enhance the network's capability\nin recognizing and processing complex seismic data. Next, the diffusion model\nutilizes the UNet enhanced with DCMSA to process noisy data. The results\nindicate that this method addresses the shortcomings of diffusion models in\ncapturing local features and expressing spatial relationships effectively,\nproving superior to traditional diffusion models and standard neural networks\nin noise suppression and preserving meaningful seismic data information.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
