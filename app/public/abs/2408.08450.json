Identifying critical windows of susceptibility, which\nare specific periods during pregnancy when exposure has the most profound\neffects, is essential for developing targeted interventions. Distributed lag\nmodels (DLMs) are widely used in environmental epidemiology to analyze the\ntemporal patterns of exposure and their impact on health outcomes. However,\ntraditional DLMs focus on modeling the conditional mean, which may fail to\ncapture heterogeneity in the relationship between predictors and the outcome.\nMoreover, when modeling the distribution of health outcomes like gestational\nbirthweight, it is the extreme quantiles that are of most clinical relevance.\nWe introduce two new quantile distributed lag model (QDLM) estimators designed\nto address the limitations of existing methods by leveraging smoothness and\nshape constraints, such as unimodality and concavity, to enhance\ninterpretability and efficiency. We apply our QDLM estimators to the Colorado\nbirth cohort data, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying critical\nwindows of susceptibility and informing public health interventions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
