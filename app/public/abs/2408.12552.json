We use a special metric in the formal power series ring\n$\\K[[x]]$. The solutions of that equations are giving in terms of fixed points\nfor certain contractive maps in our metric framework. Our main tools are\nBanach's Fixed Point Theorem, Fundamental Calculus Theorem and Barrow's rule\nfor Ward's calculus. Later, we return to the usual differential calculus via\nSheffer's expansion of some kind of operators. Finally, we give some examples\nrelated, in some sense, to combinatorics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"AaeI4KUa2jhb-zaH-oAygBySY41fz3PFRgGXz6XW4YI","pdfSize":"243802"}
