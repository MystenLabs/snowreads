A triangle design is balanced if all\nnonzero vectors are involved in the same number of triangles. Over the binary\nfield GF$(2)$, we construct balanced triangle designs for all admissible $n$\n(congruent to $1$ modulo $6$) and an infinite class of balanced block-divisible\ntriangle designs. We also prove that the existence of a triangle design over\nGF$(2)$ invariant under the action of the Singer cycle group is equivalent to\nthe existence of a partition of $Z_{2^n-1}\\backslash\\{0\\}$ into special\n$18$-subsets and find such designs for $n=7$, $13$, $19$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
