Unfortunately, while the movies\nare in English, they are hard to understand for many native speakers due to the\ndialect of English that is spoken. In this article, we accomplish two goals:\n(1) create a phonetic sub-title model that is able to translate Nigerian\nEnglish speech to American English and (2) use the most advanced toxicity\ndetectors to discover how toxic the speech is. Our aim is to highlight the text\nin these videos which is often times ignored for lack of dialectal\nunderstanding due the fact that many people in Nigeria speak a native language\nlike Hausa at home.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q3pCxoGaNRuCGltAeJT41hcnelhDPXJqJJyVMh2rzyM","pdfSize":"3180940"}
