The effective two-dimensional gravitational description retains\nfeatures of the Lifshitz symmetry, which break the usual\n$\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ invariance down to $U(1)$. For this effective\ntwo-dimensional gravitational description, we derive a one-dimensional\nSchwarzian-like description, which inherits the $U(1)$ symmetry. The\nSchwarzian-like description allows us to compute a logarithmic correction to\nthe entropy through a saddle-point approximation of the two-dimensional\npartition function. This logarithmic correction removes the mass-gap, as\nexpected. Furthermore, the prefactor of the logarithmic term is $\\frac{1}{2}$,\nrather than $\\frac{3}{2}$ found for the $\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ invariant\ndescription, indeed reflecting having fewer symmetries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
