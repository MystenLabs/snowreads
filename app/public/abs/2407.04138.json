It is not always reasonable to assume that this\nlatent structure is static, and detecting when and how this driving structure\nchanges is often of interest. In this paper, we introduce a novel online\nmethodology for detecting changes within the latent structure of a network\npoint process. We focus on block-homogeneous Poisson processes, where latent\nnode memberships determine the rates of the edge processes. We propose a\nscalable variational procedure which can be applied on large networks in an\nonline fashion via a Bayesian forgetting factor applied to sequential\nvariational approximations to the posterior distribution. The proposed\nframework is tested on simulated and real-world data, and it rapidly and\naccurately detects changes to the latent edge process rates, and to the latent\nnode group memberships, both in an online manner. In particular, in an\napplication on the Santander Cycles bike-sharing network in central London, we\ndetect changes within the network related to holiday periods and lockdown\nrestrictions between 2019 and 2020.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
