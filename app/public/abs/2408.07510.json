This problem is PSPACE-complete in general. The\nconcept of the dominating set is known to be quite useful for analyzing\nwireless networks, social networks, and sensor networks. We develop an approach\nto solve the dominating set reconfiguration problem based on Answer Set\nProgramming (ASP). Our declarative approach relies on a high-level ASP\nencoding, and both the grounding and solving tasks are delegated to an\nASP-based combinatorial reconfiguration solver. To evaluate the effectiveness\nof our approach, we conduct experiments on a newly created benchmark set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
