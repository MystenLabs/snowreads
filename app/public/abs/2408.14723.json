A handy tool that enables farmers to\nreceive a diagnosis based on query pictures or the text description of\nsuspicious plants is in high demand for initiating treatment before potential\ndiseases spread further. In this paper, we develop a multimodal plant disease\nimage retrieval system to support disease search based on either image or text\nprompts. Specifically, we utilize the largest in-the-wild plant disease dataset\nPlantWild, which includes over 18,000 images across 89 categories, to provide a\ncomprehensive view of potential diseases relating to the query. Furthermore,\ncross-modal retrieval is achieved in the developed system, facilitated by a\nnovel CLIP-based vision-language model that encodes both disease descriptions\nand disease images into the same latent space. Built on top of the retriever,\nour retrieval system allows users to upload either plant disease images or\ndisease descriptions to retrieve the corresponding images with similar\ncharacteristics from the disease dataset to suggest candidate diseases for end\nusers' consideration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
