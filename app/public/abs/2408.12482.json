When latent variables are unaccounted for, structure learning for\nGaussian graphical models can be blurred by additional correlation between the\nobserved variables that is incurred by the latent variables. A standard\napproach for this problem is a latent version of the graphical lasso that\nsplits the inverse covariance matrix into a sparse and a low-rank part that are\npenalized separately. In this paper we propose a generalization of this via the\nflexible Golazo penalty. This allows us to introduce latent versions of for\nexample the adaptive lasso, positive dependence constraints or predetermined\nsparsity patterns, and combinations of those. We develop an algorithm for the\nlatent Gaussian graphical model with the Golazo penalty and demonstrate it on\nsimulated and real data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
