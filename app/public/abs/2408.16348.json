We obtain the sharp dispersion rate, below which generalized\nKP-I equations on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and on $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{T}$ exhibit\nquasilinear behavior. In the quasilinear regime, we show improved\nwell-posedness results relying on short-time Fourier restriction. In the\nsemilinear regime, we show sharp well-posedness with analytic data-to-solution\nmapping. On $\\mathbb{R}^2$ we cover the full subcritical range, whereas on\n$\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{T}$ the sharp well-posedness is strictly\nsubcritical. Nonlinear Loomis-Whitney inequalities are one ingredient. These\nare presently proved for Borel measures with growth condition reflecting the\ndifferent geometries of the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the cylinder $\\mathbb{R}\n\\times \\mathbb{T}$, and the torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$. Finally, we point out that on\ntori $\\mathbb{T}^2_\\gamma$, KP-I equations are never semilinear.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
