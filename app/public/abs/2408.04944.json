Remarkably, the\nproposed biosensor can identify three distinct disease markers through a\nsingle-shot photon transmission measurement, due to the couplings among the\nthree Su-Schrieffer-Heeger boundary modes in the photonic crystal. Our\nbiosensor design is more robust against defects and disorders inevitable in\nreal-life device applications than previous designs. Such robustness is\ninvaluable for achieving efficient, reliable, and integrated biosensing based\non nanophotonic systems. We further demonstrate that various combinations of\ndisease markers can be recognized via the photon transmission spectrum,\nunveiling a promising route toward high performance advanced biosensing for\nfuture biomedical technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BvHS2wOcANq-oTxDTX7ZchSaFPT8XyYaje9A5St9WZw","pdfSize":"5300317"}
