However, the unambiguous demonstration\nof the existence of a QSL in a \"non-engineered\" microscopic model (or in any\nmaterial) remains challenging. Here, using numerically-exact sign-problem-free\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a QSL arises in a non-engineered\nelectron-phonon model. Specifically, we investigate the ground-state phase\ndiagram of the bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a 2D triangular lattice\nat half filling (one electron per site) which we show includes a QSL phase\nwhich is fully gapped, exhibits no symmetry-breaking order, and supports\ndeconfined fractionalized holon excitations. This suggests new routes for\nfinding QSLs in realistic materials and high-$T_c$ superconductivity by lightly\ndoping them.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
