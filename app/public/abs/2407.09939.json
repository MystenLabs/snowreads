This paper presents POPK, a\nnew method that uses temporal-counterfactual analysis to mitigate the influence\nof popular news articles. By asking, \"What if, at a given time $t$, a set of\npopular news articles were competing for the user's attention to be clicked?\",\nPOPK aims to improve recommendation accuracy and diversity. We tested POPK on\nthree different language datasets (Japanese, English, and Norwegian) and found\nthat it successfully enhances traditional methods. POPK offers flexibility for\ncustomization to enhance either accuracy or diversity, alongside providing\ndistinct ways of measuring popularity. We argue that popular news articles\nalways compete for attention, even if they are not explicitly present in the\nuser's impression list. POPK systematically eliminates the implicit influence\nof popular news articles during each training step. We combine counterfactual\nreasoning with a temporal approach to adjust the negative sample space,\nrefining understanding of user interests. Our findings underscore how POPK\neffectively enhances the accuracy and diversity of recommended articles while\nalso tailoring the approach to specific needs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
