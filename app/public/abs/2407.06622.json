A framework for dealing with surprises is defined. Minimal sets of\nsurprises are provided together with time intervals where each surprise has\noccurred, and they are characterized from a model-based diagnosis point of\nview. Then, a probabilistic approach of surprise minimisation is proposed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
