We simultaneously fit $\\alpha$ as well as the host\ndispersion measure to the data of FRBs with known redshifts. We find that\n$\\alpha\\approx 0$ is preferred over higher values of $\\alpha$ with either a\npositive or negative sign. Such constraints have implications for our\nunderstanding of galaxy formation and can be used to inform galaxy and large\nscale simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
