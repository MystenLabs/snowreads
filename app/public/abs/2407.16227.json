However, alpha-Ta films suffer\nfrom many growth-induced structural inadequacies that negatively affect their\nperformance. We have therefore explored a new synthesis method for alpha-Ta\nfilms which allows the growth of these films with unprecedented quality. Using\nthis method, high quality alpha-Ta films are deposited at a comparably high\nsubstrate temperature of 1150 C. They are single-phase alpha-Ta and have a\nsingle out-of-plane (110) orientation. They consist of grains above 2 um that\nhave one of three possible in-plane orientations. As shown by scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss studies the\nsubstrate-film interfaces are sharp with no observable intermixing. The\nobtained insights into the epitaxial growth of body-centered-cubic films on\nquasi-hexagonal substrates lay the basis for harnessing the high structural\ncoherence of such films in various applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
