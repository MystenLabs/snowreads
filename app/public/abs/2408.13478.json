The cERL\nbegan operating in 2013 to create a high-current beam with a low-emittance beam\nwith stable continuous wave (CW) superconducting cavities. Owing to the\ndevelopment of critical components, such as the DC gun, superconducting\ncavities, and the design of ideal beam transport optics, we have successfully\nestablished approximately 1 mA stable CW operation with a small beam emittance\nand extremely small beam loss. This study presents the details of our key\ntechnologies and experimental results for achieving 100% energy recovery\noperation with extremely small beam loss during a stable, approximately 1 mA CW\nbeam operation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
