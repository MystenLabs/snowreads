It is an extension of the well-known idea of\ndistinguishing all maximal stars in a graph. It was introduced in literature in\n1985 and studied by many authors in various variants, but always for stars. We\nestimate new invariants regarding triangles for proper and general colorings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hbIrxFbQet_mO2VAkUCCXRATez8xZzof4kULwuYsWRA","pdfSize":"93936","objectId":"0x9d47e5f5c1458ad24b01ae1d0422fe8d0779b57a03881cac3801a91915691900","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
