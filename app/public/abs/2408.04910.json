Our system\nseamlessly integrates a Chess engine with a language model, enabling it to\npredict moves and provide strategic explanations. Leveraging a vector database\nto achieve retrievable answer generation, our OpenSI AI system elucidates its\ndecision-making process, bridging the gap between raw computation and\nhuman-like understanding. Our choice of Chess as the demonstration environment\nunderscores the versatility of our approach. Beyond Chess, our system holds\npromise for diverse applications, from medical diagnostics to financial\nforecasting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
