LFIT has been implemented in purely\nsymbolic algorithms, but they are unable to deal with noise or generalize to\nunobserved transitions. Rule extraction based neural network methods suffer\nfrom overfitting, while more general implementation that categorize rules\nsuffer from combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a technique to\nleverage variable permutation invariance inherent in symbolic domains. Our\ntechnique ensures that the permutation and the naming of the variables would\nnot affect the results. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of\nthis method with various experiments.
