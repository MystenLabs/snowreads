This method was designed based on the assumption that\nsimilar neurons could serve identical functions. We thus cluster the neurons\nbased on the similarity between neurons. The procedures are to partition the\nneurons in the database into groups, and then assemble the groups into\npotential modules. Some of the modules correspond to known neuropils, including\nMedulla were obtained. The same clustering algorithm was applied to analyze\nMedulla's structure. Another possible application of the clustering result is\nto study the brain-wide neuron connectome by looking at the connectivity\nbetween groups of neurons.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
