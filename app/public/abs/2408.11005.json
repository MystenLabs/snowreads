Under certain\nconditions, such randomly perturbed dynamical systems can be interpreted as an\naveraged dynamical system, whose weighting coefficients, that depend on the\nstate trajectory of the underlying averaged system, are assumed to be strictly\npositive with sum unity. Here, we provide a large deviation result for the\ncorresponding family of processes, i.e., a variational problem formulation\nmodeling the most likely sample path leading to certain noise-induced\nrare-events. This remarkably allows us to provide a computational algorithm for\nsolving the corresponding variational problem. In the second part of the paper,\nwe use some of the insights from the first part and provide a new perspective\non the learning dynamics for a class of learning problems, whose averaged\ngradient dynamical systems, from continuous-time perspective, are guided by a\nset of subsampled datasets that are obtained from the original dataset via\nbootstrapping or other related resampling-based techniques. Finally, we present\nsome numerical results for a typical nonlinear regression problem, where the\ncorresponding averaged gradient system is interpreted as random walks on a\ngraph, whose outgoing edges are uniformly chosen at random.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
