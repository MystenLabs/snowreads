In this work, we\ndescribe a general approach to the first principles estimation of generic\nspin-orbit-phonon couplings suitable for investigating these diverse effects.\nThe method is demonstrated by application to study the temperature-dependent\noptical phonon lineshapes in MnPSe$_3$, for which we find quantitative\nagreement with recent experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
