Answering a question of Hamkins and Li\n\\cite{HaLi}, we show that the Medvedev degrees of countable ordinals are far\nfrom linearly ordered in multiple ways, our main result here being that there\nis a club of ordinals which is an antichain with respect to Medvedev\nreducibility. We then generalize these results to arbitrary\n``reasonably-definable\" reducibilities, under appropriate set-theoretic\nhypotheses.\n  We then turn from ordinals to general structures. We show that some of the\nresults above yield characterizations of counterexamples to Vaught's\nconjecture; another applies to all situations, assigning an ordinal to any\nreasonable class of structures and ``measure\" on that class. We end by\ndiscussing some directions for future research.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fvVe0XqvFxNvT5bYDl2xTFUcc0EhUqsFJjj_gRiIGP4","pdfSize":"218583"}
