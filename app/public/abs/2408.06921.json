In the near-infrared region, SPDs based on\nInGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are the primary candidates\nfor practical applications because of their small size, low cost and ease of\noperation. Driven by the escalating demands for quantum communication and\nlidar, the performance of InGaAs/InP SPDs has been continuously enhanced. This\npaper provides a comprehensive review of advances in InGaAs/InP SPDs over the\npast 10 years, including the investigation into SPAD structures and mechanisms,\nas well as emerging readout techniques for both gated and free-running mode\nSPDs. In addition, future prospects are also summarised.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7rdt_d3u0xkcfwA8PfXknydVHPx8_gjBwDW6XkgE96U","pdfSize":"11602838"}
