Electron and muon decay modes ($ell$ = e or$\\mu$) are studied in the\ndata collected with the CMS detector in 2017, in dedicated runs with reduced\ninstantaneous luminosity. The data sets correspond to integrated luminosities\nof 298 $\\pm$ 6 pb$^{-1}$ at 5.02 TeV and 206 $\\pm$ 5 pb$^{-1}$ at 13 TeV.\nMeasured values of the products of the total inclusive cross sections and the\nbranching fractions at 5.02 TeV are $\\sigma$(pp $\\to$ W+X)$\\mathcal{B}$(W $\\to$\n$\\ell\\nu$) = 7300 $\\pm$ 10 (stat) $\\pm$ 60 (syst) $\\pm$ 140 (lumi) pb, and\n$\\sigma$(pp $\\to$ Z+X)$\\mathcal{B}$(Z $\\to$ $\\ell^+\\ell^-$) = 669 $\\pm$ 2\n(stat) $\\pm$ 6 (syst) $\\pm$ 13 (lumi) pb for the dilepton invariant mass in the\nrange of 60-120 GeV.

The measured values agree with cross section\ncalculations at next-to-next-to-leading-order in perturbative quantum\nchromodynamics. Fiducial and total inclusive cross sections, ratios of cross\nsections of W$^+$ and W$^-$ production as well as inclusive W and Z boson\nproduction, and ratios of these measurements at 5.02 and 13 TeV are reported.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eizX9SHTsrzo_NynCvaXcBvWSnUl79r_-c_3fnT7qA4","pdfSize":"1407381"}
