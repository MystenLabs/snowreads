We interpret this event as being due to a structured\ndisc of material transiting in front of the star. The disc is in orbit around a\nsubstellar object with the mass and luminosity of a brown dwarf or smaller. We\nwant to determine the expected duration and ending date of the eclipse. We\nmodelled a tilted and inclined azimuthally symmetric ring system around an\nunseen companion and calculated the resulting time-varying light curve as the\nobject transited in front of the star. We made an initial estimate of the ring\nparameters and used these as inputs to an MCMC algorithm to determine the\ngeometric properties of the rings with associated uncertainties. The model most\nconsistent with the light curve to date is a two-ring system at high\ninclination with respect to the line of sight that has a semi-major axis of\n71.6 stellar radii. With an estimate of the stellar radius, the transverse\nvelocity is around 0.7 km/s, which if bound to the star is an orbit with a\nsemi-major axis of around 13000 au, placing it in the Oort cloud of the parent\nstar. The transit is ongoing and will finish around MJD 61526 (May 1 2027). We\nencourage the community to continue observing this object in order to\nunderstand its properties.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
