We introduce\nExpoMamba, a novel architecture that integrates components of the frequency\nstate space within a modified U-Net, offering a blend of efficiency and\neffectiveness. This model is specifically optimized to address mixed exposure\nchallenges, a common issue in low-light image enhancement, while ensuring\ncomputational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that ExpoMamba enhances\nlow-light images up to 2-3x faster than traditional models with an inference\ntime of 36.6 ms and achieves a PSNR improvement of approximately 15-20% over\ncompeting models, making it highly suitable for real-time image processing\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"14NFRIXLW1WhsmkbcDe3L8xjzrEIG4elZP3WN0cfM-Q","pdfSize":"5179225"}
