The miniBeBe detector was designed and is currently being developed\nby the MexNICA Collaboration to contribute to the level-zero trigger of the\nTime of Flight. The mechanical structure meets the requirements of minimizing\nthe material budget and be free of ferromagnetic materials, without\ncompromising its robustness. The design also allows easy module replacement for\nmaintenance and overall removal at the end of the first stage of the\nexperiment, without affecting the rest of the subsystems, to leave room for the\ninstallation of the Inner Tracking System. In addition, a Finite Element Method\nanalysis of the mechanical components under load was performed. Based on this\nanalysis, it was determined that the design meets the space constraints within\nthe Multi-Purpose Detector, as well as a deformation of less than 1 mm with\noverall stress of less than 2 MPa, such that no material used in the design is\nat risk of mechanical failure during operation. A cooling system heat transfer\nanalysis was performed showing that the detector Silicon Photo-Multipliers can\nbe kept within a temperature range of 19$^{\\circ}$C to 23$^{\\circ}$C, which is\nadequate for their optimal performance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yfNDLK50pYRmSHT2JjNF6TFkpvZnSfY8sqFoLsQvsZc","pdfSize":"19223534","txDigest":"DAEE1BBCGDZt1d79NDmu3sL2k1b2cPWhgKAR4EvHJuSt","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
