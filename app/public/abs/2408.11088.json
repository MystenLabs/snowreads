We consider defects in ABJM theory with\nmonodromy for $U(1)^4\\subset SO(8)$ global symmetry, as well as in\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ mABJM SCFT, which arises from the RG flow of a mass deformation\nof ABJM theory, with monodromy for $U(1)^3\\subset SU(3)\\times U(1)$ global\nsymmetry. We show that the defects of the two SCFTs are connected by a line of\nbulk marginal mass deformations and argue that they are also related by bulk RG\nflow. In all cases we allow for the possibility of conical singularities at the\nlocation of the defect. Various physical observables of the defects are\ncomputed including the defects conformal weight and the partition function, as\nwell as associated supersymmetric Renyi entropies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
