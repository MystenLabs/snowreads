We study the distribution of the Euler--Kronecker\nconstant $\\gamma_q^+$ of the maximal real subfield of $\\mathbb Q(\\zeta_q)$ as\n$q$ ranges over the primes. Further, we consider the distribution of\n$\\gamma_q^+-\\gamma_q$, with $\\gamma_q$ the Euler--Kronecker constant of\n$\\mathbb Q(\\zeta_q)$ and show how it is connected with Kummer's conjecture,\nwhich predicts the asymptotic growth of the relative class number of $\\mathbb\nQ(\\zeta_q)$. We improve, for example, the known results on the bounds on\naverage for the Kummer ratio and we prove analogous sharp bounds for\n$\\gamma_q^+-\\gamma_q$. The methods employed are partly inspired by those used\nby Granville (1990) and Croot and Granville (2002) to investigate Kummer's\nconjecture. We supplement our theoretical findings with numerical illustrations\nto reinforce our conclusions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
