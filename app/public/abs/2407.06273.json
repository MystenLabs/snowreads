Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels\nmeasured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from\nbright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter\nthan the photometric detection-limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated\nfrom Planck HFI $350 {~\\rm\\mu m}$ and $550 {~\\rm\\mu m}$ intensities, using a\nnew self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight\nadditional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey\nyields a highly significant detection ($6.8\\sigma$) of the COB at ${\\rm\n11.16\\pm 1.65~(1.47~sys,~0.75~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}}$ at the LORRI pivot\nwavelength of 0.608 $\\mu$m. The estimated integrated intensity from background\ngalaxies, ${\\rm 8.17\\pm 1.18 ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ can account for the great\nmajority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, ${\\rm 2.99\\pm2.03~\n(1.75~sys,~1.03~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ is formally classified as\nanomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest\ninterpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_VhQ_pK1vOoFNeHK7zOIQpqaF1gDAEZ0pYANJJxdlxA","pdfSize":"14281398"}
