A\nminiaturised one-degree-of-freedom joint-angle sensor is devised, using a\nsingle light emitting/receiving optical fibre with a coupler connected to a\nKeyence (FS-N11MN, Osaka, Japan) sensor that supplies and detects light through\nthe optical fibres. A curvature-varying reflective surface integrated in the\njoint demonstrates non-contact light intensity-based sensing. Various reflector\ngeometries and surface colours are designed to compare sensor output for\nachieving a large angle range and improved sensitivity for the proposed\nminiaturised robotic shape-sensing applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
