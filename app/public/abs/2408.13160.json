This study introduces KonvLiNA, a novel framework that integrates\nConvolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (cKAN) with Nystr\\\"om attention\nmechanisms for effective crop field detection. Leveraging KAN adaptive\nactivation functions and the efficiency of Nystr\\\"om attention in handling\nlargescale data, KonvLiNA significantly enhances feature extraction, enabling\nthe model to capture intricate patterns in complex agricultural environments.\nExperimental results on rice crop dataset demonstrate KonvLiNA superiority over\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving a 0.415 AP and 0.459 AR with the Swin-L\nbackbone, outperforming traditional YOLOv8 by significant margins.\nAdditionally, evaluation on the COCO dataset showcases competitive performance\nacross small, medium, and large objects, highlighting KonvLiNA efficacy in\ndiverse agricultural settings. This work highlights the potential of hybrid KAN\nand attention mechanisms for advancing precision agriculture through improved\ncrop field detection and management.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
