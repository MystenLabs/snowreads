We classify the\nultrahomogeneous finite binary relational structures with one asymmetric binary\nrelation and arbitrarily many unary relations. In other words, we classify the\nfinite vertex-colored oriented ultrahomogeneous graphs. The classification\ncomprises several general methods with which directed graphs can be combined or\nextended to create new ultrahomogeneous graphs. Together with explicitly given\nexceptions, we obtain exactly all vertex-colored oriented ultrahomogeneous\ngraphs this way. Our main technique is a technical tool that characterizes\nprecisely under which conditions two binary relational structures with disjoint\nunary relations can be combined to form a larger ultrahomogeneous structure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mgX6yDLBFv7ho6jr0hJ71qsNrEzJFVqyBYcxYAU4LEM","pdfSize":"477504"}
