Depending on the application scenario, these\nproblems involve from purely discrete descriptions of tasks (finite loads) and\nagents (finite resources), to a mixture of discrete and continuous elements, to\nfully continuous descriptions of the same. Yet, it is possible to find common\nfeatures that underline all the above formulations, which we aim to illustrate\nhere. By doing so, we aim to point the reader to novel references related to\nthese problems. The short article outline is the following: Static coverage via\nconcurrent area partitioning and assignment; Static coverage as a discrete task\nassignment; and Continuum task assignment for large-scale swarms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
