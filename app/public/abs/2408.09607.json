Although valuable in such applications, the costs of\nexperiments often drive experimenters to seek more efficient designs. Recently,\nexperimenters have started to examine such efficiency questions from an\noptimization perspective, as experimental design problems are fundamentally\ndecision-making problems. This perspective offers a lot of flexibility in\nleveraging various existing optimization tools to study experimental design\nproblems. This manuscript thus aims to examine the foundations of experimental\ndesign problems in the context of causal inference as viewed through an\noptimization lens.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ICjno2p3XXF5iZ9-DtXqw5WfU3nnzfAlwlLcoZMAt_8","pdfSize":"794975"}
