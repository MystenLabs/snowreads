Here,\nwe demonstrate a photonic Galton board that enables on-chip observation of\nsingle-photon interference. The photonic Galton board, which can be considered\nas a simplified Boson sampler, consists of a directional coupler matrix\nterminated by an array of superconducting nanowire detectors to provide\nspatiotemporal resolution. This design also allows for photon-number-resolving\ncapability, making it suitable for high-speed photon counting. Our results\ndemonstrate the compatibility between single-photon detector array and photonic\nintegrated circuits, paving the way for implementing on-chip large-scale\nquantum optics experiments and photonic quantum computing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sEW6rG5nOSn9wW0PPKzg1g0gqM4ceGQy4-aklUsyCwE","pdfSize":"7882666"}
