In this work, we present\nthe design and characterization of a new 60-cm diameter Reflective Half-Wave\nPlate (RHWP) polarization modulator for the 90 GHz band telescope of the\nCosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) project. The RHWP consists of an\narray of parallel wires (diameter $50~\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, $175~\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\npitch) positioned $0.88~\\mathrm{mm}$ from an aluminum mirror. In lab tests, it\nwas confirmed that the wire resonance frequency ($f_\\mathrm{res}$) profile is\nconsistent with the target, $139~\\mathrm{Hz}<f_\\mathrm{res}<154~\\mathrm{Hz}$ in\nthe optically active region (diameter smaller than $150~\\mathrm{mm}$),\npreventing the wire vibration during operation and reducing the RHWP\ndeformation under the wire tension. The mirror tilt relative to the rotating\naxis was controlled to be $<15''$, corresponding to an increase in beam width\ndue to beam smearing of $<0.6''$, negligible compared to the beam's full-width\nhalf-maximum of $36'$. The median and 16/84th percentile of the wire--mirror\nseparation residual was $0.048^{+0.013}_{-0.014}~\\mathrm{mm}$ in the optically\nactive region, achieving a modulation efficiency\n$\\epsilon=96.2_{+0.5}^{-0.4}\\%$ with an estimated bandpass of 34 GHz. The\nangular velocity of the RHWP was maintained to an accuracy of within $0.005\\%$\nat the nominal rotation frequency ($2.5~\\mathrm{Hz}$). The RHWP has been\nsuccessfully integrated into the CLASS 90 GHz telescope and started taking data\nin June 2024, replacing the previous modulator that has been in operation since\nJune 2018.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BUJg9J1YdFgTx3Kl767kHcDO8yZhf61W9sfUNs4C6zk","pdfSize":"10029320"}
