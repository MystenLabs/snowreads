As a result, towers of states become massless and their\npresence pushes the fundamental scale not to coincide with $M_{\\rm P}$ but\nrather with the $species\\, scale$, $\\Lambda$. This scale transforms as an\nautomorphic form of the theory's duality symmetries. We propose that the\ninflaton potential should be 1) an automorphic invariant form, non-singular\nover all moduli space, 2) depending only on $\\Lambda$ and its field\nderivatives, and 3) approaching constant values in the large moduli to ensure a\nlong period of inflation. These conditions lead to the proposal $V \\sim\n\\lambda(\\phi, \\phi^*)$, with $\\lambda = G^{i\\bar{j}} (\\partial_i\n\\Lambda)(\\partial_{\\bar{j}} \\Lambda) / \\Lambda^2$, determining the 'species\nscale convex hull'. For a single elliptic complex modulus with $SL(2, Z)$\nsymmetry, this results in an inflaton potential $V \\simeq (\\text{Im} \\tau)^2\n|\\tilde{G}_2|^2 / N^2$, with $N \\simeq -\\log(\\text{Im} \\tau |\\eta(\\tau)|^4)$,\nwhere $\\eta$ is the Dedekind function and $\\tilde{G}_2$ the Eisenstein modular\nform of weight 2. Surprisingly, this potential at large modulus resembles that\nof the Starobinsky model. We compute inflation parameters yielding results\nsimilar to Starobinsky's, but extended to modular invariant expressions.\nInterestingly, the number of e-folds is proportional to the number of species\nin the tower, $N_e \\simeq N$, and $\\epsilon \\simeq \\Lambda^4$ at large moduli,\nsuggesting that the tower of states plays an important role in the inflation\nprocess.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uQ1uQ_hPQ5sCokaBhNQhSGt3vgeOAtq1Wmax3S4fURQ","pdfSize":"737442"}
