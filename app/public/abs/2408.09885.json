In\nthe current advertising pattern, the oriented targets are the online store\nowners who are willing to pay extra fees to enhance the position of their\nstores. On the other hand, brand suppliers are also desirable to advertise\ntheir products in stores to boost brand sales. However, the currently used\nadvertising mode cannot satisfy the demand of both stores and brand suppliers\nsimultaneously. To address this, we innovatively propose a joint advertising\nmodel termed Joint Auction, allowing brand suppliers and stores to\ncollaboratively bid for advertising slots, catering to both their needs.\nHowever, conventional advertising auction mechanisms are not suitable for this\nnovel scenario. In this paper, we propose JRegNet, a neural network\narchitecture for the optimal joint auction design, to generate mechanisms that\ncan achieve the optimal revenue and guarantee near dominant strategy incentive\ncompatibility and individual rationality. Finally, multiple experiments are\nconducted on synthetic and real data to demonstrate that our proposed joint\nauction significantly improves platform revenue compared to the known\nbaselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
