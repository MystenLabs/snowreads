These coefficients play a crucial\nrole in characterizing stochastic processes. Our proposed approach provides a\nversatile framework for localized coefficient estimation, combining the\nflexibility of nonparametric methods with the interpretability of global\nparametric approaches. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through use\ncases involving both stationary and non-stationary time series analysis.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate its applicability to real-world complex systems,\nspecifically in the energy conversion process analysis of a wind turbine.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
