We prove that for\nany $h \\in H$, the conjugacy class $[h]_H$ of $h$ is described geometrically by\nthe move-set of its linearization, while the set of elements conjugating $h$ to\na given $h'\\in [h]_H$ is described by the the fix-set of its linearization.\nExamples include all affine Coxeter groups, certain crystallographic groups,\nand the group $G$ itself.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
