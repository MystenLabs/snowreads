Good benchmarks empower scientists, engineers,\nprogrammers, and users to understand a computing system's power, but bad\nbenchmarks can misdirect research and inhibit progress. In this Perspective, we\nsurvey the science of quantum computer benchmarking. We discuss the role of\nbenchmarks and benchmarking, and how good benchmarks can drive and measure\nprogress towards the long-term goal of useful quantum computations, i.e.,\n\"quantum utility\". We explain how different kinds of benchmark quantify the\nperformance of different parts of a quantum computer, we survey existing\nbenchmarks, critically discuss recent trends in benchmarking, and highlight\nimportant open research questions in this field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
