Our approach is direct, which consists of independently deriving\nthe sharp dispersive decay estimates for the density function and establishing\nthe boundedness of energy norms. The global in time well-posedness is done\nwithout introducing the phase correction, while the phase modification is\nexplicit in terms of the density function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
