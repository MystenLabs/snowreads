Thanks to advancements in Deep Learning for\ncomputer vision, tangible visual features can now be leveraged to enhance the\nbrowsing and searching experience of electronic services. Users usually have\nspecific search criteria to meet, but most services will not offer flexible\nsearch filters. This research emphasizes the importance of integrating visual\nand descriptive features to improve the tangibility and efficiency of\ne-services. A prime example of an electronic service that can benefit from this\nis real-estate websites. Searching for real estate properties that match user\npreferences is usually demanding and lacks visual filters, such as the Damage\nLevel to the property. The research introduces a novel visual descriptive\nfeature, the Damage Level, which utilizes a deep learning network known as\nMask-RCNN to estimate damage in real estate images. Additionally, a model is\ndeveloped to incorporate the Damage Level as a tangible feature in electronic\nreal estate services, with the aim of enhancing the tangible customer\nexperience.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
