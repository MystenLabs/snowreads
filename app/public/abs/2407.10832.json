Self-organization is present at smaller\nscales as well: cells interact and move during development to produce patterns\nin fish skin, and wound healing relies on cell migration. Across these\nexamples, scientists are interested in shedding light on the individual\nbehaviors informing spatial group dynamics and in predicting the patterns that\nwill emerge under altered agent interactions. One challenge to these goals is\nthat images of self-organization -- whether empirical or generated by models --\nare qualitative. To get around this, there are many methods for transforming\nqualitative pattern data into quantitative information. In this tutorial\nchapter, I survey some methods for quantifying self-organization, including\norder parameters, pair correlation functions, and techniques from topological\ndata analysis. I also discuss some places that I see as especially promising\nfor quantitative data, modeling, and data-driven approaches to continue meeting\nin the future.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-FPS-VgRo3USv9H87NK934yV39fhqgC8lPXXUPPmFt4","pdfSize":"7651183","objectId":"0xc270d9f46169ff490cca7bbb4892a89da1b6f6617b1ba9515dcc92ab7ae01c46","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
