Named after the\nconstellation, geminal wavefunctions provide the mean-field like representation\nof paired-electron wavefunctions in quantum chemistry, tying in with the Lewis\npicture of chemical bonding via electron pairs. Unfortunately, despite its\nmean-field product wave function description, the computational cost of\ncomputing geminal wavefunctions is dominated by the permanent overlaps with\nSlater determinant reference states. We review recent approaches to reduce the\nfactorial scaling of the permanent, and present the bi-variational principle as\na consistent framework for the projected Schr\\\"odinger Equation and the\ncomputation of reduced density matrices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WeqRsI4qEDBo5DVdavM4mBO1v2zfUOlIaB73KiPHGuU","pdfSize":"331616"}
