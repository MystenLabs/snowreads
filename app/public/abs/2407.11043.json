Moreover, the business landscape\nhas witnessed continuous transformation, closely intertwined with technological\nadvancements. Our main goal is to offer researchers and process analysts\ninsights into the latest developments concerning Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nand Machine Learning (ML) to optimize their processes in an organization and\nidentify research gaps and future directions in the field.\nDesign/methodology/approach- In this study, we perform a systematic review of\nacademic literature to investigate the integration of AI/ML in business process\nmanagement (BPM). We categorize the literature according to the BPM life-cycle\nand employ bibliometric and objective-oriented methodology, to analyze related\npapers.\n  Findings- In business process management and process map, AI/ML has made\nsignificant improvements using operational data on process metrics. These\ndevelopments involve two distinct stages: (1) process enhancement, which\nemphasizes analyzing process information and adding descriptions to process\nmodels, and (2) process improvement, which focuses on redesigning processes\nbased on insights derived from analysis. Research limitations/implications-\nWhile this review paper serves to provide an overview of different approaches\nfor addressing process-related challenges, it does not delve deeply into the\nintricacies of fine-grained technical details of each method. This work focuses\non recent papers conducted between 2010 and 2024. Originality/value- This paper\nadopts a pioneering approach by conducting an extensive examination of the\nintegration of AI/ML techniques across the entire process management lifecycle.\nAdditionally, it presents groundbreaking research and introduces AI/ML-enabled\nintegrated tools, further enhancing the insights for future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TP5AQ5C5Wr_ovOIMUD2d2h1I4HKfYA5hEhn1-yvIsSc","pdfSize":"2123468"}
