Using the DP-SGD algorithm, we\ndemonstrate that KAN can be made private in a straightforward manner and\nevaluated its performance across several datasets. Our results indicate that\nthe accuracy of KAN is not only comparable with MLP but also experiences\nsimilar deterioration due to privacy constraints, making it suitable for\ndifferentially private model training.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
