Despite its prevalence, generic mechanisms for this\nfundamental form of learning remain poorly defined. Drawing inspiration from\nprior work on systems that respond adaptively to step inputs, we study\nhabituation from a nonlinear dynamics perspective. This approach enables us to\nformalize classical hallmarks of habituation that have been experimentally\nidentified in diverse organisms and stimulus scenarios. We use this framework\nto investigate distinct dynamical circuits capable of habituation. In\nparticular, we show that driven linear dynamics of a memory variable with\nstatic nonlinearities acting at the input and output can implement numerous\nhallmarks in a mathematically interpretable manner. This work establishes a\nfoundation for understanding the dynamical substrates of this primitive\nlearning behavior and offers a blueprint for the identification of habituating\ncircuits in biological systems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"D4QWcar1Bu81neVbhTsi7jq0EmwZm1H8cy5rL_1gI30","pdfSize":"1509315"}
