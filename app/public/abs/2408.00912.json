The spatial operator for the nonlocal\nwave equation is given by a nonlocal Laplace operator with a compactly\nsupported integral kernel. We follow a unified approach based on the Fourier\nmultipliers of the nonlocal Laplace operator, which allows the study of regular\nas well as distributional solutions of the nonlocal wave equation, integrable\nas well as singular kernels, in any spatial dimension. In addition, the results\nextend beyond operators with singular kernels to nonlocal-pseudo differential\noperators. We present results on the spatial and temporal regularity of\nsolutions in terms of regularity of the initial data or the forcing term.\nMoreover, solutions of the nonlocal wave equation are shown to converge to the\nsolution of the classical wave equation for two types of limits: as the spatial\nnonlocality vanishes or as the singularity of the integral kernel approaches a\ncertain critical singularity that depends on the spatial dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vFZCZoDn-aQUItAJeSShUmLNRi5lRTqTpAnnfC8-rs8","pdfSize":"291550"}
