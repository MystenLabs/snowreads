Even though PC, web, and mobile are still the top platforms\nfor software development, it is important for university computer science (CS)\nprograms to expose students to VR as a development platform. Additionally, it\nis important for CS students to learn how to learn about new technologies,\nsince change is constant in the CS field. CS curriculum changes happen much\nslower than the pace of technology adoption. As new technologies are\nintroduced, CS faculty and students often learn together, especially in smaller\nCS programs. This paper describes how student-led VR projects are used, across\nthe CS curriculum, as basic CS concepts are covered. The student-led VR\nprojects are engaging, and promote learning and creativity. Additionally, each\nstudent project inspires more students to try their hand at VR development as\nwell.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/General Literature","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
