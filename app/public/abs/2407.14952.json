Globally, we compute each geometric term of the Jacquet-Rallis\nrelative trace formula on the general linear group for regular supported test\nfunctions. We prove that it can be described by the regular orbital integral.\nLocally, we show that the regular orbital integral can be compared with the\nsemisimple orbital integral on the unitary group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bUs5xdmcw1_WaMjyuLShp_uL_BpO3E97Hy0Ti1fH0iA","pdfSize":"679741","objectId":"0x2ee907cc77915d53b5601fe982809a58d795904a641998ef032b5e55b4dfb2c1","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
