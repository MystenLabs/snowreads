Previous approaches have primarily employed a unidirectional\nparadigm, where the compression of one view is dependent on the other,\nresulting in imbalanced compression. To address this issue, we introduce a\nsymmetric bidirectional stereo image compression architecture, named BiSIC.\nSpecifically, we propose a 3D convolution based codec backbone to capture local\nfeatures and incorporate bidirectional attention blocks to exploit global\nfeatures. Moreover, we design a novel cross-dimensional entropy model that\nintegrates various conditioning factors, including the spatial context, channel\ncontext, and stereo dependency, to effectively estimate the distribution of\nlatent representations for entropy coding. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed BiSIC outperforms conventional image/video compression\nstandards, as well as state-of-the-art learning-based methods, in terms of both\nPSNR and MS-SSIM.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
