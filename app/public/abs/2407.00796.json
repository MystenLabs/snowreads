There is a more tractable linear\ncriterion which determines a temperature $T_l$ below which the system is\nsuperconducting. Here, we observe that there is a similar linear criterion\nwhich gives a temperature $T_u$ above which no superconductivity occurs. We\nprovide examples of translation invariant systems where $T_u>T_l$ as well as\nsystems where $T_u=T_l$. Furthermore, we estimate $T_u$ for half-spaces and\nshow that it is exponentially small in the weak coupling limit, exhibiting the\nsame asymptotics as the critical temperature for full space.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
