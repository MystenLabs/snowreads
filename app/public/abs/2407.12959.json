As a key step in the proof, we determine\nthe minimal number of pairs of generators that must commute in a right-angled\nCoxeter group which is not relatively hyperbolic, a result which is of\nindependent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zy5lNiEfqybjEF4n1FXtHOoiiB_u3XmnF_iX57ojd00","pdfSize":"283730"}
