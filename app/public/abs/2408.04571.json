Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton\nbinding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for\nsolar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different\nthickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker\nlayers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms\nby which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures\nis lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide\n(MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n =\n3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n > 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient\nabsorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives\ncomprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination\nprocesses. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes\ndominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation\n(EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5,\nEb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their\nexciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative\nrecombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping\nprocesses, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping\nwhen high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n\nregions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is\nbypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"acGoKqQxZbdGGzA9HQOSuKtKvVRoQbId4Bo4_Ks2_PI","pdfSize":"25131549"}
