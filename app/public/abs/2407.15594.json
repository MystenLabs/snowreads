Events\ncontaining two charged leptons and at least one jet identified as originating\nfrom a $b$-quark are selected. A multivariate discriminant is constructed to\nseparate the $tW$ signal from the $t\\bar{t}$ background. The cross-section is\nextracted using a profile likelihood fit to the signal and control regions and\nit is measured to be $\\sigma_{tW} = 75^{+15}_{-14}$ pb, in good agreement with\nthe Standard Model prediction. The measured cross-section is used to extract a\nvalue for the left-handed form factor at the $Wtb$ vertex times the CKM matrix\nelement $|f_\\text{LV}V_{tb}|$ of $0.97 \\pm 0.10$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1ho9X87JXSf-ZVazvlcvzYXGBz31CfRjwtxMoX6UHoM","pdfSize":"2078506"}
