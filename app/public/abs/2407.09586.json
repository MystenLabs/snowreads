However, both the metric and symmetric\nteleparallel gravity theories have been found to have serious pathologies, such\nas coupling issues and Ostrogradski's instability leading to ghost degrees of\nfreedom. In this article we explore the fact that the theories are at-least\nfree from the issue of `Branched Hamiltonian' though, nonetheless, early\ninflation as well as a viable radiation era may only be driven by a scalar\nfield.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
