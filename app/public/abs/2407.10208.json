Traditional semi-insulating materials, however, struggle\nto provide consistent resistance across varying voltages. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce a design that integrates semi-insulating 4H-SiC with atomic-level\nmetal oxide interlayers and electrodes. The strategic adjustment of surface\nstates via atomic-scale metal oxide layers optimizes the work functions on\n4H-SiC surfaces, validated through density functional theory simulations. This\ndesign transcends conventional limitations, establishing an ideal Ohmic\nbehavior and maintains Peta-Ohm-level resistance, unaffected by voltage\nvariations. These on-chip devices with fine-tuned resistance are compatible\nwith integrated circuit manufacturing processes, making them ideally suited for\napplications in precision electronics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9KIYrFc0W6nf3YPsRHmsgsrZGxwQlcP5TC6F9kPlnRU","pdfSize":"1157708"}
