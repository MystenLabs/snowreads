We present our discussion of this input scheme\nbased on the light-front Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional $\\phi ^4$ theory.\nIn our input scheme, we employ a set of quantum registers, where each register\nencodes the occupation of a distinct boson mode as binaries. We squeeze the\nboson operators of each mode and present the Hamiltonian in terms of unique\ncombinations of the squeezed boson operators. We design the circuit modules for\nthese unique combinations. Based on these circuit modules, we block encode the\nmany-boson Hamiltonian utilizing the idea of quantum walk. We demonstrate our\ninput scheme by solving the low-lying spectra of the Hamiltonian utilizing the\nIBM Qiskit quantum simulator. We can incorporate the input scheme in this work\nwith the input scheme for many-fermion Hamiltonians; they jointly offer new\npathways to solving the structure and dynamics of field theory problems on\nfuture fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
