{"id":"2408.12040","title":"Global Preventive Feedback of Powerful Radio Jets on Galaxy Formation","authors":"Renyue Cen (Zhejiang University)","authorsParsed":[["Cen","Renyue","","Zhejiang University"]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 23:58:01 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-23","timestamp":1724284681000,"abstract":"  Firmly anchored on observational data, giant radio lobes from massive\ngalaxies hosting supermassive black holes can exert a major negative feedback\neffect, by endowing the intergalactic gas with significant magnetic pressure\nhence retarding or preventing gas accretion onto less massive halos in the\nvicinity. Since massive galaxies that are largely responsible for producing the\ngiant radio lobes, this effect is expected to be stronger in more overdense\nlarge-scale environments, such as proto-clusters, than in underdense regions,\nsuch as voids. We show that by redshift $z=2$ halos with masses up to\n$(10^{11-12}, 10^{12-13})\\msun$ are significantly hindered from accreting gas\ndue to this effect for radio bubble volume filling fraction of $(1.0, 0.2)$,\nrespectively. Since the vast majority of the stars in the universe at $z<2-3$\nform precisely in those halos, this negative feedback process is likely one\nmajor culprit for causing the global downturn in star formation in the universe\nsince. It also provides a natural explanation for the rather sudden flattening\nof the slope of the galaxy rest-frame UV luminosity function around $z\\sim 2$.\nA cross-correlation between proto-clusters and Faraday rotation measures may\ntest the predicted magnetic field. Inclusion of this external feedback process\nin the next generation of cosmological simulations may be imperative.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2x3HFfgoJqULyTQUiImD_nVNlFqXfo5_r4PgPUGkExg","pdfSize":"370207"}
