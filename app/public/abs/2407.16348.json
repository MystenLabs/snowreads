To accomplish this goal, we\nsystematically reconstruct the theory operationally, offering new proofs and\nresults throughout. Our approach is applied to the study of invertible power\nseries, where we notably offer a concise two-line proof of Lagrange's inversion\ntheorem, derive formulas for both fractional and regular compositional iterates\nand generalize Jabotinsky matrices. In addition, we will develop several new\ninsights into umbral operators, including their fractional exponents and novel\nexpressions, in connection with the previously discussed applications. Finally,\nwe will elaborate on both established and new concepts and examples, such as\npseudoinverses of delta operators and a natural generalization of the Laguerre\npolynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
