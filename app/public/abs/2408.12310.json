MACS0416-Y1 has been shown to\nhave extreme dust properties, thus, we study the physical properties and star\nformation histories of its resolved components. Overall, we find that\nMACS0416-Y1 is undergoing a star formation burst in three resolved clumps. The\ncentral clump is less massive compared to the other clumps and possibly formed\nin the merging process of the two larger clumps. Although the star formation\nhistory indicates an ongoing star formation burst, this gas-rich galaxy shows\ncomparable star formation efficiency to cosmic noon galaxies. Using NIRSpec\nprism spectroscopy, we measure metallicity, $12 +\\log\\rm{(O/H)} = 7.76\\pm0.03$\n, ionisation parameter, $\\log U = -2.48\\pm0.03$, and electron temperature\n$\\rm{T}_e = 18000\\pm 4000 K $. The emission line ratios of the galaxy indicate\nan evolved Interstellar medium (ISM) similar to $z\\sim2$ star-forming galaxies.\nFurther, we find possible presence of ionisation from an active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) using emission line diagnostics, however, we do not detect broad line\ncomponent in H$\\beta$ emission line. As this gas-rich galaxy is undergoing a\nmajor merger, we hypothesise that the high dust temperature in MACS0416-Y1 is\ncaused by the star formation burst or a possible narrow-line AGN.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gMdyXyY4YSmo6iprOKhJItYUqtuvFMFSkODvHCosuzQ","pdfSize":"4264941"}
