The modification of the parametrization of the\nisospin channel of two models, DD2 and DDMEX, keeping the same isoscalar\nproperties is considered and the implications are discussed. Within the models\ndiscussed it is not possible the onset of nucleonic direct Urca processes in\nstars with a mass below $\\sim1.6-1.8\\, M_\\odot$. The lowest masses that allow\ndirect Urca processes are associated to a slope of the symmetry energy $\\sim60$\nMeV and a symmetry energy incompressibility close to zero. It is shown that the\nparametrization of the isospin channel proposed destroys the correlation\nbetween symmetry energy slope and incompressibility previously identified in\nseveral works.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
