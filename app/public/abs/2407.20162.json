For a sample of $n$\nindependent and identically distributed values $X_i \\sim F_\\theta$, the maximum\nlikelihood estimator $\\hat\\theta_n$ is asymptotically normal provided that $0 <\n\\theta < 1$ is an interior point. This paper investigates the large-sample\nbehaviour for boundary points, which is entirely different and strikingly\nasymmetric for $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=1$. The reason for the asymmetry has to\ndo with typical choices such that $F_0$ is an extreme boundary point and $F_1$\nis usually not extreme. On the right boundary, well known results on boundary\nparameter problems are recovered, giving $\\lim \\mathbb{P}_1(\\hat\\theta_n <\n1)=1/2$. On the left boundary, $\\lim\\mathbb{P}_0(\\hat\\theta_n > 0)=1-1/\\alpha$,\nwhere $1\\leq \\alpha \\leq 2$ indexes the domain of attraction of the density\nratio $f_1(X)/f_0(X)$ when $X\\sim F_0$. For $\\alpha=1$, which is the most\nimportant case in practice, we show how the tail behaviour of $F_1$ governs the\nrate at which $\\mathbb{P}_0(\\hat\\theta_n > 0)$ tends to zero. A new limit\ntheorem for the joint distribution of the sample maximum and sample mean\nconditional on positivity establishes multiple inferential anomalies. Most\nnotably, given $\\hat\\theta_n > 0$, the likelihood ratio statistic has a\nconditional null limit distribution $G\\neq\\chi^2_1$ determined by the joint\nlimit theorem. We show through this route that no advantage is gained by\nextending the single distribution $F_1$ to the nonparametric composite mixture\ngenerated by the same tail-equivalence class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J0SX1-_8BlFSR8uyIMWsb0fVxo0T5VHIY4mnYUbF3ds","pdfSize":"649977"}
