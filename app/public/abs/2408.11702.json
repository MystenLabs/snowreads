Since an infinite set of $n$-particle\ncorrelation functions is required to fully characterize a system, one must\nsettle for a reduced set of structural information, in practice. We initiate a\nprogram to use the number variance $\\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a spherical\nsampling window of radius $R$ (which encodes pair correlations) and an integral\nmeasure derived from it $\\Sigma_N(R_i,R_j)$ that depends on two specified\nradial distances $R_i$ and $R_j$. Across the first three space dimensions ($d =\n1,2,3$), we find these metrics can sensitively describe and categorize the\ndegree of order/disorder of 41 different models of antihyperuniform,\nnonhyperuniform, disordered hyperuniform, and ordered hyperuniform\nmany-particle systems at a specified length scale $R$. Using our local variance\nmetrics, we demonstrate the importance of assessing order/disorder with respect\nto a specific value of $R$. These order metrics could also aid in the inverse\ndesign of structures with prescribed scale-specific degrees of order/disorder\nthat yield desired physical properties. In future work, it would be fruitful to\nexplore the use of higher-order moments [S. Torquato et al., Phys. Rev. X, 11,\n021028 (2021)] to devise even more sensitive order metrics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NXrurMEHk5ii7IKJZ2FgeHYQB1ikShQ1ti80s9d8fLg","pdfSize":"1487621"}
