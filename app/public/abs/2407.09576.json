In the Electromagnetically Accelerating Universe (EAU) model,\nsuch an electric field would be undesirable because it discharges the\nPrimoridal Extemely Massive Naked Singularities (PEMNSs) whose mutual repulsion\ncauses the acceleration. This leads to a constraints on the charges and masses\nof the PEMNSs which must be satisfied in an EAU model.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
