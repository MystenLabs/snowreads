We conjecture that the answer is $\\le 1$ for any global field $F$ and\nfinite group $G$. In the case when $F$ is a number field we show that the\nanswer is always $\\le 4[F:\\mathbb Q]$. We show that assuming Schinzel's\nHypothesis H the answer is always $\\le 1$ if $F$ is a number field. We show\nunconditionally that the answer is always $\\le 1$ if $F$ is a global function\nfield.\n  We also show that for a broader class of fields $F$ than previously known,\nevery finite group $G$ can be realized as the automorphism group of a finite\nextension $K/F$ (without restriction on the ramification).\n  An important new tool used in this work is a recent result of the author and\nC. Tsang, which says that for any finite group $G$ there exists a natural\nnumber $n$ and a subgroup $H\\leqslant S_n$ of the symmetric group such that\n$N_{S_n}(H)/H\\cong G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
