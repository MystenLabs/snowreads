In this\npaper, we demonstrate that an explanation of these observations can be obtained\nby postulating that diffuse ions condense at the \"wall\" due to a reduced\npermittivity of a solvent.\n  For small values of $\\Phi_0$ the surface potential responds linearly. On\nincreasing $\\Phi_0$ further $\\Phi_s$ augments nonlinearly and then saturates to\na constant value. Analytical approximations for $\\Phi_s$ derived for these\nthree distinct modes show that it always adjusts to salt concentration, which\nis equivalent to a violation of the constant potential condition. The latter\nwould be appropriate for highly dilute solutions, but only if $\\Phi_0$ is\nsmall. Surprisingly, when the plateau with high $\\Phi_s$ is reached, the\nconductor surface switches to a constant charge density condition normally\nexpected for insulators. Our results are directly relevant for conducting\nelectrodes, mercury drops, colloidal metallic particles and more.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
