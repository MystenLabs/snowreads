However, due to the\nconcentration of pairwise distances and the violation of the neighborhood\nstructure, this classifier often suffers in high-dimension, low-sample size\n(HDLSS) situations, especially when the scale difference between the competing\nclasses dominates their location difference. Several attempts have been made in\nthe literature to take care of this problem. In this article, we discuss some\nof these existing methods and propose some new ones. We carry out some\ntheoretical investigations in this regard and analyze several simulated and\nbenchmark datasets to compare the empirical performances of proposed methods\nwith some of the existing ones.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
