However, efficiently capturing\nthe true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this\nwork, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets\nthat better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior.\nOur method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene\ncontexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map\ninformation and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling\nalgorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories\nconditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate\nvarious sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between\ncoverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that\nour scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity\ncompared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive\nIn-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the\nrepresentation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of\ntrajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware\ntrajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of\nactor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
