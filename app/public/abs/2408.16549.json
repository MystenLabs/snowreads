The model allows for arbitrary\nmass, non-zero cosmological constant and coupling to curvature. We find that\nthere are strong restrictions to the parameter space, due to the requirement\nfor the reality of the field values. At early cosmological times, we observe\nBig Bang singularities, solutions where the scale factor asymptotically\napproaches zero, and Small Bangs. The latter are solutions for which the Hubble\nparameter diverges at a finite value of the scale factor. They appear\ngenerically in our model for certain curvature couplings. An early inflationary\nera is observed for a specific value of the curvature coupling without further\nassumptions (unlike in many other inflationary models). A late-time Dark Energy\nperiod is present for all solutions with positive cosmological constant,\nnumerically suggesting that a \"cosmic no-hair\" theorem holds under more general\nassumptions than the original Wald version which relies on classical energy\nconditions. The classical fields in consideration can be viewed as resembling\none-point functions of a semiclassical model, in which the cosmological\nexpansion is driven by a quantum field.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
