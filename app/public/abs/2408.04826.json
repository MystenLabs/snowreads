This arises due to the\ndifficulty of automatically learning accurate lumen contour from limited\ntraining data while accounting for the radial geometry of IVUS imaging. We\npropose the Geo-UNet framework to address these issues via a design informed by\nthe geometry of the lumen contour segmentation task. We first convert the input\ndata and segmentation targets from Cartesian to polar coordinates. Starting\nfrom a convUNet feature extractor, we propose a two-task setup, one for\nconventional pixel-wise labeling and the other for single boundary\nlumen-contour localization. We directly combine the two predictions by passing\nthe predicted lumen contour through a new activation (named CDFeLU) to filter\nout spurious pixel-wise predictions. Our unified loss function carefully\nbalances area-based, distance-based, and contour-based penalties to provide\nnear clinical-grade generalization in unseen patient data. We also introduce a\nlightweight, inference-time technique to enhance segmentation smoothness. The\nefficacy of our framework on a venous IVUS dataset is shown against\nstate-of-the-art models.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y4eF-oKZ6wOHxkEu7uRzg8YbsJTcIVXFPQTrARy3LL8","pdfSize":"9576693"}
