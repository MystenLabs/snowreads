This paper extends these benefits by addressing\ncomputational challenges in order to improve model solution and estimation. We\nfirst establish new results on the rates of convergence of the value iteration,\npolicy evaluation, and relative value iteration operators in the model, holding\nfixed player beliefs. Next, we introduce a new representation of the value\nfunction in the model based on uniformization -- a technique used in the\nanalysis of continuous time Markov chains -- which allows us to draw a direct\nanalogy to discrete time models. Furthermore, we show that uniformization also\nleads to a stable method to compute the matrix exponential, an operator\nappearing in the model's log likelihood function when only discrete time\n\"snapshot\" data are available. We also develop a new algorithm that\nconcurrently computes the matrix exponential and its derivatives with respect\nto model parameters, enhancing computational efficiency. By leveraging the\ninherent sparsity of the model's intensity matrix, combined with sparse matrix\ntechniques and precomputed addresses, we show how to significantly speed up\ncomputations. These strategies allow researchers to estimate more sophisticated\nand realistic models of strategic interactions and policy impacts in empirical\nindustrial organization.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
