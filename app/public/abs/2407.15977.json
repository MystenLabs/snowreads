An\nunderstanding of quantum concepts is imperative for enrollment in physics\ngraduate programs, participating in research within physics-fields, and\nemployment at companies developing quantum technologies. This study analyzes\n188 US research intensive institutions' course catalogs to determine the role\nand volume of quantum mechanics in their undergraduate physics programs. All of\nthe institutions required one course on quantum concepts, 92% required two\ncourses, and half required three. For institutions with complete class data\n(n=56), the quantum curriculum was analyzed using course syllabi. The mean\nnumber of classroom hours spent on quantum concepts was found to be 63.5 hours\nwith a standard deviation of 28.1 hours. The most commonly taught themes in the\nquantum curriculum were the Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation and three-dimensional\nquantum mechanics. However, the Stern-Gerlach Experiment was only included in\n28% of the course outlines. Despite current efforts to promote a spin-first\napproach, this study found the traditional position-first approaches were still\nmore common as they were used by 73.7% of instructors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
