These patterns\nmaintain a cohesive, self-organizing morphology, i.e. they exemplify\nautopoiesis, the self-organization principle of a network of components and\nprocesses maintaining themselves. Recent work implementing Asymptotic Lenia as\na reaction-diffusion system reported that non-Platonic behavior in standard\nLenia may depend on the clipping function, and that ALenia gliders are likely\nnot subject to non-Platonic instability. In this work I show an example of a\nglider in ALenia that depends on a certain simulation coarseness for\nautopoietic competence: when simulated with too fine spatial or temporal\nresolution the glider no longer maintains its morphology or dynamics. I also\nshow that instability maps of the asymptotic Lenia glider, and others in\ndifferent CA framworks, show fractal retention of fine boundary detail down to\nthe limit of floating point precision.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
