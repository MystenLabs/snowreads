To address this\nproblem, we introduce the concept of a phase-efficient circuit architecture,\nwhere the average phase shift is $\\ll 2\\pi$. We derive a universal\ninformation-theoretic limit to the phase-shift efficiency of universal\nmultiport interferometers, and propose a \"3-MZI\" architecture that approaches\nthis limit to within a factor of $2\\times$, approximately a $10\\times$\nreduction in average phase shift over the prior art, where the average phase\nshift scales inversely with system size as $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$. For non-unitary\ncircuits, we show that the 3-MZI saturates the theoretical bound for\nGaussian-distributed target matrices. Using this architecture, we show optical\nneural network training with all phase shifters constrained to $\\lesssim 0.2$\nradians without loss of accuracy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
