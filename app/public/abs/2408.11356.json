Existing virtual structure measurement and screening methods are\ndominated by docking and its derived methods combined with deep learning.\nHowever, the sampling and scoring methodology have largely restricted the\naccuracy and efficiency. Here, we show that these two fundamental tasks can be\naccurately tackled with a single model, namely LigPose, based on multi-task\ngeometric deep learning. By representing the ligand and the protein pair as a\ngraph, LigPose directly optimizes the three-dimensional structure of the\ncomplex, with the learning of binding strength and atomic interactions as\nauxiliary tasks, enabling its one-step prediction ability without docking\ntools. Extensive experiments show LigPose achieved state-of-the-art performance\non major tasks in drug research. Its considerable improvements indicate a\npromising paradigm of AI-based pipeline for drug development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
