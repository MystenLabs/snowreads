Characterized by its low-dimensional yet\nbiologically meaningful markers, radiomics bridges the gap between complex\nmedical imaging data and actionable clinical insights. We present\nRadiomicsFill-Mammo, the first of the RadiomicsFill series, an innovative\ntechnique that generates realistic mammogram mass images mirroring specific\nradiomics attributes using masked images and opposite breast images, leveraging\na recent stable diffusion model. This approach also allows for the\nincorporation of essential clinical variables, such as BI-RADS and breast\ndensity, alongside radiomics features as conditions for mass generation.\nResults indicate that RadiomicsFill-Mammo effectively generates diverse and\nrealistic tumor images based on various radiomics conditions. Results also\ndemonstrate a significant improvement in mass detection capabilities,\nleveraging RadiomicsFill-Mammo as a strategy to generate simulated samples.\nFurthermore, RadiomicsFill-Mammo not only advances medical imaging research but\nalso opens new avenues for enhancing treatment planning and tumor simulation.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/nainye/RadiomicsFill.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
