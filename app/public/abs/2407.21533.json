We examine the prediction time, methods, failed components, and\ndataset size. We investigate the effect of using standard SCADA data and data\nfrom additional sensors, such as those measuring vibration. We observe a\npositive correlation between dataset size and prediction time. In the\nconsidered cases, one may roughly expect a forecast for at least two days using\na dataset of one turbine year and a forecast for two hundred days from a\ndataset of a hundred turbine years.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hF30Pp36Y1P08UJFuKo48x0zbAlp8nWWsVmQ6J3Xx0s","pdfSize":"518378"}
