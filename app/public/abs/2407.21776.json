A geometrical picture of the\nKrylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes\nnon-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of\ninteracting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained\nusing an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the complexity compared to that which\nis obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter\nproperty to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space\ncomprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
