We present the ring lattice based on the\nhybrid six-bend achromat (H6BA) cell and a detailed evaluation of its beam\ndynamics performance. Design challenges as well as unique opportunities\nassociated with a low emittance ring of a large size are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
