Such a theory that is defined on the configuration space of fields\nrather than spacetime is a third quantized theory. So, both string theory and\ngroup field theory are third-quantized theories. Thus, using axioms of string\nfield theory, we motivate similar axioms for group field theory. Then using the\nstructure of these axioms for string field theory and group field theory, we\nidentify general features of axioms for any such third quantized theory of\nquantum gravity. Thus, we show that such third-quantized theories of quantum\ngravity can be formulated as formal axiomatic systems. We then analyze the\nconsequences of Godel theorems on such third quantized theories. We thus\naddress problems of consistency and completeness of any third quantized\ntheories of quantum gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
