RISC-V is gaining\ntraction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues\nsuch as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent\nRISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core\nclusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a\nlightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our\ndesign uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with\nSplash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a\ndual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized\nusing GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of\nthe system area.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
