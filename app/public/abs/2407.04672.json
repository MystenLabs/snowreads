It works for general\nspin systems including both $2$-spin and multi-spin systems. As applications\nfor this approach:\n  $\\bullet$ We prove the optimal $O(n)$ relaxation time for the Glauber\ndynamics of random $q$-list-coloring on an $n$-vertices triangle-tree graph\nwith maximum degree $\\Delta$ such that $q/\\Delta > \\alpha^\\star$, where\n$\\alpha^\\star \\approx 1.763$ is the unique positive solution of the equation\n$\\alpha = \\exp(1/\\alpha)$. This improves the $n^{1+o(1)}$ relaxation time for\nGlauber dynamics obtained by the previous work of Jain, Pham, and Vuong (2022).\nBesides, our framework can also give a near-linear time sampling algorithm\nunder the same condition.\n  $\\bullet$ We prove the optimal $O(n)$ relaxation time and near-optimal\n$\\widetilde{O}(n)$ mixing time for the Glauber dynamics on hardcore models with\nparameter $\\lambda$ in $\\textit{balanced}$ bipartite graphs such that $\\lambda\n< \\lambda_c(\\Delta_L)$ for the max degree $\\Delta_L$ in left part and the max\ndegree $\\Delta_R$ of right part satisfies $\\Delta_R = O(\\Delta_L)$. This\nimproves the previous result by Chen, Liu, and Yin (2023).\n  At the heart of our proof is the notion of $\\textit{coupling independence}$\nwhich allows us to consider multiple vertices as a huge single vertex with\nexponentially large domain and do a \"coarse-grained\" local-to-global argument\non spin systems. The technique works for general (multi) spin systems and helps\nus obtain some new comparison results for Glauber dynamics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
