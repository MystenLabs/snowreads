We consider a complete,\nseparated topological ring $\\mathfrak R$ with a countable base of neighborhoods\nof zero consisting of open two-sided ideals. The main result is that the\nhomotopy category of projective left $\\mathfrak R$-contramodules is equivalent\nto the derived category of the exact category of flat left $\\mathfrak\nR$-contramodules. In other words, a complex of flat $\\mathfrak R$-contramodules\nis contraacyclic in the sense of Becker if and only if it is an acyclic complex\nwith flat $\\mathfrak R$-contramodules of cocycles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
