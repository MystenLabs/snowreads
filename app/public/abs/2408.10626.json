We define the $e$-core and the $e$-weight\nof a multipartition associated with a multicharge as the $e$-core and the\n$e$-weight of its image under the Uglov map. We do not place any restriction on\nthe multicharge for these definitions. We show how these definitions lead to\nthe definition of the $e$-core and the $e$-weight of a block of an Ariki-Koike\nalgebra with quantum parameter $e$, and an analogue of Nakayama's `Conjecture'\nthat classifies these blocks. Our definition of $e$-weight of such a block\ncoincides with that first defined by Fayers. We further generalise the notion\nof a $[w:k]$-pair for Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type $A$ to the Ariki-Koike\nalgebras, and obtain a sufficient condition for such a pair to be Scopes\nequivalent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mxn7jqO3mQ7yZZHN55emXtELSfBuqEVAQHjktXSV3L0","pdfSize":"264903"}
