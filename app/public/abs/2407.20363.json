Bearing on similar set-theoretic\nassumptions, we characterize when every module $X$ has a perfect decomposition.\nAs a subproduct we show that Enoch's conjecture for classes $\\mathrm{Add}(X)$\nis consistent with ZFC -- a fact first proved by \\v{S}aroch \\cite{Saroch}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
