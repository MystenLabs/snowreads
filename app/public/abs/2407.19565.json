We collected data from 535 individuals who participated in\na program to meet new friends. Data consisted of surveys measuring demography,\nbelonging, and perceptions of various demographic groups at the start and end\nof the program. Participants were partitioned into a control group who received\nzero introductions, and an intervention group who received multiple\nintroductions. For each participant, we computed twelve features describing\nparticipation status, demography and the amount of program-facilitated exposure\nto others who were similar to them and different from them. We used a linear\nmodel to study the association of our features with the participants' final\nbelonging and perceptions while controlling for their initial belonging and\nperceptions. We found that those who participated in the machine-arranged\nmeetings had 4.5% higher belonging, and 3.9% more positive perception of\nothers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
