This\nwork proposes a WebXR-based cross-platform architecture for developing spatial\nweb apps using the A-Frame and Networked-Aframe frameworks with a view to an\nopen and interoperable metaverse, accessible from both the web and extended\nreality devices. A prototype was implemented and evaluated, supporting the\ncapability of the technology stack to enable immersive experiences across\ndifferent platforms and devices. Positive feedback on ease of use of the\nimmersive environment further corroborates the proposed approach, underscoring\nits effectiveness in facilitating engaging and interactive virtual spaces. By\nadhering to principles of interoperability and inclusivity, it lives up to Tim\nBerners-Lee's vision of the World Wide Web as an open platform that transcends\ngeographical and technical boundaries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WW11r6bEMDRvVLMs-059uTgP33OT3N-WLyqo_LUzeAY","pdfSize":"851319"}
