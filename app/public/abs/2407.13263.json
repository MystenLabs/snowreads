The accuracy is $n^{-s_a/d}$ in\n$L^2$-norm, where $s_a$ is the order of the underlying method. When the data\nare measured or computed with systematical experimental noise, some statistical\nregularisation might be desirable, with a smoothing method of order $s_r$ (like\nthe number of vanishing moments of a kernel). This idea is behind the use of\nsome regularised discretisation methods, whose approximation properties are the\nsubject of this paper. We decipher the interplay of $s_a$ and $s_r$ for\nreconstructing a smooth function on regular bounded domains from $n$\nmeasurements with noise of order $\\sigma$. We establish that for certain\nregimes with small noise $\\sigma$ depending on $n$, when $s_a > s_r$,\nstatistical smoothing is not necessarily the best option and {\\it not\nregularising} is more beneficial than {\\it statistical regularising}. We\nprecisely quantify this phenomenon and show that the gain can achieve a\nmultiplicative order $n^{(s_a-s_r)/(2s_r+d)}$. We illustrate our estimates by\nnumerical experiments conducted in dimension $d=1$ with $\\mathbb P_1$ and\n$\\mathbb P_2$ finite elements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
