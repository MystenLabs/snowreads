Our approach is based on the\nGaussian free field and applies to CFTs with central charge $c \\leq 1$. In this\nframework we introduce the generalized Eguchi-Ooguri equations and use them to\nderive the explicit form of Ward's equations, which describe the insertion of a\nstress tensor in terms of Lie derivatives and differential operators depending\non the Teicm\\\"{u}ller modular parameters. Furthermore, by implementing the BPZ\nequations, we provide a conformal field theoretic realization of an SLE in a\nmultiply connected domain, which in particular suggests its drift function, and\nconstruct a class of martingale observables for this SLE process.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
