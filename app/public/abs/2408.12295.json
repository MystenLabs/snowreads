Additionally, by imposing the $ VMO$ condition and mild\ndifferentiability on the diffusion coefficients and assuming an\n$L^s$-zero-order terms with $s \\in (1, \\infty)$, we demonstrate the existence\nand uniqueness of a strong solution for the corresponding non-divergence type\nequations. An important feature of this paper is that, due to the weak\ndivergence-free property of the drifts in the transformed equations, the\nconstants appearing in our estimates can be explicitly calculated, which is\nexpected to offer significant applications in error analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
