Our paper evaluates these impacts by\ninvestigating (1) the factual question of whether future advanced AI systems\nwill be conscious, together with (2) the epistemic question of whether future\nhuman society will broadly believe advanced AI systems to be conscious.\nAssuming binary responses to (1) and (2) gives rise to four possibilities: in\nthe true positive scenario, society predominantly correctly believes that AIs\nare conscious; in the false positive scenario, that belief is incorrect; in the\ntrue negative scenario, society correctly believes that AIs are not conscious;\nand lastly, in the false negative scenario, society incorrectly believes that\nAIs are not conscious. The paper offers vivid vignettes of the different\nfutures to ground the two-dimensional framework. Critically, we identify four\nmajor risks: AI suffering, human disempowerment, geopolitical instability, and\nhuman depravity. We evaluate each risk across the different scenarios and\nprovide an overall qualitative risk assessment for each scenario. Our analysis\nsuggests that the worst possibility is the wrong belief that AI is\nnon-conscious, followed by the wrong belief that AI is conscious. The paper\nconcludes with the main recommendations to avoid research aimed at\nintentionally creating conscious AI and instead focus efforts on reducing our\ncurrent uncertainties on both the factual and epistemic questions on AI\nconsciousness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dUMChXqYTVFq2M8Wm7uV4N5HPmCWnS-1DvW8ZbxPArI","pdfSize":"1706080"}
