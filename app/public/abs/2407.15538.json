For $B_{\\mathbf c}$ defined over an\narbitrary field $k$ and $q\\in k$ not a root of unity we establish a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between finite dimensional, simple $B_{\\mathbf c}$-modules and\ndominant integral weights for $so(2N-1)$. We use specialisation to show that\nthe category of finite dimensional $B_{\\mathbf c}$-modules is semisimple if\n$\\mathrm{char}(k)=0$ and $q$ is transcendental over ${\\mathbb Q}$. In this case\nthe characters of simple $B_{\\mathbf c}$-modules are given by Weyl's character\nformula. This means in particular that the quantum symmetric pair of type $DII$\ncan be used to obtain Gelfand-Tsetlin bases for irreducible representations of\nthe Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group $U_q(so(2N))$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bLHzIPZdxPm46GcE935Q_Y_Jb8Y6BqSGW4ncc3lLUKI","pdfSize":"492006"}
