We pursue here a\nthreefold goal. First we construct well-posed approximations of continuous-time\nintegro-differential systems by their discrete-time counterparts with showing\nthat any feasible solution to the original system can be strongly approximated\nin the $W^{1,2}$-norm topology by piecewise-linear extensions of feasible\ndiscrete trajectories. This allows us to verify in turn the strong convergence\nof discrete optimal solutions to a prescribed local minimizer for the original\nproblem. Facing intrinsic nonsmoothness of original integro-differential\nproblem and its discrete approximations, we employ appropriate tools of\ngeneralized differentiation in variational analysis to derive necessary\noptimality conditions for discrete-time problems (which is our second goal) and\nfinally accomplish our third goal to obtain necessary conditions for the\noriginal continuous-time problems by passing to the limit from discrete\napproximations. In this way we establish, in particular, a novel necessary\noptimality condition of the Volterra type, which is the crucial result for\ndynamic optimization of integro-differential inclusions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
