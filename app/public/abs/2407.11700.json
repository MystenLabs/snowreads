Previous studies\noften require training separate codecs to support various bitrate levels,\nmachine tasks, and networks, thus lacking both flexibility and practicality. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a rate-distortion-cognition controllable\nversatile image compression, which method allows the users to adjust the\nbitrate (i.e., Rate), image reconstruction quality (i.e., Distortion), and\nmachine task accuracy (i.e., Cognition) with a single neural model, achieving\nultra-controllability. Specifically, we first introduce a cognition-oriented\nloss in the primary compression branch to train a codec for diverse machine\ntasks. This branch attains variable bitrate by regulating quantization degree\nthrough the latent code channels. To further enhance the quality of the\nreconstructed images, we employ an auxiliary branch to supplement residual\ninformation with a scalable bitstream. Ultimately, two branches use a `$\\beta x\n+ (1 - \\beta) y$' interpolation strategy to achieve a balanced\ncognition-distortion trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod yields satisfactory ICM performance and flexible\nRate-Distortion-Cognition controlling.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
