These expressions are in terms of hypergeometric character sums over\nfinite fields, a theory developed largely by Greene, Katz,\nBeukers-Cohen-Mellit, and Fuselier-Long-Ramakrishna-Swisher-Tu. Our approach,\nin contrast to the previous works, is uniform and more geometric, and it works\nequally well for forms on elliptic modular curves and Shimura curves. The same\nmethod can be applied to obtain eigenvalues of Hecke operators as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FoUiPuK07lWCkUTzGQ-yJ9rtnuL9-sXoSrewxAK_Z6s","pdfSize":"732024"}
