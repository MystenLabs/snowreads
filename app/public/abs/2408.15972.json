Their decay rates are exactly the same as\nthose of free Hartree dynamics. Our method is based on pointwise decay\nestimates of the Green function associated with the linearized operator in\nFourier space and a nonlinear iterative scheme. Another proof of short-range\nscattering, established in [arXiv:1310.0604, arXiv:1607.07958,\narXiv:2308.15929], is also provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
