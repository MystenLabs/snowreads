Notably, methods like TIGER employing\nResidual Quantization-based Semantic Identifiers (RQ-SID), have shown\nsignificant promise in e-commerce scenarios by effectively managing item IDs.\nHowever, a critical issue termed the \"\\textbf{Hourglass}\" phenomenon, occurs in\nRQ-SID, where intermediate codebook tokens become overly concentrated,\nhindering the full utilization of generative retrieval methods. This paper\nanalyses and addresses this problem by identifying data sparsity and\nlong-tailed distribution as the primary causes. Through comprehensive\nexperiments and detailed ablation studies, we analyze the impact of these\nfactors on codebook utilization and data distribution. Our findings reveal that\nthe \"Hourglass\" phenomenon substantially impacts the performance of RQ-SID in\ngenerative retrieval. We propose effective solutions to mitigate this issue,\nthereby significantly enhancing the effectiveness of generative retrieval in\nreal-world E-commerce applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
