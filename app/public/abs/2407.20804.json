Moreover, in the case when the dimension\nis $d=2,3$, we characterize the combinations of finitely many particle\nvelocities and probabilities that lead to the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations in the hydrodynamic limit. Numerical computations conducted in 2D\nprovide information about the rate with which this hydrodynamic limit is\nachieved when the Knudsen number tends to zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
