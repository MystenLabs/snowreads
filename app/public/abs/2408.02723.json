These stars are thought to be debris from dwarf\ngalaxy accretion early in the Milky Way's history. Though typically considered\nto be from a single merger, it is possible that the GSE debris has multiple\nsources. To investigate this possibility, we use the IllustrisTNG50 simulation\nto identify stellar accretion histories in 98 Milky Way analogues -- the\nlargest sample for which such an identification has been performed -- and find\nGSE-like debris in 32, with two-merger GSEs accounting for a third of these\ncases. Distinguishing single-merger GSEs from two-merger GSEs is difficult in\ncommon kinematic spaces, but differences are more evident through chemical\nabundances and star formation histories. This is because single-merger GSEs are\ntypically accreted more recently than the galaxies in two-merger GSEs: the\nmedian infall times (with 16th and 84th percentiles) are $5.9^{+3.3}_{-2.0}$\nand $10.7^{+1.2}_{-3.7}$ Gyr ago for these scenarios, respectively. The\nsystematic shifts in abundances and ages which occur as a result suggest that\nefforts in modeling these aspects of the stellar halo prove ever-important in\nunderstanding its assembly.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
