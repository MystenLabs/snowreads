Firstly, the HRRP sequences are normalized and transformed into GAF\n(Gram Angular Field) images to effectively capture and utilize the temporal\ninformation. Subsequently, these GAF images serve as the input for a pretrained\nResNet-101 model, which is then fine-tuned for target radial length estimation.\nThe simulation results show that compared to traditional threshold method and\nsimple networks e.g. one-dimensional CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), the\nproposed method demonstrates superior noise resistance and higher accuracy\nunder low SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) conditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
