A unipotent real\nbiextension over an algebraic manifold is a variation of mixed Hodge structure\nover it, each of whose fibers is a real biextension and whose weight graded\nquotients are do not vary. We show that if a unipotent real biextension has non\nabelian monodromy, then its ``general fiber'' does not split. This result is a\ntool for investigating the boundary behaviour of normal functions and is\napplied in arXiv:2408.07809 to study the boundary behaviour of the normal\nfunction of the Ceresa cycle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
