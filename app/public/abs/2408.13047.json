This challenge, for example, crops up in studies of the impact of\ndemocracy on economic growth, where findings vary substantially due to\ndifferences in country composition. To address this challenge, this paper\nintroduces a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator that leverages the\ntemporal dimension of the data to estimate unit-specific average treatment\neffects on the treated (ATT) with as few as two cross-sectional units. Under\nweak identification and temporal dependence conditions, the proposed DiD\nestimator is shown to be asymptotically normal. The method is further\ncomplemented with an identification test that, unlike pre-trends tests, is more\npowerful and can detect violations of parallel trends in the post-treatment\nperiod. Empirical results using the DiD estimator suggest Benin's economy would\nhave been 6.3% smaller on average over the 1993-2018 period had she not\ndemocratised.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
