In order to determine its location, here we present\nsightlines to Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) passing through the Interstellar\nMedium (ISM). In this pilot study we investigate absorption features of \\SXVI,\n\\SiXIV, and \\NeX\\ in the spectra of three XRBs, namely 4U 1735-44, 4U 1820-30,\nand Cyg X-2, using Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating archival\nobservations. We do not detect any of these lines. {We determine the 2$\\sigma$\nupper limit for the equivalent widths of the undetected absorption lines and\nthe column densities of the corresponding ions.} We note that the 2$\\sigma$\nupper limits for \\SXVI\\ \\Ka\\ and \\SiXIV\\ \\Ka\\ are an order of magnitude smaller\nthan those previously detected in the extragalactic sightlines. Our finding\nsuggests that if any gas at \\logT\\ $>7$ is present in the Galactic ISM, it is\nunlikely to be ubiquitous. This is an important result because it implies that\n\\SXVI, \\SiXIV\\ {and \\NeX\\ }absorption detected in extragalactic sightlines is\nnot from the ISM, but is likely from a hot gas phase in the extraplanar region\nbeyond the ISM or in the extended CGM.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
