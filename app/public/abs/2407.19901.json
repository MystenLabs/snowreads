In this article, we precisely conduct a systematic literature review on\nstate-of-the-art proposals for designing and developing sustainable software.\nWe identify and analyse 65 primary studies by classifying them through a\ntaxonomy aimed at answering the 5W1H questions of environmentally sustainable\nsoftware design and development. We first provide a reasoned overview and\ndiscussion of the existing guidelines, reference models, measurement solutions\nand techniques for measuring, reducing, or minimising the energy consumption\nand carbon footprint of software. Ultimately, we identify open challenges and\nresearch gaps, offering insights for future work in this field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
