Under certain Auslander-type conditions, we give\nsome equivalent characterizations of (weakly) Gorenstein algebras in terms of\nthe properties of Gorenstein projective modules and modules satisfying\nAuslander-type conditions. As applications, we provide some support for several\nhomological conjectures. In particular, we prove that if $R$ is left quasi\nAuslander, then $R$ is Gorenstein if and only if it is (left and) right weakly\nGorenstein; and that if $R$ satisfies the Auslander condition, then $R$ is\nGorenstein if and only if it is left or right weakly Gorenstein. This is a\nreduction of an Auslander--Reiten's conjecture, which states that $R$ is\nGorenstein if $R$ satisfies the Auslander condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
