However, the evaluation of candidate control actions in explicit ML-MPC\ncan be time-consuming due to the non-convex nature of machine learning models.\nTo address this issue, we leverage Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNN) to\ndevelop explicit ICNN-MPC, which is formulated as a convex optimization\nproblem. Specifically, ICNN is employed to capture nonlinear system dynamics\nand incorporated into MPC, with sufficient conditions provided to ensure the\nconvexity of ICNN-based MPC. We then formulate mixed-integer quadratic\nprogramming (MIQP) problems based on the candidate control actions derived from\nthe solutions of multi-parametric quadratic programming (mpQP) problems within\nthe explicit ML-MPC framework. Optimal control actions are obtained by solving\nreal-time convex MIQP problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated through two case studies, including a chemical reactor example,\nand a chemical process network simulated by Aspen Plus Dynamics, where explicit\nML-MPC written in Python is integrated with Aspen dynamic simulation through a\nprogrammable interface.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
