Accurately diagnosing and classifying AD using neuroimaging data\npresents ongoing challenges in medicine, necessitating advanced interventions\nthat will enhance treatment measures. In this research, we introduce a dual\nattention enhanced deep learning (DL) framework for classifying AD from\nneuroimaging data. Combined spatial and self-attention mechanisms play a vital\nrole in emphasizing focus on neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques from\nthe MRI images, which are difficult to discern with regular imaging techniques.\nResults demonstrate that our model yielded remarkable performance in comparison\nto existing state of the art (SOTA) convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with\nan accuracy of 99.1%. Moreover, it recorded remarkable metrics, with an\nF1-Score of 99.31%, a precision of 99.24%, and a recall of 99.5%. These results\nhighlight the promise of cutting edge DL methods in medical diagnostics,\ncontributing to highly reliable and more efficient healthcare solutions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
