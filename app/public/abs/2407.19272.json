In addition, we develop a new\npreconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm for solving the IEM\nproblem with guaranteed theoretical convergence and significantly improved\naccuracy and computational efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art\nalgorithms. Applications to solid shape registration and deformation are\npresented to highlight the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
