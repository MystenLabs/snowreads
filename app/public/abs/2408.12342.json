The theoretical possibility of such objects forming and colliding in\nthe early universe from models such as Affleck-Dine fragmentation, or from a\nnumber of mechanisms where they are produced copiously with various size and\ncharges to be dark matter candidates, makes it important to study in detail\nQ-ball collision phenomenology. In this work we present results from a study of\nQ-ball collisions and their gravitational waves, using a new general code\npackage for scalar fields coupled to gravity. We then comment on the\npossibility of future gravitational wave detectors searching for signals of\nQ-ball collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
