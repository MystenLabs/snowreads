We start by studying how the\nshort-time Fourier transform acts on superoscillation sequences. We then apply\nthe supershift property to prove that the short-time Fourier transform\npreserves the superoscillatory behavior by taking the limit. It turns out that\nthese computations lead to interesting connections with various features of\ntime-frequency analysis such as Gabor spaces, Gabor kernels, Gabor frames,\n2D-complex Hermite polynomials, and polyanalytic functions. We treat different\ncases depending on the choice of the window function moving from the general\ncase to more specific cases involving the Gaussian and the Hermite windows. We\nconsider also an evolution problem with an initial datum given by\nsuperoscillation multiplied by the time-frequency shifts of a generic window\nfunction. Finally, we compute the action of STFT on the approximating sequences\nwith a given Hermite window.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
