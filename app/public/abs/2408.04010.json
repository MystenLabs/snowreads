These results can be\napplied to some dynamical systems such as $\\beta$-transformations, conformal\nexpanding repeller, etc. We also determine the dimension of the Furstenberg\nlevel set, which is related to a problem of Furstenberg on the orbits under two\nmultiplicatively independent maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
