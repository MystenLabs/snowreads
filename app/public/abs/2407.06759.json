Linking attacks to vulnerabilities helps experts identify and\nrespond promptly to the incident. This paper introduces VULDAT, a\nclassification tool using a sentence transformer MPNET to identify system\nvulnerabilities from attack descriptions. Our model was applied to 100 attack\ntechniques from the ATT&CK repository and 685 issues from the CVE repository.\nThen, we compare the performance of VULDAT against the other eight\nstate-of-the-art classifiers based on sentence transformers. Our findings\nindicate that our model achieves the best performance with F1 score of 0.85,\nPrecision of 0.86, and Recall of 0.83. Furthermore, we found 56% of CVE reports\nvulnerabilities associated with an attack were identified by VULDAT, and 61% of\nidentified vulnerabilities were in the CVE repository.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
