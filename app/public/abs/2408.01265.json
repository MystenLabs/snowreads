In this\nstudy, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with an impurity and unveil how\nthe impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system.\nWe present an exact analytical solution to the problem under both open and\nperiodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and\nstrength. This exact solution is thoroughly validated by numerical simulations.\nOur analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity\nstrength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique\nskin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect\nthat counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the\nimpurity-induced counter skin-effect. These findings offer unprecedented\ninsights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities,\nelucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's\nnon-reciprocal nature. Furthermore, our results suggest potential applications\nin quantum sensing, where the unique characteristics of the impurity-induced\ncounter skin-effect could be harnessed for enhanced sensitivity and precision.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GFTwgmSfy0Qxi9ivgcC4oupi6IiCEFV2y30y-IIdBqw","pdfSize":"12515658"}
