In this paper, we\nobtain the ACC characterization, Cartan-Eilenberg-Bass theorem and the\nabsolutely pure characterization for $S$-Noetherian rings. In details, we show\nthat a ring $R$ is an $S$-Noetherian ring if and only if any ascending chain of\nideals of $R$ is $S$-stationary, if and only if any direct sum of injective\nmodules is $S$-injective, if and only if any direct limit of injective modules\nis $S$-injective, if and only if any $(S$-$)$absolutely pure module is\n$S$-injective. We also characterized $S$-$w$-Noetherian rings similarly.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
