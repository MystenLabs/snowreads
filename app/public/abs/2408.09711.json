This property is shared (for various families of sets $C$)\nby for example cellwise quasigroup shifts, TEP subshifts, and subshifts of\nfinite type with a safe symbol. In this paper we concentrate on avoshifts on\npolycyclic groups, when the sets $C$ are what we call ``inductive intervals''.\nWe show that then avoshifts are a recursively enumerable subset of subshifts of\nfinite type. Furthermore, we can effectively compute lower-dimensional\nprojective subdynamics and certain factors (avofactors), and we can decide\nequality and inclusion for subshifts in this class. These results were\npreviously known for group shifts, but our class also covers many non-algebraic\nexamples as well as many SFTs without dense periodic points. The theory also\nyields new proofs of decidability of inclusion for SFTs on free groups, and\nSFTness of subshifts with the topological strong spatial mixing property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
