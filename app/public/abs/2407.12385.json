The\npre-ranking module plays a vital role in selecting a subset of candidates for\nthe subsequent ranking module. It is crucial for the pre-ranking model to\nmaintain a balance between efficiency and accuracy to adhere to online latency\nconstraints. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture\ncalled RankTower, which is designed to efficiently capture user-item\ninteractions while following the user-item decoupling paradigm to ensure online\ninference efficiency. The proposed approach employs a hybrid training objective\nthat learns from samples obtained from the full stage of the cascade ranking\nsystem, optimizing different objectives for varying sample spaces. This\nstrategy aims to enhance the pre-ranking model's ranking capability and\nimprovement alignment with the existing cascade ranking system. Experimental\nresults conducted on public datasets demonstrate that RankTower significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art pre-ranking models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
