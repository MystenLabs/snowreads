We assume that information from other\nagents is accessible in the form of waypoints or destinations. Consequently, we\nconsider that other agents follow their optimal Dubin's path--a trajectory that\nconnects their current state to their intended state--while accounting for\npotential uncertainties. We propose using scenario tree model predictive\ncontrol as a robust approach that offers computational efficiency. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed method can easily integrate intent information\nand offer a robust scheme that handles different uncertainties. The method is\nillustrated through simulation results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"xRhwSEpkH2amRnfKAIj4AOMac6gNeaVuuso3c7M9lPI","pdfSize":"984290"}
