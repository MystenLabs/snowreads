The wavefunction of such systems coherently extends over a distance\nmuch larger than their size, an achievement that is incredibly challenging for\nmassive and more complex objects. Yet, reaching similar level of coherent\ndiffusion will enable tests of fundamental physics at the genuinely macroscopic\nscale, as well as the development of quantum sensing apparata of great\nsensitivity. We report on experimentally achieving an unprecedented degree of\nposition diffusion in a massive levitated optomechanical system through\nfrequency modulation of the trapping potential. By starting with a pre-cooled\nstate of motion and employing a train of sudden pulses yet of mild modulation\ndepth, we surpass previously attained values of position diffusion in this\nclass of systems to reach diffusion lengths that exceed the physical dimensions\nof the trapped nanoparticle.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b64-utXKWaPG-Jnnii156JP0BVRknsYdFzrTotLaryE","pdfSize":"1397456"}
