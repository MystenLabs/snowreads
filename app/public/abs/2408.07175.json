The\nstrength of the evidence for evolving dark energy ranges from ~3.9 sigma for\nthe Dark Energy 5 year (DES5Y) SN sample to ~ 2.5 sigma for the Pantheon+\nsample. Here I compare SN common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations\nfinding evidence for an offset of ~0.04 mag. between low and high redshifts.\nCorrecting for this offset brings the DES5Y sample into very good agreement\nwith the Planck LCDM cosmology. Given that most of the parameter range favoured\nby the uncorrected DES5Y sample is discrepant with many other cosmological\ndatasets, I conclude that the evidence for evolving dark energy is most likely\na result of systematics in the DES5Y sample.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"NOIYqNNDlqZZgT-YC9zxbnPVs1axnq0shfqoxY_Vpn8","pdfSize":"817486"}
