To this end, we\npropose LoopSplat, which takes RGB-D images as input and performs dense mapping\nwith 3DGS submaps and frame-to-model tracking. LoopSplat triggers loop closure\nonline and computes relative loop edge constraints between submaps directly via\n3DGS registration, leading to improvements in efficiency and accuracy over\ntraditional global-to-local point cloud registration. It uses a robust pose\ngraph optimization formulation and rigidly aligns the submaps to achieve global\nconsistency. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD,\nScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrates competitive or superior tracking,\nmapping, and rendering compared to existing methods for dense RGB-D SLAM.
