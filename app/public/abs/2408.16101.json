We propose\na density-free generative method based on quantiles that naturally calculates\nexpected utility as a marginal of quantiles. Our approach uses a deep quantile\nneural estimator to directly estimate distributional utilities. Generative\nmethods assume only the ability to simulate from the model and parameters and\nas such are likelihood-free. A large training dataset is generated from\nparameters and output together with a base distribution. Our method a number of\ncomputational advantages primarily being density-free with an efficient\nestimator of expected utility. A link with the dual theory of expected utility\nand risk taking is also discussed. To illustrate our methodology, we solve an\noptimal portfolio allocation problem with Bayesian learning and a power utility\n(a.k.a. fractional Kelly criterion). Finally, we conclude with directions for\nfuture research.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
