A Shafarevich-Tate twist of $X$ is a holomorphic symplectic\nmanifold with a Lagrangian fibration $\\pi^\\varphi\\colon X^\\varphi\\to B$ which\nis isomorphic to $\\pi$ locally over the base. In particular, $\\pi^\\varphi$ has\nthe same fibers as $\\pi$. A twist $X^\\varphi$ corresponds to an element\n$\\varphi$ in the Shafarevich-Tate group of $X$. We show that $X^\\varphi$ is\nK\\\"ahler when a multiple of $\\varphi$ lies in the connected component of unity\nof the Shafarevich-Tate group and give a necessary condition for $X^\\varphi$ to\nbe bimeromorphic to a K\\\"ahler manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
