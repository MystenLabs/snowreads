Notably, our framework\neliminates the need for data transfer between the CPU and GPU, enabling the\nconcurrent execution of thousands of simulations on a single or multiple GPUs.\nThis high data throughput architecture proves particularly advantageous for\ndata-driven scientific research, where intricate environment models are\ncommonly essential.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
