This paper introduces an adaptive tailored\nfinite point scheme (TFPS) for RTEs in heterogeneous media, which can\nadaptively compress the angular space. It does so by selecting reduced TFPS\nbasis functions based on the local optical properties of the background media.\nThese reduced basis functions capture the important local modes in the velocity\ndomain. A detailed a posteriori error analysis is performed to quantify the\ndiscrepancy between the reduced and full TFPS solutions. Additionally,\nnumerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the adaptive\nTFPS in solving multiscale RTEs, especially in scenarios involving boundary and\ninterface layers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
