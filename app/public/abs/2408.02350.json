We use the\nArbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method, where the approximation of spatial\nderivatives and the reconstruction of a function is based on the weighted least\nsquares method. We have used the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to accelerate\nthe code and compared with the CPU code. Two and three dimensional driven\ncavity problems are solved, where we have obtained the speed up up to 307 times\nand 127 times in two and three dimensional cases, respectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
