We propose a diffuse interface\nmodel in which a phase field function is used to write each integral in the\nweak formulation of the coupled problem on the entire domain containing both\nthe Stokes and Biot regions. The phase field function continuously transitions\nfrom one to zero over a diffuse region of width $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$\naround the interface; this allows the equations to be posed uniformly across\nthe domain, and obviates tracking the subdomains or the interface between them.\nWe prove convergence in weighted norms of a finite element discretisation of\nthe diffuse interface model to the continuous diffuse model; here the weight is\na power of the distance to the diffuse interface. We in turn prove convergence\nof the continuous diffuse model to the standard, sharp interface, model.\nNumerical examples verify the proven error estimates, and illustrate\napplication of the method to fluid flow through a complex network, describing\nblood circulation in the circle of Willis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"CcttXBPw0cqrmuxbe4fwh7xsYdc3HznxgvZ6GuoZvQE","pdfSize":"1326600"}
