With dual form in relative cohomology, the intersection number can\nbe used to achieve the projection and provide the selection rules for canonical\ndifferential equations, which relate to the pole structure of the\n$\\mathrm{d}\\log$ master integrands.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
