We classify the crystals by $p$-connections on a certain ring\nand prove a cohomological comparison theorem. This equivalence is more general\nthan the Ogus' equivalence. Moreover, we will prove the equivalence between the\ncrystalline crystals and prismatic crystals by gluing local Ogus-Vologodsky\ncorrespondence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
