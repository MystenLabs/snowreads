Direct field measurements of\nbiomass are laborious and expensive, typically limiting their spatial and\ntemporal sampling density and therefore the precision and resolution of the\nresulting inference. Satellites can provide biomass predictions at a far\ngreater density, but these predictions are often biased relative to field\nmeasurements and exhibit heterogeneous errors. We developed and implemented a\ncoregionalization model between sparse field measurements and a predictive\nsatellite map to deliver improved predictions of biomass density at a 1-by-1 km\nresolution throughout the Pacific states of California, Oregon and Washington.\nThe model accounts for zero-inflation in the field measurements and the\nheterogeneous errors in the satellite predictions. A stochastic partial\ndifferential equation approach to spatial modeling is applied to handle the\nmagnitude of the satellite data. The spatial detail rendered by the model is\nmuch finer than would be possible with the field measurements alone, and the\nmodel provides substantial noise-filtering and bias-correction to the satellite\nmap.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
