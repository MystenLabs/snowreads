We develop the in-in and\nSchwinger Keldysh formalism to calculate cosmological correlators for\npseudo-Hermitian systems. We study a model consists of massive symplectic\nfermions coupled to the primordial curvature perturbation. The three-point\nfunction for the primordial curvature perturbation is computed up to one-loop\nand compared to earlier work where the loop correction comes from a massive\nscalar boson. The two results differ by a minus sign. Therefore, the one loop\ncorrection to the three-point function cannot be used to distinguished scalar\nbosons and symplectic fermions. To conclude, we discuss possibilities where the\nscalar bosons and symplectic fermions may be distinguished.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
