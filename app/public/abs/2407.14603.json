In particular,\nwe explore the indirect search prospects of sub-TeV Bino-Higgsino and\nBino-Wino-Higgsino DM in the MSSM, consistent with the supersymmetric\npredictions required to explain the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.\nTypical over-abundance of Bino DM is ameliorated with slepton and/or Wino\ncoannihilations. The lightest neutralino, thus, may be associated with a\ncompressed supersymmetric particle spectrum, which, in general, is difficult to\nprobe at conventional LHC searches. Similarly, for a rather tiny Higgsino\nmixing, $\\tilde \\chi_1^0$ does not offer much prospect to assess its\npredictions at dark matter direct detection searches. Accommodating the\ninclusive effects of density spike, here, we present the requisite boost factor\nto facilitate $\\gamma-$ray searches of Bino-dominated DM in the MSSM,\nespecially focusing on the Fermi-LAT and HESS observations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NKW4vO45rU1n5HOww6zx0JW_hLYGhPaTjLeQ3bPW82E","pdfSize":"1559626"}
