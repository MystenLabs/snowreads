McLachlan, Molecular Physics\n{\\bf 8}, 39 (1964)] provides a powerful tool for the generation of equations of\nmotion. If the trial wave function is the Slater determinant, McLVP produces a\ntemporally and spatially nonlocal exchange potential [V. U. Nazarov, Phys. Rev.\nB {\\bf 87}, 165125 (2013)]. We study the performance of the corresponding\nwave-vector and frequency-dependent exchange kernel $f^h_x(q,\\omega)$ of the\nhomogeneous electron liquid. While the McLVP-based $f^h_x(q,\\omega)$ lacks\ncorrelations by construction, we find that it accurately accounts for exchange,\nreproducing features in the quantum Monte Carlo data, which the known\nconstraint-based kernels miss. We argue that the complementary use of the\nMcLVP- and the constraint-based exchange-correlation kernels will enhance the\nperformance of the linear response time-dependent density functional theory of\nthe electron liquid.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
