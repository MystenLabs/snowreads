We investigate the quantum uncertainty\nrelation of quantum channel in qubit systems. Under two general measurement\nbases, we first derive the quantum uncertainty relation for quantum channels\nwith respect to the relative entropy of coherence. Then we obtain the quantum\nuncertainty relation for unitary channels with respect to the $l_1$ norm of\ncoherence. Some examples are given in detail.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
