Inspired by the event GW170817, detected in\ngravitational waves and in optical/infrared emission, we investigate a scenario\nin which cosmic-ray (CR) particles are accelerated, in a population of BNS\nmergers, in the energy range from the knee to the ankle. By taking into account\nthe measured thermal and non-thermal energy density of the photon fields in the\nsource environment as a function of the time after the merger, we model the CR\ninteractions and the consequent neutrino production. We propagate the escaped\nCR and neutrino fluxes through the extragalactic space and compare the expected\ndiffuse fluxes to the experimental data and current limits. Depending on the\naccelerated CR mass composition and on the contribution of this possible source\nclass to the sub-ankle CR flux, we provide indications on the rate of BNS\nmerger events and the amount of baryons present in the source site.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
