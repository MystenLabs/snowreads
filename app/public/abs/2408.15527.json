Especially for the\ncase $k=3$, our result is sharp up to the endpoint. The main idea is to\ninvestigate the structure of the set where large values of Weyl sums are\nachieved by making use of the rational approximation and the refined estimate\nfor the exponential sums.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9joJe6k9uaOcaz06Ups8vmN29lx4efa3hLKGAu8OZwU","pdfSize":"272980"}
