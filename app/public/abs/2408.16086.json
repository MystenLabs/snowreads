In the literature, three\ngauges are commonly used: the Coulomb gauge, the Lorenz gauge and the temporal\ngauge. It has been noticed [J. Fleckinger-Pell\\'e et al., Technical report,\nArgonne National Lab. (1997)] that these gauges can be continuously related by\na single parameter considering the more general $\\omega$-gauge, where $\\omega$\nis a non-negative real parameter. In this article, we study the influence of\nthe gauge parameter $\\omega$ on the convergence of numerical simulations of the\nTDGL model using finite element schemes. A classical benchmark is first\nanalysed for different values of $\\omega$ and artefacts are observed for lower\nvalues of $\\omega$. Then, we relate these observations with a systematic study\nof convergence orders in the unified $\\omega$-gauge framework. In particular,\nwe show the existence of a tipping point value for $\\omega$, separating optimal\nconvergence behaviour and a degenerate one. We find that numerical artefacts\nare correlated to the degeneracy of the convergence order of the method and we\nsuggest strategies to avoid such undesirable effects. New 3D configurations are\nalso investigated (the sphere with or without geometrical defect).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
