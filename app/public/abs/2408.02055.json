Here we show that a\ncombination of observables including high-redshift UV luminosity functions, the\ncosmic X-ray background, the optical depth to reionization, and hydrogen\nabsorption lines in quasar spectra, can be used to mitigate the astrophysical\nuncertainties assuming minimal modeling. Beyond its implications to standard\nastrophysics, we demonstrate how applying this procedure can improve\nsensitivity to new physics signatures in the global 21-cm signal. Taking the\nscenario of fractional millicharged dark matter (DM) as an example, we address\nastrophysical systematics to produce interesting predictions for upcoming\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A7GNEB0bVnbzyhIInaP4_4iMVQDkVKPQ1YXc3xxG_cc","pdfSize":"15901638","txDigest":"3Jt61wat5HZV25yqaShwHAQqp93Gf3SyYX3Hjz1XBm8m","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
