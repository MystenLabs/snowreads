Previous work suggests\nthat grains near the outlet randomly sample configurational flow microstates\nuntil a clog-causing flow microstate is reached. However, factors that lead to\nclogging remain elusive. Here we experimentally observe over 50,000 clogging\nevents for a tridisperse mixture of quasi-2D circular grains, and utilize a\nvariety of machine learning (ML) methods to search for predictive signatures of\nclogging microstates. This approach fares just modestly better than chance.\nNevertheless, our analysis using linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\nhighlights the position of potential arch cornerstones as a key factor in\nclogging likelihood. We verify this experimentally by varying the position of a\nfixed (cornerstone) grain, and show that such a grain dictates the size of\nfeasible flow-ending arches, and thus the time and mass of each flow.\nPositioning this grain correctly can even increase the ejected mass by over\n50%. Our findings demonstrate that interpretable ML algorithms like SVMs can\nuncover meaningful physics even when their predictive power is below the\nstandards of conventional ML practice.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
