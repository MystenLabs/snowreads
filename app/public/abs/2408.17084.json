The key step is developing\na labeling system to map research publications to their related SDGs. The SDGs\nlabeling system integrated in Web of Science (WoS), which assigns citation\ntopics instead of individual publication to SDGs, has emerged as a promising\ntool.However we still lack of a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of\nWoS labeling system. By comparing with the Bergon approach, we systematically\nassessed the relatedness between citation topics and SDGs. Our analysis\nidentified 15% of topics showing low relatedness to their assigned SDGs at a 1%\nthreshold. Notably, SDGs such as '11 Cities', '07 Energy', and '13 Climate'\nexhibited higher percentages of low related topics. In addition, we revealed\nthat certain topics are significantly underrepresented in their relevant SDGs,\nparticularly for '02 Hunger', '12 Consumption', and '15 Land'. This study\nunderscores the critical need for continual refinement and validation of SDGs\nlabeling systems in WoS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YzzllGGRt4ZBy7JmnHTIgoivaKpUwQOLv4Tni2UjUtA","pdfSize":"3531870"}
