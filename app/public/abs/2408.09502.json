The antenna of such an array must be lightweight, easily storable\nand transportable, deployable on a large scale, durable, and capable of good\nelectrical performance. A membrane antenna is an excellent candidate to meet\nthese criteria. We study the design of a low-frequency membrane antenna for a\nlunar-based low-frequency (<30 MHz) radio telescope constructed from polyimide\nfilm widely used in aerospace applications, owing to its excellent dielectric\nproperties and high stability as a substrate material. We first design and\noptimize an antenna in free space through dipole deformation and coupling\nprinciples, then simulate an antenna on the lunar surface with a simple lunar\nsoil model, yielding an efficiency greater than 90% in the range of 12-19 MHz\nand greater than 10% in the range of 5-35 MHz. The antenna inherits the\nomni-directional radiation pattern of a simple dipole antenna in the 5-30 MHz\nfrequency band, giving a large field of view and allowing detection of the 21\ncm global signal when used alone. A demonstration prototype is constructed, and\nits measured electrical property is found to be consistent with simulated\nresults using |S11| measurements. This membrane antenna can potentially fulfill\nthe requirements of a lunar low-frequency array, establishing a solid technical\nfoundation for future large-scale arrays for exploring the cosmic dark ages.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
