The maximum of entry variances as\na natural proxy of sparsity is both a key feature and a significant obstacle.\nIn this paper, we study low-rank additive perturbations of such random\nmatrices, and establish a sharp BBP phase transition for extreme eigenvalues at\nthe level of law of large numbers. Under suitable conditions on the variance\nprofile and the finite-rank perturbation, we also establish the fluctuations of\nspectral outliers that may be characterized by the general inhomogeneous random\nmatrices. This reveals the strong non-universality phenomena, which may depend\non eigenvectors, sparsity or geometric structure. Our proofs rely on ribbon\ngraph expansions, upper bounds for diagram functions, large moment estimates\nand counting of typical diagrams.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
