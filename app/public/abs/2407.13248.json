We introduce a novel computational\nframework to analyze narratives through three discourse-level aspects: i) story\narcs, ii) turning points, and iii) affective dimensions, including arousal and\nvalence. By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant\ndiscrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories. While human-written\nstories are suspenseful, arousing, and diverse in narrative structures, LLM\nstories are homogeneously positive and lack tension. Next, we measure narrative\nreasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most\nLLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding. Finally, we show\nthat explicit integration of aforementioned discourse features can enhance\nstorytelling, as is demonstrated by over 40% improvement in neural storytelling\nin terms of diversity, suspense, and arousal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
