This equality holds\nin the homology of any toric compactification $X\\supset U$. It was proved for\nsch\\\"on $U$ by Huh, and later for all $U$ in the homology of $X=CP^n$ by\nMaxim--Rodriguez--Wang--Wu, using Ginsburg's interpretation of CSM classes as\nLagrangian cycles.\n  We deduce this identity in full generality from properties of affine\ncharacteristic classes, give an explicit sufficient condition of general\nposition for the 1-forms, and use it to extend the identity to non-torus\ninvariant 1-forms. Along the way, we characterize very affine varieties of ML\ndegree 0, and give a useful criterion for a family of varieties to have a\nconstant tropical fan (``tropical isotopy theorem'').\n  Our main idea is a technique to study very affine varieties without\ncompactifying them. As a result we do not have to deal with singularities\noccuring at the boundary of the compactification, which would require less\nconstructive methods (such as resolution of singularities). This is what\nenables us to give constructive genericity conditions in this Gauss--Bonnet\ntheorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
