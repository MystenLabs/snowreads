Constructing these well,\nespecially when there are many relevant categories, is a controversial task but\nis crucial for achieving meaningful inclusivity. Here, we focus on developing a\npragmatic ontology of belief systems, which is a complex and often\ncontroversial space. By iterating on our community-based design until mutual\nagreement is reached, we found that epistemological methods were best for\ncategorizing the fundamental ways beliefs differ, maximally respecting our\nprinciples of inclusivity and brevity. We demonstrate our methodology's utility\nand interpretability via user studies in term annotation and sentiment analysis\nexperiments for belief fairness in language models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
