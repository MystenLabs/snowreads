It assumes that the non-extensive\neffects consistently exist in the initial conditions set by the optical Glauber\nmodel, the equation of state and the hadron kinetic freeze-out procedure. The\nmodel is then applied to simulate the pseudo-rapidity ($\\eta$) distribution,\nthe transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) spectra and the $p_{\\rm T}$-differential\nelliptic flow ($v_2$) of charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. It is found that the\nmodel can reasonably well reproduce the experimental data of the $\\eta$\ndistribution and the charged-particle spectra in a $p_{\\rm T}$ range up to 6-8\nGeV/c. When compared with the ideal hydrodynamic model, the $p_{\\rm\nT}$-differential $v_2$ of charged particles is suppressed in the NEX-CLVisc\nmodel, which is similar to that observed in the viscous hydrodynamic model.\nMoreover, due to the lack of the viscous corrections and the event-by-event\nfluctuation, the model can only describe the $p_{\\rm T}$-differential $v_2$ up\nto 4 GeV/c, which is smaller than the applicable range for the particle $p_{\\rm\nT}$ spectra.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
