The dispersion behavior of survivors is critically\nsignificant for the survival of the entire species. In this paper, we consider\nan uniform dispersion scheme, where all possible survivor groupings are equally\nprobable. The aim of the survivors is to establish new colonies, with\nindividuals who settle in empty sites potentially initiating a new colony by\nthemselves. However, all other individuals succumb to the catastrophe. We\nconsider the number of dispersal options for surviving individuals in the\naftermath of a catastrophe to be a fixed value $d$ within the neighborhood. In\nthis context, we conceptualize the evolution of population dynamics occurring\nover a homogeneous tree. We investigate the conditions necessary for these\npopulations to survive, presenting pertinent bounds for survival probability,\nthe number of colonized vertices, the extent of dispersion within the\npopulation, and the mean time to extinction for the entire population.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
