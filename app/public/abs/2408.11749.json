In response, the burgeoning field of LLM Security aims to\nstudy and defend against such threats. Thus far, the majority of works in this\narea have focused on monolingual English models, however, emerging research\nsuggests that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to various attacks than\ntheir monolingual counterparts. While previous work has investigated embedding\ninversion over a small subset of European languages, it is challenging to\nextrapolate these findings to languages from different linguistic families and\nwith differing scripts. To this end, we explore the security of multilingual\nLLMs in the context of embedding inversion attacks and investigate\ncross-lingual and cross-script inversion across 20 languages, spanning over 8\nlanguage families and 12 scripts. Our findings indicate that languages written\nin Arabic script and Cyrillic script are particularly vulnerable to embedding\ninversion, as are languages within the Indo-Aryan language family. We further\nobserve that inversion models tend to suffer from language confusion, sometimes\ngreatly reducing the efficacy of an attack. Accordingly, we systematically\nexplore this bottleneck for inversion models, uncovering predictable patterns\nwhich could be leveraged by attackers. Ultimately, this study aims to further\nthe field's understanding of the outstanding security vulnerabilities facing\nmultilingual LLMs and raise awareness for the languages most at risk of\nnegative impact from these attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vJJcYHkpY1RGa7ugG4_3Z0EkB7X17c4qF3n9oL3nNd8","pdfSize":"819302"}
