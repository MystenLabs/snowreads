This paper presents a novel unlearning framework, which enables\nfully parallel unlearning among models exhibiting inheritance. A key enabler is\nthe new Unified Model Inheritance Graph (UMIG), which captures the inheritance\nusing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).Central to our framework is the new Fisher\nInheritance Unlearning (FIUn) algorithm, which utilizes the Fisher Information\nMatrix (FIM) from initial unlearning models to pinpoint impacted parameters in\ninherited models. By employing FIM, the FIUn method breaks the sequential\ndependencies among the models, facilitating simultaneous unlearning and\nreducing computational overhead. We further design to merge disparate FIMs into\na single matrix, synchronizing updates across inherited models. Experiments\nconfirm the effectiveness of our unlearning framework. For single-class tasks,\nit achieves complete unlearning with 0\\% accuracy for unlearned labels while\nmaintaining 94.53\\% accuracy for retained labels on average. For multi-class\ntasks, the accuracy is 1.07\\% for unlearned labels and 84.77\\% for retained\nlabels on average. Our framework accelerates unlearning by 99\\% compared to\nalternative methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
