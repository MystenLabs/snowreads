In this paper we extend our previous results\non abstract ladder operators considering in many details what happens if the\nHamiltonian of the system is not self-adjoint. Among other results, we give an\nexistence criterion for coherent states constructed as eigenstates of our\nlowering operators. In the second part of the paper we discuss two different\nexamples of our framework: pseudo-quons and a deformed generalized Heisenberg\nalgebra. Incidentally, and interestingly enough, we show that pseudo-quons can\nbe used to diagonalize an oscillator-like Hamiltonian written in terms of (non\nself-adjoint) position and momentum operators which obey a deformed commutation\nrule of the kind often considered in minimal length quantum mechanics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
