In addition, we show\nSchauder-type higher regularity at local extrema point for a concrete non-local\ndegenerate equation. In the singular case, we prove gradient H\\\"{o}lder\nregularity of solutions to general non-local equation. It is noteworthy that\nthese results are new even for the case $ a(x) \\equiv 0 $. Finally, as a\nbyproduct of the borderline regularity, we show how to apply our strategies in\nthe study of the corresponding regularity for a class of degenerate non-local\nnormalized $ p$-Laplacian equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
