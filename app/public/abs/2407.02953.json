By rigorously linking the double sparsity\nmodel to the hierarchical sparsity paradigm, a compressed sensing algorithm\nwith recovery guarantees is proposed for extracting delay-Doppler profiles of\nLTV channels using AFDM. Through mathematical analysis and numerical results,\nthe superiority of AFDM over other waveforms in terms of channel estimation\noverhead and minimal sampling rate requirements in sub-Nyquist radar\napplications is demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
