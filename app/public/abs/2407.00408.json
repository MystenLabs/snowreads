The hardwood cuttings were collected\nfrom 11 genotypes, which were 'Salakhani Trsh' (G1), 'Salakhani Mekhosh' (G2),\n'Amriki' (G3), 'Twekl Sury Trsh' (G4), 'Twekl Astury Naw Spy' (G5), 'Hanara\nSherina' (G6), 'Kawa Hanary Sherin' (G7), 'Kawa Hanary Trsh' (G8), 'Malesay\nTwekl Asture' (G9), 'Malesay Twekl Tank' (G10), and 'Sura Hanary Trsh' (G11).\nThe genotypes were subjected to irrigation applications by 1-day, 2-day, 7-day,\nor 10-day frequencies. Among pomegranates, G11, G6, and G7 produced 95, 90, and\n83% rooting percentages, which were significantly higher than the rest of other\ngenotypes. The lowest rooting percentages (28, 36, 38, and 40%) were found in\nG1, G5, G3, and G10, respectively. The effect of irrigation frequencies on the\ngenotypes confirmed that a 7-day frequency was the best irrigation frequency to\nachieve the maximum rooting percentages (93, 86, 80, 73, 53, and 40%) in G6,\nG9, G2, G4, G3, and G1, respectively. In contrast, the minimum rooting\npercentage (20%) was recorded in G3 with a 1-day frequency and in G1 with\n10-day frequency. In this study, it was found that the cuttings of G11, G6, and\nG7 had the best ability to form roots, and irrigation with a 7-day frequency\nwas the best for the cuttings of all the 11 pomegranate genotypes investigated.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nV67YgGeXbWcdkoStpUO5BQtfcuHfKedoorfkG58sKc","pdfSize":"1332364"}
