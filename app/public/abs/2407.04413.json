We simulate both\nsingle impurities as well as impurity dimers at different impurity-impurity\ndistances inside the TI. We extract changes to magnetic moments, analyze the\npolarizability of non-magnetic impurity atoms via nearby magnetic impurity\natoms and calculate the exchange coupling constants for a Heisenberg\nHamiltonian. We uncover chemical trends in the exchange coupling constants and\ndiscuss the impurities' potential with respect to magnetic order in the fields\nof quantum anomalous Hall insulators and topological quantum computing. In\nparticular, we predict that co-doping of different magnetic dopants is a viable\nstrategy to engineer the magnetic ground state in magnetic TIs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FPw-wcLayHWkK8yGLCMLNBa36uEgT4ushSizOPPSpfI","pdfSize":"5459570"}
