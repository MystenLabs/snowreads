The technique uses quantum optimal control to favorably harness\nthe multipath interference of the stray trajectories produced by imperfect\natom-optics operations. We apply this method to a resonant atom interferometer\nand achieve thousand-fold phase amplification, representing a fifty-fold\nimprovement over the performance observed without optimized control. Moreover,\nwe find that spurious interference can arise from the interplay of spontaneous\nemission and many-pulse sequences and demonstrate optimization strategies to\nmitigate this effect. Given the ubiquity of spontaneous emission in quantum\nsystems, these results may be valuable for improving the performance of a\ndiverse array of quantum sensors. We anticipate our findings will significantly\nbenefit the performance of matter-wave interferometers for a variety of\napplications, including dark matter, dark energy, and gravitational wave\ndetection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
