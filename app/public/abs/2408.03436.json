Leveraging robust Python libraries\nsuch as Biopython for data handling, Flask, for Graphical User Interface,\nJinja2, and wkhtmltopdf for visualization, ProS2Vi offers a modern and\nintuitive representation for visualization of the DSSP assigned secondary\nstructures to each residue of any proteins amino acid sequence. Significant\nfeatures of ProS2Vi include customizable icon colors, the number of residues\nper line, and the ability to export visualizations as scalable PDFs, enhancing\nboth visual appeal and functional versatility through a user-friendly GUI. We\nhave designed ProS2Vi specifically for secure and local operation, which\nsignificantly increases security when dealing with novel protein data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"P0urzQ5R6LtNNaNrmrnesEgJlAjZIC7Bq2lcW5MLeos","pdfSize":"961339"}
