To this\npurpose, we use a dynamical version of geometric theories. We obtain a nice\ndescription of the algebraic properties of the real number field, but also a\nfirst outline for a constructive theory of certain o-minimal structures. The\nmemoir we present here is an unfinished development of the article by the\nauthors https://inria.hal.science/hal-01426164. Compared to that paper,\nhowever, we have modified the definition of continuous semialgebraic functions,\nin the same spirit in which Bishop defines a continuous real function as a\nuniformly continuous function on any bounded interval. Despite its unfinished\nnature and the many questions that we do not currently know how to answer, we\nhope that this paper will arouse interest for its original approach to the\nsubject.
