This paper\nintroduces a dynamic Stackelberg game to determine the government's optimal\nsubsidy strategy for zero-emission vehicles, taking into account the pricing\ndecisions of a profit-maximizing firm. While firms have the flexibility to\nchange prices continuously, subsidies are adjusted at specific time intervals.\nThis is captured in our game formulation by using impulse controls for\ndiscrete-time interventions. We provide a verification theorem to characterize\nthe Feedback Stackelberg equilibrium and illustrate our results with numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
