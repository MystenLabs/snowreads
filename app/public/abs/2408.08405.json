We\nalso prove that for projective deformations of the figure-eight knot complement\nsufficiently close to the complete hyperbolic structure, the induced map on the\nfirst cohomology of the longitude of the boundary torus is non-zero. This paper\nprovides a complementary piece to the results of Heusener and Porti who showed\nthat for each k in Z, there is a sufficiently large Nk for which every k/n-Dehn\nfilling on the figure-eight knot complement for n larger than Nk is\ninfinitesimally projectively rigid. In the process of the proof, we provide\nexplicit representations of the figure-eight knot complement in PSO(3,1) which\nare rational in the real and imaginary parts of the shapes of the ideal\ntetrahedra used to glue the knot complement together.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
