Particular attention has focused on the so-called\n$f(R)$ dark energy models. Instead of focusing on a particular f(R) model, we\npresent a completely model-independent approach to study the background\ndynamics and the growth of matter density perturbations for those f(R) models\nthat mimic the $\\Lambda$CDM evolution at the background level. We do this by\ncharacterising the dynamics of the gravitational field using a set of\ndimensionless variables and using cosmography to determine the expansion\nhistory. We then illustrate the integrity of this method by fixing the\ncosmography to be the same as an exact $\\Lambda$CDM model, allowing us to test\nthe solution. We compare the exact evolution of the density contrast and growth\nindex with what one obtains from various levels of the quasi-static\napproximation, without choosing the form of $f(R)$ dark energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y-nFDiGG04nc2TKU6cp5kOhRS6Ku3WSP1ZVfDbFFEIA","pdfSize":"2233975"}
