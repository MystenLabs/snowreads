These plane curves can be obtained as\nparameterized pairs of approximating truncated series (x(s), y(s)) determined\nby sampled points. Earlier work has found that representing these truncated\nseries (polynomials) in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev basis has a number of\ndesirable properties. These include compact data representation, meaningful\nclustering of like symbols in the vector space of polynomial coefficients,\nlinear separability of classes in this space, and highly efficient calculation\nof variation between curves. In this work, we take a first step at examining\nthe use of Chebyshev-Sobolev series for symbol recognition. The early\nindication is that this representation may be superior to Legendre-Sobolev\nrepresentation for some purposes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
