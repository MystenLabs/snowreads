Future missions to the surface of\nMars may be augmented with stationary satellites that remain overhead at all\ntimes as a means of sending data back to Earth from fixed antennae on the\nsurface. These areostationary satellites will experience several important\ndisturbances that push and pull the spacecraft off of its desired orbit. Thus,\na station-keeping control strategy must be put into place to ensure the\nsatellite remains overhead while minimizing the fuel required to elongate\nmission lifetime. This paper develops a model predictive control policy for\nareostationary station keeping that exploits knowledge of non-Keplerian\nperturbations in order to minimize the required annual station-keeping $\\Delta\nv$. The station-keeping policy is applied to a satellite placed at various\nlongitudes, and simulations are performed for an example mission at a longitude\nof a potential future crewed landing site. Through careful tuning of the\ncontroller constraints, and proper placement of the satellite at stable\nlongitudes, the annual station-keeping $\\Delta v$ can be reduced relative to a\nnaive mission design.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
