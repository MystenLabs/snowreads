Alternately, g can be calculated by\nmeasuring time and distance for a free fall. Since the time of free fall in a\nlaboratory is short, there are challenges in measuring the short period. In\nthis article, a low cost technique to measure the time for a free fall using a\ndischarging RC circuit is discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
