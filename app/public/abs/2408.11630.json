Here we present a fiber-based scanning Michelson\ninterferometer employing a strongly focused laser beam as a probe. Combined\nwith a heterodyne circuit, this setup enables frequency- and spatially-resolved\nmeasurements of the amplitude and phase of the SAW displacement. We demonstrate\nthis by investigating a 1 GHz SAW cavity, revealing the presence of\nfrequency-overlapping transverse modes, which are not resolved with an\nall-electrical measurement. The frequency overlap of these transverse modes\nleads to mode superpositions, which we analyze by quadrature decomposition of\nthe complex acoustic field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
