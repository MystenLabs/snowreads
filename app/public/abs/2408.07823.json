This is in striking contrast with the situation in dimensions $n\n\\ge 11$, where Ammann and Humbert obtained the existence of minimizers for the\nsecond conformal eigenvalue on any smooth closed non-locally conformally flat\nmanifold. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also obtain a lower bound on the\nenergy of sign-changing solutions of the \\nobreak Yamabe equation in dimensions\n3, 4 and 5, which extends a result obtained by Weth in the case of the round\nsphere.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
