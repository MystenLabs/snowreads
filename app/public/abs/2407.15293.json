Recent advancements in imaging technologies allow clinicians to\ncapture high-quality images of the retinal blood vessels via Optical Coherence\nTomography Angiography (OCTA), which contain vital information for diagnosing\nthese diseases and expediting preventative measures. OCTA provides detailed\nvascular imaging as compared to the solely structural information obtained by\ncommon OCT imaging. Although there have been considerable studies on OCT\nimaging, there have been limited to no studies exploring the role of artificial\nintelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches for predictive modeling\nwith OCTA images. In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning to\nidentify eye disease in OCTA images. However, due to the lack of labeled data,\nthe straightforward application of deep learning doesn't necessarily yield good\ngeneralization. To this end, we utilize active learning to select the most\nvaluable subset of data to train our model. We demonstrate that active learning\nsubset selection greatly outperforms other strategies, such as inverse\nfrequency class weighting, random undersampling, and oversampling, by up to 49%\nin F1 evaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
