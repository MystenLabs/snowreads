A promising solution\nto this challenge is synthetic data generation. This technique creates entirely\nnew datasets that mimic the statistical properties of real data, while\npreserving confidential patient information. In this paper, we present the\nworkflow and different services developed in the context of Germany's National\nData Infrastructure project NFDI4Health. First, two state-of-the-art AI tools\n(namely, VAMBN and MultiNODEs) for generating synthetic health data are\noutlined. Further, we introduce SYNDAT (a public web-based tool) which allows\nusers to visualize and assess the quality and risk of synthetic data provided\nby desired generative models. Additionally, the utility of the proposed methods\nand the web-based tool is showcased using data from Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Center for Cancer Registry Data of the\nRobert Koch Institute (RKI).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"e_nV4_zhNRE1UnYj3kKmmRnh11EXbIA13EVl3p3uM78","pdfSize":"586388"}
