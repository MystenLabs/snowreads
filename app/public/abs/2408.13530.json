In particular, we develop the\nwell-posedness theory of entropy solution based on the Kru\\v{z}kov's\nsemi-entropy formulation. In comparison to the pioneered work by Bauzet et al.\n(J. Funct. Anal. 266, (2014), 2503-2545), concerning the existence and\nuniqueness of entropy solution for the Dirichlet problem for conservation laws\ndriven by Brownian noise, our present analysis involves a simpler approach to\nobtain the global Kato's inequality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
