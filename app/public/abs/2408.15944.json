Through a spectral\ndecomposition of $R$ and a simplified model of triadic convective interactions,\nwe show that $R$ actually suppresses the signature of convective scale\ninteractions, and we suggest that what $R$ likely measures is linear\ninteractions between large-scale motions and the background mean flow. We\npropose an alternative coefficient which is specifically designed for the\ndetection of convective non-linearities, and we show how this new coefficient,\n$R_T$, also quantifies the turbulent kinetic energy transport involved in\nturbulent scale interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AZiFKQpsT0xhPAJ3I_C9mzBELlzprMUAAC3KjZfwUPI","pdfSize":"615536"}
