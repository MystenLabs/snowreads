For the\nHeitmann-Radin sticky disk potential $V=V_{\\text{HR}}$, we prove, using Brass'\nkey result from [Computational Geometry, 6:195--214, 1996], that\ncrystallization occurs for any fixed norm, with a classification of minimizers\nand minimal energies according to the kissing number associated to $\\|\\cdot\\|$.\nThe minimizer is proved to be, up to affine transform, a patch of the\ntriangular or the square lattice, which shows how to easily get anisotropy in a\ncrystallization phenomenon. We apply this result to the $p$-norms\n$\\|\\cdot\\|_p$, $p\\geq 1$, which allows us to construct an explicit family of\nnorms for which crystallization holds on any given lattice. We also solve part\nof a crystallization problem studied in [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal.,\n240:987--1053] where points are constrained to be on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. Moreover,\nwe numerically investigate the minimization problem for the energy per point\namong lattices for the Lennard-Jones potential $V=V_{\\text{LJ}}:r\\mapsto\nr^{-12}-2r^{-6}$ as well as the Epstein zeta function associated to a $p$-norm\n$\\|\\cdot\\|_p$, i.e. when $V=V_s:r\\mapsto r^{-s}$, $s>2$. Our simulations show a\nnew and unexpected phase transition for the minimizers with respect to $p$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
