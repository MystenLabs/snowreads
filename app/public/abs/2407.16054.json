Yet, as of today, their locomotion\nremains far from that of the biological snakes. Our recent study suggested that\nsnake locomotion utilizing partial ground contacts can be achieved with robots\nby using body compliance and lengthwise-globally applied body tensions. In this\npaper, we present the first hardware implementation of this locomotion\nprinciple. Our snake robot comprises serial tendon-driven continuum sections\nand is bent and twisted globally using tendons. We demonstrate how the tendons\nare actuated to achieve the ground contacts for forward and backward locomotion\nand sidewinding. The robot's capability to generate snake locomotion in various\ndirections and its steerability were validated in a series of indoor\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
