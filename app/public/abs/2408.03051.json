Lavancier, A. Philippe, and D. Surgailis. Covariance function\nof vector self-similar processes. Statistics & Probability Letters, 2009] we\ndefine a multivariate version of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\nThis multivariate Gaussian process is stationary, ergodic and allows for\ndifferent Hurst exponents on each component. We characterize its correlation\nmatrix and its short and long time asymptotics. Besides the marginal\nparameters, the cross correlation between one-dimensional marginal components\nis ruled by two parameters. We consider the problem of their inference,\nproposing two types of estimator, constructed from discrete observations of the\nprocess. We establish their asymptotic theory, in one case in the long time\nasymptotic setting, in the other case in the infill and long time asymptotic\nsetting. The limit behavior can be asymptotically Gaussian or non-Gaussian,\ndepending on the values of the Hurst exponents of the marginal components. The\ntechnical core of the paper relies on the analysis of asymptotic properties of\nfunctionals of Gaussian processes, that we establish using Malliavin calculus\nand Stein's method. We provide numerical experiments that support our\ntheoretical analysis and also suggest a conjecture on the application of one of\nthese estimators to the multivariate fractional Brownian Motion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
