In this work, we introduce a lightweight framework that learns\na single walking controller that yields locomotion on multiple terrains. We\nhave designed a real-time robot controller based on diffusion models, which not\nonly captures multiple behaviours with different velocities in a single policy\nbut also generalizes well for unseen terrains. Our controller learns with\noffline data, which is better than online learning in aspects like scalability,\nsimplicity in training scheme etc. We have designed and implemented a diffusion\nmodel-based policy controller in simulation on our custom-made Bipedal Robot\nmodel named Stoch BiRo. We have demonstrated its generalization capability and\nhigh frequency control step generation relative to typical generative models,\nwhich require huge onboarding compute.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
