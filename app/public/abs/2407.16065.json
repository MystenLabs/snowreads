These proteinopathies involve misfolded proteins accumulating\ninto neurotoxic aggregates. Mathematical and computational models describing\nthe prion-like dynamics offer an analytical basis to study the diseases'\nevolution and a computational framework for exploring potential therapies. This\nwork focuses on the heterodimer model in a three-dimensional setting, a\nreactive-diffusive system of nonlinear partial differential equations\ndescribing the evolution of both healthy and misfolded proteins. We investigate\ntraveling wave solutions and diffusion-driven instabilities as a mechanism of\nneurotoxic pattern formation. For the considered mathematical model, we propose\na space discretization, relying on the Discontinuous Galerkin method on\npolytopal/polyhedral grids, allowing high-order accuracy and flexible handling\nof the complicated brain's geometry. Further, we present a priori error\nestimates for the semi-discrete formulation and we perform convergence tests to\nverify the theoretical results. Finally, we conduct simulations using realistic\ndata on a three-dimensional brain mesh reconstructed from medical images.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
