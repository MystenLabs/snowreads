The contributing factors are manifold, and some of them are linked to\nstructural change in agriculture, for instance because of higher workloads,\nrural depopulation, or reduced opportunities for collaboration. Our work\nexplores the interconnections between loneliness, social contacts, and\nstructural factors in agriculture based on a survey of 110 farm managers in the\nmountain region of Entlebuch, Switzerland combined with agricultural census\ndata. We use path analysis, in which loneliness is the main outcome, and social\ncontacts are an explanatory and explained variable. We find that 3% of\nrespondents report that they feel lonely frequently or very frequently, and the\nrest sometimes (20%), rarely (40%) or never (38%). Managers with higher\nworkloads report feeling lonely more frequently, and this relationship is\ndirect, as well as indirect because of less frequent social contacts. However,\nphysical isolation is not a significant predictor of loneliness. Moreover,\nshort food supply chains correlate with less frequent loneliness feelings. Our\nstudy sheds light on the effects that structural change can have on the social\nfabric of rural areas.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
