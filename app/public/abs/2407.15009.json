This paper explores how easily\nthe default ethical guardrails of ChatGPT, using its latest customization\nfeatures, can be bypassed by simple prompts and fine-tuning, that can be\neffortlessly accessed by the broad public. This malevolently altered version of\nChatGPT, nicknamed \"RogueGPT\", responded with worrying behaviours, beyond those\ntriggered by jailbreak prompts. We conduct an empirical study of RogueGPT\nresponses, assessing its flexibility in answering questions pertaining to what\nshould be disallowed usage. Our findings raise significant concerns about the\nmodel's knowledge about topics like illegal drug production, torture methods\nand terrorism. The ease of driving ChatGPT astray, coupled with its global\naccessibility, highlights severe issues regarding the data quality used for\ntraining the foundational model and the implementation of ethical safeguards.\nWe thus underline the responsibilities and dangers of user-driven\nmodifications, and the broader effects that these may have on the design of\nsafeguarding and ethical modules implemented by AI programmers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
