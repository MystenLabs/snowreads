By a wall-crossing argument the\nconjecture is equivalent to a new conjectural formula for the K-theoretically\nrefined Pandharipande-Thomas invariants of the local Enriques surface. Evidence\nfor the conjecture is given in several cases. We also comment on the case of K3\nsurfaces previously studied by Thomas.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
