We call them two- and\nfour-winged ``Sim\\'o angels''. These three attractors exist in an\norientation-reversing, three-dimensional, quadratic H\\'enon map. Our analysis\nis based on a numerical study of a normal form for this bifurcation, a\nthree-dimensional system of differential equations with a Z4-symmetry. We\ninvestigate bifurcations in the normal form and describe those responsible for\nthe emergence of the Lorenz attractor and the continuous-time version of the\nSimo angels. Both for the normal form and the 3D H\\'enon map, we have found\nopen regions in the parameter space where the attractors are pseudohyperbolic,\nimplying that for every parameter value from these regions every orbit in the\nattractor has positive top Lyapunov exponent.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
