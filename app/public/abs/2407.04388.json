If $C+W=\\mathbb{Z}$, then $C$ is\ncalled an additive complement to $W$. We further call $C$ a minimal additive\ncomplement to $W$ if no proper subset of $C$ is an additive complement to $W$.\nAnswering a problem of Nathanson in part, we give sufficient conditions of $W$\nwhich has no minimal additive complements. Our result also extends the prior\nresult of Chen and Yang.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
