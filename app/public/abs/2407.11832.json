In\nthis paper, we show that approximating the number of relevant variables in the\nparity function is as hard as properly learning parities.\n  More specifically, let $\\gamma:{\\mathbb R}^+\\to {\\mathbb R}^+$, where\n$\\gamma(x) \\ge x$, be any strictly increasing function. In our first result, we\nshow that from any polynomial-time algorithm that returns a\n$\\gamma$-approximation, $D$ (i.e., $\\gamma^{-1}(d(f)) \\leq D \\leq\n\\gamma(d(f))$), of the number of relevant variables~$d(f)$ for any parity $f$,\nwe can, in polynomial time, construct a solution to the long-standing open\nproblem of polynomial-time learning $k(n)$-sparse parities (parities with\n$k(n)\\le n$ relevant variables), where $k(n) = \\omega_n(1)$.\n  In our second result, we show that from any $T(n)$-time algorithm that, for\nany parity $f$, returns a $\\gamma$-approximation of the number of relevant\nvariables $d(f)$ of $f$, we can, in polynomial time, construct a\n$poly(\\Gamma(n))T(\\Gamma(n)^2)$-time algorithm that properly learns parities,\nwhere $\\Gamma(x)=\\gamma(\\gamma(x))$.\n  If $T(\\Gamma(n)^2)=\\exp({o(n/\\log n)})$, this would resolve another\nlong-standing open problem of properly learning parities in the presence of\nrandom classification noise in time $\\exp({o(n/\\log n)})$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Trhj1ckDFdBi3x1VBfPjCa1aC4D8rYV21WSOe52DNmc","pdfSize":"257705","objectId":"0x3563bd3a6136a6d2a240f98f777f14af5e0b9e46941f6be23b95d47b2f07dc6d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
