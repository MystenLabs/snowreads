Considering only local intra- and interspecies interactions, the\nsystem is described by the Bose-Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which is studied\nusing the density matrix renormalization group method. In addition to the\ncommon gapless and mixed Mott insulator phases, we identify unknown gapped\nstates, in which bosons couple with some or all flavors of fermions. We unveil\ndifferent flavor-selective states characterized by itinerant fermions that\ncoexist with an insulator state where the bosons tie with only one- or\ntwo-flavor fermions. The states reported here could be implemented in\ncold-atoms experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
