The time-resolved Kerr rotation\ntechnique was primarily used. The samples with $x=$ 0.05 and 0.15 exhibited an\nanomalously large nuclear magnetic field of $\\sim$1.1 T, which was twice the\napplied magnetic field. This observation is unusual for bulk semiconductors,\nwhich typically exhibit weak hyperfine interactions. Further investigations\nrevealed a long nuclear field formation time, which indicated clear two-stage\nformation dynamics. Thus, this study concluded that slow nuclear spin diffusion\nowing to the nuclear quadrupole interaction facilitates the formation process\nof the nuclear field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BVXocVEp3ExT2n7sI9dGNGrtGgG98hBKDibHE9_MRIg","pdfSize":"7134334"}
