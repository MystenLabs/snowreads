First, because of flexoelectricity, the\ncombination of polar order and splay reduces the free energy. Second, because\nof electrostatics, any splay generates a bound charge density, which increases\nthe free energy. To assess the competition between these two effects, we\ndevelop a theory that combines flexoelectricity and electrostatics. The theory\npredicts a phase diagram that includes ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and\nconventional nematic phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
