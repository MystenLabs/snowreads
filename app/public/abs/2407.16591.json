In this paper, we establish a novel framework for real-time\ninteractions through the virtual models in the Metaverse. Specifically, we\njointly predict the motion of the human controller for 1) proactive rendering\nin the Metaverse and 2) generating control commands to the real-world remote\ndevice in advance. The virtual model is decoupled into two components for\nrendering and control, respectively. To dynamically adjust the prediction\nhorizons for rendering and control, we develop a two-step human-in-the-loop\ncontinuous reinforcement learning approach and use an expert policy to improve\nthe training efficiency. An experimental prototype is built to verify our\nalgorithm with different communication latencies. Compared with the baseline\npolicy without prediction, our proposed method can reduce 1) the\nMotion-To-Photon (MTP) latency between human motion and rendering feedback and\n2) the root mean squared error (RMSE) between human motion and real-world\nremote devices significantly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
