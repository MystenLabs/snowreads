The essential ideal graph\n$\\mathcal{E}_{R}$ of $R$ is a graph whose vertex set consists of all nonzero\nproper ideals of \\textit{R}. Two vertices $\\hat{I}$ and $\\hat{J}$ are adjacent\nif and only if $\\hat{I}+ \\hat{J}$ is an essential ideal. In this paper, we\ncharacterize the graph $\\mathcal{E}_{R}$ as having a finite metric dimension.\n  Additionally, we identify that the essential ideal graph and annihilating\nideal graph of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ are isomorphic whenever $n$ is a\nproduct of distinct primes. Also, we estimate the metric dimension of the\nessential ideal graph of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Furthermore, we determine\nthe topological indices, namely the first and the second Zagreb indices, of\n$\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathbb Z_n}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"g2oyLB4yjnVUbRdW3RQ7mIuan6lKS_HhoFupPWuv2Nc","pdfSize":"244710"}
