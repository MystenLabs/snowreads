We calculate the action density of\nthe solutions and find that the soliton solutions behave as the KP-type\nsolitons, that is, the one-soliton solution has a localized action/energy\ndensity on a 3d hyperplane in 4-dimensions (soliton wall) and the n-soliton\nsolution describes n intersecting soliton walls with phase shifts. We note that\nthe Ward conjecture holds mostly in the split signature (+,+,-,-). Furthermore,\nthe 4dWZW model describes the string field theory action of the open N=2 string\ntheory in the four-dimensional space-time with the split signature and hence\nour soliton solutions would describe a new-type of physical objects in the N=2\nstring theory. We discuss instanton solutions in the 4dWZW model as well.\nNoncommutative extension and quantization of the unified theory of integrable\nsystems are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
