In\nthe present work, we extend recently introduced methods for the construction of\nmolecular Auger spectra that are based on complex-scaled equation-of-motion\ncoupled-cluster theory to Coster-Kronig decay. We compute ionization energies\nas well as total and partial decay widths for the 2s-1 states of argon and\nhydrogen sulfide and construct the L1L2,3M Coster-Kronig and L1MM Auger spectra\nof these species. Whereas our final spectra are in good agreement with the\navailable experimental and theoretical data, substantial disagreements are\nfound for various branching ratios suggesting that spin-orbit coupling makes a\nmajor impact on Coster-Kronig decay already in the third period of the periodic\ntable.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
