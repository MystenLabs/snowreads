This (2+0)D reduction enables the construction of the kinetic\nequation for the stationary gas of KP solitons by invoking recent results on\n(1+1)D bidirectional soliton gases and generalised hydrodynamics of the\nBoussinesq equation. We then use the kinetic theory to analytically describe\ntwo basic types of 2D soliton gas interactions: (i) refraction of a line\nsoliton by a stationary soliton gas, and (ii) oblique interference of two\nsoliton gases. We verify the analytical predictions by numerically implementing\nthe corresponding KPII soliton gases via exact N-soliton solutions with N-large\nand appropriately chosen random distributions for the soliton parameters. We\nalso explicitly evaluate the long-distance correlations for the two-component\ninterference configurations. The results can be applied to a variety of\nphysical systems, from shallow water waves to Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N-a-6vCyGkKSfIWDFL86w74MEkCxx_3bZhQYf_PJJ4k","pdfSize":"12571009"}
