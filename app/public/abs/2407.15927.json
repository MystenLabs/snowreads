We find that the\n$\\dot{m}_{\\rm BH} (\\equiv \\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}c^2 /L_{\\rm Edd})$ dependence of\n$L_{\\rm rad}/L_{\\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\\rm mech}/L_{\\rm Edd}$ found for stellar-mass\nblack hole can apply to the high mass cases, where $L_{\\rm rad}$ is the\nradiation luminosity, $L_{\\rm mech}$ is the mechanical luminosity, $c$ is the\nspeed of light, and $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity. Such\nuniversalities can appear in the regime, in which electron scattering opacity\ndominates over absorption opacity. Further, the normalized isotropic mechanical\nluminosity $L_{\\rm mech}^{\\rm ISO}/L_{\\rm Edd}$ (evaluated by normalized\ndensity and velocity at $\\theta=10^\\circ$) exhibits a broken power-law\nrelationship with ${\\dot m}_{\\rm BH}$; $L_{\\rm mech}^{\\rm ISO}/ L_{\\rm Edd}\n\\propto{\\dot m}_{\\rm BH}^{2.7}$ (or $\\propto {\\dot m}_{\\rm BH}^{0.7}$) below\n(above) ${\\dot m}_{\\rm BH}\\sim 400$. This is because the radial velocity stays\nnearly constant (or even decreases) below (above) the break with increase of\n$\\dot m_{\\rm BH}$. We also find that the luminosity ratio is $L_{\\rm\nmech}/L_{\\rm rad}^{\\rm ISO} \\sim$ 0.05 at ${\\dot m}_{\\rm BH} \\sim 100$, which\nis roughly consistent with the observations of NLS1, 1H 0323+103.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"0HVAYUg4Y_iVztEFXHnrrOFj75d86euHG3Fg5XhnD_E","pdfSize":"2954852"}
