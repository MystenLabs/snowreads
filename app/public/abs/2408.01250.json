The sender designs an experiment to persuade\nthe receiver to take a specific action. The experiment also affects the\nreceiver's attention effort, that is, the probability that she updates her\nbeliefs. As a result, persuasion has two margins: extensive (effort) and\nintensive (action). The receiver's utility exhibits a supermodularity property\nin information and effort. By leveraging this property, I prove a general\nequivalence between experiments and persuasion mechanisms \\`a la Kolotilin et\nal. (2017). Censoring high states is an optimal strategy for the sender in\napplications.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cFaDGtE7krmsFBNsVU6lOqoQRjTUoQ6mzVOqxnyDsTE","pdfSize":"815177","txDigest":"5vor77zKoAycQsjje9sd7s54PnUs7VQJ5tpFWYkR1Xti","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
