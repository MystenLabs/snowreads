One challenge\nwhen designing with flexures is the large number of degrees of freedom\navailable which makes it difficult or impossible to optimise their motion by\nhand. In this paper we demonstrate two approaches for optimising flexure\ngeometry to follow arbitrary focal surface curvature and to orient the optical\nfibre with arbitrary tilt. These approaches are: analytical using MATLAB models\nand FEA based using Ansys. The approaches are complementary allowing the\ndesigner to efficiently explore the parameter space and then do precise\noptimisation of the flexure geometry. We demonstrate the applicability both to\nthe UKATCs preferred design for WST, and to flexure-based fibre positioner\ndesigns generally. We also present a sensitivity analysis relating small\nchanges in design parameters to changes in fibre tip motion. Finally we briefly\npresent the UKATCs preferred geometry for the WST fibre positioner.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iwlHT6omJdzREXqrfvna52lySmeAOkYt9F2iP5tU45M","pdfSize":"573863"}
