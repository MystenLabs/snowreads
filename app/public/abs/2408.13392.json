Pinatubo eruption resulted in a massive increase of sulfate\naerosols in the atmosphere, absorbing radiation and leading to global changes\nin surface and stratospheric temperatures. A volcanic eruption of this\nmagnitude serves as a natural analog for stratospheric aerosol injection, a\nproposed solar radiation modification method to combat the warming climate. The\nimpacts of such an event are multifaceted and region-specific. Our goal is to\ncharacterize the multivariate and dynamic nature of the climate impacts\nfollowing the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. We developed a multivariate space-time\ndynamic linear model to understand the full extent of the spatially- and\ntemporally-varying impacts. Specifically, spatial variation is modeled using a\nflexible set of basis functions for which the basis coefficients are allowed to\nvary in time through a vector autoregressive (VAR) structure. This novel model\nis caste in a Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) framework and estimated via a\ncustomized MCMC approach. We demonstrate how the model quantifies the\nrelationships between key atmospheric parameters following the Mt. Pinatubo\neruption with reanalysis data from MERRA-2 and highlight when such model is\nadvantageous over univariate models.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
