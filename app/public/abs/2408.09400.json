Euler Characteristic\nSurfaces with an appropriate metric is used to quantify stability and locate\ncritical changes in a dynamical system with respect to variations in a\nparameter, while being substantially computationally cheaper than available\nalternate methods such as persistent homology. The stability of the\nconstruction is demonstrated by a quantitative comparison bound with persistent\nhomology, and a quantitative stability bound under small changes in time is\nestablished. The proposed construction is used to analyze two different kinds\nof simulated disordered flow situations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
