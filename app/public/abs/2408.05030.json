We show a central limit theorem for the point process\nassociated to the cluster positions when the system is started from a uniform\nconfiguration. The critical mixing estimate is obtained by coupling the system\nto countably many independent Brownian motions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
