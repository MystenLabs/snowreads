{"id":"2408.15873","title":"Constructing a Common Ground: Analyzing the quality and usage of\n  International Auxiliary Languages in Wikipedia","authors":"Marta Alet and Diego Saez-Trumper","authorsParsed":[["Alet","Marta",""],["Saez-Trumper","Diego",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 15:44:06 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-29","timestamp":1724859846000,"abstract":"  International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) are constructed languages designed\nto facilitate communication among speakers of different native languages while\nfostering equality, efficiency, and cross-cultural understanding. This study\nfocuses on analyzing the editions of IALs on Wikipedia, including Simple\nEnglish, Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, Volapuk, Interlingue, and Novial. We\ncompare them with three natural languages: English, Spanish, and Catalan. Our\naim is to establish a basis for the use of IALs in Wikipedia as well as\nshowcase a new methodology for categorizing wikis. We found in total there are\n1.3 million articles written in these languages and they gather 15.6 million\nmonthly views. Although this is not a negligible amount of content, in\ncomparison with large natural language projects there is still a big room for\nimprovement. We concluded that IAL editions on Wikipedia are similar to other\nprojects, behaving proportionally to their communities' size. Therefore, the\nkey to their growth is augmenting the amount and quality of the content offered\nin these languages. To that end, we offer a set of statistics to understand and\nimprove these projects, and we developed a webpage that displays our findings\nto foster knowledge sharing and facilitate the expansion of the IAL\ncommunities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
