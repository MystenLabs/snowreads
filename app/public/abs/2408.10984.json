Our compactness argument bypasses the\nfailure of the classical localisation techniques, that mismatch with the\nnonlocal nature of the operators involved. If symmetry is also assumed, we show\nthat the $H$-compactness can be equivalently obtained through the\n$\\Gamma$-convergence of the associated energies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
