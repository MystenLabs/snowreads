We investigate the benefits of these\nshort T1 times on the two-photon indistinguishability for quasi-resonant and\nstrictly resonant excitation, and observe visibilities $\\geq96\\%$ at 12.5 ns\ntime delay of consecutively emitted photons. The strongly Purcell-enhanced\ndecay times enable a high degree of indistinguishability for elevated\ntemperatures of up to 30 K, and moreover, allow for excitation of up to 1.28\nGHz repetition rate. Our work highlights the prospects of high Purcell enhanced\nsolid-state quantum emitters for applications in quantum information and\ntechnologies operating at GHz clock-rates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
