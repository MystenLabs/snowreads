It modifies the data processing pipeline into\ntwo alternating phases: feature clustering and model training. However, such\nalternating schedule may lead to instability and computational burden issues.\nWe propose a centerless clustering algorithm called Probability Aggregation\nClustering (PAC) to proactively adapt deep learning technologies, enabling easy\ndeployment in online deep clustering. PAC circumvents the cluster center and\naligns the probability space and distribution space by formulating clustering\nas an optimization problem with a novel objective function. Based on the\ncomputation mechanism of the PAC, we propose a general online probability\naggregation module to perform stable and flexible feature clustering over\nmini-batch data and further construct a deep visual clustering framework deep\nPAC (DPAC). Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAC has superior clustering\nrobustness and performance and DPAC remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art\ndeep clustering methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
