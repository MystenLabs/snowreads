In the budgeted version,\neach robot is subject to a travel budget limiting the distance it can travel.\nOur interest in this problem is motivated by applications in precision\nagriculture, where robots are used to collect measurements to estimate\ndomain-relevant scalar parameters such as soil moisture or nitrates\nconcentrations. In this paper, we propose an online, distributed multi-robot\nsampling algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) where each robot\niteratively selects the next sampling location through communication with other\nrobots and considering its remaining budget. We evaluate our proposed method\nfor varying team sizes and in different environments, and we compare our\nsolution with four different baseline methods. Our experiments show that our\nsolution outperforms the baselines when the budget is tight by collecting\nmeasurements leading to smaller reconstruction errors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H-q1doy6KXbHeOsf8eCL7rV8oUCp4ZZucEnp9GUG9Ck","pdfSize":"3237858"}
