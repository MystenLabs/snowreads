Beyond its\nalgorithmic implications, this transformation is instrumental in identifying\nall minimal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs. We conduct a structural\nstudy of this transformation, and for $C_{4}$-free graphs, we achieve a\ncomplete characterization of these patterns. This characterization allows us,\namong other things, to identify all minimal chordal graphs that are not\ncircular-arc graphs in a companion paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vzW8mSr3LdSdCcbGRZpy_aHBVgufeYYomd9iXZKxP48","pdfSize":"390508"}
