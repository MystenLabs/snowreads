Nowadays more and\nmore tasks require to consider stochastic formulations of optimization\nproblems. In this paper, we present an analysis of a method that gives optimal\nconvergence estimates for monotone stochastic finite-sum variational\ninequalities. In contrast to the previous works, our method supports batching,\ndoes not lose the oracle complexity optimality and uses an arbitrary Bregman\ndistance to take into account geometry of the problem. Paper provides\nexperimental confirmation to algorithm's effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
