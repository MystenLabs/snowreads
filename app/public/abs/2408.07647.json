Procuring pharmacists with the right behavioral\ninterventions or nudges can enhance their skills, public health awareness, and\npharmacy inventory management, ensuring access to essential medicines that\nultimately benefit their patients. We introduce a reinforcement learning\noperational system to deliver personalized behavioral interventions through\nmobile health applications. We illustrate its potential by discussing a series\nof initial experiments run with SwipeRx, an all-in-one app for pharmacists,\nincluding B2B e-commerce, in Indonesia. The proposed method has broader\napplications extending beyond pharmacy operations to optimize healthcare\ndelivery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4joqs6nDGkqhPDgCkZRZ_vkfVX3-WuJdC4y5roeYb0Y","pdfSize":"666856"}
