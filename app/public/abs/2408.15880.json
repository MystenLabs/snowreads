In this context, it is crucial to certify that a given quantum\nchannel can reliably transmit high-dimensional quantum information. Here we\ndevelop efficient methods for the characterization of high-dimensional quantum\nchannels. We first present a notion of dimensionality of quantum channels, and\ndevelop efficient certification methods for this quantity. We consider a simple\nprepare-and-measure setup, and provide witnesses for both a fully and a\npartially trusted scenario. In turn we apply these methods to a photonic\nexperiment and certify dimensionalities up to 59 for a commercial graded-index\nmulti-mode optical fiber. Moreover, we present extensive numerical simulations\nof the experiment, providing an accurate noise model for the fiber and\nexploring the potential of more sophisticated witnesses. Our work demonstrates\nthe efficient characterization of high-dimensional quantum channels, a key\ningredient for future quantum communication technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
