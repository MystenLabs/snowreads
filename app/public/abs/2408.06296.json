Starting from the raw side-channel trace, the\npreprocessing of the side-channel trace to pinpoint the time at which each\ncryptographic primitive is executed, and, then, to re-align all the collected\ndata to this specific time represent a critical step to setup a successful\nside-channel attack. The use of hiding techniques has been widely adopted as a\nlow-cost solution to hinder the preprocessing of side-channel traces thus\nlimiting side-channel attacks in real scenarios. This work introduces Hound, a\nnovel deep learning-based pipeline to locate the execution of cryptographic\nprimitives within the side-channel trace even in the presence of trace\ndeformations introduced by the use of dynamic frequency scaling actuators.\nHound has been validated through successful attacks on various cryptographic\nprimitives executed on an FPGA-based system-on-chip incorporating a RISC-V CPU,\nwhile dynamic frequency scaling is active. Experimental results demonstrate the\npossibility of identifying the cryptographic primitives in DFS-deformed\nside-channel traces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
