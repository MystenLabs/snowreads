At each\nfrequency sample, the scheme employs Newton iterations to solve the nonlinear\ninverse scattering problem. At every iteration, the Newton step is computed by\nsolving a linear system that involves the Frechet derivative of the integral\noperator, which represents the scattered fields, and the difference between\nthese fields and the measurements. This linear system is regularized using the\nTikhonov method. The multi-frequency data is accounted for in a recursive\nmanner. More specifically, the profile reconstructed at a given frequency is\nused as an initial guess for the iterations at the next frequency. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical examples,\nwhich demonstrate its ability to accurately reconstruct surface profiles even\nin the presence of measurement noise. The results also show the superiority of\nthe multi-frequency approach over single-frequency reconstructions,\nparticularly in terms of handling surfaces with sharp variations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
