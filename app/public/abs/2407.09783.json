Thanks to the special structure of the defining sets, the principal\nparameters of these codes are characterized. Specially, when the employed\nsimplicial complexes are generated by a single maximal element, we determine\ntheir Lee weight distributions completely. Furthermore, by considering the Gray\nimage codes and the corresponding subfield-like codes, numerous of linear codes\nover $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are also obtained, where $q$ is a prime power. Certain\nconditions are given to ensure the above linear codes are (Hermitian)\nself-orthogonal in the case of $q=2,3,4$. It is noteworthy that most of the\nderived codes over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ satisfy the Ashikhmin-Barg's condition for\nminimality. Besides, we obtain two infinite families of distance-optimal codes\nover $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with respect to the Griesmer bound.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
