The volume of data generated by modern vehicles presents\ntransmission, storage, and computational challenges. Focusing on Dynamic\nBehavior (DB) offers a promising approach to distinguish relevant from\nirrelevant information for ADS functionalities, thereby reducing data. Time\nseries pattern recognition is beneficial for this task as it can analyze the\ntemporal context of vehicle driving behavior. However, existing\nstate-of-the-art methods often lack the adaptability to identify\nvariable-length patterns or provide analytical descriptions of discovered\npatterns. This contribution proposes a Behavior Forest framework for real-time\ndata selection by constructing a Behavior Graph during vehicle operation,\nfacilitating analytical descriptions without pre-training. The method\ndemonstrates its performance using a synthetically generated and\nelectrocardiogram data set. An automotive time series data set is used to\nevaluate the data reduction capabilities, in which this method discarded 96.01%\nof the incoming data stream, while relevant DB remain included.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1lzm92iC8facHvlZ2ktJcUm_jMIayx3ye_fp81QarrY","pdfSize":"1848128"}
