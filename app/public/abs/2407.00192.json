The first aim is based on\nRiesz--Thorin's interpolation theorem, we prove new Hausdorff--Young type\ninequalities for the Quadratic Fourier transforms in (Ann. Funct. Anal.\n2014;5(1):10--23) and linear canonical transforms in (Mediterr. J. Math.\n2018;15,13), which were introduced by Castro et al. The second aim is to\ninvestigate the boundedness of the oscillatory integral operator with\npolynomial phases, which is also presented in the last section of the article.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
