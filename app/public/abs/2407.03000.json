While most large vision-language models (VLMs) focus on\nphysical-level skills, our work is the first to examine their multimodal\ncapabilities in leveraging human values to make decisions under a\nvision-depicted situation. VIVA contains 1,062 images depicting diverse\nreal-world situations and the manually annotated decisions grounded in them.\nGiven an image there, the model should select the most appropriate action to\naddress the situation and provide the relevant human values and reason\nunderlying the decision. Extensive experiments based on VIVA show the\nlimitation of VLMs in using human values to make multimodal decisions. Further\nanalyses indicate the potential benefits of exploiting action consequences and\npredicted human values.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
