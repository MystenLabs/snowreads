In this novel method, we\nonly collocate on nodes interior to the domain boundary and enforce boundary\nconditions as constraints by means of Lagrange multipliers. This combination\nenables full geometric flexibility near boundaries without compromising the\nhigh-order accuracy of the RBF-FD method. The high-order accuracy and\nrobustness of two formulations of this approach are illustrated by numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
