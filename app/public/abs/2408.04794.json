The kernel of such an\noperator takes values in the ideal of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on $H$. We\nestablish regularity conditions on the kernel under which the associated\nintegral operator is trace class. First, we extend Mercer's theorem to\noperator-valued kernels by proving that a continuous, nonnegative-definite,\nHermitian symmetric kernel defines a trace class integral operator on\n$L^2(X;H)$ under an additional assumption. Second, we show that a general\noperator-valued kernel that is defined on a compact set and that is H\\\"older\ncontinuous with H\\\"older exponent greater than a half is trace class provided\nthat the operator-valued kernel is essentially bounded as a mapping into the\nspace of trace class operators on $H$. Finally, when $\\dim H < \\infty$, we show\nthat an analogous result also holds for matrix-valued kernels on the real line,\nprovided that an additional exponential decay assumption holds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
