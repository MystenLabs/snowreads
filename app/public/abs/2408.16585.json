It turns out that a\ncertain randomized initial condition is the most amenable to such an analysis.\nOur main result is the behavior of such an ASEP in the KPZ limit regime. A key\ntechnical tool introduced in the paper -- the coloring of ASEP particles with\nthe use of random Mallows permutations -- may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
