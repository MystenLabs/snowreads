We test those models\nover 11 synthetic datasets drawn from different distributions of 200M 64-bit\nfloating-point items, so deriving hints about their ultimate performance and\nusefulness in designing a sorting algorithm.\n  Based on these findings, we select and plug the best models from above in a\nnew learned-based algorithmic scheme and devise three new sorters that we will\ntest against other 6 sequential sorters (5 classic and 1 learned, known and new\nones) over 33 datasets (11 synthetic and 22 real), whose size will be up to\n800M items. Our experimental figures will show that our learned sorters achieve\nsuperior performance on 31 out of all 33 datasets (synthetic and real). In\nconclusion, these experimental results provide, on the one hand, a\ncomprehensive answer to the main question: Which algorithmic structure for\ndistribution-based sorting is suited to leverage a learned model in order to\nachieve efficient performance? and, on the other hand, they leave open several\nother research and engineering questions about the design of a highly\nperforming sequential sorter that is robust over different input distributions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
