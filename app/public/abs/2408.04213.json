The methods that have been\nproposed in literature usually assume that the underlying structure is a known\nmodel. In practice, however, the true model is usually unknown, and network\nlearning procedures based on these methods may suffer from model\nmisspecification. To handle this issue, based on the random matrix theory, we\nfirst give a spectral property of the normalized adjacency matrix under a mild\ncondition. Further, we establish a general goodness-of-fit test procedure for\nthe unweight and undirected network. We prove that the null distribution of the\nproposed statistic converges in distribution to the standard normal\ndistribution. Theoretically, this testing procedure is suitable for nearly all\npopular network models, such as stochastic block models, and latent space\nmodels. Further, we apply the proposed method to the degree-corrected mixed\nmembership model and give a sequential estimator of the number of communities.\nBoth simulation studies and real-world data examples indicate that the proposed\nmethod works well.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
