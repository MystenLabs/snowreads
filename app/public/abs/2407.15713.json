In\nthese coupled systems, we enforce non-negativity of the solutions, aligning\nwith realistic scenarios in biology and ecology. There are several salient\nfeatures of our inverse problem study: the drastic reduction in\nmeasurement/observation data due to averaging effects, the nonlinear coupling\nbetween multiple equations, and the nonlocality arising from fractional-type\nderivatives. These factors present significant challenges to our inverse\nproblem, and such inverse problems have never been explored in previous\nliterature. To address these challenges, we develop new and effective schemes.\nOur approach involves properly controlling the injection of different source\nterms to obtain multiple sets of mean flux data. This allows us to achieve\nunique identifiability results and accurately determine the unknown parameters.\nFinally, we establish a connection between our study and practical applications\nin biology, further highlighting the relevance of our work in real-world\ncontexts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
