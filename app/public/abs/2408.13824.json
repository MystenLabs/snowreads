The reason behind this is that the properties of blood flow\nseem \\`a priori non universal as they depend on various factors such as global\nconcentration of red blood cells (RBCs) and channel width. Here, we have\ndiscovered a universal law when the stress and strain rate are measured at a\ngiven local RBCs concentration. However, the local concentration must be\ndetermined in order to close the problem. We propose a non-local diffusion\nequation of RBCs concentration that agrees with the full simulation. The\nuniversal law is exemplified for both shear and pressure driven flows. While\nthe theory is restricted to a simplistic geometry (straight channel) it\nprovides a fundamental basis for future research on blood flow dynamics and\ncould lead to the development of a new theory that accurately describes blood\nflow properties under various conditions, such as in complex vascular networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
