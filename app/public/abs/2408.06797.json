Sleeping Beauty is put asleep, and a coin is tossed. If the\noutcome of the coin toss is Tails, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday, put\nasleep again and woken up again on Tuesday (with no recollection of having\nwoken up on Monday). If the outcome is Heads, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on\nMonday only. Each time Sleeping Beauty is woken up, she is asked what her\nbelief is that the outcome was Heads. What should Sleeping Beauty reply? In\nliterature arguments have been given for both 1/3 and 1/2 as the correct\nanswer. In this short note we argue using simple Bayesian probability theory\nwhy 1/3 is the right answer, and not 1/2. Briefly, when Sleeping Beauty\nawakens, her being awake is nontrivial extra information that leads her to\nupdate her beliefs about Heads to 1/3. We strengthen our claim by considering\nan additional observer, Prince Probability, who may or may not meet Sleeping\nBeauty. If he meets Sleeping Beauty while she is awake, he lowers his credence\nin Heads to 1/3. We also briefly consider the credence in Heads of a Sleeping\nBeauty who knows that she is dreaming (and thus asleep).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
