Data for the parent compound ($x = 0$) indicates that the\nelectronic gap opens in predominantly oxygen-derived states strongly coupled to\na long-range ordered breathing distortion of the oxygen sublattice. Upon\ndoping, short-range breathing distortions and sizable ($e$-ph) coupling persist\ninto the superconducting regime ($x = 0.4$). Comparisons with exact\ndiagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations further\nsupport this conclusion. Our results provide compelling evidence that BKBO's\nmetallic phase hosts a liquid of small (bi)polarons derived from local\nbreathing distortions of the lattice, with implications for understanding the\nlow-temperature superconducting instability\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
