In this study, we demonstrate\nthe application of operator techniques to an electromagnetic field\ncharacterized by the function $f(x + ay)$, leveraging the structural analogies\nbetween these equations. Specifically, we employ initial conditions defined by\nAiry and Bessel functions to illustrate the practical implementation of these\ntechniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xWcotChozeNnv32APpp2mU1jj94TRw_s2xSG4w6Qw8w","pdfSize":"876877"}
