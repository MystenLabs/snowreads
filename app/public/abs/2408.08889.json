The approach includes temporal\nmarkers - coinciding with Samn-Perelli (SP) and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale\n(KSS) responses - where SAFTE-FAST model outcomes are calculated. The model\nresults follow the increase of fatigue and sleepiness perceptions during the\ndawn (0h00 to 05h59), but underestimate the self-rated scores during the\nevening (18h00 to 23h59). On the other hand, the KSS scores fit the relative\nrisk of pilot errors, representing a reasonable proxy for risk assessment.\nLinear relationships obtained between workload metrics, computed within\n168-hours prior to the responses, and self-rated SP and KSS scores provide a\nconsistent method to estimate accumulated fatigue and sleepiness. Considering\n7149 rosters of 2023, the duty time ($DT$), the number of flight sectors\n($N_{CREW}$) and the sum of flight sectors with sit periods longer than one\nhour ($N_{CREW}+N_{SIT}$) are associated with 70.1%/60.6% of the highest\npredicted scores of SP/KSS. Applying the mitigations $DT\\leq44h$,\n$N_{CREW}\\leq15$ and $N_{CREW}+N_{SIT}\\leq19$ for every 168-hour interval\nyields a significant decrease in the higher values of SP/KSS with minimal\nimpact on aircrew productivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QvhhF1bmmL-nT-r-esemk2eN1XPD5nNFQc8abj9yrx8","pdfSize":"434060"}
