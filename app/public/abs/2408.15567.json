For careful background estimation, we simultaneously fitted spectra\nextracted from the SNR and background regions and evaluated the SNR emission\ncontaminating the background-region spectrum as well as the background emission\nin the source-region spectrum. The SNR emission is explained by the collisional\nionization equilibrium plasma originating from the interstellar medium and the\nionizing plasma originating from the ejecta, in contrast to the previous\nstudies. In addition, we found an unidentified X-ray source near the SNR,\nSuzaku J1937.4+1718, which is accompanied by an emission line at ~4.4~keV with\nthe 2.8$\\sigma$ confidence level. Since there is no striking atomic line at the\nenergy in the rest frame, Suzaku J1937.4+1718 can be an extragalactic object\nwith a redshifted Fe line.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p7wxu8JNCceS02bOQSMrDN1GZouIBc13WuMUdF7cQtg","pdfSize":"852696"}
