The\noptical/near-infrared counterparts of the X-ray sources are taken from our\nHyper Suprime Cam (HSC)/Subaru and Wide-Field InfraRed Camera\n(WIRCam)/Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) data because these have much\nmore accurate source positions due to their spatial resolution than that of\n{Chandra} and longer wavelength infrared data. We concentrate our\nidentifications in the HSC $g$ band and WIRCam $K_{\\rm s}$ band-based catalogs.\nTo select the best counterpart, we utilize a novel extension of the\nlikelihood-ratio (LR) analysis, where we use the X-ray flux as well as $g -\nK_{\\rm s}$ colors to calculate the likelihood ratio. Spectroscopic and\nphotometric redshifts of the counterparts are summarized. Also, simple X-ray\nspectroscopy is made on the sources with sufficient source counts.\n  We present the resulting catalog in an electronic form. The main ID catalog\ncontains 403 X-ray sources and includes X-ray fluxes, luminosities, $g$ and\n$K_{\\rm s}$ band magnitudes, redshifts, and their sources, optical\nspectroscopic properties, as well as intrinsic absorption column densities and\npower-law indices from simple X-ray spectroscopy. The identified X-ray sources\ninclude 27 Milky-Way objects, 57 type I AGNs, 131 other AGNs, and 15 galaxies.\nThe catalog serves as a basis for further investigations of the properties of\nthe X-ray and near-infrared sources in this field.
