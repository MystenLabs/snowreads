Here I describe an alternative formulation of partons in terms of\nequal-time (or Euclidean) correlators, which allows to compute\nprecision-controlled $x$-distribution through lattice QCD simulations. This\napproach is in accord with Weinberg's pioneering idea of effective field theory\nas well as Wilson's renormalization group, in which the large hadron momentum\nserves as a natural cut-off for light-cone/rapidity divergences and can\nultimately be eliminated through a method like the ``perfect action'' program\nin lattice QCD.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
