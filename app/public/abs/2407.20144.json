However, the spectrum is extremely\nsensitive to small disturbances of the system, thus potentially jeopardizing\nthe predictions of the gravitational wave observables. We offer an analytical\nand intuitive explanation of such an instability and its properties based on\nthe transfer matrix approach of quantum mechanics. We also give a simple\ninterpretation of the fact that the prompt ringdown response in the time domain\nand the black hole greybody factor receive parametrically small corrections,\nthus being robust observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0ARGSTJe2UWhKnA0_YFF11m5O0FmfmXXpKLQQkwNEEc","pdfSize":"557611","objectId":"0xace68348a024ce072d46624e6fcc05ffdbad148471f5975b0f5ed65f0254b093","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
