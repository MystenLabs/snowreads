{"id":"2408.10544","title":"A dynamical systems perspective on the celestial mechanical contribution\n  to the emergence of life","authors":"Fan Zhang","authorsParsed":[["Zhang","Fan",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 04:55:33 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-21","timestamp":1724129733000,"abstract":"  Biological activities are often seen entrained onto the day-night and other\ncelestial mechanical cycles (e.g., seasonal and lunar), but studies on the\norigin of life have largely not accounted for such periodic external\nenvironmental variations. We argue that this may be an important omission,\nbecause the signature replication behaviour of life represents temporal memory\nin the dynamics of ecosystems, that signifies the absence of mixing properties\n(i.e., the dynamics are not fully chaotic), and entrainment onto regular,\nperiodic external perturbative influences has been proven capable of\nsuppressing chaos, and thus may bring otherwise unstable chemical reaction sets\ninto viability, as precursors to abiogenesis. As well, external perturbations\nmay be necessary to prevent an open dissipative (bio)chemical system from\ncollapsing into the opposite extreme -- the point attractor of thermal\nequilibrium. In short, life may precariously rest on the edge of chaos, and\nopen-loop periodic perturbation rooted in celestial mechanics (and should be\nsimulated in laboratory experiments in origin-of-life studies) may help with\nthe balancing. Such considerations, if pertinent, would also be consequential\nto exobiology, e.g., in regard to tidal-locking properties of potential host\nworlds.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
