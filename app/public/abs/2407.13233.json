We outline the formalism for the\nbrick wall model in arbitrary number of dimensions and generalize it to include\nboth charged spacetimes and charged probes in order to systematically show how\nto calculate the entropy for any black hole, in higher orders of the WKB\napproximation. We calculate the entropy for the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m and\ncharged BTZ black holes, and by looking at the chargeless limits we recover the\nentropy of the Schwarzschild and neutral BTZ black holes. We also study\nnoncommutative corrections to the black hole entropy by using a Drinfeld twist\nto deform spacetime symmetries. Using the noncommutative action for a charged\nscalar field, we derive the noncommutative Klein-Gordon equation and the radial\nequation in arbitrary dimension on which we generalize the brick wall method.\nWe study case by case the noncommutative Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m and\nnoncommutative charged BTZ black holes, the entropy of which we calculate using\nthe generalized brick wall method. Corrections due to higher order in the WKB\napproximation arise, and they are given by the logarithms of the black hole\narea. The corrections in the lowest order of WKB due to noncommutativity are\nalso given by the logarithms of the black hole area.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
