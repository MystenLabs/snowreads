Challenges associated to\nthese tasks have created an interest in autonomous planning, navigation, and\ntracking technologies that operate with little ground-based intervention. This\nresearch introduces a trajectory planning tool for a low-thrust mobile\nobserver, aimed at maximizing navigation and tracking performance with\nsatellite-to-satellite relative measurements. We formulate an expression for\nthe information gathered over an observation period based on the mutual\ninformation between augmented observer/target states and the associated\nmeasurement set collected. We then develop an optimal trajectory design problem\nfor a mobile observer, balancing information gain and control effort, and solve\nthis problem with a Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach. The developed\nmethods are demonstrated in scenarios involving spacecraft in the cislunar\nregime, demonstrating the potential for improved autonomous navigation and\ntracking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
