This work builds on previous\nnetwork-flow-based charge scheduling approaches and includes both consumption\nand demand time-of-use costs while accounting for uncontrolled loads on the\nsame meter. Additionally, a variable-rate, non-linear partial charging model\ncompatible with the mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is developed for\nincreased charging fidelity. To respond to feedback in an uncertain\nenvironment, the resulting MILP is adapted to a hierarchical receding horizon\nplanner that utilizes a static plan for the day as a reference to follow while\nreacting to stochasticity on a regular basis. This receding horizon planner is\nanalyzed with Monte-Carlo techniques alongside two other possible planning\nmethods. It is found to provide up to 52\\% cost savings compared to a\nnon-time-of-use aware method and significant robustness benefits compared to an\noptimal open-loop method.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
