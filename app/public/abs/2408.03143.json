Current approaches frequently fail to\nfulfil the extensive demands of these industries, which encompass high\nperformance, consistency, and fast operation, along with the capacity to\nleverage the entirety of the available training data. Addressing these gaps, we\nintroduce SuperSimpleNet, an innovative discriminative model that evolved from\nSimpleNet. This advanced model significantly enhances its predecessor's\ntraining consistency, inference time, as well as detection performance.\nSuperSimpleNet operates in an unsupervised manner using only normal training\nimages but also benefits from labelled abnormal training images when they are\navailable. SuperSimpleNet achieves state-of-the-art results in both the\nsupervised and the unsupervised settings, as demonstrated by experiments across\nfour challenging benchmark datasets.
