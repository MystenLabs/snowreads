We argue that a\nnatural object to describe this state is the Wigner distribution, which is a\nfunction on a classical phase space obtained by a certain integral transform of\nthe density matrix. We work with Lorentzian de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity\nin which we find semiclassical saddle-points for pure gravity, as well as when\nwe include matter components such as a CFT and a classical inflaton field. We\nalso discuss different choices of fixing time reparametrizations. In the regime\nof large universes our connected geometry dominates over the Hartle-Hawking\nsaddle and gives a distribution that has a meaningful probabilistic\ninterpretation for local observables. It does not, however, give a normalizable\nprobability measure on the entire phase space of the theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
