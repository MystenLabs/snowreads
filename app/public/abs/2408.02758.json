In this report, we study the\nimplementation of a fluid dynamics application, the Finite-Time Lyapunov\nExponent (FTLE) calculation, on FPGA using HLS. We provide speed and\nresource-consumption results for 2- and 3-dimensional cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nRWuIOdBt5pv061aVc0SSxX625bHtmYjHuXSKbKlqBI","pdfSize":"131891","txDigest":"62GKE8j6wWJJXfSKeuUDCA7RokBKuTgUJgv2tdBEEmTM","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
