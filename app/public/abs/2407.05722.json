The\ntransverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) dependence of identified hadron $v_2$ in\ndifferent centrality intervals (0-10%, 10-40%, and 40-80%) are shown. A clear\ncentrality dependence of $v_2(p_\\mathrm{T})$ is observed for particles at\n$E_{lab} = $ 25 and 11 A GeV, while the centrality dependence becomes weaker\nfor particles at $E_{lab} = $ 8 and 6.7 A GeV. Within the PHSD model, the\nnumber of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_2$ approximately follows in\nAu+Au collisions at all beam energies. A collision energy ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$)\ndependence of $\\pi$, $K$, and $p$ $v_2$ is studied in comparison with available\npublished experimental data in the beam energy range of 6-25 A GeV. These\npredictions will help in interpreting the data from the forthcoming Compressed\nBaryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion\nResearch (FAIR) and Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD) at the Nuclotron-based Ion\nCollider facility (NICA).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
