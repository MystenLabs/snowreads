By using\nnumerical simulations of a continuum model, we study the dynamics of two\nantagonistic strains that are dispersed by incompressible turbulent flows in\ntwo spatial dimensions. A key parameter is the ratio of the fluid transport\ntime to that of biological reproduction, which determines the winning strain\nthat ultimately takes over the whole population from an initial heterogeneous\nstate. By quantifying the probability and mean time for fixation along with the\nspatial structure of concentration fluctuations, we demonstrate how turbulence\nraises the threshold for biological nucleation and antagonism suppresses\nflow-induced mixing by depleting the population at interfaces. Our work\nhighlights the unusual biological consequences of the interplay of turbulent\nfluid flows with antagonistic population dynamics, with potential implications\nfor marine microbial ecology and origins of biological chirality.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
