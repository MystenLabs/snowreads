This paper introduces and analyzes a\nnovel meal delivery strategy that incorporates a microhub. In this approach,\nthe service area is segmented into smaller sub-areas, with deliverers assigned\nto operate exclusively within these sub-areas. The microhub functions as a\ntransfer depot, enabling the batching and transfer of orders toward different\nsub-areas. To evaluate this system's performance, two critical metrics --\ncustomer waiting time and vehicle miles traveled -- are estimated through the\ncontinuous approximation approach. Comprehensive numerical experiments are\nconducted to validate the accuracy of our approximations. The derived\nanalytical approximation is then integrated into an optimal design problem to\ndetermine the optimal number of sub-areas and the optimal batch size of\npackages within each sub-area. The numerical results suggest that the meal\ndelivery system with a microhub outperforms the traditional pickup and delivery\nmode in both metrics, under either high demand or low supply conditions. The\nhigher efficiency of the microhub design is attributed to the strategy of\nsub-regional batching, facilitated by the use of the microhub.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
