As main result, we prove a lower\nbound, in terms of the quantum Renyi information in Petz's form, for the\nreliability function. This resolves Holevo's conjecture proposed in 2000, a\nlong-standing open problem in quantum information theory. It turns out that the\nobtained lower bound matches the upper bound derived by Dalai in 2013, when the\ncommunication rate is above a critical value. Thus we have determined the\nreliability function in this high-rate case. Our approach relies on Renes'\nbreakthrough made in 2022, which relates classical-quantum channel coding to\nthat of privacy amplification, as well as our new characterization of the\nchannel Renyi information.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GobYLAWgCPstoaEnsg-9jVafr_1M1QzCGz9ZQtiqLR4","pdfSize":"177368"}
