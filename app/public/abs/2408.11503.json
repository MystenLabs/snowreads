Here, modelling linear homopolymers in\nsolution as Brownian or fractional processes, we develop a formalism to take\ninto account both the interactions of the polymer with the solvent as well as\nthe effect of arbitrary polymer-polymer potentials and Gibbs factors. As an\nexample the average squared length is computed for a non-trivial Gaussian Gibbs\nfactor, which is also compared with the Edwards' and a step factor.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
