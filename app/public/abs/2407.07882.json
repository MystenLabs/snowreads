Previous understanding of this\nmechanism has focused on evaluating the performance of error correction\nalgorithms based on measurement results. In this work, we instead intrinsically\ncharacterize the information dynamics in a quantum memory under repeated\nmeasurements, using coherent information and relative entropy. We consider the\ndynamics of a $d$-dimensional stabilizer code subject to Pauli errors and noisy\nstabilizer measurements and develop a $(d+1)$-dimensional statistical mechanics\nmodel for the information-theoretic diagnostics. Our model is dual to the model\npreviously obtained for the optimal decoding algorithm, and the potential\ndecoding transition in the quantum memory again manifests as a thermal phase\ntransition in the statistical mechanics model. We explicitly derive the model\nand study the phase transition in information encoding in three examples:\nsurface codes, repetition codes, and the XZZX code.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
