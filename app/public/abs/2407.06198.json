Also the underlying interplay between the discrete and continuous\nsettings arising from discretization is highlighted. Additionally, localization\nresults that set bounds to the estimated influence of the personalization\nvector on the ranking of a particular node are given. The theoretical results\nare illustrated by means of some real and synthetic examples.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x9yPG8it4fDsjcfwfQAHNO363AyllPWmgXla3L_ier8","pdfSize":"514162"}
