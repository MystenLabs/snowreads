This article\ntakes an in-depth look at the application of cloud computing technology in\nindustrial big data processing and explores its potential impact on improving\ndata processing efficiency, security, and cost-effectiveness. The article first\nreviews the basic principles and key characteristics of cloud computing\ntechnology, and then analyzes the characteristics and processing requirements\nof industrial big data. In particular, this study focuses on the application of\ncloud computing in real-time data processing, predictive maintenance, and\noptimization, and demonstrates its practical effects through case studies. At\nthe same time, this article also discusses the main challenges encountered\nduring the implementation process, such as data security, privacy protection,\nperformance and scalability issues, and proposes corresponding solution\nstrategies. Finally, this article looks forward to the future trends of the\nintegration of cloud computing and industrial big data, as well as the\napplication prospects of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence\nand machine learning in this field. The results of this study not only provide\npractical guidance for cloud computing applications in the industry, but also\nprovide a basis for further research in academia.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
