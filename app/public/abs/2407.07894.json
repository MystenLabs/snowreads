Here, we unravel that the quantum metric causes the\nmany-body Chern number of the FCI states to deviate sharply from the expected\nvalue associated with partial filling of the single-particle topological\nflatband. Furthermore, the variation of the quantum metric in momentum space\ninduces band dispersion through interactions, affecting the stability of the\nFCI states. This causes a reentrant transition into the Fermi liquid from the\nFCI phase as the interaction strength increases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
