Loop closures correct drifts in trajectory\nestimation to build a globally consistent map. However, a false loop closure\ncan be fatal, so verification is required as an additional step to ensure\nrobustness by rejecting the false positive loops. Geometric verification has\nbeen a well-acknowledged solution that leverages spatial clues provided by\nlocal feature matching to find true positives. Existing feature matching\nmethods focus on homography and pose estimation in long-term visual\nlocalization, lacking references for geometric verification. To fill the gap,\nthis paper proposes a unified benchmark targeting geometric verification of\nloop closure detection under long-term conditional variations. Furthermore, we\nevaluate six representative local feature matching methods (handcrafted and\nlearning-based) under the benchmark, with in-depth analysis for limitations and\nfuture directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
