Our self-consistent formulation for this\nthree-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called\nzero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the\ncoherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally,\nwe show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper\npairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in\nthe dilute flat-band limit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
