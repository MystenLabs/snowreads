In the literature, ECG, actigraphy, speech, voice,\nand facial analysis have proven effective at detecting patients' emotions. On\nthe other hand, these tools are invasive and do not integrate smoothly into the\npatient's daily life. HRV has also been proven to effectively indicate stress\nconditions, especially in combination with other signals. However, when HRV is\nderived from less invasive devices than the ECG, like smartwatches and\nbracelets, the quality of measurements significantly degrades. This paper\npresents a methodology for stress detection from a smartwatch based on a\nuniversal model for time series, UniTS, which we fine-tuned for the task. We\ncast the problem as anomaly detection rather than classification to favor model\nadaptation to individual patients and allow the clinician to maintain greater\ncontrol over the system's predictions. We demonstrate that our proposed model\nconsiderably surpasses 12 top-performing methods on 3 benchmark datasets.\nFurthermore, unlike other state-of-the-art systems, UniTS enables seamless\nmonitoring, as it shows comparable performance when using signals from invasive\nor lightweight devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hI5Whz0vNaVg5s9QoQJqJF4yvrO1Z490eQ1-rm3oo9I","pdfSize":"7334362"}
