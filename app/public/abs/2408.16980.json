These arise as the\ncohomology of $\\text{v}_2$ self maps $\\Sigma^7 Z \\longrightarrow Z$, as in\narXiv:1608.06250 [math.AT]. There are $256$ $\\mathbb{F}_2$ points in this\nvariety, arising from $16$ such actions of $Sq^8$ and, for each such, $16$\nactions of $Sq^{16}$. We describe in similar fashion the 1600 $\\mathcal{A}$\nactions on $\\mathcal{A}(2)$ found by Roth(1977) and the inclusion of the\nvariety of symmetric actions into the variety of all actions. We also describe\ntwo related varieties of $\\mathcal{A}$ actions, the maps between these and the\nbehavior of Spanier-Whitehead duality on these varieties. Finally, we note that\nthe actions which have been used in the literature correspond to the simplest\nchoices, in which all the coordinates equal zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fc3zrscN2QktGpKGC1OPEIV9TsWqTrUoc2tU9n39jLk","pdfSize":"437778"}
