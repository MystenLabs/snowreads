At each iteration, a block of variables is selected by means of a\ngreedy (Gauss-Southwell) rule which considers the amount of first-order\nstationarity violation, then an approximate minimizer of a cubic model is\ncomputed for the block update. In the proposed scheme, blocks are not required\nto have a prefixed structure and their size is allowed to change during the\niterations. For non-convex objective functions, global convergence to\nstationary points is proved and a worst-case iteration complexity analysis is\nprovided. In particular, given a tolerance $\\varepsilon$, we show that at most\n${\\cal O}(\\varepsilon^{-3/2})$ iterations are needed to drive the stationarity\nviolation with respect to the selected block of variables below $\\varepsilon$,\nwhile at most ${\\cal O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations are needed to drive the\nstationarity violation with respect to all variables below $\\varepsilon$.\nNumerical results are finally provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
