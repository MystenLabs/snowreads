In\nthis paper, we describe the current state of establishing an open LLM\ninfrastructure at FernUniversit\\\"at in Hagen under the project name FLEXI\n(FernUni LLM Experimental Infrastructure). FLEXI enables experimentation within\nteaching and research with the goal of generating strongly needed evidence in\nfavor (or against) the use of locally maintained open LLMs in higher education.\nThe paper will provide some practical guidance for everyone trying to decide\nwhether to run their own LLM server.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
