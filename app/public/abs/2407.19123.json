The freedom that remains unstudied in the\ndesign of coils is enormous. This freedom could be quickly studied\ncomputationally at low cost with high reliability. In particular, the space\nbetween toroidal field or modular coils that block access to the plasma chamber\ncould be increased by a large factor. The concept of current-potential patches,\nwhich was developed in Todd Elder's thesis, provides a method for separating\nthe study of the feasibility of coils with attractive physics properties from\nthe engineering design of specific coils.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
