The primary objective of the\npaper is to study the decay estimate for a class of dispersive semigroup given\nby $e^{it\\phi(\\mathcal{L})}$. Inspired by earlier work of Guo-Peng-Wang\n\\cite{GPW2008} in the Euclidean space and Song-Yang \\cite{SY2023} on the\nHeisenberg group, we overcome the difficulty arising from the\nnon-homogeneousness of $\\phi$ by frequency localization, which is based on the\nnon-commutative Fourier transform on H-type groups, the properties of the\nLaguerre functions and Bessel functions, and the stationary phase theorem.\nFinally, as applications, we derive the new Strichartz inequalities for the\nsolutions of some specific equations, such as the fractional Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation, the fourth-order Schr\\\"odinger equation, the beam equation and the\nKlein-Gordon equation, which corresponds to $\\phi(r)=r^\\alpha$,\n$r^2+r,\\sqrt{1+r^2},\\sqrt{1+r}$, respectively. Moreover, we also prove that the\ntime decay is sharp in these cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
