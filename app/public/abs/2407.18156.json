For\ntheoretical analysis the mean-field (MF) ansatz is routinely applied. However,\nbesides special cases of all-to-all or strong long range interactions, the MF\nansatz provides only approximate results. Here we present a systematic\ncorrection to MF theory based on diagrammatic perturbation theory for quantum\nspin correlators in thermal equilibrium. Our analytic results are universally\napplicable for any lattice geometry and spin-length S. We provide pre-computed\nand easy-to-use building blocks for Ising, Heisenberg and transverse field\nIsing models in the symmetry-unbroken regime. We showcase the quality and\nsimplicity of the method by computing magnetic phase boundaries and excitations\ngaps. We also treat the Dicke-Ising model of ground-state superradiance where\nwe show that corrections to the MF phase boundary vanish.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fPsPaLocJV2hboTZJzhSidqJiiDOdVlRLQ860Ujsw9I","pdfSize":"817933","objectId":"0xe8d4057372879447a0a4b531cf21f319b9468fcaf150ebe971ba076e439aefb7","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
