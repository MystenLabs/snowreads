Previous benchmarking work has demonstrated it to be\nhighly accurate for modeling dynamics in one-dimensional analytical models, but\nnonadiabatic dynamics often involves conical intersections, which are\ninherently two-dimensional. In this report, we assess the performance of TAB on\ntwo-dimensional models of cascades of conical intersections in dense manifolds\nof states. Several variants of TAB are considered, including TAB-w, which is\nbased on the assumption of a Gaussian rather than exponential decay of the\ncoherence, and TAB-DMS, which incorporates an efficient collapse procedure\nbased on approximate eigenstates. Upon comparison to numerically exact quantum\ndynamics simulations, it is found that all TAB variants provide a suitable\ndescription of the dynamical passage through a cascade of conical\nintersections. The TAB-w approach is found to provide a somewhat more accurate\ndescription of population dynamics than the original TAB method, with final\nabsolute population errors $\\leq$0.013 in all cases. Even when only four\napproximate eigenstates are computed, the use of approximate eigenstates was\nfound to introduce minimal additional error (absolute population error\n$\\leq$0.018 in all models).\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
