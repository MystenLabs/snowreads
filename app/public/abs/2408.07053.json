Two primary features of this code are the\nimprovement in performance compared to existing tools, and higher levels of\naccuracy when determining radio synchrotron emission associated with WIMP\nannihilations, both of which are enabled by the employment of a set of modern\nand novel numerical techniques. The code also includes functionality for a\nmulti-wavelength set of output products including gamma-ray, radio and neutrino\nfluxes which can be saved in common formats used by the astronomical community,\nsuch as the FITS data file format. The calculations may be tailored to work\nwith a wide range of astrophysical target structures, from dwarf galaxies to\ngalaxy clusters, and the configuration of the underlying calculations is\nmanaged by a set of key-value dictionary entries that are easy to understand\nand use. The code base is publicly accessible through an online repository with\na permissive MIT source code licence.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
