Then we use the Planck data to find constraints on the\nparameter spaces as dark matter cross sections and the five dimentional Planck\nmass for brane cosmology, enhancement factor for kination model and the\ninverse-scaled shear temperature for shear dominated universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
