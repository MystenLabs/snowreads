We study\nthe properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that\nthe photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios:\nin high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle\ncarries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\\mathrm{i}\n\\epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its\nutility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged\nfields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of\nrelaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show\ngenerally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the\nchemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The\n$\\mathrm{i} \\epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes\nand the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on\nsome related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
