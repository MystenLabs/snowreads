However, their\ntypically limited or one-size-fits-all support for advanced data flow patterns\nleaves optimization to the application programmer -- optimization that becomes\nmore difficult as data become larger. The transparent object proxy, which\nprovides wide-area references that can resolve to data regardless of location,\nhas been demonstrated as an effective low-level building block in such\nsituations. Here we propose three high-level proxy-based programming patterns\n-- distributed futures, streaming, and ownership -- that make the power of the\nproxy pattern usable for more complex and dynamic distributed program\nstructures. We motivate these patterns via careful review of application\nrequirements and describe implementations of each pattern. We evaluate our\nimplementations through a suite of benchmarks and by applying them in three\nsubstantial scientific applications, in which we demonstrate substantial\nimprovements in runtime, throughput, and memory usage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
