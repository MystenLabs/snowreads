Here we employ a combination of broadband infrared (IR)\nreflectivity and THz-pump/IR-probe measurements to investigate the relationship\nbetween localized defect states and delocalized conducting polaronic states. We\nshow that the THz pump allows to convert deeply localized electrons into\nmetastable polarons with a lifetime in the ns range. These long-lived\nmetastable states may find application in novel opto-electronic applications\nexploiting the interplay of dc resistivity, with terahertz and infrared\nsignals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
