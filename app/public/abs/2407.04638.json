Annotating\nthree-dimensional medical images is a time-consuming and costly process. To\novercome this limitation, we propose a novel semi-supervised segmentation\nmethod that leverages mostly unlabeled images and a small set of labeled images\nin training. Our approach involves assessing prediction uncertainty to identify\nreliable predictions on unlabeled voxels from the teacher model. These voxels\nserve as pseudo-labels for training the student model. In voxels where the\nteacher model produces unreliable predictions, pseudo-labeling is carried out\nbased on voxel-wise embedding correspondence using reference voxels from\nlabeled images. We applied this method to automate hip bone segmentation in CT\nimages, achieving notable results with just 4 CT scans. The proposed approach\nyielded a Hausdorff distance with 95th percentile (HD95) of 3.30 and IoU of\n0.929, surpassing existing methods achieving HD95 (4.07) and IoU (0.927) at\ntheir best.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"36AFIPMUEcIUKHWxwR2fZINLD7mcYlqTjbs9uT7Yyiw","pdfSize":"2837500"}
