Here, we study the spectral content of radio signals produced by\ninclined showers, with a focus on the 30-80 MHz frequency band, as measured,\nfor example, by the antennas of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Two exponential\nmodels are investigated and used to describe the spectral shape of the\nGeomagnetic and Charge-excess components of the pulses. The spectral fitting\nprocedure of the models is described in detail. For both components, a\nparameterization of the frequency slope as a function of the lateral distance\nto the shower axis and the geometrical distance between core and shower maximum\nis derived. For the Geomagnetic component, a quadratic correction to the\nfrequency slope is needed to better describe the spectrum, and it has been\nparameterized, too. These pieces of information can be employed in event\nreconstruction to constrain the geometry, in particular the core position.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
