In\naddition, existing work has not effectively utilized trigger word information\nexplicitly. Hence, we propose MLSL, a method based on multi-layer sequence\nlabeling for joint biomedical event extraction. MLSL does not introduce prior\nknowledge and complex structures. Moreover, it explicitly incorporates the\ninformation of candidate trigger words into the sequence labeling to learn the\ninteraction relationships between trigger words and argument roles. Based on\nthis, MLSL can learn well with just a simple workflow. Extensive\nexperimentation demonstrates the superiority of MLSL in terms of extraction\nperformance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
