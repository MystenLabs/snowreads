We study the effect of bulk matter\ndeformations (both marginal and relevant) on a wide range of boundary\nconditions in a number of CFTs up to subleading (two-loop) order in\nperturbation theory. In all analyzed examples, we find that the shift in the\n$g$-function of the matter boundary state is always accompanied by a\nboundary-independent shift in the string coupling constant, whose leading\nbehaviour is universally proportional to the sphere two-point function of the\ndeforming bulk operator.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
