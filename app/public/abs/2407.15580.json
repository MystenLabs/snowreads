MCL is a learning framework handling ambiguous\ntasks by predicting a small set of plausible hypotheses. These hypotheses are\ntrained using the Winner-takes-all (WTA) scheme, which promotes the diversity\nof the predictions. However, this scheme may converge toward an arbitrarily\nsuboptimal local minimum, due to the greedy nature of WTA. We overcome this\nlimitation using annealing, which enhances the exploration of the hypothesis\nspace during training. We leverage insights from statistical physics and\ninformation theory to provide a detailed description of the model training\ntrajectory. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by extensive experiments on\nsynthetic datasets, on the standard UCI benchmark, and on speech separation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4aQcMAutHqmrNFqpG9W3QPa8BluqjJFZLEc3k03vDkE","pdfSize":"1740577"}
