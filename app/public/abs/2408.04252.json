The experiments have been performed with the beam from the\nelectron linear accelerator LINAC-200 using the activation and off-line\n{\\gamma}-ray spectrometric technique. The bremsstrahlung photon flux has been\ncalculated with the Geant4 program. The cross sections were calculated by using\ncomputer code TALYS-1.96 with different models and are found to be in good\nagreement with the experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"zdeeuhELWYWALDxeVOJVBW1W1oZJqugJjaahB57XdvQ","pdfSize":"1344571"}
