TAMP solvers typically require exponentially longer planning time as\nthe planning horizon and the number of environmental objects increase. To\naddress this challenge, we first propose Learn2Decompose, a Learning from\nDemonstrations (LfD) approach that learns embedding task rules from\ndemonstrations and decomposes the long-horizon problem into several\nsubproblems. These subproblems require planning over shorter horizons with\nfewer objects and can be solved in parallel. We then design a parallelized\nhierarchical TAMP framework that concurrently solves the subproblems and\nconcatenates the resulting subplans for the target task, significantly\nimproving the planning efficiency of classical TAMP solvers. The effectiveness\nof our proposed methods is validated in both simulation and real-world\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
