We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for small\nhypergraph count to be asymptotically normal, and complement them with\nconvergence rate in both the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances. Next we\nnarrow our attention to the homogeneous model and relate the obtained results\nto the fourth moment phenomenon. Additionally, a short proof of necessity of\naforementioned conditions is presented, which seems to be absent in the\nliterature even in the context of the model $\\mathbb G(n, p)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
