However, generating\nrealistic vessel graphs that correspond to an anatomy of interest is\nchallenging. Previous methods aimed at generating vessel trees mostly in an\nautoregressive style and could not be applied to vessel graphs with cycles such\nas capillaries or specific anatomical structures such as the Circle of Willis.\nAddressing this gap, we introduce the first application of \\textit{denoising\ndiffusion models} in 3D vessel graph generation. Our contributions include a\nnovel, two-stage generation method that sequentially denoises node coordinates\nand edges. We experiment with two real-world vessel datasets, consisting of\nmicroscopic capillaries and major cerebral vessels, and demonstrate the\ngeneralizability of our method for producing diverse, novel, and anatomically\nplausible vessel graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nbbPZkVNYeWcKejjxofjQQEQGyfd3ry-WNInwZ6l41Y","pdfSize":"8986914"}
