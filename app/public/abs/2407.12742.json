The problem considers the feasibility of placing $n$\nmutually non-attacking queens on the reflecting chessboard, an $n\\times n$\nchessboard with a $1\\times n$ \"reflecting strip\" of squares added along one\nside of the board. A queen placed on the reflecting chessboard can attack the\nsquares in the same row, column, and diagonal, with the additional feature that\nits diagonal path can be reflected via the reflecting strip. Klarner noted the\nequivalence of this problem to a number theory problem proposed by Slater,\nwhich asks: for which $n$ is it possible to pair up the integers 1 through $n$\nwith the integers $n+1$ through $2n$ such that no two of the sums or\ndifferences of the $n$ pairs of integers are the same. We prove the existence\nof reflecting $n$-queens configurations for all sufficiently large $n$, thereby\nresolving both Slater's and Klarner's questions for all but a finite number of\nintegers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
