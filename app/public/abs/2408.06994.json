This duality implies a natural isomorphism between\nthe homeomorphism group of the space and the automorphism group of the algebra.\nWe introduce a complex of cuts on which these groups act, and prove that when\nthe algebra is countable and the space has at least five points, that these\ngroups are the full automorphism group of the complex.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
