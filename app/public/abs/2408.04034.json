Current datasets and models\nfor 3D visual grounding predominantly focus on identifying and localizing\nobjects from static, object-centric descriptions. These approaches do not\nadequately address the dynamic and sequential nature of task-oriented grounding\nnecessary for practical applications. In this work, we propose a new task:\nTask-oriented Sequential Grounding in 3D scenes, wherein an agent must follow\ndetailed step-by-step instructions to complete daily activities by locating a\nsequence of target objects in indoor scenes. To facilitate this task, we\nintroduce SG3D, a large-scale dataset containing 22,346 tasks with 112,236\nsteps across 4,895 real-world 3D scenes. The dataset is constructed using a\ncombination of RGB-D scans from various 3D scene datasets and an automated task\ngeneration pipeline, followed by human verification for quality assurance. We\nadapted three state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding models to the sequential\ngrounding task and evaluated their performance on SG3D. Our results reveal that\nwhile these models perform well on traditional benchmarks, they face\nsignificant challenges with task-oriented sequential grounding, underscoring\nthe need for further research in this area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
