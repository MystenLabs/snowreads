In this study, we conducted\ninterviews with 14 students to explore their everyday interactions with\nChatGPT. Our preliminary findings reveal that students grapple with the dilemma\nof utilizing ChatGPT's efficiency for learning and information seeking, while\nsimultaneously experiencing a crisis of trust and ethical concerns regarding\nthe outcomes and broader impacts of ChatGPT. The students perceive ChatGPT as\nbeing more \"human-like\" compared to traditional AI. This dilemma, characterized\nby mixed emotions, inconsistent behaviors, and an overall positive attitude\ntowards ChatGPT, underscores its potential for beneficial applications in\neducation and learning. However, we argue that despite its human-like\nqualities, the advanced capabilities of such intelligence might lead to adverse\nconsequences. Therefore, it's imperative to approach its application cautiously\nand strive to mitigate potential harms in future developments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
