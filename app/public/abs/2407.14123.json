We at first deal with\nthe corresponding functional spaces, namely the Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces,\nhence we investigate their regularity properties and the extension of the\nclassical Sobolev embedding results to the new context. Then, we focus on the\nregularity properties of our operators, and prove that these operators are\nbounded, continuous, strictly monotone, coercive and satisfy the\n(S_+)-property. Further, we discuss suitable problems driven by such operators.\nIn particular, we deal with Dirichlet problems in which the nonlinearity is\ngradient dependent. Under very general assumptions, we establish the existence\nof a nontrivial solution for such problems. Also, we give additional conditions\non the nonlinearity which guarantee the uniqueness of solution. Lastly, we\nproduce some local regularity results (namely, Caccioppoli-type inequality,\nSobolev-Poincar\\'e-type inequalities and higher integrability) for minimizers\nof the integral functionals corresponding to the operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
