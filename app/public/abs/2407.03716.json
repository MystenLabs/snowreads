Contrary to the previous dispatch methods that require\nprecise predictions of RES, this paper proposes a novel prediction-free and\ndata-driven coordinated dispatch framework for reliable microgrid operations.\nIn the offline stage, ex-post optimal dispatch sequences are generated based on\nhistorical dispatch from \"God' s-eye view\". The sequences offer a global\nreference and are sequentially updated based on the newly observed data.\nSubsequently, we propose an adaptive virtual-queue-based online convex\noptimization (OCO) method to generate the real-time control policy of\nmicrogrid, which aim to minimize the instant operation cost while tracking the\noffline reference. We provide theoretical proof that the proposed method\noutperforms the existing OCO methods and admits sublinear dynamic regret bound\nand sublinear hard cumulative constraint violation bound for OCO with\ntime-varying constraints. Case study illustrates that the proposed method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of economic optimality,\ncomputational efficiency, and security.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
