Then by this notion, we introduce the discrete motion planning for\nrobots which can move discreetly. Moreover, in this case the number of motion\nplanning, called discrete topological complexity, required for these robots is\nreduced. Then we prove some properties of discrete topological complexity; For\ninstance, we show that a discrete motion planning in a metric space X exists if\nand only if X is a discrete contractible space. Also, we prove that the\ndiscrete topological complexity depends only on the strictly discrete homotopy\ntype of spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
