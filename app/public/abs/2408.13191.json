We review how this PDF emerges when\nelectroweak interactions are applied to the collinear splitting process and\nshow that the leading-order approximation is significantly suppressed due to an\naccidental cancellation. However, this suppression does not appear in the\nleading-logarithm resummed numerical result, where the $Z/\\gamma$ PDF is\ninstead comparable to those of other electroweak gauge bosons. By extending the\nanalytical approximation to next-to-leading order, we show the mechanism by\nwhich the suppression is lifted and provide a more accurate approximation to\nthe numerical result. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the $Z/\\gamma$ PDF\nin several processes at future muon colliders. High-energy Compton scattering\nis identified as a promising process for observing experimentally this peculiar\nelectroweak effect with high precision. We also quantify the impact of the\n$Z/\\gamma$ PDF on Higgs physics and, as a new physics example, in resonant\nsingle-production of axion-like particles (ALP).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
