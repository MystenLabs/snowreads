It includes a detailed analysis of dynamical degrees of freedom of\ntensionless DGP and their comparison with other related theories. We develop a\nprocedure for constructing the effective energy-momentum tensor of the\ngravitational field on the brane from the non-local effective action of the DGP\nmodel based on the Noether method used to determine the conservation laws\ncorresponding to the symmetries of the action. Using it we construct the\neffective energy-momentum tensor of the dynamical degrees of freedom of DGP\ngravity on the brane and obtain the effective four-dimensional gravitational\nradiation energy flux. We then obtain an analog of the quadrupole formula for\nthe effective gravitational radiation power of an arbitrary non-relativistic\nsource on the brane. We also discuss the possibility of detecting the effect of\nleakage of gravitational waves into the extra dimension resulting from the\nmetastable character of the effective graviton on the brane. In particular, in\naccordance with the infrared transparency of the bulk of DGP model, we find\nthat the frequency of gravitational-wave signal controls the effective\ncrossover radius, beyond which the leakage of gravitational waves manifests\nitself.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PrgHDFO8XXXLHOQGLH7oMfDQ5K4VYRJCrNrWcVHwHPM","pdfSize":"1670613"}
