These affect the continuous-time plant in\na rational way which is then modeled as a Linear Fractional Transformation\n(LFT). Based on a zero-order-hold (ZOH) LFT discretization process at the cost\nof bounded quantifiable approximations, and then using LFT-preserving\ndown-sampling operations, a single-rate discrete-time closed-loop LFT model is\nderived. Interestingly, for any step inputs, and any admissible values of the\nuncertain parameters, the outputs of this model cover those of the initial\nhybrid multi-rate closed-loop system at every sampling time of the slowest\ncontrol loop. Such an LFT model, which also captures the discretization errors,\ncan then be used to evaluate both robust stability and guaranteed $H_\\infty$\nperformance with a $\\mu$-based approach. The proposed methodology is\nillustrated on a realistic and easily reproducible example inspired by the\nvalidation of multi-rate attitude control systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3dG6u3_0M_BZ1Y6NZrRnkDcjVVMySVKkiXl-uYjua8U","pdfSize":"832965"}
