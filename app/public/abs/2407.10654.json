This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN\napplied to different transport models, from diffusion to\nadvection-diffusion-reaction problems. Once a suitable PINN is established to\nsolve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable\nparameters. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct\nsolution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial\nconditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to\nbe weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch).\nSimilarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch\naccordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support\nour PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
