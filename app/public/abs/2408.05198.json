As an application, we construct an\nexplicit example. Our strategy employs certain differential operators. It is\ninspired by work of Cl\\'ery and van der Geer in the setting of Siegel modular\nforms, but it also requires overcoming challenges that do not arise in the\nSiegel setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
