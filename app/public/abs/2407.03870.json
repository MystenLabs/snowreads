This uniform estimate cannot be easily\nobtained with standard inequalities or entropy methods, but can be obtained\nthrough the use of Harris's theorem, finding interesting links to quantitative\nversions of the central limit theorem in probability. As a consequence one can\nprove that solutions of this nonlocal approximation converge to solutions of\nthe usual Fokker-Planck equation uniformly in time -- hence we show the\napproximation is asymptotic-preserving in this sense. The associated\nequilibrium has some interesting tail and regularity properties, which we also\nstudy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
