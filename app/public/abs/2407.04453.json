These task-oriented algorithms work in a\nhybrid loop combining a quantum processor and classical optimization. Using a\nspecific class of VQA named variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs), we choose\nsome parameterized quantum circuits to benchmark them at entanglement\nwitnessing and entangled ground state detection for many-body systems described\nby Heisenberg Hamiltonian, varying the number of qubits and shots. Quantum\ncircuits whose structure is inspired by the Hamiltonian interactions presented\nbetter results on cost function estimation than problem-agnostic circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
