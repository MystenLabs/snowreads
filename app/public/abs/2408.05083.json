Existing\napproaches, when used for face personalization, suffer to achieve convincing\ninversion with identity preservation and rely on semantic text-based editing of\nthe generated face. However, a more fine-grained control is desired for facial\nattribute editing, which is challenging to achieve solely with text prompts. In\ncontrast, StyleGAN models learn a rich face prior and enable smooth control\ntowards fine-grained attribute editing by latent manipulation. This work uses\nthe disentangled $\\mathcal{W+}$ space of StyleGANs to condition the T2I model.\nThis approach allows us to precisely manipulate facial attributes, such as\nsmoothly introducing a smile, while preserving the existing coarse text-based\ncontrol inherent in T2I models. To enable conditioning of the T2I model on the\n$\\mathcal{W+}$ space, we train a latent mapper to translate latent codes from\n$\\mathcal{W+}$ to the token embedding space of the T2I model. The proposed\napproach excels in the precise inversion of face images with attribute\npreservation and facilitates continuous control for fine-grained attribute\nediting. Furthermore, our approach can be readily extended to generate\ncompositions involving multiple individuals. We perform extensive experiments\nto validate our method for face personalization and fine-grained attribute\nediting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"SlTkJs7zphQIjc1xnVchI4zDYcu7uTZcMfPFz4lNUTA","pdfSize":"31679960"}
