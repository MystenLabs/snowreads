Our approach utilizes gradient\nboosting for estimation, providing a model-free, nonlinear analysis able to\nhandle large-dimensional systems while requiring minimal or no calibration. Our\nprocedure is divided into three phases: trajectory encoding, Markovian order\nidentification, and hypothesis testing for variable interactions. The latter is\nthe key innovation that allows us to selectively switch off variable\ninteractions to discern their specific contribution to irreversibility. When\napplied to financial markets, our findings reveal a distinctive shift: during\nstable periods, irreversibility is mainly related to short-term patterns,\nwhereas in unstable periods, these short-term patterns are disrupted, leaving\nonly contributions from stable long-term ones. This observed transition\nunderscores the crucial importance of high-order variable interactions in\nunderstanding the dynamics of financial markets, especially in times of\nturbulence.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
