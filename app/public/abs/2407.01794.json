Most existing methods, such as conformalized\nquantile regression and probabilistic conformal prediction, only offer marginal\ncoverage guarantees. Our approach extends these methods to achieve conditional\ncoverage, which is essential for many practical applications. While exact\nconditional guarantees are impossible without assumptions on the data\ndistribution, we provide non-asymptotic bounds that explicitly depend on the\nquality of the available estimate of the conditional distribution. Our\nconfidence sets are highly adaptive to the local structure of the data, making\nthem particularly useful in high heteroskedasticity situations. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations, showing that\nit outperforms existing methods in terms of conditional coverage and improves\nthe reliability of statistical inference in a wide range of applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
