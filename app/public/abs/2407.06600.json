To mitigate this challenge, we propose integrating\nclinical knowledge to refine CBMs, better aligning them with clinicians'\ndecision-making processes. Specifically, we guide the model to prioritize the\nconcepts that clinicians also prioritize. We validate our approach on two\ndatasets of medical images: white blood cell and skin images. Empirical\nvalidation demonstrates that incorporating medical guidance enhances the\nmodel's classification performance on unseen datasets with varying preparation\nmethods, thereby increasing its real-world applicability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
