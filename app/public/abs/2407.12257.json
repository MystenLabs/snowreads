Human emotional expressions are inherently complex due to the\npresence of compound expressions, requiring the consideration of both local and\nglobal facial cues for accurate judgment. In this paper, we propose an ensemble\nlearning-based solution to address this complexity. Our approach involves\ntraining three distinct expression classification models using convolutional\nnetworks, Vision Transformers, and multiscale local attention networks. By\nemploying late fusion for model ensemble, we combine the outputs of these\nmodels to predict the final results. Our method demonstrates high accuracy on\nthe RAF-DB datasets and is capable of recognizing expressions in certain\nportions of the C-EXPR-DB through zero-shot learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
