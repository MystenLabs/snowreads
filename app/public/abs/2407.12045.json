A graph automorphism is a mapping of a set of vertices onto itself\nthat preserves adjacency. The set of such automorphisms forms a vertex group of\na graph or simply a graph group. The basis for constructing a group of graph\nautomorphisms is the concept of orbit. The construction of an orbit is closely\nrelated to the quantitative assessment of a vertex or edge of a graph, called\nweight. To determine the weight of an element, graph invariants built on the\nspectrum of edge cuts and the spectrum of edge cycles are used. The weight of\nthe graph elements allows identifying generating cycles and forming orbits.\nExamples are given of constructing a group of automorphisms for some types of\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XhVa8IbKIiy6MKJoGVeQ3PBWfxUYl8K9jRNmwwCZTXg","pdfSize":"5277567","objectId":"0xac398eba2856b9bf409bc920d892b28b1bae8222fcf70040f9491303b63eaffd","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
