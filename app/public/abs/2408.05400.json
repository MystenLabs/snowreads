We confirm that cluster haloes grow inside-out,\nsimilar to galactic haloes. Major merger events dominate the growth of the\ninternal region and minor mergers/diffuse accretion shape the outskirts.\nHowever, compared to galactic haloes, cluster haloes tend to have a younger and\nmore actively evolving inner region. On average, the majority of mass (> 80%)\nin the inner region ($R< 0.1 r_{200}$) of Phoenix haloes is accreted after $z =\n3$, while for galactic haloes, most mass in the central region has already been\naccreted before $z=6$. The density profiles of cluster haloes are less stable\nthan those of galactic haloes over different radii. The enclosed mass within\n$50$ or $150$ kpc of all Phoenix haloes evolves substantially in the past\n${\\sim} 7$ Gyr, while galactic haloes remained stable during the same period.\nWe suggest that the relatively younger and more active state explains the\nvarious observations of cluster haloes, especially in central regions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
