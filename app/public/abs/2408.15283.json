Although DDPMs have shown\nsuperior performance when applied to various computer vision tasks, their\neffectiveness has yet to be translated to high dimensional CT super-resolution.\nTo train DDPMs in a conditional sampling manner, we first leverage CatSim to\nsimulate realistic lower resolution PCCT images from high-resolution CT scans.\nSince maximizing DDPM performance is time-consuming for both inference and\ntraining, especially on high-dimensional PCCT data, we explore both 2D and 3D\nnetworks for conditional DDPM and apply methods to accelerate training. In\nparticular, we decompose the 3D task into efficient 2D DDPMs and design a joint\n2D inference in the reverse diffusion process that synergizes 2D results of all\nthree dimensions to make the final 3D prediction. Experimental results show\nthat our DDPM achieves improved results versus baseline reference models in\nrecovering high-frequency structures, suggesting that a framework based on\nrealistic simulation and DDPM shows promise for improving PCCT resolution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
