We study a new model,\n$\\mathcal{G}$EDE, featuring the cubic Galileon operator $X\\Box\\phi$ and test it\nagainst the most recent Planck PR4 CMB and Cepheid calibrated Pantheon+ type Ia\nSupernovae data. Thanks to the kinetic braiding effects, $\\mathcal{G}$EDE gives\na better fit to the data, with a higher $H_0$, and is preferred over the\ncanonical EDE with a Bayes factor $\\ln B=0.9$, despite introducing one more\nparameter. This calls for further explorations of modified gravity near and\nbefore last scattering. To facilitate these, we introduce a substantial\nextension of the cosmological code \\texttt{EFTCAMB} that allows to fully evolve\nthe background and linear dynamics of any covariant theory, oscillatory or not,\nbelonging to the Horndeski class.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
