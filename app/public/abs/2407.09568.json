J. Phys. 92:397, 2024; arXiv:2309.10826), Vallejo and\nBove provide a physical argument based nominally on the second law of\nthermodynamics as a way of resolving the mathematical question appearing in the\ntitle. A remarkable aspect of their argument is that it does not depend on the\nnumerical value of $\\pi$, because $e^{x} \\ge x^{e}$ for all positive $x$, with\nequality occurring only when $x = e$. Moreover, their argument does not depend\non the validity of the second law but is rather a limited proof of it for this\nparticular case.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
