Two\nplayers, Dominator and Staller, alternatingly claim vertices of a graph $G$\nwhere Dominator is allowed to claim up to $b$ vertices in every round and she\nwins if and only if she occupies all vertices of a dominating set of $G$. For\nthis game, we prove a full characterization of all trees on which Dominator has\na winning strategy. For the number of rounds which Dominator needs to win, we\ngive exact results when played on powers of paths or cycles, and for all trees\nwe provide bounds which are optimal up to a constant factor not depending on\n$b$. Furthermore, we discuss general minimum degree conditions and study how\nmany vertices can still be dominated by Dominator even when Staller has a\nwinning strategy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
