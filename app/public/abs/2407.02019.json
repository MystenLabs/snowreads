We show that it possesses the same crucial property as its\nfinite-dimensional version to identify the support of the measure (and so to\ndetect outliers). Indeed, the growth of its reciprocal with respect to its\ndegree is at least exponential outside the support of the measure and at most\npolynomial inside. Moreover, for a fixed degree, its computation mimics that of\nthe finite-dimensional case, but now the entries of the moment matrix\nassociated with the measure are moments of moments. To illustrate the potential\nof this new tool, we consider the following application. Given a data base of\nregistered reference trajectories, we consider the problem of detecting whether\na newly acquired trajectory is abnormal (or out of distribution) with respect\nto the data base. As in the finite-dimensional case, we use the\ninfinite-dimensional Christoffel function as a score function to detect\noutliers and abnormal trajectories. A few numerical examples are provided to\nillustrate the theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
