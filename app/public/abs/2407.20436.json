Fibers in suspension usually align with the\nflow, leading to diameter-based filtration when passing through a sieve.\nModifying the flow conditions by introducing more mixing so that fibers are\narbitrarily oriented can lead to sorting by diameter and length simultaneously,\nresulting in a lower filtration quality. In this paper, we demonstrate that\ncapillary filtration by dip coating can be utilized to selectively sort fibers\nby length or by diameter in a controlled manner. Using the withdrawal of a flat\nsubstrate from a fiber suspension, we demonstrate that fibers are primarily\nsorted by their diameters. When considering cylindrical substrates, fibers can\nbe sorted by length under appropriate conditions due to the orientation adopted\nby the fibers during their entrainment. We report guidelines for designing this\nfiltration process and obtaining good sorting efficiency.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
