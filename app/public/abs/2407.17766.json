Leveraging the robust framework of Safety Barrier Certificates, our\nmethod integrates a strategic perturbation mechanism that guides agents through\nsocial mini-games where deadlock and collision occur frequently. The method\nadopts a strategic calculation process where agents, upon encountering a\ndeadlock select a pseudo goal within a predefined radius around the current\nposition to resolve the deadlock among agents. The calculation is based on\ncontrolled strategic algorithm, ensuring that deviation towards pseudo-goal is\nboth purposeful and effective in resolution of deadlock. Once the agent reaches\nthe pseudo goal, it resumes the path towards the original goal, thereby\nenhancing navigational efficiency and safety. Experimental results demonstrates\nSPGP's efficacy in reducing deadlock instances and improving overall system\nthroughput in variety of multi-agent navigation scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Azr1vQBIoz-IB92Bx5-9qVWRAEZDHQtVHOynyKcv7g0","pdfSize":"496835","objectId":"0x057b9f5dbb256d1f0e281e939f7383ce9d5f0fb960f58fcc98e8a1ddc3884986","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
