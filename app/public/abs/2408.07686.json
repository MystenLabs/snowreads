Here, we\ninvestigate to which extent electromagnetic observations of the associated\nkilonovae allow us to place constraints on the EoS. For this, we use\nstate-of-the-art three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics\nsimulations and detailed nucleosynthesis modeling to connect properties of\nobserved light curves to properties of the accretion disk, and hence, the EoS.\nUsing our general approach, we use multi-messenger observations of\nGW170817/AT2017gfo to study the impact of various sources of uncertainty on\ninferences of the EoS. We constrain the radius of a $\\rm{1.4 M_\\odot}$ neutron\nstar to lie within $\\rm{10.19\\leq R_{1.4}\\leq 13.0}$~km and the maximum mass to\nbe $\\rm{M_{TOV}\\leq 3.06 M_\\odot}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6Y0b7_8WQUNGtKj7CJTwPPpYNNH9Ax5wf5dqYI_CPu4","pdfSize":"3765631"}
