This\nLetter demonstrates bi-directional asymmetric frequency conversion -- either\nupward or downward -- depending on the excitation direction in the elastic\ndomain, moving beyond uni-directional approaches. We numerically and\nexperimentally demonstrate its practical realization in a model system of\ncylindrical beam crystals, a type of granular crystal characterized by\nintrinsic local resonance. This novel wave transport mechanism operates through\nthe interplay of nonlinear contact, spatial asymmetry, and the coupling of\nlocal resonance. Thanks to the proposed highly tunable architecture, we\ndemonstrate various ways to manipulate wave transport, including tunable\nfrequency conversion. Given that the local resonance we employ exemplifies\navoided crossings (i.e., a strong coupling effect), our work may inspire\ninvestigations into diverse physical nonlinear domains that support\nmaterial/structural resonance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
