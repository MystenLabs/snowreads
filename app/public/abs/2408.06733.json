Although tumor\ngrowth is not yet incorporated, this work aims to comprehend the interaction\nbetween thermal effects and hydrodynamics on short-time scales where the tumor\nsize typically remains stable. We establish the existence of a unique weak\nsolution within the framework of implicit evolution equations, overcoming\nchallenges posed by intricate coupling mechanisms within the system. To further\ninvestigate the model, we then study the one-dimensional model and explore in\ndetail the complex interplay between fluid flow, solid deformation, and heat\ntransfer. This complex coupled system of equations is reduced for the short\ntime scale to obtain the semi-analytical solution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
