We show how binary tubings\nof rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels\nsatisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions\nto Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the\nreciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way.\nFurther, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of\ndifferential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for\nresurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and\ninvestigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the\nasymptotics and the transseries structure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
