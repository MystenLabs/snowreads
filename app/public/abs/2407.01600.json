Our extended treatment uses the UK R-matrix\ntheory and the multichannel quantum-defect theory procedure to uniformly\nresolve the direct and indirect mechanisms of DR while bypassing explicit\ndissociative state and electronic coupling calculations. The theoretical\nresults exhibit good overall agreement with previous experimental measurements.\nAt lower scattering energies, good agreement is found only if the rotational\nstructure of the ion is included and the theoretical cross sections are\naveraged over initial rotational levels corresponding to the temperature at\nwhich the experimental measurements were made. At higher scattering energies,\nour rotationally resolved results are very similar to those obtained without\nincluding the ion's rotational structure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
