It is\noften measured by two- and multi-particle correlations and is therefore\ncontaminated by nonflow, those genuine few-body correlations unrelated to the\nglobal event-wise correlations. Many methods have been devised to estimate\nnonflow contamination with various degrees of successes and difficulties. Here,\nwe review those methods pedagogically, discussing the pros and cons of each\nmethod, and give examples of ballpark estimate of nonflow contamination and\nassociated uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We hope such a\nreview of the various nonflow estimation methods in a single place would prove\nhelpful to future researches.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
