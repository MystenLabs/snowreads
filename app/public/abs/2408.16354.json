To estimate environmental interference in a low-cost and\nsensorless way (without force sensor), a variety of tightly-coupled visual\ninertial external force estimators are proposed in the literature. However,\nexisting solutions may suffer from relatively low-frequency preintegration. In\nthis paper, a novel estimator is designed to overcome this issue via\nhigh-frequency instantaneous accelerometer update.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
