Recently, superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJs) have been widely\nexplored for such purposes, leading to the development of sMTJ-based systems;\nhowever, the reliance on nanoscale ferromagnets limits scalability and\nreliability, making sMTJs sensitive to external perturbations and prone to\nsignificant device variations. Here, we present an experimental demonstration\nof closed loop three-terminal sMTJs as reliable and potentially scalable\nsources of true randomness in the field-free regime. By leveraging dual-current\ncontrollability and incorporating feedback, we stabilize the switching\noperation of superparamagnets and reach cryptographic-quality random\nbitstreams. The realization of controllable and robust true random sMTJs\nunderpin a general hardware platform for computing schemes exploiting the\nstochasticity in the physical world, as demonstrated by the generative\nartificial intelligence example in our experiment.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
