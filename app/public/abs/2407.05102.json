However, its application in the field of wastewater flow\nestimation remains underexplored due to: (1) a lack of available datasets, (2)\ninconvenient toolchains for on-device AI model development and deployment, and\n(3) hardware platforms designed for general DL purposes rather than being\noptimized for energy-efficient soft sensor applications. This study addresses\nthese gaps by proposing an automated, end-to-end solution for wastewater flow\nestimation using a prototype IoT device.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
