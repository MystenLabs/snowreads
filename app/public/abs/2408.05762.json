The period of a digraph is the least common\nmultiple of the periods of its strongly connected components that contain at\nleast one cycle. These notions play an important role in the theory of Markov\nchains and the analysis of powers of nonnegative matrices. While the time\ncomplexity of computing the period is well-understood, little is known about\nits space complexity. We show that the problem of computing the period of a\ndigraph is NL-complete, even if all its cycles are contained in the same\nstrongly connected component. However, if the digraph is strongly connected, we\nshow that this problem becomes L-complete. For primitive digraphs (that is,\nstrongly connected digraphs of period one), there always exists a number $m$\nsuch that there is a path of length exactly $m$ between every two vertices. We\nshow that computing the smallest such $m$, called the exponent of a digraph, is\nNL-complete. The exponent of a primitive digraph is a particular case of the\nindex of convergence of a nonnegative matrix, which we also show to be\ncomputable in NL, and thus NL-complete.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
