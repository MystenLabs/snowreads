It is known that the\nexperimentally observed dependence of the damping rate on the phase difference\nbehaves in the opposite way to that of theory. It is shown that this problem\ncan be solved by calculating the damping rate by incorporating changes in the\nelectronic state at the resonant frequency. When the phase difference is large,\nthe broadening of the one-particle state is large due to the presence of a dc\ncurrent and brings about the effective thermalization, so that the\nnonequilibrium correction becomes small. Conversely, when the phase difference\nis small, the nonequilibrium correction becomes large and causes a smaller\ndamping rate due to a reduction in the effective temperature. This dependence\nof the nonequilibrium correction on the phase difference results in a damping\nrate that is consistent with experimental results.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
