Existing OLP algorithms\nfall into two categories: LP-based algorithms and LP-free algorithms. The\nformer one typically guarantees better performance, even offering a constant\nregret, but requires solving a large number of LPs, which could be\ncomputationally expensive. In contrast, LP-free algorithm only requires\nfirst-order computations but induces a worse performance, lacking a constant\nregret bound. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two extremes by\nproposing an algorithm that achieves a constant regret while solving LPs only\n$O(\\log\\log T)$ times over the time horizon $T$. Moreover, when we are allowed\nto solve LPs only $M$ times, we propose an algorithm that can guarantee an\n$O\\left(T^{(1/2+\\epsilon)^{M-1}}\\right)$ regret. Furthermore, when the arrival\nprobabilities are known at the beginning, our algorithm can guarantee a\nconstant regret by solving LPs $O(\\log\\log T)$ times, and an\n$O\\left(T^{(1/2+\\epsilon)^{M}}\\right)$ regret by solving LPs only $M$ times.\nNumerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the\nproposed algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
