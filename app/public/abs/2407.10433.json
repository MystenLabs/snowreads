Accurate segmentation of 3D tooth is of importance for the\ntreatment. Although deep learning based methods have achieved convincing\nresults in medical image processing, they need a large of annotated data for\nnetwork training, making it very time-consuming in data collection and\nannotation. Besides, domain shift widely existing in the distribution of data\nacquired by different devices impacts severely the model generalization. To\nresolve the problem, we propose a multi-stage framework for 3D tooth\nsegmentation in dental CBCT, which achieves the third place in the\n\"Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation\" 3D (STS-3D) challenge. The experiments on\nvalidation set compared with other semi-supervised segmentation methods further\nindicate the validity of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
