In particular, we discuss the\nrelationship between the Radon number, the colorful and fractional Helly\nproperties, weak $\\varepsilon$-nets, and $(p,q)$-theorems. As an application of\nthe theory of convexity spaces we introduce new classes of uniform hypergraphs\nand show that they are $\\chi$-bounded.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
