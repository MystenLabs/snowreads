After an exponential\nsubstitution, the equation takes the form of a differential-difference equation\nwith a piecewise-constant right-hand side. In the work of A. Yu. Kolesov and\nothers, this equation was studied with a negative continuous initial function,\nand the existence and orbital stability of a periodic solution with a period\nlonger than the delay were proven. In the present work, all possible solutions\nwith continuous on the interval of the delay length initial functions,\ncontaining no more than two zeros, are constructed. It is proven that the\nequation has a periodically unstable solution, the period of which is shorter\nthan the delay.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
