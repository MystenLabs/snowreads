As a sixth and final formalism, we\nconsider a recent proposal by \\citet{Trlifajova:2024}, which we call\nc-numerosity. It is fully constructive and uniquely determined, but assigns\nmerely partially ordered numerosity values. By relating all six formalisms to\neach other in terms of the underlying limit operations, we get a better sense\nof the intrinsic limitations in determining the sizes of subsets of\n$\\mathbb{N}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
