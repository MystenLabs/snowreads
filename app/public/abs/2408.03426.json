The analysis elucidates the methodologies,\nframeworks, and technologies malicious entities employ to misuse computational\nresources for unauthorized cryptocurrency mining. The investigation focuses on\nidentifying websites serving as platforms for cryptojacking activities. A\ndataset of 887 websites, previously identified as cryptojacking sites, was\ncompiled and analyzed to categorize the attacks and malicious activities\nobserved. The study further delves into the DNS IP addresses, registrars, and\nname servers associated with hosting these websites to understand their\nstructure and components. Various malware and illicit activities linked to\nthese sites were identified, indicating the presence of unauthorized\ncryptocurrency mining via compromised sites. The findings highlight the\nvulnerability of website infrastructures to cryptojacking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ecQBGihEJT6bQwppX5ld7mSxcGgF51uBbahBN4kJMpU","pdfSize":"153176"}
