However, we argue that this success is incomplete without an\nunderstanding of relational composition: how (or whether) neural nets combine\nfeature vectors to represent more complicated relationships. To facilitate\nresearch in this area, this paper offers a guided tour of various relational\nmechanisms that have been proposed, along with preliminary analysis of how such\nmechanisms might affect the search for interpretable features. We end with a\nseries of promising areas for empirical research, which may help determine how\nneural networks represent structured data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sZhhGUA2POejA9SLVO0RuTcv5XTotoC90lBGHyTydLA","pdfSize":"215618"}
