The first interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, Borisov and IM1,\nwere discovered over the past decade. Aims. We follow the trajectories of known\ninterstellar objects in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way galaxy to\nconstrain their possible origin. Methods. We initiate the trajectories based on\nthe measured velocities of the interstellar objects relative to the Local\nStandard of Rest. Since the scale-height of stars in the Milky-Way disk\nincreases with age, we use the vertical excursion of each interstellar object\nfrom the Milky-Way disk mid-plane to constrain their likely age. Results. The\nsmall vertical extent of 'Oumuamua's past trajectory suggests that it\noriginated near the mid-plane of the thin disk, implying a likely age younger\nthan 1-2 Gyr. The maximal excursion of the comet Borisov is similar to that of\nthe Sun, suggesting a similar age. The meteor IM1 exhibits yet larger vertical\nexcursions, suggesting an older source. Finally, we show that human-made\ninterstellar probes, like Voyager 1 or Pioneer 10 will arrive at the opposite\nside of the Milky Way disk relative to the Sun in $\\sim$ 2 Gyr and return to\nthe vicinity of the Sun before it becomes a red giant.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nNM94htSZmvHUrwUXvN4cuZh9Au1a39VX2sODDCV2NU","pdfSize":"1018734"}
