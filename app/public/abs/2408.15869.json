The plasma cools radiatively,\nand because it is optically thin to this radiation, it becomes possible to\nmodel the density, velocity, and temperature structure of the system by\nmodifying the MHD equations to include energy source terms that approximate the\nlocal heating and cooling rates. The solutions can be highly inhomogeneous and\neven multiphase because the well known linear instability associated with these\nsource terms, thermal instability, leads to a catastrophic heating and cooling\nof the plasma in the nonlinear regime. Here we show that there is a separate,\nmuch simpler instance of catastrophic heating and cooling accompanying these\nsource terms that can rival thermal instability in dynamical importance. The\nlinear stability criterion is the isochoric one identified by Parker (1953),\nand we demonstrate that cooling functions derived from collisional ionization\nequilibrium are highly prone to violating this criterion. If catastrophic\ncooling instability can act locally in global simulations, then it is an\nalternative mechanism for forming condensations, and due to its nonequilibrium\ncharacter, it may be relevant to explaining a host of phenomena associated with\nthe production of cooler gas in hot, low density plasmas.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
