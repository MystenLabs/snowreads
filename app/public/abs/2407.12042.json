To address this we\nintroduce and explore a robust framework for wave control: Quasi-normal modes\n(QNMs). Specifically we consider the problem for thin elastic plates, where the\nGreen's function formalism is well known and readily exploited to solve\nmultiple scattering problems. By studying the associated nonlinear eigenvalue\nproblem we derive a dispersive QNM expansion, providing a reduced-order model\nfor efficient forced response computations which reveals physical insight into\nthe resonant mode excitation. Furthermore, we derive eigenvalue sensitivities\nwith respect to resonator parameters and apply a gradient-based optimization to\ndesign quasi-bound states in the continuum and position eigenfrequencies\nprecisely in the complex plane. Scattering simulations validate our approach in\nstructures such as graded line arrays and quasi-crystals. Drawing on QNM\nconcepts from electromagnetism we demonstrate significant advances in elastic\nmetamaterials, highlighting their potential for tailored wave manipulation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
