Fix an integral model and assume the existence of infinitely many\nintegral points. Then one would like to give an asymptotic count with the help\nof some height function. In many cases, with the help of measure rigidity of\nunipotent flows, we reduce this problem to one on equivariant birational\ngeometry. For instance, we show that if G and H are both connected, semisimple,\nsimply connected and without compact factors, then U=G/H is strongly\nHardy-Littlewood with respect to certain height function. We also show that\nwhen H is \"large\" in H and both G and H are connected, reductive and without\nnon-trivial Q-characters, then for every equivariant height, the asymptotic of\nintegral points is the same as the volume asymptotic up to a constant. Three\nconcrete examples with explicit heights are also provided to illustrate our\napproach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B9wdV_rjXNfWgbTRKPf-oVKNECaI7WJDjel63dwPqWk","pdfSize":"1210403","txDigest":"nGKereJetiuwBR1CUFFGkd9bhjM5mD3nLFcXoiZUrGB","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
