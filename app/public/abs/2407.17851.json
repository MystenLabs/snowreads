(2011)].\nWe provide strong evidence that for a part of the phase where efficient\nalgorithms exist that approximately reconstruct the communities, inference\nbased on maximum a posteriori (MAP) fails. In other words, we show that there\nexist modes of the posterior distribution that have a vanishing agreement with\nthe ground truth. The proof is based on the analysis of a graph colouring\nalgorithm from [Achlioptas and Moore (2003)].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
