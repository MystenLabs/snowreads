In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods:\nThey largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation,\nand transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time,\nwithout accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We\naddress the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and\nuncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models\nfor sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with\npretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no\nadditional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation\nmethods across both different semantic perception models and policies,\nconfirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation\nand found decisions.
