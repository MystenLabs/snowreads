In\nparticular, we show that by exclusively employing the vertices after convex\nhull compression, an equivalent solution can be obtained compared to utilizing\nthe entire scenario set. For other compression methods that might relax the\noriginal solution, such as box compression, this paper presents the compression\nrisk validation scheme to assess the risk arising from the sample space. By\nquantifying the risk associated with compression, decision-makers are empowered\nto select either solution risk or compression risk as the risk metric,\ndepending on the complexity of specific problems. Numerical examples based on\nthe 118-bus system and synthetic Texas grids compare these two risk metrics.\nThe results also demonstrate the efficiency of compression methods in both\nproblem formulation and solving processes.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
