Methods based on persistent homology have demonstrated their\nadvantages in capturing topological features that traditional deep learning\nmethods cannot detect in both radiology and pathology. However, previous\nresearch primarily focused on 2D image analysis, neglecting the comprehensive\n3D context. In this paper, we propose an innovative 3D TDA approach that\nincorporates the concept of superpixels to transform 3D medical image features\ninto point cloud data. By Utilizing Optimized Gaussian Coefficient, the\nproposed 3D TDA method, for the first time, efficiently generate holistic\nPersistence Images for 3D volumetric data. Our 3D TDA method exhibits superior\nperformance on the MedMNist3D dataset when compared to other traditional\nmethods, showcasing its potential effectiveness in modeling 3D persistent\nhomology-based topological analysis when it comes to classification tasks.
