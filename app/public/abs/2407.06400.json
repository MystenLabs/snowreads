Interactive Natural Language\nDebugging (INLD) aims to lessen this burden by casting debugging as a reasoning\nproblem, asking the user a series of questions to diagnose and correct errors\nin the system's knowledge. In this paper, we present work in progress on an\ninteractive error diagnosis system for the CNLU semantic parser. We show how\nthe first two stages of the INLD pipeline (symptom identification and error\nlocalization) can be cast as a model-based diagnosis problem, demonstrate our\nsystem's ability to diagnose semantic errors on synthetic examples, and discuss\ndesign challenges and frontiers for future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tBJbBuz1ED0tWWfU0jBdLIX85aY9sqqIO1th8WfSwME","pdfSize":"453646"}
