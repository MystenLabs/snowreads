Complex financial crimes can be hard to detect primarily\nbecause data related to different pieces of the overall puzzle is usually\ndistributed across a network of financial institutions, regulators, and\nlaw-enforcement agencies and they cannot be easily shared due to privacy\nconstraints. Recent advances in Privacy-Preserving Data Matching and Machine\nLearning provide an opportunity for regulators and the financial industry to\ncome together to solve the risk-discovery problem with technology. This paper\nprovides a survey of the financial intelligence landscape and where\nopportunities lie for privacy technologies to improve the state-of-the-art in\nfinancial-crime detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
