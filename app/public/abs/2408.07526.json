In this paper, we extensively and comprehensively\ninvestigate two types of state-of-the-art learning-based approaches\n(sequence-based and graph-based) by conducting experiments on a recently built\nlarge-scale dataset. We investigate seven research questions from five\ndimensions, namely model capabilities, model interpretation, model stability,\nease of use of model, and model economy. We experimentally demonstrate the\npriority of sequence-based models and the limited abilities of both LLM\n(ChatGPT) and graph-based models. We explore the types of vulnerability that\nlearning-based models skilled in and reveal the instability of the models\nthough the input is subtlely semantical-equivalently changed. We empirically\nexplain what the models have learned. We summarize the pre-processing as well\nas requirements for easily using the models. Finally, we initially induce the\nvital information for economically and safely practical usage of these models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
