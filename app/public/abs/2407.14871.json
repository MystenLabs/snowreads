While some\ngenuinely entangled states cannot be verified by violating a single Bell-type\ninequality, a quantum network consisting of different sources allows for the\ncertification of the non-classicality of all sources. In this paper, we propose\nthe first method to verify both types of nonlocality simultaneously in a single\nexperiment. We consider a quantum network comprising a bipartite source and a\ntripartite source. We demonstrate that there are quantum correlations cannot be\nsimulated if the tripartite source distributes biseparable systems while the\nbipartite source distributes even stronger-than-quantum systems. These\ncorrelations can be used to verify both the genuine multipartite nonlocality of\ngeneralized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and the full network nonlocality\nthat is stronger than all the existing results. Experimentally, we observe both\ntypes of nonlocality in a high fidelity photonic quantum network by violating a\nsingle network Bell inequality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2LC5PvoE9826QADp2ksgDDc9gxrgZMcK31zvqclJRJM","pdfSize":"2581784"}
