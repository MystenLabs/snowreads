If $\\rho$ is an\nirreducible, smooth $\\mathcal{C}$-representation of a compact, open subgroup\n$K$ of $G(F)$, then the pair $(K,\\rho)$ gives rise to a Hecke algebra\n$\\mathcal{H}(G(F),(K, \\rho))$. For a large class of pairs $(K,\\rho)$, we show\nthat $\\mathcal{H}(G(F),(K, \\rho))$ is a semi-direct product of an affine Hecke\nalgebra with explicit parameters with a twisted group algebra, and that it is\nisomorphic to $\\mathcal{H}(G^0(F),(K^0, \\rho^0))$ for some reductive subgroup\n$G^0 \\subset G$ with compact, open subgroup $K^0$ and depth-zero representation\n$\\rho^0$ of $K^0$.\n  The class of pairs that we consider includes all depth-zero types. In\ndescribing their Hecke algebras, we thus recover a result of Morris as a\nspecial case. In a second paper, we will show that our class also contains all\nthe types constructed by Kim and Yu, and hence we obtain as a corollary that\narbitrary Bernstein blocks are equivalent to depth-zero Bernstein blocks under\nminor tameness assumptions.\n  The pairs to which our results apply are described in an axiomatic way so\nthat the results can be applied to other constructions of types by only\nverifying that the relevant axioms are satisfied. The Hecke algebra\nisomorphisms are given in an explicit manner and are support preserving.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
