Our\nproposed approach relies on the technique [35], which requires for the\n$C^s$-smooth isogeometric spline space a degree at least $p=2s+1$ on the entire\nmulti-patch domain. Similar to [35], the $C^s$-smooth mixed degree and\nregularity spline space is generated as the span of basis functions that\ncorrespond to the individual patches, edges and vertices of the domain. The\nreduction of degrees of freedom for the functions in the interior of the\npatches is achieved by introducing an appropriate mixed degree and regularity\nunderlying spline space over $[0,1]^2$ to define the functions on the single\npatches. We further extend our construction with a few examples to the class of\nbilinear-like $G^s$ multi-patch parameterizations [33,35], which enables the\ndesign of multi-patch domains having curved boundaries and interfaces. Finally,\nthe great potential of the $C^s$-smooth mixed degree and regularity\nisogeometric spline space for performing isogeometric analysis is demonstrated\nby several numerical examples of solving two particular high order partial\ndifferential equations, namely the biharmonic and triharmonic equation, via the\nisogeometric Galerkin method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
