Hierarchical time\nseries, where lower-level forecasts must sum to upper-level ones, are prevalent\nin various contexts, such as retail sales across countries. Current empirical\nevaluations of forecasting methods are often limited to a small set of\nbenchmark datasets, offering a narrow view of algorithm behavior. RHiOTS\naddresses this gap by systematically altering existing datasets and modifying\nthe characteristics of individual series and their interrelations. It uses a\nset of parameterizable transformations to simulate those changes in the data\ndistribution. Additionally, RHiOTS incorporates an innovative visualization\ncomponent, turning complex, multidimensional robustness evaluation results into\nintuitive, easily interpretable visuals. This approach allows an in-depth\nanalysis of algorithm and model behavior under diverse conditions. We\nillustrate the use of RHiOTS by analyzing the predictive performance of several\nalgorithms. Our findings show that traditional statistical methods are more\nrobust than state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, except when the\ntransformation effect is highly disruptive. Furthermore, we found no\nsignificant differences in the robustness of the algorithms when applying\nspecific reconciliation methods, such as MinT. RHiOTS provides researchers with\na comprehensive tool for understanding the nuanced behavior of forecasting\nalgorithms, offering a more reliable basis for selecting the most appropriate\nmethod for a given problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tDYY_oQqVPhkM79m4p02JHScfm6HYldoxRZjxw9q88I","pdfSize":"1498397"}
