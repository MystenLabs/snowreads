The radio pulsations occur at the longest period yet found,\n2.9 hours, and were discovered in archival low-frequency data from the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA). High time resolution observations from MeerKAT\nshow that pulsations from the source display complex microstructure and high\nlinear polarisation, suggesting a pulsar-like emission mechanism occurring due\nto strong, ordered magnetic fields. The timing residuals, measured over more\nthan a decade, show tentative evidence of a ~6-yr modulation. The high Galactic\nlatitude of the system and the M-dwarf star excludes the magnetar\ninterpretation, suggesting a more likely M-dwarf / white dwarf binary scenario\nfor this system.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
