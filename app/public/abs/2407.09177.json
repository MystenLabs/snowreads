We first perform a bifurcation\nanalysis to track their emergence in a one-dimensional domain for numerical\nfeasibility and find that localized states can become the ground state in\nsuitable parameter regions. Their existence for parameters featuring a\nsupercritical primary bifurcation shows that the latter is not sufficient to\nconclude that the phase transition is of second order, hence density\nmodulations can jump rather than emerging gradually. Finally, we show that\nlocalized states also exist in a three-dimensional domain.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
