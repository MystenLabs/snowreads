The uncertainty\narising from the volatility and unpredictability of technology (such as AI) and\nits potential consequences is widely discussed on social media. This study uses\nBERTopic modelling along with sentiment and emotion analysis on 1.5 million\ntweets from 2021 to 2023 to identify anticipated tech-driven futures and\ncapture the emotions communicated by 400 key opinion leaders (KOLs). Findings\nindicate positive sentiment significantly outweighs negative, with a prevailing\ndominance of positive anticipatory emotions. Specifically, the 'Hope' score is\napproximately 10.33\\% higher than the median 'Anxiety' score. KOLs emphasize\n'Optimism' and benefits over 'Pessimism' and challenges. The study emphasizes\nthe important role KOLs play in shaping future visions through anticipatory\ndiscourse and emotional tone during times of technological uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nY8g1tw_wKigcZae3LMRtlCJqtWc-biXQcRGFmRNFSI","pdfSize":"4408888"}
