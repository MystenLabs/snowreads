Its pathogenesis is not\ncompletely clear, making it difficult to treat patients precisely. Because of\nthe complicated non-Euclidean network structure of the human brain, learning\ncritical information from brain networks remains difficult. To effectively\ncapture the topological information of brain neural networks, a novel\nmultimodal graph attention network based on sparse interaction mechanism\n(Multi-SIGATnet) was proposed for SZ classification was proposed for SZ\nclassification. Firstly, structural and functional information were fused into\nmultimodal data to obtain more comprehensive and abundant features for patients\nwith SZ. Subsequently, a sparse interaction mechanism was proposed to\neffectively extract salient features and enhance the feature representation\ncapability. By enhancing the strong connections and weakening the weak\nconnections between feature information based on an asymmetric convolutional\nnetwork, high-order interactive features were captured. Moreover, sparse\nlearning strategies were designed to filter out redundant connections to\nimprove model performance. Finally, local and global features were updated in\naccordance with the topological features and connection weight constraints of\nthe higher-order brain network, the features being projected to the\nclassification target space for disorder classification. The effectiveness of\nthe model is verified on the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)\nand University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) datasets, achieving 81.9\\% and\n75.8\\% average accuracy, respectively, 4.6\\% and 5.5\\% higher than the graph\nattention network (GAT) method. Experiments showed that the Multi-SIGATnet\nmethod exhibited good performance in identifying SZ.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
