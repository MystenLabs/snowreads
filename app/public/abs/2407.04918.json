It is well known that no-go\nconstraints may arise in cases of explicit symmetry-breaking in curved\nspacetime as a consequence of the Bianchi identities; we show in this work that\ncertain terms in the action can be countenanced and used to cancel would-be\nno-go constraints, at least in the linearized gravity limit. Nonetheless, we go\non to find more potential no-go issues, and we show that one particular\nexplicit breaking subset of the EFT, while evading direct no-go constraints,\nresults in unsuppressed additional polarizations for gravitational waves. In a\ngeneral treatment of the explicit breaking EFT, but confined to linearized\ngravity, we explicitly show the existence of an extra degree of freedom,\nindependent of coordinates. We find extra polarizations of gravitational waves\nin the solutions, with a scalar mode unsuppressed by any coefficient, which\ncould render these cases as no-go as well.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
