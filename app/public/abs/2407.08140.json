Recently,\nBayesian fitting procedures for SEMs have received more attention thanks to\ntheir potential to facilitate the adoption of more flexible model structures,\nand variational approximations have been shown to provide fast and accurate\ninference for Bayesian analysis of SEMs. However, the application of\nvariational approximations is currently limited to very simple, elemental SEMs.\nWe develop mean-field variational Bayes algorithms for two SEM formulations for\ndata that present non-Gaussian features such as skewness and multimodality. The\nproposed models exploit the use of mixtures of Gaussians, include covariates\nfor the analysis of latent traits and consider missing data. We also examine\ntwo variational information criteria for model selection that are\nstraightforward to compute in our variational inference framework. The\nperformance of the MFVB algorithms and information criteria is investigated in\na simulated data study and a real data application.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
