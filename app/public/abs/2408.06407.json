These\nsolutions have important features in optics and mechanics. We use these\nsimilarities for a better understanding of these theories. We know that, the\nvacuum in the DSR has an effective refractive index which depends on the\nfrequency of the light. We find this modified refractive index which leads us\nto a modified Electrodynamics with some new interesting aspects, for example\nnear the Planck energy the electric field can be stronger or weaker than the\nusual case. Also, we will find a new modified Lorentz transformations in the\nfirst order of the Planck length which are very similar to the usual Lorentz\ntransformations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"jsk_t27GDhYuE1O_GzzW5MjEvtuxSPqPpDMVpIOGbyA","pdfSize":"90062"}
