We devised a concise and portable pulsed magnetic field\ngenerator that produces a 40 T field with a pulse duration of 2 ms. It is\nassembled using only off-the-shelf components and a homemade coil that\nleverages small computers, Raspberry Pi, and Python codes. It allows for\nstraightforward modification for general purposes. As working examples, we show\nrepresentative applications in condensed matter experiments of\nmagnetoresistance, magnetization, and magnetostriction measurements for\ngraphite, NdNi$_{2}$P$_{2}$, and NdCo$_{2}$P$_{2}$, respectively, with the\nmaximum magnetic field of 41 T and the lowest temperature of 4.2 K.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jaOpy36IowRgOWBEaAdl0LQ5itXNVi21M0wuZYIGfFo","pdfSize":"9797922","objectId":"0x1a4f98e47e7380eb4676e0dda104e26e2f31bd15cf54a927ec8b4b681555ee4d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
