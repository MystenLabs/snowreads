The\nincidence of this dangerous cancer continues to rise, making accurate and rapid\ndiagnosis, particularly in the early stages, critically important. While modern\nComputer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can address most cases, medical\nprofessionals still face challenges in using them in the field without powerful\ncomputing resources. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN model called BCDNet,\nwhich effectively detects IDC in histopathological images with an accuracy of\nup to 89.5% and reduces training time effectively.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
