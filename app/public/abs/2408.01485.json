We show that the phase space is in both cases\nparameterized by the leading soft variables in asymptotically flat spacetimes,\nthereby extending the equivalence between shockwave and soft commutators to\nspacetimes with non-vanishing Bondi mass. We then demonstrate that our on-shell\naction is equal to three quantities studied separately in the literature: $(i)$\nthe soft supertranslation charge; $(ii)$ the shockwave effective action, or\nequivalently the modular Hamiltonian; and $(iii)$ the soft effective action.\nFinally, we compute the quantum fluctuations in the soft supertranslation\ncharge and, assuming the supertranslation parameter may be promoted to an\noperator, we obtain an area law, consistent with earlier results showing that\nthe modular Hamiltonian has such fluctuations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vyTotuyl--lLoxhVxIc6MB3bDU8qWftyW42hBi1ZKv8","pdfSize":"499389"}
