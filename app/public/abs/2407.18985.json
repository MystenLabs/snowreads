With the growing\nprevalence of voice-activated devices such as Amazon Alexa, ensuring secure and\nuser-specific interactions has become paramount. Our study aims to enhance the\nsecurity framework of these systems by leveraging wake words for initial\nactivation and speaker recognition to validate user permissions. By\nincorporating these AI-driven methodologies, we propose a robust solution that\nrestricts system usage to authorized individuals, thereby mitigating\nunauthorized access risks. This research delves into the algorithms and\ntechnologies underpinning wake word detection and speaker recognition,\nevaluates their effectiveness in real-world applications, and discusses the\npotential for their implementation in various embedded systems, emphasizing\nsecurity and user convenience. The findings underscore the feasibility and\nadvantages of employing these AI techniques to create secure, user-friendly\nvoice-activated systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mZ42XNcQnpMKET7uA4uTJyLeViBBIEC03gdO25vtE44","pdfSize":"146243"}
