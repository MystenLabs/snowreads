With\ncontinuum model and maximally localized Wannier function approaches, we\nidentify a quadratic dispersion relationship between the bandwidth, interaction\nparameters versus the twist angle, in contrast to twisted bilayer graphene\n(TBG). Introducing Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling to TBG greatly reduces the\nfractional Chern insulator indicator and enhances the stability of fractional\nChern states near the magic angle, as confirmed by exact diagonalization\ncalculations. Moreover, in twisted bilayer Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ with intrinsic\nKane-Mele spin-orbit coupling, we identify a topological flat band at a large\ntwist angle around 4 degrees.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
