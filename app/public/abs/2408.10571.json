However, these advancements bring forth risks including privacy\nbreaches and unauthorized replication of artworks. Previous researches\nprimarily center around using prompt-specific methods to generate adversarial\nexamples to protect personal images, yet the effectiveness of existing methods\nis hindered by constrained adaptability to different prompts. In this paper, we\nintroduce a Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation (PAP) method for\ncustomized diffusion models. PAP first models the prompt distribution using a\nLaplace Approximation, and then produces prompt-agnostic perturbations by\nmaximizing a disturbance expectation based on the modeled distribution. This\napproach effectively tackles the prompt-agnostic attacks, leading to improved\ndefense stability. Extensive experiments in face privacy and artistic style\nprotection, demonstrate the superior generalization of our method in comparison\nto existing techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
