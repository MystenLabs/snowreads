Similar to non-wearable robots, it is\nimportant to measure the trust a person has that the robot can support\nachieving the desired goals. While some measures of trust may apply to all\npotential robotic roles, there are key distinctions between wearable and\nnon-wearable robotic systems. In this paper, we considered the dimensions and\nsub-dimensions of trust, with example attributes defined for exoskeleton\napplications. As the research community comes together to discuss measures of\ntrust, it will be important to consider how the selected measures support\ninterpreting trust along different dimensions for the variety of robotic\nsystems that are emerging in the field in a way that leads to actionable\noutcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
