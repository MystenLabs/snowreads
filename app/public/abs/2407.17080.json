The vortices, in the majority\ncomponent, exhibit a filled core, where the in-filling minority component\nundergoes a quantum tunneling effect. Remarkably, we observe that the\ntwo-vortex system features stable Josephson oscillations, as well as all the\nnonlinear phenomena, including the macroscopic quantum self-trapping, that\ncharacterize a Bosonic Josephson Junction (BJJ). We propose an analytical model\nfor describing the inter-vortex tunneling, obtained by implementing the a\ncoherent-state representation of the two-mode Bose-Hubbard model. This allows\nus to give the explicit expression of the model's parameters in terms of the\nphysical macroscopic parameters of the two-vortex system. The comparison of the\ndynamical scenario predicted by the model with that emerging from the\nGross-Pitaevskii equations is very good for sufficiently small particle\nnumbers, while at larger particle numbers it grows less precise, presumably due\nto the partial exclusion of the many-body interactions from our model. The\ndefinition of an effective self-interaction parameter allows us to include the\nmany-body effects, thus restoring a quite good agreement with the numerical\nresults. Interestingly, the recognition of the bosonic Josephson dynamics paves\nthe way to the investigation of new dynamical behaviors in multi-vortex\nconfigurations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
