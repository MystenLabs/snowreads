The flow is governed by the 3D compressible\nNavier-Stokes-Fourier system coupled with the equations of species mass\nfractions. The fluid velocity is supposed to fulfill the complete slip boundary\ncondition, whereas the heat flux and species diffusion fluxes satisfy the\nconservative boundary conditions. The existence of weak solutions is obtained\nby means of suitable approximation techniques. To this end, we need to\nrigorously analyze the penalization of the boundary behavior, viscosity and the\npressure in the weak formulation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
