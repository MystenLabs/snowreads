In this paper, we study this result through\nthe lens of discrete Morse theory. This requires a suitable simplicial model\nfor the loop space. Here, we use Milnor's $\\textrm{F}^+\\textrm{K}$ construction\nto model the loop space of the sphere $S^2$, describe a discrete gradient on\nit, and identify a collection of critical cells. We also compute the action of\nthe boundary operator in the Morse complex on these critical cells, showing\nthat they are potential homology generators. A careful analysis allows us to\nrecover the calculation of the first homology of $\\Omega S^2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
