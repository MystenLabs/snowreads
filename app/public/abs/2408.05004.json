Making use of the embedding of the Type IIB theory into the\n$\\mathrm{E}_{6(6)}$ exceptional field theory we derive explicit transformation\nrules for four-vector deformations. We prove that the algebraic condition\nfollowing from the Type IIB realization of exceptional Drinfeld algebras is\nsufficient for the transformation to generate a solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
