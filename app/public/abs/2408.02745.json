In particular,\ntwo unital separable simple nuclear $\\mathcal Z$-stable C$^*$-algebras which\neither have real rank zero or unique trace are isomorphic if and only if they\nare homotopy equivalent. It is further shown that two finite strongly\nself-absorbing C$^*$-algebras are isomorphic if and only if they are\n$KK$-equivalent in a unit-preserving way.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
