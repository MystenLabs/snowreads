However, the\nproduction of reproducible devices remains challenging, partly due to\nvariability at the nanometer to atomic scales. Thus, access to chemical,\nstructural, and optical characterization at these lengthscales is essential.\nWhile electron microscopy and spectroscopy can provide chemical and structural\ndata, accessing the optical response at the nanoscale through electron\nspectroscopies has been hindered until recently. This review focuses on the\napplication of two electron spectroscopies in scanning (transmission) electron\nmicroscopes, namely cathodoluminescence and electron energy-loss spectroscopy,\nto study the nano-optics of TMD atomic layers and their vdW heterostructures.\nWe discuss how technological advancements that can improve these\nspectroscopies, many of which are already underway, will make them ideal for\nstudying the physics of vdW heterostructures at the nanoscale.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
