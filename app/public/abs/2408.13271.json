This survey paper comprehensively explores the\nfoundational principles of CBFs, delves into the complexities of High Order\nControl Barrier Functions (HOCBFs), and extends the discussion to the adaptive\nrealm with adaptive Control Barrier Functions (aCBFs). Through a systematic\nexamination of theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and the\nevolving landscape of research, this survey highlights the versatility of CBFs\nin addressing safety and stability challenges.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
