We consider the constrains on the Odderon properties and the\nperturbative QCD Odderon given at the lowest $\\alpha_s$ order by the three\ngluon exchange. Then we discuss the experimental indications for the Odderon\ncontribution to high energy proton-proton elastic scattering and some other\nprocesses in which the Odderon may reveal itself.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
