To\nconstruct the relevant tetraquark currents we need to explicitly add the\ncovariant derivative operator. Our systematic analysis of these interpolating\ncurrents indicates that: a) this state readily decays into the $P$-wave $[\\rho\nJ/\\psi] / [\\omega J/\\psi ]$ channel but not into the $ [\\rho \\chi_{c2}]/[\\omega\n\\chi_{c2}]/[J/\\psi f_2(1270)]$ channels, and b) it readily decays into the\n$[D^* \\bar D_2^*]$ channel but not into the $P$-wave $[D^* \\bar D^*]$ channel.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i1Z4RNvgaROO9RrgRoC4La6RtyWToSLmuibCuRjCP-w","pdfSize":"339011"}
