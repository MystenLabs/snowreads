In fact, we present a new approach to the construction of conserved\nquantities and comment about the solutions of the equations of motion; we\ndisplay mostly new analytical and numerical results, starting from the\nclassical predator-prey model till the general $N-$species model.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9_iFPUtDrJ4J1RC-mM37XZT7gbUXXYgENk96RAssOP4","pdfSize":"1208960"}
