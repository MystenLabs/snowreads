Consequently, nonlinearities are\nwidespread in nanomechanics and determine the critical characteristics of\nnanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonators. A thorough understanding of\nthe nonlinear dynamics of higher eigenmodes of NEMS resonators would be\nbeneficial for progress, given their use in applications and fundamental\nstudies. Here, we characterize the nonlinearity and the linear dynamic range\n(LDR) of each eigenmode of two nanomechanical beam resonators with different\nintrinsic tension values up to eigenmode $n=11$. We find that the modal Duffing\nconstant increases as $n^4$, while the critical amplitude for the onset of\nnonlinearity decreases as $1/n$. The LDR, determined from the ratio of the\ncritical amplitude to the thermal noise amplitude, increases weakly with $n$.\nOur findings are consistent with our theory treating the beam as a string, with\nthe nonlinearity emerging from stretching at high amplitudes. These scaling\nlaws, observed in experiments and validated theoretically, can be leveraged for\npushing the limits of NEMS-based sensing even further.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0jmt_E1SMd0wrIMfBToeAMy2EKywBteALPyuSIjt0bE","pdfSize":"2098014"}
