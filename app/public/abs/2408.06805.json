We establish and substantiate the fact that depending on the\nchoice of initial conditions, the neurons in the network are divided into\nclusters and whenever these clusters are phase synchronized intermittently,\nextreme events originate in the collective observable. This mechanism, which we\nname as intermittent cluster synchronization is proposed as the new precursor\nfor the generation of extreme events in this system. These results are also\ntrue for electrical diffusive coupling. The distribution of the local maxima\nshows long tailed non-Gaussian while the interevent interval follows the\nWeibull distribution. The goodness of fit are corroborated using\nprobability-probability plot and quantile-quantile plot. These extreme events\nbecome rarer and rarer with the increase in the number of different initial\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
