In order to\naddress this essential issue and enhance the safety and efficiency of connected\nand autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at multi-lane merging zones, we propose a novel\ncollaborative decision-making framework, named AgentsCoMerge, to leverage large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Specifically, we first design a scene observation and\nunderstanding module to allow an agent to capture the traffic environment. Then\nwe propose a hierarchical planning module to enable the agent to make decisions\nand plan trajectories based on the observation and the agent's own state. In\naddition, in order to facilitate collaboration among multiple agents, we\nintroduce a communication module to enable the surrounding agents to exchange\nnecessary information and coordinate their actions. Finally, we develop a\nreinforcement reflection guided training paradigm to further enhance the\ndecision-making capability of the framework. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed method, demonstrating its\nsuperior efficiency and effectiveness for multi-agent collaborative\ndecision-making under various ramp merging scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
