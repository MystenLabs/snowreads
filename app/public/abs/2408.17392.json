Conventional dose escalation methods\nidentify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose-limiting toxicity\n(DLT). However, as cancer therapies have evolved from chemotherapy to targeted\ntherapies, these traditional methods have become problematic. Many targeted\ntherapies rarely produce DLT and are administered over multiple cycles,\npotentially resulting in the accumulation of lower-grade toxicities, which can\nlead to intolerance, such as dose reduction or interruption. To address this\nissue, we proposed dual-criterion designs that find the MTD based on both DLT\nand non-DLT-caused intolerance. We considered the model-based design and\nmodel-assisted design that allow real-time decision-making in the presence of\npending data due to long event assessment windows. Compared to DLT-based\nmethods, our approaches exhibit superior operating characteristics when\nintolerance is the primary driver for determining the MTD and comparable\noperating characteristics when DLT is the primary driver.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
