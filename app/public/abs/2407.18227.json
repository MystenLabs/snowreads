However, despite their\nsuccess, current approaches generally issue predictions using data from a\nsingle modality. This stands in stark contrast with clinician decision-making\nwhich employs diverse information from multiple sources. While several\nmultimodal machine learning approaches exist, significant challenges in\ndeveloping multimodal systems remain that are hindering clinical adoption. In\nthis paper, we introduce a multimodal framework, AutoPrognosis-M, that enables\nthe integration of structured clinical (tabular) data and medical imaging using\nautomated machine learning. AutoPrognosis-M incorporates 17 imaging models,\nincluding convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, and three\ndistinct multimodal fusion strategies. In an illustrative application using a\nmultimodal skin lesion dataset, we highlight the importance of multimodal\nmachine learning and the power of combining multiple fusion strategies using\nensemble learning. We have open-sourced our framework as a tool for the\ncommunity and hope it will accelerate the uptake of multimodal machine learning\nin healthcare and spur further innovation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N4GdOBAqjCa8vhTOtuIBb3JrMLZGM12gjLJSLEMEh3o","pdfSize":"1283176"}
