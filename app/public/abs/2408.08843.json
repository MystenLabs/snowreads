In this context, we introduce the Python package\nHigh-throughput Organic Crystal Structure Prediction (HTOCSP), which enables\nthe prediction and screening of crystal packing for small organic molecules in\nan automated, high-throughput manner. Specifically, we describe the workflow,\nwhich encompasses molecular analysis, force field generation, and crystal\ngeneration and sampling, all within customized constraints based on user input.\nWe demonstrate the application of \\texttt{HTOCSP} by systematically screening\norganic crystals for 100 molecules using different sampling strategies and\nforce field options. Furthermore, we analyze the benchmark results to\nunderstand the underlying factors that influence the complexity of the crystal\nenergy landscape. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of the package\nand potential future extensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
