The distinctive property of the proposed family is invariance under the\nactions of the group of disc-preserving conformal mappings. The\ngroup-invariance property renders it a convenient and tractable model for\nencoding uncertainties in hyperbolic data. Potential applications in Geometric\nDeep Learning and bioinformatics are numerous, some of them are briefly\ndiscussed. We also emphasize analogies with hyperbolic coherent states in\nquantum physics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HAAi4bY5oJBB21ok_mzbjvc9mAfWzkIAvx3C0iUXJxs","pdfSize":"239269"}
