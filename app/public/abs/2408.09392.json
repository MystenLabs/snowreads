The scheme\nis divided into two main parts. The first part involves the calculation of the\nCahn-Hilliard equations, and the other part is calculating the Navier-Stokes\nequations subsequently by utilizing the phase field and chemical potential\nvalues obtained from the above step. Specifically, the velocity in the\nCahn-Hilliard equation is discretized explicitly at the discrete time level,\nwhich enables the computation of the Cahn-Hilliard equations is fully decoupled\nfrom that of Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, the pressure-correction\nprojection method, in conjunction with the scalar auxiliary variable approach\nnot only enables the discrete scheme to satisfy unconditional energy stability,\nbut also allows the convective term in the Navier-Stokes equations to be\ntreated explicitly. We subsequently prove that the time semi-discrete scheme is\nunconditionally stable and analyze the optimal error estimates for the fully\ndiscrete scheme. Finally, several numerical experiments validate the\ntheoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
