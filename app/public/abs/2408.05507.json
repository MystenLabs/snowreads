However, owing to their intrinsic strain-limiting layer design, these\nsoft grippers possess a singular gripping functionality, rendering them\nincapable of adapting to diverse gripping tasks with different strategies.\nBased on our previous work, we introduce a novel soft gripper that offers\nvariable stiffness, an adjustable gripping range, and multifunctionality. The\nMASH actuator based soft gripper can expand its gripping range up to threefold\ncompared to the original configuration and ensures secure grip by enhancing\nstiffness when handling heavy objects. Moreover, it supports multitasking\ngripping through specific gripping strategy control.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
