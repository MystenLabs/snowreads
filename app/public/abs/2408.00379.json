Traditional way to find these defective\nIRS elements requires a thorough diagnosis of all the circuits belonging to a\nhuge number of IRS elements, which is practically challenging. In this paper,\nwe will devise a novel approach under which a transmitter sends known pilot\nsignals and a receiver localizes all the defective IRS elements just based on\nits over-the-air measurements reflected from the IRS. The key lies in the fact\nthat the over-the-air measurements at the receiver side are functions of the\nset of defective IRS elements. Based on this observation, we propose a\nbisection based method to localize all the defective IRS elements.\nSpecifically, at each time slot, we properly control the desired phase shifts\nof all the IRS elements such that half of the considered regime that is not\nuseful to localize the defective elements can be found based on the received\nsignals and removed. Via numerical results, it is shown that our proposed\nbisection method can exploit the over-the-air measurements to localize all the\ndefective IRS elements quickly and accurately.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
