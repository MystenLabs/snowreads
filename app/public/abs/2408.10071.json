Here, we used\n0.5Ba(Zr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$)O$_3$-0.5Ba(Zr$_{0.7}$Ti$_{0.3}$)O$_3$ (BCZT) as a\nmodel relaxor ferroelectric oxide system and La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ as the\nsacrificial layer for demonstration. Arrays of SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) / BCZT / SRO\nferroelectric capacitor mesas were first defined and isolated on the growth\nwafer, and then they were released using epitaxial lift-off with\nlithography-defined surrounding etching holes, after which the freestanding\ndevice arrays were integrated onto a glass substrate. Our proposed strategy\nsheds light on preparing various freestanding single-crystalline oxide devices\nand paves the way for their heterogeneous integration onto arbitrary substates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4oTc6glSEuhHNMdciaSAPqS7npGi11kWWxNbNkYvPTQ","pdfSize":"1350629"}
