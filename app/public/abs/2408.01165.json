We explore the impact of adding new particles as the\nmediators in the electron-proton scattering on these ratios. Consequently, we\nfind some bound on the scalar coupling as $\\alpha_{sc}\\sim 10^{-5}$ for\n$m_{sc}\\sim 5 MeV-2 GeV$ and $\\alpha_{sc}\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for $m_{sc}\\sim\n2-10 GeV$. Meanwhile, the vector coupling is bounded as $\\alpha_v\\sim 10^{-5}$\nfor $m_v\\sim 5 MeV-1.1 GeV$ and $\\alpha_v\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for $m_v\\sim\n1.2-10 GeV$. These constraints are in complete agreement with those which is\nfound from other independent experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8wcPmznqGhrItU5zZ9JvLsDVUuJt0cIFjFqbEn3pJIs","pdfSize":"301224"}
