These regularising terms can be\nobtained by field redefinitions and allow to rewrite the resulting equations of\nmotion as a system of second-order nonlinear wave equations. For instance, our\nresult applies to the quadratic, cubic, and quartic truncations of the\neffective field theory of gravity that have previously appeared in the\nliterature. The regularising terms correspond to fiducial massive modes,\nhowever, their masses can be chosen to be non-tachyonic and heavier than the\ncutoff scale and hence these modes should not affect the dynamics in the regime\nof validity of effective field theory. Our well-posed formulation is not\nlimited to the weakly coupled regime of these theories, is manifestly covariant\nand does neither require fine tuning of free parameters nor involves\nprescribing arbitrary equations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
