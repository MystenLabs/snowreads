This paper proposes a novel approach to identify and estimate\ncausal effects in the presence of endogeneity. We consider a structural\nequation with endogenous exposures and an additive error term. Assuming the\nlight-tailedness of the error term, we show that the causal effect can be\nidentified by contrasting extreme conditional quantiles of the outcome given\nthe exposures. Unlike many existing results, our identification approach does\nnot rely on additional parametric assumptions or auxiliary variables. Building\non the identification result, we develop an EXtreme-based Causal Effect\nLearning (EXCEL) method that estimates the causal effect using extreme quantile\nregression. We establish the consistency of the EXCEL estimator under a general\nadditive structural equation and demonstrate its asymptotic normality in the\nlinear model setting. These results reveal that extreme quantile regression is\ninvulnerable to endogeneity when the error term is light-tailed, which is not\nappreciated in the literature to our knowledge. The EXCEL method is applied to\ncausal inference problems with invalid instruments to construct a valid\nconfidence set for the causal effect. Simulations and data analysis of an\nautomobile sale dataset show the effectiveness of our method in addressing\nendogeneity.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
