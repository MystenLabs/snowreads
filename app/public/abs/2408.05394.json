These examples -- and many\nothers -- can be formulated as the following eigenproblem: given a self-adjoint\noperator $\\mathcal{L}$ on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ and a closed subspace\n$W\\subset\\mathcal{H}$, can we identify all eigenvectors of $\\mathcal{L}$ that\nlie approximately in $W$?\n  We develop an approach to answer this question efficiently, with a\nuser-defined tolerance and range of eigenvalues, building upon recent work for\nspatial localization in diffusion operators (Ovall and Reid, 2023). Namely, by\nperturbing $\\mathcal{L}$ appropriately along the subspace $W$, we collect the\neigenvectors near $W$ into a well-isolated region of the spectrum, which can\nthen be explored using any of several existing methods. We prove key bounds on\nperturbations of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, showing that our algorithm\ncorrectly identifies desired eigenpairs, and we support our results with\nseveral numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
