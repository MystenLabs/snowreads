Here, we explore the photofragmentation\nbehaviour of the coronene cation (C24H12+) using time of flight mass\nspectrometry. The experiments show photodissociation fragmentation channels\nincluding the formation of bare carbon clusters (Cn+) and hydrocarbon chains\n(CnHx+). The mass spectrum of coronene is dominated by peaks from C11+ and\nC7H+. Density functional theory was used to calculate relative energies,\npotential dissociation pathways, and possible structures for relevant species.\nWe identify 6-6 to 5-7 ring isomerisation as a key step in the formation of\nboth the bare carbon clusters and the hydrocarbon chains observed in this\nstudy. We present the dissociation mechanism outlined here as a potential\nformation route for C60 and other astrochemically relevant species.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
