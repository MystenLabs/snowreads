The here presented study analyses simulations of\nthe scrape-off layer (SOL) of the stellarator Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) using\nspatially varying diffusion coefficients for the magnetic standard\nconfiguration, extending our previous study. Comparing the EMC3-Eirene\nsimulations with experimental observations, an inconsistency between the\nstrike-line width (SLW) and the upstream parameters was observed. While to\nmatch the experimental SLW a particle diffusion coefficient $D \\approx 0.2$ is\nneeded, $D \\approx 1$ is needed to get experimental separatrix temperatures of\n50\\,eV at the given experimental heating power. We asses the impact of\nphysically motivated spatially varying transport coeffients. Agreement with\nexperimental data can be improved, but various differences remain. We show that\ndrifts are expected to help overcome the discrepancies and, thus, the\ndevelopment of SOL transport models including drifts is a necessary next step\nto study the SOL transport of the W7-X stellarator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6vBUcc5bRBep5rnL3nZhaMwz3THXMefZt5gK6j4bvg4","pdfSize":"6942556"}
