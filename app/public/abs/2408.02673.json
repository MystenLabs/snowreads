The 2D GO films with highly anisotropic light absorption are\non-chip integrated with precise control over their thicknesses and sizes.\nDetailed measurements are performed for the fabricated devices with different\nGO film thicknesses, coating lengths, and Si waveguide widths. The results show\nthat a maximum polarization-dependent loss (PDL) of ~17 dB is achieved for the\nhybrid waveguides, and the hybrid MRRs achieved a maximum polarization\nextinction ratio (PER) of ~10 dB. We also characterize the wavelength- and\npower-dependent response for these polarizers. The former demonstrates a broad\noperation bandwidth of over ~100 nm, and the latter verifies performance\nimprovement enabled by photo-thermal changes in GO films. By fitting the\nexperimental results with theoretical simulations, we find that the anisotropy\nin the loss of GO films dominates the polarization selectivity of these\ndevices. These results highlight the strong potential of 2D GO films for\nrealizing high-performance polarization selective devices in Si photonic\nplatform.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
