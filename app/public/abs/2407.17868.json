The flux of the muons penetrating the beam dump was scanned\nvertically at intervals of 0.5 m, showing a wide distribution with a maximum at\nthe beam level. The muon flux was consistent with the expectation from a\nMonte-Carlo simulation at more than 1 m away from the beam axis, which is\nexpected to be used for signal-loss evaluation in the future KOTO II experiment\nfor measuring rare kaon decays. The data can also be used in improving the\naccuracy of shielding calculations in the radiation protection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
