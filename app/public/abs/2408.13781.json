In this context, open 6G development involves multiple\ndisciplines and requires advanced simulation approaches for testing. In this\ndemo paper, we propose a generative simulation approach based on a multi-agent\nLarge Language Model (LLM) and Network Simulator 3 (ns-3), called Generative\nOpen xG Network Simulation (GenOnet), to effectively generate, debug, execute,\nand interpret simulated Open Fifth-Generation (5G) environments. The first\nversion of GenOnet application represents a specialized adaptation of the\nOpenAI GPT models. It incorporates supplementary tools, agents, 5G standards,\nand seamless integration with ns-3 simulation capabilities, supporting both C++\nvariants and Python implementations. This release complies with the latest Open\nRadio Access Network (O-RAN) and 3GPP standards.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
