However, topic modelling is usually\ncompleted in one shot. Assessing the quality of resulting topics is\nchallenging. No effective methods or measures have been developed for assessing\nthe results or for making further enhancements to the topics. In this research,\nwe propose we propose to use an iterative process to perform topic modelling\nthat gives rise to a sense of completeness of the resulting topics when the\nprocess is complete. Using the BERTopic package, a popular method in topic\nmodelling, we demonstrate how the modelling process can be applied iteratively\nto arrive at a set of topics that could not be further improved upon using one\nof the three selected measures for clustering comparison as the decision\ncriteria. This demonstration is conducted using a subset of the COVIDSenti-A\ndataset. The early success leads us to believe that further research using in\nusing this approach in conjunction with other topic modelling algorithms could\nbe viable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
