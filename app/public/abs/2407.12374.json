While CDR offers substantial potential for\nenhancing recommendation performance, most existing CDR methods suffer from\nsensitivity to the ratio of overlapping users and intrinsic discrepancy between\nsource and target domains. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we\nexplore the application of graph signal processing (GSP) in CDR scenarios. We\npropose CGSP, a unified CDR framework based on GSP, which employs a\ncross-domain similarity graph constructed by flexibly combining target-only\nsimilarity and source-bridged similarity. By processing personalized graph\nsignals computed for users from either the source or target domain, our\nframework effectively supports both inter-domain and intra-domain\nrecommendations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CGSP consistently\noutperforms various encoder-based CDR approaches in both intra-domain and\ninter-domain recommendation scenarios, especially when the ratio of overlapping\nusers is low, highlighting its significant practical implication in real-world\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
