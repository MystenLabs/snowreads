We\nprove that if the equilibrium state has a triple zero eigenvalue, then\npseudohyperbolic attractors of different types can arise as a result of the\nbifurcation. The first type is the classical Lorenz attractor and the second\ntype is the so-called Sim\\'o angel. The normal form of the considered\nbifurcation also serves as the normal form of the bifurcation of a periodic\norbit with multipliers $(-1, i, -i)$. Therefore, the results of this paper can\nalso be used to prove the emergence of discrete pseudohyperbolic attractors as\na result of this codimension-3 bifurcation, providing a theoretical\nconfirmation for the numerically observed Lorenz-like attractors and Sim\\'o\nangels in the three-dimensional H\\'enon map.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
