We show that\nthe sets of allowable flows always can be imbued with a downward closure\nproperty, which leads to a useful `calculus' of flows, allowing easy\ncombination and splitting of edges. We then derive a conic form for the convex\nflow problem, which we show is equivalent to the original problem and almost\nself-dual. Using this conic form, we consider the nonconvex flow problem with\nfixed costs on the edges, i.e., where there is some fixed cost to send any\nnonzero flow over an edge. We show that this problem has almost integral\nsolutions by a Shapley--Folkman argument, and we describe a rounding scheme\nthat works well in practice. Additionally, we provide a heuristic for this\nnonconvex problem which is a simple modification of our original algorithm. We\nconclude by discussing a number of interesting avenues for future work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
