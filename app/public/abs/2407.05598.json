The currently estimations predict\nthree bound states with estimated masses to be 2886 MeV, 3039 MeV, and 3153\nMeV, respectively. Additionally, three resonance states are identified in\nvarious scattering phase shifts processes. Among them, two resonance states\n$\\Sigma D$ and $\\Sigma^{\\ast}D^{\\ast}$ with quantum number\n$\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2}^{-})$ are detected in channels $ND_{s}^{\\ast}$ and\n$ND$, and $\\Sigma D^{\\ast}$ and $\\Lambda D$, with masses and decay widths of\n($M_{R}=3053\\sim3055$ MeV, $T_{total}=13.0\\sim13.4$ MeV) and\n($M_{R}=3389\\sim3390$ MeV, $T_{total}=10.4$ MeV), respectively. In the $\\Lambda\nD^{\\ast}$ and $\\Sigma D^{\\ast}$ channels, a resonance state with quantum number\n$\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{3}{2}^{-})$ is discovered, with its mass and decay width\nbeing $3250\\sim3252$ MeV and 4.4 MeV, respectively. These predicted pentaquark\nstates have $\\bar{c}snnn$ quark compositions, allowing them to be recognized as\ngenuine pentaquark states. To validate these predictions, it is expected that\nupcoming experiments will further explore the predicted resonance and bound\nstates in these possible decay channels.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
