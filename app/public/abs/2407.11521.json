To this end, we consider the optimisation problem\nof removing $k$ edges from $G$ such that the resulting graph has minimal\nrobustness, simulating attacks or failures. In this paper, we propose total\nharmonic resistance as a new robustness measure for this purpose - and compare\nit to the recently proposed forest index [Zhu et al., IEEE Trans.\\ Inf.\\\nForensics and Security, 2023]. Both measures are related to the established\ntotal effective resistance measure, but their advantage is that they can handle\ndisconnected graphs. This is also important for originally connected graphs due\nto the removal of the $k$ edges. To compare our measure with the forest index,\nwe first investigate exact solutions for small examples. The best $k$ edges to\nselect when optimizing for the forest index lie at the periphery. Our proposed\nmeasure, in turn, prioritizes more central edges, which should be beneficial\nfor most applications. Furthermore, we adapt a generic greedy algorithm to our\noptimization problem with the total harmonic resistance. With this algorithm,\nwe perform a case study on the Berlin road network and also apply the algorithm\nto established benchmark graphs. The results are similar as for the small\nexample graphs above and indicate the higher suitability of the new measure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
