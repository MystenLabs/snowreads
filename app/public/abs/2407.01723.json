This\nsublimation-activated release (SAR) loading technique makes use of\nmicropositioners with tungsten probe tips, as well as the relatively fast rate\nof sublimation of camphor at room temperature, to selectively load particles\nhaving diameters ranging from $\\SI{8}{\\micro \\meter}$ to $\\SI{100}{\\micro\n\\meter}$ or more. The advantages of this method include its ability to\nselectively load unique particles or particles in limited supply, its low loss\ncompared to alternative techniques, the low speed of the particle when\nreleased, and the versatility of its design which allows for loading into traps\nwith complex geometries. SAR is demonstrated here by loading a particle into a\nmagneto-gravitational trap, but the technique could also be applicable to other\nlevitated optomechanical systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
