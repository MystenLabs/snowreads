Existing\ngraph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in\ndeveloping evolving representations for both entities and relational\nembeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these\nmodels to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious\ncorrelations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between\nevents. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false\ncorrelations. To address this, we propose an innovative causal enhanced graph\nrepresentation learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework\nintroduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil\nthe essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing task\nperformance. Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary\nrepresentations of entities and relations in a temporal graph sequence into two\ndistinct components, namely causal representations and confounding\nrepresentations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the\nutilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the\neffects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus\nachieving more robust and accurate predictions. Finally, extensive experimental\nresults on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our\nmodel in the link prediction task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
