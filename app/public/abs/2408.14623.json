Traditional information retrieval systems\ncan assist with this task, but most systems have not been designed with\nLLM-generated queries in mind. As such, there is a compelling need for\nintegrated systems that provide both retrieval and generation functionality\nwithin a single user interface.\n  We present MODOC, a modular user interface that leverages the capabilities of\nLLMs and provides assistance with detecting their confabulations, promoting\nintegrity in scientific writing. MODOC represents a significant step forward in\nscientific writing assistance. Its modular architecture supports flexible\nfunctions for retrieving information and for writing and generating text in a\nsingle, user-friendly interface.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
