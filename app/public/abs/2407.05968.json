Their origin is still unclear and one widely discussed scenario involves\na millisecond magnetar central engine. The GeV-TeV emission of SLSNe has been\npredicted in the literature but has not been convincingly detected yet. Here we\nreport the search for the $\\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of SN 2017egm,\none of the closest SLSNe detected so far, with the 15-year {\\it Fermi}-LAT Pass\n8 data. There is a transient $\\gamma$-ray source appearing about 2 months after\nthis event and lasting a few months. Both the peak time and the luminosity of\nthe GeV emission are consistent with the magnetar model prediction, suggesting\nthat such a GeV transient is the high-energy counterpart of SN 2017egm and the\ncentral engine of this SLSNe is a young magnetar.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
