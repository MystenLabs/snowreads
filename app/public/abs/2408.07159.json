The previously discovered (vectorial)\ntorsion/non-metricity equivalence is shown to be built-in as it corresponds to\na redefinition of the generators of the Weyl group. We present a generalisation\nof the torsion/non-metricity duality which includes, aside from the vector,\nalso a traceless 3-tensor with two antisymmetric indices and vanishing skew\nsymmetric part. A discussion of this relation in the case of minimally coupled\nmatter fields is given. We further point out that a Rarita-Schwinger field can\ncouple minimally to all the components of torsion and some components of\nnon-metricity. Alongside we present the same gauge construction for the\nPoincar\\'e and conformal groups. We show that even though the Weyl group is a\nsubgroup of the conformal group, the gauge theory of the latter is actually\nonly a special case of Weyl quadratic gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
