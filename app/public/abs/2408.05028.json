Irrespective of the exposure\nconditions and testing parameters, corrosion products have been reported to\nconsistently precipitate in a unique pattern within these macroscopic voids,\npreferentially along the void walls and growing inward. The underlying\nmechanisms governing corrosion product precipitation in macroscopic voids and\ntheir effects on long-term durability remain unclear. Through in-situ X-ray\ncomputed tomography observations, thermodynamic and kinetic considerations, and\nnumerical modelling of water transport within macroscopic voids, here, we\nprovide plausible hypotheses of the processes responsible for the precipitation\nof corrosion products along the walls of the voids. Understanding the\nmechanisms of corrosion product precipitation can offer insights into the\ndevelopment of stresses in and around the macroscopic interfacial void and the\ndurability of reinforced concrete structures. This contribution also discusses\nopportunities for different avenues for research to elucidate several\nmultiscale processes that influence the durability of reinforced concrete.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
