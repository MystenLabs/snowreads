The edge-connectivity of $G$, denoted by\n$\\lambda(G)$, is the minimum number of edges whose removal renders $G$\ndisconnected. Let $\\delta(G)$ be the minimum degree of $G$. It is well-known\nthat $\\lambda(G) \\leq \\delta(G)$, and graphs for which equality holds are said\nto be maximally edge-connected. The square $G^2$ of $G$ is the graph with the\nsame vertex set as $G$, in which two vertices are adjacent if their distance is\nnot more that $2$.\n  In this paper we present results on the edge-connectivity of the square of a\ngraph. We show that if the minimum degree of a connected graph $G$ of order $n$\nis at least $\\lfloor \\frac{n+2}{4}\\rfloor$, then $G^2$ is maximally\nedge-connected, and this result is best possible. We also give lower bounds on\n$\\lambda(G^2)$ for the case that $G^2$ is not maximally edge-connected: We\nprove that $\\lambda(G^2) \\geq \\kappa(G)^2 + \\kappa(G)$, where $\\kappa(G)$\ndenotes the connectivity of $G$, i.e., the minimum number of vertices whose\nremoval renders $G$ disconnected, and this bound is sharp. We further prove\nthat $\\lambda(G^2) \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda(G)^{3/2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda(G)$,\nand we construct an infinite family of graphs to show that the exponent $3/2$\nof $\\lambda(G)$ in this bound is best possible.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lgpHVb7dYmgUGKWLvaK1vexOK3JmWGKaRRZvGvBdNIU","pdfSize":"147688"}
