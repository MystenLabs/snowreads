We\nestablish that the mild solution to the Boltzmann equation on the torus is\nglobally well-posed, provided the initial data that satisfy bounded\nvelocity-weighted $L^{\\infty}$ norm and the smallness condition on the initial\nrelative entropy. Furthermore, we also study the asymptotic behavior of\nsolutions, converging to the global Maxwellian with an exponential rate. A key\npoint in the proof is to develop the pointwise estimate on the gain term of\nnon-linear collision operator for Gr\\\"{o}nwall's argument.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
