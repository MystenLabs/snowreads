This study\npresents the discovery of a relatively bright (V = 12.72), highly\nr-process-enhanced (r-II) star ([Eu/Fe] = +1.32, [Ba/Eu] = - 0.95), LAMOST\nJ020632.21 + 494127.9. This star was selected from the Large Sky Area\nMulti-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution (R ~\n7500) spectroscopic survey; follow-up high-resolution (R ~ 25,000) observations\nwere conducted with the High Optical Resolution Spectrograph (HORuS) installed\non the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The stellar parameters (${T_{\\rm eff}}$\n= 4130 K, $\\rm log\\,g $ = 1.52, $ \\rm[Fe/H] $ = $ - $0.54, $\\xi$ = 1.80 $\n\\rm{km\\,{s^{-1}}} $) have been inferred taking into account non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects. The abundances of [Ce/Fe], [Pr/Fe],\nand [Nd/Fe] are +0.19, +0.65 and +0.64, respectively, relatively low compared\nto the Solar r-process pattern normalized to Eu. This star has a high\nmetallicity ([Fe/H] = - 0.54) compared to most other highly r-process-enhanced\nstars, and has the highest measured abundance ratio of Eu to H ([Eu/H] =\n+0.78). It is classified as a thin-disk star based on its kinematics, and does\nnot appear to belong to any known stream or dwarf galaxy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
