To\naddress this imbalance, in this article, we propose a novel framework of\nphysical layer deception (PLD), which combines PLS with deception technologies\nto actively counteract wiretapping attempts. Combining a two-stage encoder with\nrandomized ciphering and non-orthogonal multiplexing, the PLD approach enables\nthe wireless communication system to proactively counter eavesdroppers with\ndeceptive messages. Relying solely on the superiority of the legitimate channel\nover the eavesdropping channel, the PLD framework can effectively protect the\nconfidentiality of the transmitted messages, even against eavesdroppers who\npossess knowledge equivalent to that of the legitimate receiver. We prove the\nvalidity of the PLD framework with in-depth analyses and demonstrate its\nsuperiority over conventional PLS approaches with comprehensive numerical\nbenchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
