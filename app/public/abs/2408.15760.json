Nevertheless, the\nexistence of such interactions is not precluded by observations nor by\ntheoretical considerations. A promising approach to probe the dark matter\nelectromagnetic properties is through the search of photon-mediated dark\nmatter-nucleus interactions in direct detection experiments. In this paper we\npresent a simple methodology to calculate the scattering rate in a direct\ndetection experiment for given values of the dark matter electric charge,\ncharge radius, electric- and magnetic- dipole moments and anapole moment. In\nour work we include contributions to the scattering from nuclear recoils and\nfrom the Migdal effect. We finally apply this formalism to determine exclusion\nlimits on the five electromagnetic interactions using data from XENON1T, LZ,\nPICO-60 and DS50 experiments, and we discuss the implications for a simplified\ndark matter model with t-channel mediators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
