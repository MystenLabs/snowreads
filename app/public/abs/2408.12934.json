The method fuses deep scores (e.g.,\nMegaDescriptor or DINOv2) and local matching similarity (e.g., LoFTR and\nLightGlue) to identify individual animals. The global and local information\nfusion is facilitated by similarity score calibration. In a zero-shot setting,\nrelying on local similarity score only, WildFusion achieved mean accuracy,\nmeasured on 17 datasets, of 76.2%. This is better than the state-of-the-art\nmodel, MegaDescriptor-L, whose training set included 15 of the 17 datasets. If\na dataset-specific calibration is applied, mean accuracy increases by 2.3%\npercentage points. WildFusion, with both local and global similarity scores,\noutperforms the state-of-the-art significantly - mean accuracy reached 84.0%,\nan increase of 8.5 percentage points; the mean relative error drops by 35%. We\nmake the code and pre-trained models publicly available5, enabling immediate\nuse in ecology and conservation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bUr0Wv3yQ3jqchMYNwe7GbMFxB1ZFcBQ2Xi8PkbPrjg","pdfSize":"6811127"}
