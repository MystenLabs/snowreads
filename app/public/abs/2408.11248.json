Given the difficulty in distinguishing brown-dwarf events from those\nproduced by binary lenses with nearly equal-mass components, we analyze all\nlensing events detected during the seasons that exhibit anomalies\ncharacteristic of binary-lens systems. Using the same criteria consistently\napplied in previous studies, we identify six additional brown dwarf candidates\nthrough the analysis of lensing events KMT-2022-BLG-0412, KMT-2022-BLG-2286,\nKMT-2023-BLG-0201, KMT-2023-BLG-0601, KMT-2023-BLG-1684, and KMT-2023-BLG-1743.\nAn examination of the mass posteriors shows that the median mass of the lens\ncompanions ranges from 0.02 $M_\\odot$ to 0.05 $M_\\odot$, indicating that these\ncompanions fall within the brown-dwarf mass range. The mass of the primary\nlenses ranges from 0.11 $M_\\odot$ to 0.68 $M_\\odot$, indicating that they are\nlow-mass stars with substantially lower masses compared to the Sun.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l70bIRqUbzU6OWCHBkYxx8wAMu4jOXBQWy0uPAp2bEg","pdfSize":"3846846"}
