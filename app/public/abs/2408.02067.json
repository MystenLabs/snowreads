It is known that the\nreconstruction is ambiguous if the scene points are contained in particular\nalgebraic varieties, called critical loci. To be more precise, from the\ndefinition of criticality, for the same reconstruction problem, two critical\nloci arise in a natural way. In the present paper, we investigate the relations\nbetween these two critical loci, and we prove that, under some mild smoothness\nhypotheses, (some of) their irreducible components are birational. To this end,\nwe introduce a unified critical locus that restores the symmetry between the\ntwo critical loci, and a natural commutative diagram relating the unified\ncritical locus and the two single critical loci. For technical reasons, but of\ninterest in its own, we also consider how a critical locus change when one\nincreases the number of views.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
