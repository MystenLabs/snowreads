In this work, we establish a\nbootstrap-based goodness-of-fit test which empirically works for all kinds of\nself-exciting point processes (and even beyond). In an infill-asymptotic\nsetting we also prove its asymptotic consistency, albeit only in the particular\ncase that the underlying point process is inhomogeneous Poisson.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
