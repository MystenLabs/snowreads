For many, the\ndefinition is a simple shortcut to Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning.\nHowever, there is far more depth and nuance to the field of Data Science than a\nsimple shortcut can provide. The School of Data Science at the University of\nVirginia has developed a novel model for the definition of Data Science. This\nmodel is based on identifying a unified understanding of the data work done\nacross all areas of Data Science. It represents a generational leap forward in\nhow we understand and teach Data Science. In this paper we will present the\ncore features of the model and explain how it unifies various concepts going\nfar beyond the analytics component of AI. From this foundation we will present\nour Undergraduate Major curriculum in Data Science and demonstrate how it\nprepares students to be well-rounded Data Science team members and leaders. The\npaper will conclude with an in-depth overview of the Foundations of Data\nScience course designed to introduce students to the field while also\nimplementing proven STEM oriented pedagogical methods. These include, for\nexample, specifications grading, active learning lectures, guest lectures from\nindustry experts and weekly gamification labs.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
