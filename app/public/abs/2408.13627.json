This paper presents a comprehensive survey of event\ncameras, tracing their evolution over time. It introduces the fundamental\nprinciples of event cameras, compares them with traditional frame cameras, and\nhighlights their unique characteristics and operational differences. The survey\ncovers various event camera models from leading manufacturers, key\ntechnological milestones, and influential research contributions. It explores\ndiverse application areas across different domains and discusses essential\nreal-world and synthetic datasets for research advancement. Additionally, the\nrole of event camera simulators in testing and development is discussed. This\nsurvey aims to consolidate the current state of event cameras and inspire\nfurther innovation in this rapidly evolving field.
