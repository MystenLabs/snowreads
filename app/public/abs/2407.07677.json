We are\ngiven a set of items each of which is associated with a rational size in the\ninterval [0,1], and a monotone non-decreasing non-negative cost function f\ndefined over the cardinalities of the subsets of items. A feasible solution is\na partition of the set of items into bins subject to the constraint that the\ntotal size of items in every bin is at most 1. Unlike bin packing, the goal\nfunction is to minimize the total cost of the bins where the cost of a bin is\nthe value of f applied on the cardinality of the subset of items packed into\nthe bin. We present an APTAS for this strongly NP-hard problem. We also provide\na complete complexity classification of the problem with respect to the choice\nof f.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
