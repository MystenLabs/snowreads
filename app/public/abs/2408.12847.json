The energy\nfunctional is based on the one proposed by [Berkels et al. Cartoon extraction\nbased on anisotropic image classification, SFB 611, 2006], which incorporates\nan orientation auto-adjustment mechanism, and our energy is a simplified\nversion which reduces the order of derivatives to improve computational\nefficiency. The aim of this paper is to establish a stable minimization process\nthat addresses some instability of the algorithm caused by the reduction of\nderivative order. As a part of the study, we here prove Main Theorems concerned\nwith the well-posedness of the pseudo-parabolic system, and provide a\nmathematically rigorous guarantee for the stability of the image denoising\nprocess derived from our system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
