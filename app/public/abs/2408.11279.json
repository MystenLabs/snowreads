When $f_{\\Lambda}(t)$\nis constant, the modified thermodynamic relation is equivalent to the\nformulation of the first law in standard cosmology. One side of this modified\nrelation describes thermodynamic quantities in the bulk and can be divided into\ntwo time-derivative terms, namely $\\dot{\\rho}$ and $\\dot{V}$ terms, where\n$\\rho$ is the mass density of cosmological fluids and $V$ is the Hubble volume.\nUsing the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\\rm{GH}}$, the other side of this\nrelation, $T_{\\rm{KH}} \\dot{S}_{\\rm{BH}}$, can be formulated as the sum of\n$T_{\\rm{GH}} \\dot{S}_{\\rm{BH}}$ and $[(T_{\\rm{KH}}/T_{\\rm{GH}}) -1] T_{\\rm{GH}}\n\\dot{S}_{\\rm{BH}}$, which are equivalent to the $\\dot{\\rho}$ and $\\dot{V}$\nterms, respectively, with the magnitude of the $\\dot{V}$ term being\nproportional to the square of the $\\dot{\\rho}$ term. In addition, the modified\nthermodynamic relation for constant $f_{\\Lambda}(t)$ is examined by applying\nthe equipartition law of energy on the horizon. This modified thermodynamic\nrelation reduces to a kind of extended holographic-like connection when a\nconstant $T_{\\rm{KH}}$ universe is considered. The evolution of thermodynamic\nquantities is also discussed, using a constant $T_{\\rm{KH}}$ model, extending a\nprevious analysis [Phys. Rev. D 108, 083515 (2023) (arXiv:2306.11285)].\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6tv65ehc3O4s4C2-wfF1VI0Sdl12KxQ8pj07gMWzBY4","pdfSize":"816766"}
