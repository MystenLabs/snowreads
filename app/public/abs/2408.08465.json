We extend the\nOnsager-Machlup functional from finite-dimensional to infinite-dimensional\nsystems, and from constant to time-varying diffusion coefficients. We first\nverify the existence and uniqueness of general SLDS solutions in the infinite\nsequence weighted space $l^2_{\\rho}$. Building on this foundation, we employ\ntechniques such as the infinite-dimensional Girsanov transform,\nKarhunen-Lo\\`eve expansion, and probability estimation of Brownian motion balls\nto derive the Onsager-Machlup functionals for SLDSs in $l^2_{\\rho}$ space.\nAdditionally, we use a numerical example to illustrate our theoretical\nfindings, based on the Euler Lagrange equation corresponding to the Onsage\nMachup functional.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
