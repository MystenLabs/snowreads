We prove\nthe soundness of our approach and show experimentally that the proposed method\noutperforms existing methods on both local and global path planning tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e8snPaAUWUQNQ0agyWcVuwh5fLuSmIXt3_Ra16xgqw8","pdfSize":"669328"}
