We derive\nexplicit formulas for the optimal terminal wealth and the optimal strategy in\nthe multi-dimensional Black-Scholes model, showing the existence of all\nnecessary parameters. In incomplete markets, we state Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nequations for the value function. Moreover, we provide a numerical analysis of\nthe Black-Scholes market. The equity holders on average increase their\ninvestment into the risky asset in bad economic states and decrease their\ninvestment over time.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
