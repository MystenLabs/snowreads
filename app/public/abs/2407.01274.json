For large\nclasses, however, the volume of feedback makes these tools impractical for this\npurpose. This paper explores the use of open-source generative AI to synthesise\nfactual, actionable and appropriate summaries of student feedback from these\nsurvey responses. In our setup, we have 742 student responses ranging over 75\ncourses in a Computer Science department. For each course, we synthesise a\nsummary of the course evaluations and actionable items for the instructor. Our\nresults reveal a promising avenue for enhancing teaching practices in the\nclassroom setting. Our contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility of\nusing generative AI to produce insightful feedback for teachers, thus providing\na cost-effective means to support educators' development. Overall, our work\nhighlights the possibility of using generative AI to produce factual,\nactionable, and appropriate feedback for teachers in the classroom setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
