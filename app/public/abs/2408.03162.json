In these\nsystems, the Topological Hall Effect (THE) manifests as humps or peaks in\nanomalous Hall Effect (AHE) loops near the coercive field. Numerous studies\nhave reported THE in ruthenate/iridate and ruthenate/manganite\nheterostructures. Among the manganites, the Nd0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (NSMO) system\nremains relatively less explored. The strontium ruthenate (SrRuO3 - SRO) system\nexhibits excellent structural compatibility with NSMO, making NSMO/SRO\nheterostructures a model system for investigating non-trivial spin textures at\noxide-based interfaces. In this work, we have studied the proximity effect of\nNSMO with SRO through magnetic and magnetotransport studies, varying the SRO\nlayer thicknesses in the NSMO/SRO heterostructures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
