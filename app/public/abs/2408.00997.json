In this paper, we introduce a new exploration framework for\nnavigating the grid environments that enables model-free agents to interact\nwith the environment while adhering to safety constraints. Our framework\nincludes a pre-training phase, during which the agent learns to identify\npotentially unsafe states based on both observable features and specified\nsafety constraints in the environment. Subsequently, a binary classification\nmodel is trained to predict those unsafe states in new environments that\nexhibit similar dynamics. This trained classifier empowers model-free agents to\ndetermine situations in which employing random exploration or a suboptimal\npolicy may pose safety risks, in which case our framework prompts the agent to\nfollow a predefined safe policy to mitigate the potential for hazardous\nconsequences. We evaluated our framework on three randomly generated grid\nenvironments and demonstrated how model-free agents can safely adapt to new\ntasks and learn optimal policies for new environments. Our results indicate\nthat by defining an appropriate safe policy and utilizing a well-trained model\nto detect unsafe states, our framework enables a model-free agent to adapt to\nnew tasks and environments with significantly fewer safety violations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
