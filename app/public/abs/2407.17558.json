Due to its fundamental role in many transport phenomena, it is\ncrucial to understand the robustness of superfluid properties to external\nperturbations. Here, we theoretically study the effects of speckle disorder on\nthe propagation of sound waves in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate at\nzero temperature. We numerically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the\npresence of disorder and employ a superfluid hydrodynamic approach to elucidate\nthe role of the compressibility and superfluid fraction on the propagation of\nsound. A key result is that disorder reduces the superfluid fraction and hence\nthe speed of sound; it also introduces damping and mode coupling. In the limit\nof weak disorder, the predictions for the speed of sound and its damping rate\nare well reproduced by a quadratic perturbation theory. The hydrodynamic\ndescription is valid over a wide range of parameters, while discrepancies\nbecome evident if the disorder becomes too strong, the effect being more\nsignificant for disorder applied in only one spatial direction. Our predictions\nare well within the reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments and carry\nover to more general disorder potentials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
