While these flows may exhibit rich and multiscale dynamics,\nin many cases underlying low-rank structures exist which describe the bulk of\nthe motion. These structures tend to be spatially large and temporally slow,\nand may contain most of the energy in a given flow. The extraction and\nparsimonious representation of these low-rank dynamics from high-dimensional\ndata is a key challenge. Inspired by the success of physics-informed machine\nlearning methods, we propose a spectrally-informed approach to extract low-rank\nmodels of fluid flows by leveraging known spectral properties in the learning\nprocess. We incorporate this knowledge by imposing regularizations on the\nlearned dynamics, which bias the training process towards learning\nlow-frequency structures with corresponding higher power. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this method to improve prediction and produce learned models\nwhich better match the underlying spectral properties of prototypical fluid\nflows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
