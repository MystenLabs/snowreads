Additionally, several surveys of these\nontologies have been conducted. However, these studies often lack comprehensive\nanalysis and quality control metrics. This paper provides an overview of\nontologies used in Materials Science and Engineering to assist domain experts\nin selecting the most suitable ontology for a given purpose. Sixty selected\nontologies are analyzed and compared based on the requirements outlined in this\npaper. Statistical data on ontology reuse and key metrics are also presented.\nThe evaluation results provide valuable insights into the strengths and\nweaknesses of the investigated MSE ontologies. This enables domain experts to\nselect suitable ontologies and to incorporate relevant terms from existing\nresources.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
