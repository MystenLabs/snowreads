Although accurate predictions can\nbe made using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the process used to arrive at such\npredictions is usually hard to explain. In terms of perceptibly human-friendly\nrepresentations, such as word phrases in text or super-pixels in images,\nprototype-based explanations can justify a model's decision. In this work, we\nintroduce a DNN architecture for image classification, the Enhanced\nPrototypical Part Network (EPPNet), which achieves strong performance while\ndiscovering relevant prototypes that can be used to explain the classification\nresults. This is achieved by introducing a novel cluster loss that helps to\ndiscover more relevant human-understandable prototypes. We also introduce a\nfaithfulness score to evaluate the explainability of the results based on the\ndiscovered prototypes. Our score not only accounts for the relevance of the\nlearned prototypes but also the performance of a model. Our evaluations on the\nCUB-200-2011 dataset show that the EPPNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nxAI-based methods, in terms of both classification accuracy and explainability\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
