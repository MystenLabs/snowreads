This modified proposal is defined by the function\n$f(Q,T)$, where $Q$ characterizes non-metricity and $T$ denotes the trace of\nenergy-momentum tensor. We investigate the modified field equations of this\ntheory using different parametric values of the Hubble parameter and\nnon-metricity to derive viable solutions. These solutions are relevant in\nvarious cosmological bounce models such as symmetric-bounce, super-bounce,\noscillatory-bounce, matter-bounce and exponential-bounce models. Furthermore,\nwe examine the behavior of energy density and pressure to analyze the\ncharacteristics of dark energy. A comprehensive analysis is also conducted to\nexplore the behavior of the equation of state parameter and deceleration\nparameter to examine the evolutionary eras of the cosmos. Our findings show\nthat the $f(Q,T)$ gravity describes the cosmic expansion in the vicinity of the\nbouncing point during the early and late times of cosmic evolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
