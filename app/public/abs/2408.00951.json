To discretize the continuous problem in\nspace, a spectral Galerkin method is employed, followed by the presentation of\na nonlinear-tamed accelerated exponential Euler method to yield a fully\ndiscrete scheme. By showing the exponential integrability of the stochastic\nconvolution of the fractional Brownian motion, we present the boundedness of\nmoments of semi-discrete and full-discrete approximations. Building upon these\nresults and the convergence of the fully discrete scheme in probability proved\nby a stopping time technique, we derive the strong convergence of the proposed\nscheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
