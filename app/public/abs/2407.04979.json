A classical example of a homogeneous space is the\nPaley-Wiener space of entire functions with exponential type at most a being\nsquare integrable on the real axis. Other examples occur in the theory of the\nBessel equation. Being homogeneous is a strong property, and one can describe\nall homogeneous spaces, their structure Hamiltonians, and the measures\nassociated with chains of such spaces, explicitly in terms of powers,\nlogarithms, and confluent hypergeometric functions.\n  The theory of homogeneous spaces was in essence settled by L.de Branges in\nthe early 1960's. However, in his work some connections and explicit formulae\nare not given, some results are stated without a proof, and last but not least\na mistake occurs which seemingly remained unnoticed up to the day.\n  In this paper we give a detailed account on homogeneous spaces. We provide\nexplicit proofs for all formulae and relations between the mentioned objects,\nand correct the mentioned mistake.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
