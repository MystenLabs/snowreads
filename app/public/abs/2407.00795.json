Here, we propose a new versatile one-dimensional\n(1D) lattice model that extends beyond the SSH model. Our 1D model breaks\nchiral symmetry and has generalized topology characterized by a projected\nwinding number $W_{1D,P}=1$. When this model is extended to 2D, it can generate\na second-order topological insulator (SOTI) phase. The generalized topology of\nthe SOTI phase is protected by a pair of opposite winding numbers\n$W_{2D,P}^{\\pm}=\\pm1$, which count the opposite phase windings of a projected\nvortex and antivortex pair defined in the manifold of the entire parameter\nspace. Thus, the topology of our models is robust and the end (corner) modes\nare independent of the selection of unit cells and boundary configurations.\nMore significantly, we demonstrate that the model is very general and can be\ninherently realized in many categories of crystalline materials such as BaHCl.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
