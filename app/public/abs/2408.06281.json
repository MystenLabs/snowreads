To stimulate\nresearch in this area, we present a new dataset, MovieSum, for abstractive\nsummarization of movie screenplays. This dataset comprises 2200 movie\nscreenplays accompanied by their Wikipedia plot summaries. We manually\nformatted the movie screenplays to represent their structural elements.\nCompared to existing datasets, MovieSum possesses several distinctive features:\n(1) It includes movie screenplays, which are longer than scripts of TV\nepisodes. (2) It is twice the size of previous movie screenplay datasets. (3)\nIt provides metadata with IMDb IDs to facilitate access to additional external\nknowledge. We also show the results of recently released large language models\napplied to summarization on our dataset to provide a detailed baseline.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZlCUjJamDhbafI4MFUo31Tkzttjf5XziewPMVnyF3KA","pdfSize":"379058"}
