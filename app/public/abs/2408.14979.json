We establish the existence of solutions when the parameters\nare not critical, assuming that Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma)<1$ via\nanalyzing the sublevels. Furthermore, we find a sufficient condition that\nensures multiple solutions for generic potentials by Morse inequalities and a\ntransversality theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
