A zero-one limit law is shown by Shelah and Spencer for\nErd\\\"{o}s-Renyi graphs given that the connection rate has an irrational\nexponent. We show a limit law for preferential attachment graphs which admit a\nP\\'{o}lya urn representation. The two extreme cases of the parametric model,\nthe uniform attachment graph and the sequential Barab\\'{a}si-Albert model, are\ncovered separately as they exhibit qualitative differences regarding the\ndistribution of cycles of bounded length in the graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
