While clinical decision support systems (CDSS)\nhave shown promise, the integration of large language models (LLMs) offers new\npossibilities for enhancing triage accuracy and clinical decision-making. This\nstudy presents an LLM-driven CDSS designed to assist ED physicians and nurses\nin patient triage, treatment planning, and overall emergency care management.\n  We developed a multi-agent CDSS utilizing Llama-3-70b as the base LLM,\norchestrated by CrewAI and Langchain. The system comprises four AI agents\nemulating key ED roles: Triage Nurse, Emergency Physician, Pharmacist, and ED\nCoordinator. It incorporates the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) for\ntriage assessment and integrates with the RxNorm API for medication management.\n  The model was evaluated using the Asclepius dataset, with performance\nassessed by a clinical emergency medicine specialist. The CDSS demonstrated\nhigh accuracy in triage decision-making compared to the baseline of a\nsingle-agent system. Furthermore, the system exhibited strong performance in\ncritical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification,\ndisposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation.\n  Our multi-agent CDSS demonstrates significant potential for supporting\ncomprehensive emergency care management. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI\ntechnologies, this system offers a scalable and adaptable tool that could\nenhance emergency medical care delivery, potentially alleviating ED\novercrowding and improving patient outcomes. This work contributes to the\ngrowing field of AI applications in emergency medicine and offers a promising\ndirection for future research and clinical implementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
