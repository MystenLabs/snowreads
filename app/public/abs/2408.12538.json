Nowadays there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the\neffects of experience on Requirements Engineering (RE). There is a widespread\nidea that experience improves analyst performance. However, there are empirical\nstudies that demonstrate the exact opposite. Aim. Determine whether experience\ninfluences requirements analyst performance. Method. Quasi-experiments run with\nstudents and professionals. The experimental task was to elicit requirements\nusing the open interview technique immediately followed by the consolidation of\nthe elicited information in domains with which the analysts were and were not\nfamiliar. Results. In unfamiliar domains, interview, requirements, development,\nand professional experience does not influence analyst effectiveness. In\nfamiliar domains, effectiveness varies depending on the type of experience.\nInterview experience has a strong positive effect, whereas professional\nexperience has a moderate negative effect. Requirements experience appears to\nhave a moderately positive effect; however, the statistical power of the\nanalysis is insufficient to be able to confirm this point. Development\nexperience has no effect either way. Conclusion. Experience effects analyst\neffectiveness differently depending on the problem domain type (familiar,\nunfamiliar). Generally, experience does not account for all the observed\nvariability, which means there are other influential factors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
