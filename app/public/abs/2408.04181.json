However, the\ncurrent methods of defending against these attacks often come with a high\ncomputing cost and require back-end processing, making real-time defense\nchallenging. Fortunately, there have been remarkable advancements in\nedge-computing, which make it easier to deploy neural networks on edge devices.\nBuilding upon these advancements, we propose an edge framework design to enable\nuniversal and efficient detection of adversarial attacks. This framework\nincorporates an attention-based adversarial detection methodology and a\nlightweight detection network formation, making it suitable for a wide range of\nneural networks and can be deployed on edge devices. To assess the\neffectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted evaluations on five\nneural networks. The results indicate an impressive 97.43% F-score can be\nachieved, demonstrating the framework's proficiency in detecting adversarial\nattacks. Moreover, our proposed framework also exhibits significantly reduced\ncomputing complexity and cost in comparison to previous detection methods. This\naspect is particularly beneficial as it ensures that the defense mechanism can\nbe efficiently implemented in real-time on-edge devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
