Given\nthe recent success of Deep neural networks in digital signal processing, we\npropose a Neural Network Emulator for fast chemical concentration modeling. We\nconsider atmospheric chemistry as a time-dependent Ordinary Differential\nEquation. To extract the hidden correlations between initial states and future\ntime evolution, we propose ChemNNE, an Attention based Neural Network Emulator\n(NNE) that can model the atmospheric chemistry as a neural ODE process. To\nefficiently simulate the chemical changes, we propose the sinusoidal time\nembedding to estimate the oscillating tendency over time. More importantly, we\nuse the Fourier neural operator to model the ODE process for efficient\ncomputation. We also propose three physical-informed losses to supervise the\ntraining optimization. To evaluate our model, we propose a large-scale chemical\ndataset that can be used for neural network training and evaluation. The\nextensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in modeling accuracy and computational speed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
