To explore the\nuniversality of these phenomena independent of microscopic detail, we formulate\ntopological mechanics in the continuum. By augmenting standard linear\nelasticity with additional fields of soft modes, we define a continuum version\nof Maxwell counting, which balances degrees of freedom and mechanical\nconstraints. With one additional field, these augmented elasticity theories can\nbreak spatial inversion symmetry and harbor topological edge states. We also\nshow that two additional fields are necessary to harbor Weyl points in two\ndimensions, and define continuum invariants to classify these states. In\naddition to constructing the general form of topological elasticity based on\nsymmetries, we derive the coefficients based on the systematic homogenization\nof microscopic lattices. By solving the resulting partial differential\nequations, we efficiently predict coarse-grained deformations due to\ntopological floppy modes without the need for a detailed lattice-based\nsimulation. Our discovery formulates novel design principles and efficient\ncomputational tools for topological states of matter, and points to their\nexperimental implementation in mechanical metamaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
