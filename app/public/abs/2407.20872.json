This\nresearch presents a comparative analysis of three YOLO models, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,\nand YOLOv10, to detect the hazards involved in handling knife, concentrating\nmainly on ensuring fingers are curled while holding items to be cut and that\nhands should only be in contact with knife handle avoiding the blade.\nPrecision, recall, F-score, and normalized confusion matrix are used to\nevaluate the performance of the models. The results indicate that YOLOv5\nperformed better than the other two models in identifying the hazard of\nensuring hands only touch the blade, while YOLOv8 excelled in detecting the\nhazard of curled fingers while holding items. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 performed\nalmost identically in recognizing classes such as hand, knife, and vegetable,\nwhereas YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv10 accurately identified the cutting board.\nThis paper provides insights into the advantages and shortcomings of these\nmodels in real-world settings. Moreover, by detailing the optimization of YOLO\narchitectures for safe knife handling, this study promotes the development of\nincreased accuracy and efficiency in safety surveillance systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9UX6qrba4_I7negcHn1Ptj6tYv3V4LBRA8Hobo7shZ0","pdfSize":"2012975"}
