The generic\nproperty of the ghost-free theory fixed on Minkowski space-time is the\nemergence of an infinite number of complex mass states when other classical\nbackgrounds are considered. These additional states are shown to enhance the\npower spectrum of scalar perturbations generated during inflation. Current and\nfuture space-based and terrestrial interferometers offer indirect testing\nmethods for the infinite derivative gravity action, enabling the exploration of\nnew parameter spaces. In particular, we identify unconventional blue-tilted\nGravitational Wave spectra, presenting a novel approach for testing infinite\nderivative quantum gravity in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
