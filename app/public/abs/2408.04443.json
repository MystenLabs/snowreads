While exact top-k retrieval over such embeddings\nfaces efficiency challenges, a recent algorithm called Seismic has enabled\nremarkably fast, highly-accurate approximate retrieval. Seismic statically\nprunes inverted lists, organizes each list into geometrically-cohesive blocks,\nand augments each block with a summary vector. At query time, each inverted\nlist associated with a query term is traversed one block at a time in an\narbitrary order, with the inner product between the query and summaries\ndetermining if a block must be evaluated. When a block is deemed promising, its\ndocuments are fully evaluated with a forward index. Seismic is one to two\norders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art inverted index-based solutions\nand significantly outperforms the winning graph-based submissions to the BigANN\n2023 Challenge. In this work, we speed up Seismic further by introducing two\ninnovations to its query processing subroutine. First, we traverse blocks in\norder of importance, rather than arbitrarily. Second, we take the list of\ndocuments retrieved by Seismic and expand it to include the neighbors of each\ndocument using an offline k-regular nearest neighbor graph; the expanded list\nis then ranked to produce the final top-k set. Experiments on two public\ndatasets show that our extension, named SeismicWave, can reach almost-exact\naccuracy levels and is up to 2.2x faster than Seismic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
