I present Penzai, a neural network\nlibrary designed to simplify model manipulation by representing models as\nsimple data structures, and Treescope, an interactive pretty-printer and array\nvisualizer that can visualize both model inputs/outputs and the models\nthemselves. Penzai models are built using declarative combinators that expose\nthe model forward pass in the structure of the model object itself, and use\nnamed axes to ensure each operation is semantically meaningful. With Penzai's\ntree-editing selector system, users can both insert and replace model\ncomponents, allowing them to intervene on intermediate values or make other\nedits to the model structure. Users can then get immediate feedback by\nvisualizing the modified model with Treescope. I describe the motivation and\nmain features of Penzai and Treescope, and discuss how treating the model as\ndata enables a variety of analyses and interventions to be implemented as\ndata-structure transformations, without requiring model designers to add\nexplicit hooks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TIESuwUWcvmD1ve3EBxWgDJyZs7nvWHhlPXbNSFsQ0I","pdfSize":"2322509","txDigest":"8cXcjcpscW1yxGgr7BQZY52k8Bt3fpvJ6hovXdKagbLW","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
