As a consequence, we prove K-stability of a\nlarge class of quasi-smooth Fano hypersurfaces of index 1 and of all smooth\nFano weighted hypersurfaces of index 1 and 2. The proofs are based on the\nAbban--Zhuang method and on the study of linear systems on flags of weighted\nhypersurfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
