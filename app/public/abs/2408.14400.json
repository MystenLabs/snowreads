Google's Solar API aids this transition by estimating solar\npotential from aerial imagery, but its impact is constrained by geographical\ncoverage. This paper proposes expanding the API's reach using satellite\nimagery, enabling global solar potential assessment. We tackle challenges\ninvolved in building a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and roof instance\nsegmentation from lower resolution and single oblique views using deep learning\nmodels. Our models, trained on aligned satellite and aerial datasets, produce\n25cm DSMs and roof segments. With ~1m DSM MAE on buildings, ~5deg roof pitch\nerror and ~56% IOU on roof segmentation, they significantly enhance the Solar\nAPI's potential to promote solar adoption.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
