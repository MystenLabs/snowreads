A new\nfeedforward control scheme is developed to minimize the quality variations\ncaused by process disturbances in MMSs. Notably, the control framework\nleverages a stochastic deep Koopman (SDK) model to capture the quality\npropagation mechanism in the MMSs, highlighted by its ability to transform the\nnonlinear propagation dynamics into a linear one. Two roll-to-roll case studies\nare presented to validate the proposed method and demonstrate its\neffectiveness. The overall method is suitable for nonlinear MMSs and does not\nrequire extensive expert knowledge.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"75hJoBMm4BRjEWmbqe2VpyaBWnyoSPAEUKLzPn6KAUE","pdfSize":"2466405"}
