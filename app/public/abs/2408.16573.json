As the number of communication nodes increases\nand temporal slots accumulate, each node interacts in with only a few nodes in\na given temporal slot, the DCN can be represented by an High-Dimensional Sparse\n(HDS) tensor. In order to extract rich behavioral patterns from an HDS tensor\nin DCN, this paper proposes an Adaptive Temporal-dependent Tensor low-rank\nrepresentation (ATT) model. It adopts a three-fold approach: a) designing a\ntemporal-dependent method to reconstruct temporal feature matrix, thereby\nprecisely represent the data by capturing the temporal patterns; b) achieving\nhyper-parameters adaptation of the model via the Differential Evolutionary\nAlgorithms (DEA) to avoid tedious hyper-parameters tuning; c) employing\nnonnegative learning schemes for the model parameters to effectively handle an\nthe nonnegativity inherent in HDS data. The experimental results on four\nreal-world DCNs demonstrate that the proposed ATT model significantly\noutperforms several state-of-the-art models in both prediction errors and\nconvergence rounds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
