More\nprecisely, we show that the centraliser of $osp(1|2(\\ell-1),\\mathbb R)$ in the\nWeyl--Clifford algebra generated by $4$ bosonic and $8(\\ell-1)$ fermionic\nsymbols, modulo $osp(1|2(\\ell-1),\\mathbb R)$ generators, is isomorphic to the\nhigher spin algebra of the type-A$_\\ell$ theory whose spectrum contains\npartially-massless fields of all spins and depths $t=1,3,\\dots,2\\ell-1$. We\nalso discuss the possible existence of a deformation of this algebra, which\nwould encode interaction for the type-A$_\\ell$ theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
