We implement Chain-of-Thought prompting with Zero-Shot and\nFew-Shot settings on a binary mental manipulation detection task, building upon\nexisting work conducted with Zero-Shot and Few- Shot prompting. Our primary\nobjective is to decipher why certain prompting techniques display superior\nperformance, so as to craft a novel framework tailored for detection of mental\nmanipulation. Preliminary findings suggest that advanced prompting techniques\nmay not be suitable for more complex models, if they are not trained through\nexample-based learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
