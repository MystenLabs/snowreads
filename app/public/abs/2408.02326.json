By leveraging the maximum entropy\nprinciple in curved statistical manifolds, here we introduce curved neural\nnetworks as a class of prototypical models for studying higher-order phenomena.\nThrough exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural\nnetworks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate\nmemory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with\nmulti-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring\ntheir memory capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass\nphase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks enhance memory capacity\nover the classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework\nprovides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel\nhigher-order phenomena in complex network systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
