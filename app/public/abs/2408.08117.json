By examining the critical current and upper critical magnetic\nfields ($H_{c2}$) of 40-60 nm thick films in the superconducting state, we\nidentify a pronounced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition\nbehavior, i.e. a drastic decrease of the superfluid stiffness near the\ntransition, and a cusp-like feature of the angular dependent $H_{c2}$, both of\nwhich serve as direct evidence of 2D SC. In addition, an exceeding of the Pauli\nparamagnetic limit of the in-plane $H_{c2}$ is consistent with the 2D SC\nnature. The observed 2D SC occurs in thick films with the highest\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the lowest charge density wave\ntransition temperature $T_{\\rm {CDW}}$, which suggests that the charge density\nwave states are interrelated with the superconducting states. Our findings\nimpose constraints in understanding the enhancement of SC in kagome\nsuperconductors, and illuminate pathways for achieving novel 2D superconducting\nstates in more stable and much thicker systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2bG1vrNlDqSM6rwvJ9QdDs-gwhCFxU8fXMjrs1LEixc","pdfSize":"4024453"}
