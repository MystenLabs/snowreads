The majority of\nnutritional literature focuses on macronutrients, often ignoring the more\ncritical nuances of micronutrient balance, which require more precise\nregulation. Currently, micronutrient status is routinely assessed via complex\nmethods that are arduous for both the patient and the clinician. To address the\nglobal burden of micronutrient malnutrition, innovations in assessment must be\naccessible and noninvasive. In support of this task, this article synthesizes\nuseful background information on micronutrients themselves, reviews the state\nof biofluid and physiological analyses for their assessment, and presents\nactionable opportunities to push the field forward. By taking a unique,\nclinical perspective that is absent from technological research on the topic,\nwe find that the state of the art suffers from limited clinical relevance, a\nlack of overlap between biofluid and physiological approaches, and highly\ninvasive and inaccessible solutions. Future work has the opportunity to\nmaximize the impact of a novel assessment method by incorporating clinical\nrelevance, the holistic nature of micronutrition, and prioritizing accessible\nand noninvasive systems.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
