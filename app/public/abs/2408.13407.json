For trapped ions, electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT)\ncooling has received attention for the relative speed, low laser power\nrequirements, and broad cooling bandwidth of the technique. However, in\napplications where the ion used for cooling has hyperfine structure to enable\nlong coherence times, it is difficult to find a closed three-level system in\nwhich to perform standard EIT cooling. Here, we demonstrate successful EIT\ncooling on 25Mg+ by the addition of an extra laser frequency; this method can\nbe applied to any ion with non-zero nuclear spin. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nsimultaneous EIT cooling of all axial modes in mixed-species crystals 9Be+ -\n25Mg+ and 9Be+ - 25Mg+ - 9Be+ through the 25Mg+ ion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
