Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) has\nemerged as a promising technique to mitigate volatility by decomposing data\ninto distinct modes, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. In this study, we\nintegrate VMD with linear models to develop a robust forecasting framework. Our\napproach is evaluated on 13 diverse datasets, including ETTm2, WindTurbine, M4,\nand 10 air quality datasets from various Southeast Asian cities. The\neffectiveness of the VMD strategy is assessed by comparing Root Mean Squared\nError (RMSE) values from models utilizing VMD against those without it.\nAdditionally, we benchmark linear-based models against well-known neural\nnetwork architectures such as LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and RNN. The results\ndemonstrate a significant reduction in RMSE across nearly all models following\nVMD application. Notably, the Linear + VMD model achieved the lowest average\nRMSE in univariate forecasting at 0.619. In multivariate forecasting, the\nDLinear + VMD model consistently outperformed others, attaining the lowest RMSE\nacross all datasets with an average of 0.019. These findings underscore the\neffectiveness of combining VMD with linear models for superior time-series\nforecasting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
