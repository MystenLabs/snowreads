We find sufficient conditions for there to exist a quasi-excellent\nlocal subring $B$ of $T$ satisfying the following conditions: (1) the\ncompletion of $B$ at its maximal ideal is isomorphic to the completion of $T$\nat its maximal ideal, (2) $B \\cap Q_1 = B \\cap Q_2$, (3) the set of prime\nideals of $T/(Q_1 \\cap Q_2)$ of positive height is the same as the set of prime\nideals of $B/(B \\cap Q_1)$ of positive height when viewed as partially ordered\nsets, and (4) for $i = 1$ and for $i = 2$, there is a coheight preserving\nbijection between the minimal prime ideals of $T_{Q_i}$ and the minimal prime\nideals of $B_{B \\cap Q_1}$. Intuitively, this means that $T$ contains a\nquasi-excellent local subring in which $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are \"glued together\" and\nsuch that both the completion and desirable properties of the prime spectrum\nare preserved. We use this result to show that certain complete local rings are\nthe completion of a quasi-excellent local ring whose prime spectrum, when\nviewed as a partially ordered set, contains interesting noncatenary finite\nsubsets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
