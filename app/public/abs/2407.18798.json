We\npresent a framework combining a 3D physics simulator implemented in C++ with a\ndeep learning model constructed using PyTorch. The simulator generates training\ndata encompassing linear and angular motion, elastic collisions, fluid\nfriction, gravitational effects, and damping. Our deep residual network,\nconsisting of an input layer, multiple residual blocks, and an output layer, is\ndesigned to handle the complexities of 3D dynamics. We evaluate the network's\nperformance using a datasetof 10,000 simulated scenarios, each involving 3-5\ninteracting rigid bodies. The model achieves a mean squared error of 0.015 for\nposition predictions and 0.022 for orientation predictions, representing a 25%\nimprovement over baseline methods. Our results demonstrate the network's\nability to capture intricate physical interactions, with particular success in\npredicting elastic collisions and rotational dynamics. This work significantly\ncontributes to physics-informed machine learning by showcasing the immense\npotential of deep residual networks in modeling complex 3D physical systems. We\ndiscuss our approach's limitations and propose future directions for improving\ngeneralization to more diverse object shapes and materials.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
