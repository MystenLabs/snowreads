We obtain a sharp upper bound for the dimension of these\nsubgroups and show that, when equality holds, the foliations that realize this\nupper bound are induced by fiber bundles whose fibers are round spheres or\nprojective spaces. Moreover, singular Riemannian foliations that realize the\nupper bound are induced by smooth fiber bundles whose fibers are round spheres\nor projective spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
