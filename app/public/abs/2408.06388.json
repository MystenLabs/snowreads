Here, we demonstrate the fundamental relationships between\nnon-Hermitian singularities and observe them experimentally in the scattering\nspectra. We reveal that exceptional points appear in the anapole regime, and\ndiabolic points are associated with superscattering. We confirm our findings\nwith microwave experiments by measuring the scattering spectra of subwavelength\nMie-resonant ceramic rings. Our study underpins the generic behavior of\nnon-Hermitian singularities in the scattering spectra of subwavelength\nresonators, uncovering their novel applications in non-Hermitian nonlinear\noptics and topological photonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
