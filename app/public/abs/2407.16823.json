This\nwork proposes exploiting equivariant learning from 3D point clouds to improve\nregistration robustness. We propose SE3ET, an SE(3)-equivariant registration\nframework that employs equivariant point convolution and equivariant\ntransformer designs to learn expressive and robust geometric features. We\ntested the proposed registration method on indoor and outdoor benchmarks where\nthe point clouds are under arbitrary transformations and low overlapping\nratios. We also provide generalization tests and run-time performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
