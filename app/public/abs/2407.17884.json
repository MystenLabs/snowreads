They weaken the\nsubcompleteness condition of values, and relax the ascending condition of the\ncorrespondence. As an application, we derive a generalization of Topkis's\ntheorem on the existence and order structure of the set of Nash equilibria of\nsupermodular games.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
