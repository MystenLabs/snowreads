It is shown that the derivative of volume to pressure in a\nstable system is always negative, i.e., volume decreases with the increase of\npressure, when all other natural variables of the system are kept constant.\nThis originates from the stability requirement that the conjugate variables,\nsuch as volume and negative pressure, must change in the same direction in a\nstable system. Consequently, since volume and temperature are not conjugate\nvariables, they do not have to change in the same direction and thus do change\nin opposite directions in both natural and man-made systems. It is shown that\nthe decrease of volume with the increase of temperature, commonly referred as\nnegative thermal expansion (NTE) in the literature, originates from the\nstatistical competitions of configurations in the system when the volumes of\nmetastable configurations are smaller than that of the ground-state\nconfiguration. It is demonstrated that the zentropy theory can concisely\nexplain and accurately predict NTE based on the density functional theory\nwithout fitting parameters.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S-f8VhLzKhJ6UBHQXzUiVFC3CfU-zfGzIO9G0sENMHA","pdfSize":"1532717"}
