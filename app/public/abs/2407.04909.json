Firstly, we rigorously establish the existence and\nuniqueness of strong solutions for a specific class of finite-dimensional\nsystems characterized by H\\\"older continuous coefficients and infinite delay.\nWe extend these results to their infinite-dimensional counterparts using the\nvariational approach and Galerkin projection technique. Subsequently, we\nestablish the averaging principle (the first Bogolyubov theorem) for SFPDEs\nwith infinite delay, subject to conditions of linear growth and H\\\"older\ncontinuity. This is achieved through classical Khasminskii time discretization\nand reductio ad absurdum, illustrating the convergence of solutions from the\noriginal Cauchy problem to those of the averaged equation across the finite\ninterval [0, T]. To illustrate our findings, we present two applications:\nstochastic generalized porous media equations and stochastic reaction-diffusion\nequations with H\\\"older coefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
