Our work\nexamines the complex interplay of geometrical and optical resonances within\ncore-shell structures. Using a finite element method (FEM) simulation closely\naligned with the actual s-SNOM measurement processes, we capture the specific\nnear-field responses in these nanostructures. Our findings show that core-shell\nnanoparticles exhibit unexpected distinct resonance shifts and massively\nenhanced scattering driven by both core and shell properties. This\ninvestigation not only advances the understanding of near-field interactions in\ncomplex nanosystems but also provides a refined theoretical framework to\naccurately predict the optical signatures of nanostructures with internal\nheterogeneity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6HlZQvrrLZMmjQrCW6GfcRGyZ4UEepn6W5WVI7_eHUs","pdfSize":"5924221"}
