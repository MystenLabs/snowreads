Data sharing\nwas pivotal for advancing research to understand the underlying causes and\nimplement effective containment strategies. In response, many countries have\npromoted the availability of daily cases to support research initiatives,\nfostering collaboration between organisations and making such data available to\nthe public through open data platforms. Despite the several advantages of data\nsharing, one of the major concerns before releasing health data is its impact\non individuals' privacy. Such a sharing process should be based on\nstate-of-the-art methods in Data Protection by Design and by Default. In this\npaper, we use a data set related to Covid-19 cases in the second largest\nhospital in Portugal to show how it is feasible to ensure data privacy while\nimproving the quality and maintaining the utility of the data. Our goal is to\ndemonstrate how knowledge exchange in multidisciplinary teams of healthcare\npractitioners, data privacy, and data science experts is crucial to\nco-developing strategies that ensure high utility of de-identified data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
