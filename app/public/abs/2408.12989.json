However, rule systems require significant input from domain experts\nto create and tune, an issue that rule induction algorithms attempt to mitigate\nby inferring rules directly from data. We explore the application of these\nalgorithms to fraud detection, where rule systems are constrained to have a low\nfalse positive rate (FPR) or alert rate, by proposing RIFF, a rule induction\nalgorithm that distills a low FPR rule set directly from decision trees. Our\nexperiments show that the induced rules are often able to maintain or improve\nperformance of the original models for low FPR tasks, while substantially\nreducing their complexity and outperforming rules hand-tuned by experts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
