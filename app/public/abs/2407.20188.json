We find that as a function of the magnetic field and substrate\nperiodicity, a remarkably wide variety of ordered phases appear similar to\nthose found in colloidal or Wigner molecular crystals, including ferromagnetic\nand herringbone states. The ability of the skyrmions to annihilate, deform, and\nchange size gives rise to a variety of superlattice states in which a mixture\nof different skyrmion sizes and shapes produces bipartate or more complex\nlattice structures. Our results are relevant for skyrmions on structured\ntriangular substrates, in magnetic arrays, or skyrmions in moire materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
