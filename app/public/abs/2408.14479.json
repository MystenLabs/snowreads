OCD occurs when excessive CRH is\nreleased in the prefrontal cortex, activating cAMP. cAMP is a major inducer of\nHCN channels, which promote repeated neural firing. The combination of CRH,\nwhich is strongly associated with stress, and repeated firing that cannot be\ncontrolled, explains all of the features of OCD, including obsessions and\ncompulsions of all kinds.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
