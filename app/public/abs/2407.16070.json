The quotient $P/W_K$ can be\nidentified with a polytope. Polytopes $P$ and $P/W_K$ are associated to toric\nvarieties $X_P$ and $X_{P/W_K}$ respectively. It turns out the underlying\ntopological spaces $X_P/W_K$ and $X_{P/W_K}$ are homotopy equivalent, when\nconsidering the polytopes in the real span of the root lattice or of the weight\nlattice.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
