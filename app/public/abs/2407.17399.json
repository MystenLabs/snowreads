However, the necessity of training data that are\nspecific to the targeted application constrains the widespread use of denoising\nnetworks. Recently, several approaches have been developed to overcome this\ndifficulty by whether artificially generating realistic clean/noisy image\npairs, or training exclusively on noisy images. In this paper, we show that,\ncontrary to popular belief, denoising networks specialized in the removal of\nGaussian noise can be efficiently leveraged in favor of real-world image\ndenoising, even without additional training. For this to happen, an appropriate\nvariance-stabilizing transform (VST) has to be applied beforehand. We propose\nan algorithm termed Noise2VST for the learning of such a model-free VST. Our\napproach requires only the input noisy image and an off-the-shelf Gaussian\ndenoiser. We demonstrate through extensive experiments the efficiency and\nsuperiority of Noise2VST in comparison to existing methods trained in the\nabsence of specific clean/noisy pairs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
