To address this problem, we introduce\nthe Emoji Encoder, a tool that generates a set of emoji recommendations for the\nfield and category names appearing in a tabular dataset. The selected set of\nemoji encodings can be used to generate configurable unit charts that combine\nplain text and emojis as word-scale graphics. These charts can serve to\ncontrast values across multiple quantitative fields for each row in the data or\nto communicate trends over time. Any resulting chart is simply a block of text\ncharacters, meaning that it can be directly copied into a text message or\nposted on a communication platform such as Slack or Teams. This work represents\na step toward our larger goal of developing novel, fun, and succinct data\nstorytelling experiences that engage those who do not identify as data\nanalysts. Emoji-based unit charts can offer contextual cues related to the data\nat the center of a conversation on platforms where emoji-rich communication is\ntypical.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
