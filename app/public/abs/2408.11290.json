This paper focuses on the privacy concerns associated\nwith delay-based localization, where unauthorized base stations attempt to\ninfer the location of the end user. We propose a method to disrupt localization\nat unauthorized nodes by injecting artificial components into the pilot signal,\nexploiting model mismatches inherent in these nodes. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of two techniques, namely artificial multipath\n(AM) and artificial noise (AN), in mitigating location leakage. By leveraging\nthe misspecified Cram\\'er-Rao bound framework, we evaluate the impact of these\ntechniques on unauthorized localization performance. Our results demonstrate\nthat pilot manipulation significantly degrades the accuracy of unauthorized\nlocalization while minimally affecting legitimate localization. Moreover, we\nfind that the superiority of AM over AN varies depending on the specific\nscenario.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
