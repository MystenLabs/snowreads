This paper addresses this gap by focusing on\nparameter inference for the wave equation with Markovian switching. We propose\na Bayesian statistical framework using discrete sparse Bayesian learning to\nestablish its convergence and a uniform error bound. Our method requires fewer\nassumptions and enables independent parameter inference for each segment by\nallowing different underlying structures for the parameter estimation problem\nwithin each segmented time interval. The effectiveness of our approach is\ndemonstrated through three numerical cases, which involve noisy spatiotemporal\ndata from different wave equations with Markovian switching. The results show\nstrong performance in parameter estimation for variable coefficient PDEs.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
