Motivated by this objective, the\npresent study proposes an automated design methodology that employs data-driven\nmethods to generate new designs of soft actuators. One of the bottlenecks in\nthe data-driven automated design process is having publicly available data to\ntrain the model. Due to its unavailability, a synthetic data set of soft\npneumatic network (Pneu-net) actuators has been created. The parametric design\ndata set for the training of the generative model is created using data\naugmentation. Next, the Gaussian mixture model has been applied to generate\nnovel parametric designs of Pneu-net actuators. The distance-based metric\ndefines the novelty and diversity of the generated designs. In addition, it is\nnoteworthy that the model has the potential to generate a multimodal Pneu-net\nactuator that could perform in-plane bending and out-of-plane twisting. Later,\nthe novel design is passed through finite element analysis to evaluate the\nquality of the generated design. Moreover, the trajectory of each category of\nPneu-net actuators evaluates the performance of the generated Pneu-net\nactuators and emphasizes the necessity of multimodal actuation. The proposed\nmodel could accelerate the design of new soft robots by selecting a soft\nactuator from the developed novel pool of soft actuators.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
