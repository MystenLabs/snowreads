Reactive molecular dynamics\nsimulations were performed to evaluate the magnitude of the dehydroxylation of\nMg-rich serpentine by micrometeoroid impacts. When micrometeoroids were not\ncoupled with interplanetary magnetic fields, serpentine could be dehydroxylated\nby micrometeoroids as small as 2 nm in size. In particular, ~200 O-H bonds\ndissociated when the meteoroids were derived from cometary activity (the impact\nvelocity was ~20 km s$^{-1}$). When nano-sized dust particles were accelerated\nto ~300 km s$^{-1}$ by the magnetic fields of solar wind plasma, the number of\ndissociated O-H bonds increased by one order of magnitude. Consequently even 1\nnm-sized dust particles can contribute to the space weathering of Ryugu. In all\ncases, Si-OH, H2O, and free OH were generated from the hydroxyls initially\nconnected to Mg, which could partially offset dehydration. Despite the\nlimitations of our computational resources, which restricted the simulation\ntime scale to 1 ps, reactive molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated that\nmicrometeoroid bombardment could influence the space weathering of asteroids.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
