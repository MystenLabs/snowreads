Although the\ndynamics of this model is very involved, asymptotically, as the singularity is\napproached, it can be well approximated as a succession of Bianchi I periods\nconnected by quick bounces against potential walls. Moreover, in such limit,\nmatter fields (excluding stiff matter) are known to be subdominant with respect\nto the anisotropies. Therefore, by performing an expansion around small\nvolumes, and assuming that the dominant matter contribution in this regime can\nbe described as a barotropic perfect fluid with a linear equation of state, we\nobtain an approximate analytic solution of the dynamics. Then, we explicitly\ncompute the form of the transition (Kasner) map that relates the pre- and\npost-bounce Bianchi I periods including the leading matter effects. As an\nimportant conclusion, we observe that generically the presence of matter leads\nto a post-bounce velocity with a lower deflection angle than in the vacuum\ncase, and thus effectively increases the convex curvature of the potential\nwalls. This effect may have important consequences in the chaotic nature of\ngeneral relativity near spacelike singularities.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
