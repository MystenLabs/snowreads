At high\nlaser powers, all the trapped clusters display rotation coupled with\noscillation along the axial direction, with a majority spinning about a body\nfixed axis, while the rest display dual spin as well as orbital motion about a\nfixed point in space. The spinning and orbiting frequency is inversely\nproportional to the amplitude of the axial oscillation - with one growing at\nthe expense of the other. Further, the frequencies of these rotations are not\nproportional to the laser power, but to the trap stiffnesses inferred from the\ncorresponding natural frequencies. The clusters also stop rotating below a\ncertain laser power, and execute random thermal fluctuations. Our work suggests\nthat the dynamics of clusters trapped with photophoretic force are largely\ndependent on the cluster size and morphology, which could, in principle, be\ntuned to obtain various motional responses, and help in the design of rotating\nmicromachines in air.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
