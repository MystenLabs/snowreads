This\nresult implies that for any $\\sigma \\leq 1/2$, if $G$ is a graph and every\nclique $K\\subseteq V(G)$ has at most $(1 - \\sigma)(|K| - \\sigma)$ simplicial\nvertices, then $\\alpha(G) \\geq \\sum_{v\\in V(G)} 1 / (d(v) + 1 - \\sigma)$.\nLetting $\\sigma = 0$ implies the famous Caro-Wei Theorem, and letting $\\sigma =\n1/2$ implies that if fewer than half of the vertices in each clique of $G$ are\nsimplicial, then $\\alpha(G) \\geq \\sum_{v\\in V(G)}1/(d(v) + 1/2)$, which is\ntight for the 5-cycle. When applied to the complement of a graph, this result\nimplies the following new Tur\\' an stability result. If $G$ is a $K_{r +\n1}$-free graph with more than $(1 - 1/r)n^2/2 - n/4$ edges, then $G$ contains\nan independent set $I$ such that at least half of the vertices in $I$ are\ncomplete to $G - I$. Applying this stability result iteratively provides a new\nproof of the stability version of Tur\\' an's Theorem in which $K_{r + 1}$-free\ngraphs with close to the extremal number of edges are $r$-partite.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
