Our goal is to\nunderstand how the universe evolved over time. To do this, we use\nparameterizetion of Hubble's parameter method. We then use a powerful tool\ncalled Monte Carlo Markov Chain to find the best values for the constants in\nour formula. We do this by comparing our formula to actual data from\nobservations of the universe. Once we have the best values for the constants,\nwe calculate other important parameters that describe the universe's evolution.\nThese include: Deceleration parameter which measures how quickly the expansion\nis slowing down. We found $q_0 = -0.601^{+0.0131}_{-0.0131}$. Equation of state\nparameter to measures the properties of dark energy. We find $\\omega_0 =\n-0.7018^{+0.0101}_{-0.0101}$. We also study the stability and energy conditions\nalong with the state-finder and $O_m(z)$-parameter of our model to ensure it's\nconsistent with our understanding of the universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
