It facilitates effective AI training within\nsovereign data networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data\nsources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where\ndata remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated\nlearning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI\ntraining, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within\nthe personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards\nmechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair\nreward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach\nguarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or\ninfluence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are\nmanaged on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework\nsupports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control\nover their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized,\nscalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial\nalgorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
