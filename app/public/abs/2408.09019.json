More generally, the latter\nwill be proved for $D_n$-fields with $n \\geq 4$ an even integer. Further,\ngeneralizing a result of Zantema, we also prove that the pre-P\\'olya group of a\nnon-Galois field of a prime degree, e.g. an $A_5$-field, coincides with its\nP\\'olya group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
