For every isometric continuous group action of $G$ we have an induced\ncontinuous dual action on the weak-star compact unit ball\n$B_{\\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$ of the dual space $\\mathrm{Lip_0} (M)=\\mathcal{F}(M)^*$.\nWe pose the question when a given abstract continuous action of $G$ on a\ntopological space $X$ can be represented through a $G$-subspace of\n$B_{\\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$. One of such natural examples is the so-called metric\ncompactification (of isometric $G$-spaces) for a pointed metric space. As well\nas the Gromov $G$-compactification of a bounded metric $G$-space. Note that\nthere are sufficiently many representations of compact $G$-spaces on\nLipschitz-free spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
