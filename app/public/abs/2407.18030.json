The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\ninstruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and\nyearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface\nReflectance black-sky albedo dataset (MCD43D, version 6.1) gives detailed\nalbedo maps in seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range.\nThese albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and\ntheir seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only in seven spectral\nbands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength\nrange is required to simulate radiance spectra, and to correctly retrieve\natmospheric and cloud properties from Earth's remote sensing. We use a\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate\nhyperspectral albedo maps of Earth. Combining different datasets of\nhyperspectral reflectance laboratory measurements for various dry soils,\nvegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct the albedo maps in\nthe entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500~nm. The PCA method is trained with\na 10-years average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain\nhyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05{\\deg} in latitude\nand longitude, a spectral resolution of 10~nm, and a temporal resolution of\n1~day. Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles\nof different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities and icy surfaces,\nand study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps shall enable to refine\ncalculations of Earth's energy budget, its seasonal variability, and improve\nclimate simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XdksYxAxK9WPsIyaQh9V6UwuIHsgN1ywjwqYHuh-9So","pdfSize":"43874556"}
