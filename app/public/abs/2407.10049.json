AutoGRAMS represents AI agents as a graph, where each\nnode can execute either a language modeling instruction or traditional code.\nLikewise, transitions in the graph can be governed by either language modeling\ndecisions or traditional branch logic. AutoGRAMS supports using variables as\nmemory and allows nodes to call other AutoGRAMS graphs as functions. We show\nhow AutoGRAMS can be used to design highly sophisticated agents, including\nself-referential agents that can modify their own graph. AutoGRAMS's\ngraph-centric approach aids interpretability, controllability, and safety\nduring the design, development, and deployment of AI agents. We provide our\nframework as open source at https://github.com/autograms/autograms .\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S-ej8q_sKUbWoNy7IYfMMMzVEk8AI8xT4dvTYDOfM0M","pdfSize":"1360345"}
