We discuss different examples that\ncome up in the literature, including the entropic risk measure and the risk\nmeasure arising from the ambiguous interest rate problem. We develop a\nnumerical algorithm for solving a BSDE using the backward Euler-Maruyama scheme\nand the universal approximation theorem for the signature of a path. We prove\nthe convergence theorem and use the algorithm to solve some examples of dynamic\nrisk measures induced by BSDEs. At last a deep learning approach is included\nfor solving the ambiguous interest rate problem as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_h24pOilGO76qSB7w_qJoE7fWtskW7x5jV79Z_BYVxw","pdfSize":"816147"}
