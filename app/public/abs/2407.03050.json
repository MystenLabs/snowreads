The combination of the generative model and semantic\ncommunication (SemCom) enables high-fidelity semantic information exchange at\nultra-low rates. A novel generative SemCom framework for image tasks is\nproposed, wherein pre-trained foundation models serve as semantic encoders and\ndecoders for semantic feature extractions and image regenerations,\nrespectively. The mathematical relationship between the transmission\nreliability and the perceptual quality of the regenerated image and the\nsemantic values of semantic features are modeled, which are obtained by\nconducting numerical simulations on the Kodak dataset. We also investigate the\nsemantic-aware power allocation problem, with the objective of minimizing the\ntotal power consumption while guaranteeing semantic performance. To solve this\nproblem, two semanticaware power allocation methods are proposed by constraint\ndecoupling and bisection search, respectively. Numerical results show that the\nproposed semantic-aware methods demonstrate superior performance compared to\nthe conventional one in terms of total power consumption.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
