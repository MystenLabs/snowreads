In this\nwork, optically active nitrogen-vacancy color centers NV in a 28Si-enriched\n(nuclear spin I = 0) 6H-28SiC crystal have been studied using the photoinduced\n(980 nm) high-frequency (94 GHz, 3.4 T) pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance\nmethod at a temperature of 150 K. Three structurally nonequivalent types of NV-\ncenters with axial symmetry have been identified and their spectroscopic\nparameters have been determined. Long spin-lattice, T1=1.3 ms, and spin-spin,\nT2=59 us, ensemble relaxation times of NV- centers with extremely narrow (450\nkHz) absorption lines allow highly selective excitation of resonant transitions\nbetween sublevels caused by the weak hyperfine interaction (A = 1 MHz) with 14N\n(I = 1) nuclei for the quantum manipulation of the electron spin magnetization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HhsGAxsDMOW9LLHV_trn8CRCuFdM3h1JufsXUNkAX0A","pdfSize":"1034208"}
