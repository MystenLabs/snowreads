At the quark level, these decays are governed\nby the $b\\to d\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ transition. Along with different angular\nobservables, we also give predictions of differential branching ratios,\nforward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal polarization fraction of $\\rho$, and\n$a_{1}$ mesons. Our analysis shows that the signatures of family non-universal\n$Z^{\\prime}$ model are more distinct in the observables associated with the\n$B\\to\\rho(\\to\\pi\\pi)\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay, compared to that of the $B\\to\na_{1}(\\to\\rho_{\\parallel, \\perp}\\pi)\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay. Future measurements\nof the predicted angular observables, both at current and future high energy\ncolliders, will add to the useful complementary data required to clarify the\nstructure of the family non-universal $Z^{\\prime}$ model in $|\\Delta\nb|$=$|\\Delta d|=1$ processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
