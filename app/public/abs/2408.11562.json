To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial\nlearning framework that incorporates noise-disentanglement to establish a\nnoise-independent speaker invariant embedding space. Specifically, the\ndisentanglement module includes two encoders for separating speaker related and\nirrelevant information, respectively. The reconstruction module serves as a\nregularization term to constrain the noise. A feature-robust loss is also used\nto supervise the speaker encoder to learn noise-independent speaker embeddings\nwithout losing speaker information. In addition, adversarial training is\nintroduced to discourage the speaker encoder from encoding acoustic condition\ninformation for achieving a speaker-invariant embedding space. Experiments on\nVoxCeleb1 indicate that the proposed method improves the performance of the\nspeaker verification system under both clean and noisy conditions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
