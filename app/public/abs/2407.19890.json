Through\nWick rotation, the relationship between quantum dynamics and thermodynamics is\nalso established in this paper. This equation reformulates the iterative\nprocess of machine learning into a time-dependent partial differential equation\nwith a clear mathematical structure, offering a theoretical framework for\ninvestigating machine learning iterations through quantum and mathematical\ntheories. Within this framework, the fundamental iterative process, the\ndiffusion model, and the Softmax and Sigmoid functions are examined, validating\nthe proposed quantum dynamics equations. This approach not only presents a\nrigorous theoretical foundation for machine learning but also holds promise for\nsupporting the implementation of machine learning algorithms on quantum\ncomputers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
