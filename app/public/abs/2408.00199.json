Here, we\napply a continuous-space self-consistent field theory to study the structural\nheterogeneity in PE brushes induced by competing electrostatic and hydrophobic\ninteractions. For brushes with high grafting densities, we find a series of\nmicrophase-segregated morphologies with alternating polymer-rich and\npolymer-poor layers in the direction normal to the substrate. The transitions\nbetween multi-layer morphologies with consecutive numbers of condensed layers\nas well as the melting transition to the fully swollen brush are all\ndiscontinuous. We also elucidate that the segregated layers are formed by\ndifferent subpopulations of all chains, significantly different from the\nscenario of the pearl-necklace structure formed by a single PE in poor\nsolvents. Furthermore, we bridge the microstructure of multi-layer brushes to\nexperimentally measurable reflectivity spectra, where the oscillation period\nand amplitude in the spectra are shown to be very sensitive to the number of\nlayers and the sharpness of the polymer-solvent interface. The multi-layer\nmorphology predicted by our theory is in good agreement with the lamellae\nstructure experimentally observed at hydrated Nafion film interfaces.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
