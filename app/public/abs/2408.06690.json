The proton light-front\nwave functions (LFWFs) are adopted from the soft-wall AdS/QCD predictions, and\nthe model parameters are determined using the gluon unpolarized parton\ndistribution function from the NNPDF3.0nlo dataset. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrated the model calculations for gluon transverse momentum distributions\n(TMDs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs). We also predicted the gluon\nspin and orbital angular momentum (OAM) contributions to the total proton spin.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
