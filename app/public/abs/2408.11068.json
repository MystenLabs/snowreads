Based on this frequency difference,the\npermittivity of soil is calculated which is related to the soil VWC.Triangular\ntwo turn resonator (T2 SR) resonance frequency changes from 4 to 2.38 GHz when\nVWC varies 0 percent to 30 percent.The sensor's operation principle is\ndescribed through circuit model analysis and simulations.To validate the\ndifferential sensing concept, prototype of the designed 3 cell DSMS is\nfabricated and measured.The proposed sensor exhibits frequency shift of 110 MHz\nfor 1 percent change at the highest soil moisture content (30 percent) for\nsandy type soil.This work proves the differential microwave sensing concept for\nprecision agriculture.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
