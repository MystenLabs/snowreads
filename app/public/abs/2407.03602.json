It is shown that in the limit of very strong\ncoupling the upper limit for transition temperature is determined in fact by a\ncombination of atomic constants and density of conduction electrons.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
