For these matrices, criteria are established under which\ntheir Kippenhahn curves contain elliptical components or even consist\ncompletely of such. These criteria are in terms of system of homogeneous\npolynomial equations in variables\n$(\\left|a_{j,j+1}\\right|-\\left|a_{j+1,j}\\right|)^2$, and established via a\nunified approach across arbitrary dimensions. The results are illustrated, and\nspecific numerical examples provided, for $n=7$ thus generalizing earlier work\nin the lower dimensional setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fzvu_iW1Fo2jQv4TrcGVj59eK7tdlB4q5lgzA4tLvrA","pdfSize":"726223","objectId":"0xa4e1898dbed925bc5da8383ce8828254a4a1bc57d2cb48999c9115c0e9476406","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
