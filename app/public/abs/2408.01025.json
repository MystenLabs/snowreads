These $n$-bit\ngates are entirely constructed from the Clifford+T gates, in the approach of\nselecting sequences of rotations visualized on the Bloch sphere. This Bloch\nsphere approach ensures to match the quantum layout for synthesizing\n(transpiling) these $n$-bit gates into an IBM quantum computer. Various\nstandard $n$-bit gates (Toffoli, Fredkin, etc.) and their operational\nequivalent of our proposed $n$-bit gates are examined and evaluated, in the\ncontext of the final quantum costs, as the final counts of generated IBM native\ngates. In this paper, we demonstrate that all our $n$-bit gates always have\nlower quantum costs than those of standard $n$-bit gates after transpilation.\nHence, our Bloch sphere approach can be used to build a quantum library of\nvarious cost-effective $n$-bit gates for different layouts of IBM quantum\ncomputers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
