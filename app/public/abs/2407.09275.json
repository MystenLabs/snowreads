When\nthese bounds overlap, this provides obstructions to $G$ being cocompactly\ncubulated. More strongly, it prevents $G$ from being a coarse median space.\n  As applications, we show that many free-by-cyclic groups cannot be\ncocompactly cubulated, and that any tubular group with a coarse median is\nvirtually compact special.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
