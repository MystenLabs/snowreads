In this work we generalize this approximation from the\nscattering problems with time-independent Hamiltonian to the ones with\nperiodical Hamiltonians, {\\it i.e.}, the Floquet scattering problems. We\nfurther illustrate the applicability of our generalized EA via the scattering\nproblem with respect to a shaking spherical square-well potential, by comparing\nthe results given by this approximation and the exact ones. The generalized EA\nwe developed is helpful for the research of manipulation of high-energy\nscattering processes with external field, {\\it e.g.}, the manipulation of atom,\nmolecule or nuclear collisions or reactions via strong laser fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
