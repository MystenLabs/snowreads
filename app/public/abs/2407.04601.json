This\nsimplification however has drawbacks due to the loss of modularity. In\nparticular, where ASR-based KWS systems can benefit from external unpaired text\nvia a language model, current formulations of E2E KWS systems have no such\nmechanism. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multitask training objective\nwhich allows unpaired text to be integrated into E2E KWS without complicating\nindexing and search. In addition to training an E2E KWS model to retrieve text\nqueries from spoken documents, we jointly train it to retrieve text queries\nfrom masked written documents. We show empirically that this approach can\neffectively leverage unpaired text for KWS, with significant improvements in\nsearch performance across a wide variety of languages. We conduct analysis\nwhich indicates that these improvements are achieved because the proposed\nmethod improves document representations for words in the unpaired text.\nFinally, we show that the proposed method can be used for domain adaptation in\nsettings where in-domain paired data is scarce or nonexistent.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
