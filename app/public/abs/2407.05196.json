Utilitarian welfare is maximized by concentrating\ncontributions among low-cost group members, but such policies generally induce\nsome members to leave the group or misreport their preferences. To forestall\nexit, contributions must be shifted from members with intermediate costs to\nsome high-cost members. To deter misreporting, members must be screened using\nup to two membership tiers, which reward larger contributions with increased\naccess to the good. We apply our results to the design of platforms such as\nNetflix and TikTok hosting crowd-sourced recommendation engines, which function\nas public goods supported by user feedback about new content.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
