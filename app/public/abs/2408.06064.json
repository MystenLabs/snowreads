The Belle experiment collected roughly 1\nab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity data. While Belle II data-taking is in\nprogress, we have performed a new search for exotic states and cross-section\nmeasurements with the full Belle data sets. Here we review the recent analysis\nof: (a) $e^+e^-\\to D_s^{(*)+}+D_{sJ}^-$ + $c.c$. from both $\\Upsilon(2S)$\ndecays and continuum production at 10.52 GeV, using the Belle detector at KEKB;\n(b) the analysis of $e^+e^- \\to \\eta_c J/\\psi$ + $c.c.$ and search for double\ncharmonium states; (c) the study of $e^+e^- \\to D_s^+D_{s0}(2317)^-$ + $c.c.$\nand $e^+e^- \\to D_s^+D_{s1}(2460)^-$ + $c.c.$ + anything else, in the\ncontinuum. Born cross-sections are evaluated, and a possible confirmation of\nthe states seen in the invariant mass system of $J/\\psi\\phi$ by LHCb in $B$\ndecays has been investigated.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
