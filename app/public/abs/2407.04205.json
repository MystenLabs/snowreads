We consider a\nparadigmatic example of a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state hosted by the\nhoneycomb Kitaev model, and use a trainable symmetry-guided ansatz for\npreparing its ground state. Applying the tools of quantum subspace expansion\n(QSE), Hamiltonian operator approximation, and overlap measurements, we\nsimulate the QSL at zero temperature and finite magnetic field, thus moving\noutside of the symmetric subspace. Next, we implement a protocol for quantum\nsubspace expansion-based measurement of spin-spin correlation functions.\nFinally, we perform QSE-based simulation of the dynamical structure factor\nobtained from Green's functions of the finite field Kitaev model. Our results\nshow that quantum simulators offer an insight to quasiparticle properties of\nstrongly correlated magnets and can become a valuable tool for studying\nmaterial science.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
