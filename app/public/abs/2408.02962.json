This emission is\nlikely to originate from the interface of the neutral shell and the ionized\nregion. The other three ground-state OH lines at 1665, 1667, and 1721 MHz are\nobserved in absorption and have velocities well matched with that of HCO$^+$\nabsorption. We infer that the OH absorption is from the outer shell of NGC\n7027, although the possibility that they are associated with a foreground cloud\ncannot be completely ruled out. All the OH lines exhibit a single blue-shifted\ncomponent with respect to the central star. The formation of OH in carbon-rich\nenvironments might be via photodissociation-induced chemical processes. Our\nobservations offer significant constraints for chemical simulations, and they\nunderscore the potent capability of the UWB receiver of FAST to search for\nnascent PNe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
