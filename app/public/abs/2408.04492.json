Here, using a gapped 2D Dirac\nmaterial as a model system of the OHE, we develop a microscopic theory of\norbital transport which captures extrinsic disorder effects non-perturbatively.\nWe show that it predicts several hitherto unknown effects, including (i) a\nstrong dependence of the OHE conductivity with the strength and symmetry of the\nimpurity scattering potential, and (ii) a smooth crossover from intrinsic to\nextrinsic OHE as a function of the Fermi energy. In contrast to previous\n(perturbative) studies, the OHE is found to exhibit bona fide diffusive\nbehavior in the dilute impurity limit, which we trace back to the dominance of\nskew scattering-type processes. Our work unveils the crucial nature of\nnonperturbative vertex corrections for a correct description of extrinsic\norbital Hall transport and confirms common short-range impurities as key\nenablers of the OHE.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
