Our main contribution is the proof that the word problem for\nadmissible graphs of groups, in the sense of Croke and Kleiner, is solvable in\n$O(n\\log n)$; this covers fundamental groups of non-geometric graph manifolds.\nSimilar methods also give that the word problem for free products can be solved\n\"almost as quickly\" as the word problem in the factors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
