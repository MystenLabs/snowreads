By systematic numerical experiments, we find that the leading\nLyapunov exponents obtained with large eddy simulations follow the same scaling\nlaw as that of filtered perturbations of the real flow, thus should be\ninterpreted as approximations of the latter. Data on the threshold coupling\nwavenumber for synchronisation show that the synchronisability of coupled\nturbulent flows is mainly determined by the conditional leading Lyapunov\nexponents of the slave flow itself, and is insensitive to the nature of the\nmaster flow. We present strong evidence to show that the peak wavenumber for\nthe energy spectrum of the leading Lyapunov vector is approximately the same as\nthe threshold wavenumber, corroborating a relationship established recently in\nrotating turbulence. The threshold wavenumber of large eddy simulations based\non canonical subgrid-scale stress models is shown to be different from that of\ndirect numerical simulations, even for the more sophisticated dynamical mixed\nmodel. By employing new parametrisation, the threshold wavenumbers are\nquantified. The care one needs to exercise to interpret the results obtained\nwith large eddy simulations is discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
