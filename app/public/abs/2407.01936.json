Spin dynamics activated by the interchain hopping\n$t_y$ drastically modifies the HHG features. When two chains are decoupled\n($t_y=0$), HHG originates from the dynamics of coherent doublon-holon pairs\nbecause of spin-charge separation. With increasing $t_y$, the doublon-holon\npairs lose their coherence due to their interchain hopping and resultant\nspin-strings. Furthermore, the HHG signal from spin-polarons -- charges dressed\nby spin clouds -- leads to an additional plateau in the HHG spectrum. For large\n$t_y$, we identify unconventional HHG processes involving $three$ elementary\nexcitations -- two polarons and one magnon. Our results demonstrate the\nnontrivial nature of HHG in strongly correlated systems, and its qualitative\ndifferences to conventional semiconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gO8dE6u20E2COsR0ywhGwguZWXn2p3YsZ9AzBfbyzGI","pdfSize":"4716692"}
