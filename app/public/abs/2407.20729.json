However,\nexisting safe-for-work classifiers are primarily focused on English text. To\naddress this gap for the Malaysian language, we present a novel safe-for-work\ntext classifier tailored specifically for Malaysian language content. By\ncurating and annotating a first-of-its-kind dataset of Malaysian text spanning\nmultiple content categories, we trained a classification model capable of\nidentifying potentially unsafe material using state-of-the-art natural language\nprocessing techniques. This work represents an important step in enabling safer\ninteractions and content filtering to mitigate potential risks and ensure\nresponsible deployment of LLMs. To maximize accessibility and promote further\nresearch towards enhancing alignment in LLM-Ops for the Malaysian context, the\nmodel is publicly released at\nhttps://huggingface.co/malaysia-ai/malaysian-sfw-classifier.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
