Yet,\nwith the potential of NeRF to serve as shareable digital assets, there's a\nconcern that malicious users might alter the color of NeRF models and falsely\nclaim the recolorized version as their own. To safeguard against such breaches\nof ownership, enabling original NeRF creators to establish rights over\nrecolorized NeRF is crucial. While approaches like CopyRNeRF have been\nintroduced to embed binary messages into NeRF models as digital signatures for\ncopyright protection, the process of recolorization can remove these binary\nmessages. In our paper, we present GeometrySticker, a method for seamlessly\nintegrating binary messages into the geometry components of radiance fields,\nakin to applying a sticker. GeometrySticker can embed binary messages into NeRF\nmodels while preserving the effectiveness of these messages against\nrecolorization. Our comprehensive studies demonstrate that GeometrySticker is\nadaptable to prevalent NeRF architectures and maintains a commendable level of\nrobustness against various distortions.
