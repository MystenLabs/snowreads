For this kind of dynamical systems we are\nable to characterize the upper and lower bounds of the attractor as complete\ntrajectories belonging to the attractor, so that all the internal dynamics is\nconfined in this region, which can be described as an interval due to the\norderly nature of the processes. Thus, we are able to generalize to this\nframework previous general results in literature for autonomous multivalued\nflows or nonautonomous differential equations. We apply our results to a\npartial differential inclusion with a nonautonomous term, also proving the\nupper semicontinuity dependence of pullback and global attractors when the time\ndependent term asymptotically converges to an autonomous multivalued term.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_r26ytwRyYyjtza9CZvKFMqMtBemA5RrT4r_QSufH4k","pdfSize":"240966"}
