For $s=2$, the\nproblem of computing the diameter of a $k$-CNF formula was initiated by\nCreszenzi and Rossi, who showed strong hardness results even for $k=2$.\nAssuming SETH, the current best upper bound [Angelsmark and Thapper '04] goes\nto $4^n$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. As our first result, we give exact\nalgorithms for using the Fast Fourier Transform and clique-finding that run in\n$O^*(2^{(s-1)n})$ and $O^*(s^2 |\\Omega_{F}|^{\\omega \\lceil s/3 \\rceil})$\nrespectively, where $|\\Omega_{F}|$ is the size of the solution space of the\nformula $F$ and $\\omega$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.\n  As our main result, we re-analyze the popular PPZ (Paturi, Pudlak, Zane '97)\nand Sch\\\"{o}ning's ('02) algorithms (which find one solution in time\n$O^*(2^{\\varepsilon_{k}n})$ for $\\varepsilon_{k} \\approx 1-\\Theta(1/k)$), and\nshow that in the same time, they can be used to approximate the diameter as\nwell as the dispersion ($s>2$) problems. While we need to modify Sch\\\"{o}ning's\noriginal algorithm, we show that the PPZ algorithm, without any modification,\nsamples solutions in a geometric sense. We believe that this property may be of\nindependent interest.\n  Finally, we present algorithms to output approximately diverse, approximately\noptimal solutions to NP-complete optimization problems running in time\n$\\text{poly}(s)O^*(2^{\\varepsilon n})$ with $\\varepsilon<1$ for several\nproblems such as Minimum Hitting Set and Feedback Vertex Set. For these\nproblems, all existing exact methods for finding optimal diverse solutions have\na runtime with at least an exponential dependence on the number of solutions\n$s$. Our methods find bi-approximations with polynomial dependence on $s$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X5L54frA6HXciBJ9YksUo-1wrVJOv0zDNR_OTBrbYNM","pdfSize":"1394355"}
