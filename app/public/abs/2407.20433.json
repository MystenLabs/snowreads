By measuring\nAutler-Townes splitting in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)\nspectrum, we determined that the minimum measurable microwave electric field is\napproximately five times lower than conventional EIT techniques. The results\nare well reproduced by a full optical Bloch equation model, which takes into\naccount all the hyperfine levels involved. Subsequently, the EIT setup was used\nto characterize a custom microwave cylindrical lens, which increases the field\nat the focus by a factor of three, decreasing the minimum measurable microwave\nelectric field by the same amount. Our results indicate that the combination of\npolarization spectroscopy and a microwave lens may enhance microwave\nelectrometry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
