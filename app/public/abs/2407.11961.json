Our proof involves new techniques combining tools from\nautomorphic forms and harmonic analysis.\n  In particular, we prove effective equidistribution with respect to the\nHausdorff measures on certain shifted, possibly irrational, missing digit\nCantor sets, whose Hausdorff dimensions can be as small as 0.61. This improves\nupon the dimension and rationality restrictions of the recent breakthrough of\nKhalil--Luethi [Invent. Math].\n  As an application in Diophantine approximation, a complete Khintchine's\ntheorem follows for a large class of self-similar measures extending a\ngroundbreaking work of Yu [arXiv, 2101.05910].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
