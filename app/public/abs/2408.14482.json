In addition to the widths of the signal conductor and\ncoplanar ground lines and the distance between them, the length, spacing and\nstacking of the metal layers of the substrate shield strips are also shown to\nbe critical in maximizing performance. Measured results from more than 50\ndifferent devices show that a 7X increase in the quality factor (e.g., Q > 70\nat 24 GHz in 0.18 {\\mu}m CMOS) is achievable using the optimum topology with\noptimum dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
