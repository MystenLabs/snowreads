We address only the audio-only\nSELD with SDE (SELDDE) task in this report. We propose to improve the existing\nResNet-Conformer architectures with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks in order to\nintroduce additional forms of channel- and spatial-wise attention. In order to\nimprove SELD performance, we also utilize the Spatial Cue-Augmented\nLog-Spectrogram (SALSA) features over the commonly used log-mel spectra\nfeatures for polyphonic SELD. We complement the existing Sony-TAu Realistic\nSpatial Soundscapes 2023 (STARSS23) dataset with the audio channel swapping\ntechnique and synthesize additional data using the SpatialScaper generator. We\nalso perform distance scaling in order to prevent large distance errors from\ncontributing more towards the loss function. Finally, we evaluate our approach\non the evaluation subset of the STARSS23 dataset.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
