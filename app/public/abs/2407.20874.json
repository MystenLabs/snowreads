Motivated by the random\ntheory of lattices, the statistical significance of MacWilliams theorem is\nconsidered, indeed, MacWilliams distribution provides a finite analog of the\nclassical Gauss distribution. In particular, the MacWilliams distribution over\nquotient space of a code is statistical close to the uniform distribution. In\nthe respect of lattices, the analogy of MacWilliams identity associated with\nnu-function was conjectured by Sole in 1995. We give an answer to this problem\nin positive.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9zoSy-QG2DpACVvqRmrV3zY6-yQQmNBNADj7gAmdu-4","pdfSize":"161609"}
