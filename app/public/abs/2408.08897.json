Leveraging the robust and flexible capabilities of OpenFOAM's data\nstructure for handling complex geometries and boundary conditions, it is\ndemonstrated how to construct detailed loss functions that accurately embed\nphysics constraints and potentially enhance the training and performance of\nneural networks in handling industrial-level complicated geometry for\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The present work primarily\nfocuses on the 1D Burger equation to showcase the detailed procedure of\nconstructing initial loss, boundary loss, and residual loss. While the\ncomputational geometry employed here is relatively simple, the procedure is\nsufficiently general to illustrate its applicability to more complex\ncomputational domains. The results show the trained operator former (OFormer)\nneural network can successfully predict the simulation results subject to the\nOpenFOAM'data structure composed loss. This framework potentially opens new\navenues for using deep learning to tackle complex industrial simulation\nchallenges, promising significant advancements in the accuracy and practicality\nof CFD applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
