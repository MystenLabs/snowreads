There have also been\nsuggestions that the Weyl double copy should extend to solutions with\nnon-trivial sources. In this paper, we provide a systematic derivation of\nsourced Weyl double copy formulae, using spinorial methods previously\nestablished for ${\\cal N}=0$ supergravity. As a cross-check, we rederive the\nsame formulae using a tensorial approach, which then allows us to extend our\narguments to sources containing arbitrary powers of the inverse radial\ncoordinate. We also generalise our results to include the Kerr-Newman black\nhole, clarifying previous alternative double copy formulae presented in the\nliterature. Our results extend the validity of the Weyl double copy, and may be\nuseful for further astrophysical applications of this correspondence.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
