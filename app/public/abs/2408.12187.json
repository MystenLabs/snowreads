Take advantage of trial and\nerror mechanism, reinforcement learning is able to self evolve by learning the\noptimal policy, and it is particularly well suitable for solving\ndecision-making problems. However, reinforcement learning suffers from safety\nissues and low learning efficiency, especially in the continuous action space.\nTherefore, the motivation of this paper is to address the above problem by\nproposing a hybrid Mechanism-Experience-Learning augmented approach.\nSpecifically, to realize the efficient self-evolution, the driving tendency by\nanalogy with human driving experience is proposed to reduce the search space of\nthe autonomous driving problem, while the constrained optimization problem\nbased on a mechanistic model is designed to ensure safety during the\nself-evolving process. Experimental results show that the proposed method is\ncapable of generating safe and reasonable actions in various complex scenarios,\nimproving the performance of the autonomous driving system. Compared to\nconventional reinforcement learning, the safety and efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithm are greatly improved. The training process is collision-free, and the\ntraining time is equivalent to less than 10 minutes in the real world.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
