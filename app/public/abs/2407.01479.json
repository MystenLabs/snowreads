We propose EquiBot, a robust,\ndata-efficient, and generalizable approach for robot manipulation task\nlearning. Our approach combines SIM(3)-equivariant neural network architectures\nwith diffusion models. This ensures that our learned policies are invariant to\nchanges in scale, rotation, and translation, enhancing their applicability to\nunseen environments while retaining the benefits of diffusion-based policy\nlearning such as multi-modality and robustness. We show in a suite of 6\nsimulation tasks that our proposed method reduces the data requirements and\nimproves generalization to novel scenarios. In the real world, we show with in\ntotal 10 variations of 6 mobile manipulation tasks that our method can easily\ngeneralize to novel objects and scenes after learning from just 5 minutes of\nhuman demonstrations in each task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
