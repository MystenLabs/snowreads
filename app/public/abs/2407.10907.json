The proposed parareal algorithms proceed as two-level temporal\nparallelizable integrators with the stochastic exponential integrator as the\ncoarse propagator and both the exact solution integrator and the stochastic\nexponential integrator as the fine propagator. It is proved that the\nconvergence order of the proposed algorithms linearly depends on the iteration\nnumber. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the convergence of\nthe parareal algorithms for different choices of the iteration number and the\ndamping coefficient.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
