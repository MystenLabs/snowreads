In-game objects, a type of digital currency, have emerged as\ntradable commodities within gaming ecosystems. Despite extensive research on\nvarious aspects of digital goods, little attention has been given to the impact\nof in-game trading mechanisms on user experience. This paper presents a study\naimed at evaluating the influence of trading systems on user experience in a\nracing game context. We developed a simple racing game featuring an in-game\nmarket for buying and selling car variants and conducted an A/B study comparing\nuser experiences between groups utilizing the trading system and those\nunlocking cars through race completion. Our findings suggest that while the\ntrading system did not significantly alter the overall user experience, further\nexploration of diverse trading approaches may offer insights into their impact\non user engagement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
