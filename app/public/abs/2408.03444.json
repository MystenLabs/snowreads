The QCD axion is\na well-motivated dark matter candidate that additionally solves the strong CP\nproblem in nuclear physics. A haloscope has three necessary components; a very\nstrong external magnet, a high Q cavity resonator embedded in this field, and\nan ultra-sensitive RF read-out system. This dissertation mainly reports on the\nfuture development of the resonators for ADMX, specifically superconducting RF\n(SRF) cavities. It starts with an overview of axions, haloscopes, and the\ncurrent ADMX experiment, followed by the work done at Lawrence Livermore\nNational Laboratory (LLNL) on SRF cavities, and finally the preliminary results\nof the ADMX \"hybrid\" superconducting-copper Sidecar cavity in run 1D.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sz-80qBkd9b_Av438c7MGdLN9slHGoawN4vzoPXQHx0","pdfSize":"37083634"}
