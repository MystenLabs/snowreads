In recent years, also Joint Species\nDistribution Models and Generalized Linear Latent Variale Models have gained in\npopularity when the goal is to incorporate residual covariation between species\nthat cannot be explained due to measured environmental covariates. Few software\nimplementations of such models exist that can additionally incorporate\nphylogenetic information, and those that exist tend to utilize Markov chain\nMonte Carlo methods for estimation, so that model fitting takes a long time. In\nthis article we develop new methods for quickly and flexibly fitting\nphylogenetic mixed models, potentially incorporating residual covariation\nbetween species using latent variables, with the possibility to estimate the\nstrength of phylogenetic structuring in species responses per environmental\ncovariate, and while incorporating correlation between different covariate\neffects. By combining Variational approximations with a reduced rank matrix\nnormal covariance structure, Nearest Neighbours Gaussian Processes, and\nparallel computation, phylogenetic mixed models can be fitted much more quickly\nthan the current state-of-the-art. Two simulation studies demonstrate that the\nproposed combination of approximations is not only fast, but also enjoys high\naccuracy. Finally, we demonstrate use of the method with a real world dataset\nof wood-decaying fungi.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
