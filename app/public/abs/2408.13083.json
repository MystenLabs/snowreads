Next I prove a limit formula for the trace of the functional\ncalculus and I prove that the limit can be expressed using generalized Husimi\nfunctions or using Berezin transforms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
