The dual CFT is conjectured to be a deformed symmetric orbifold of\n$\\mathbb{R}_{\\widetilde{Q}}\\times X$, where $\\mathbb{R}_{\\widetilde{Q}}$\ndenotes a linear dilaton theory with slope $\\widetilde{Q}$. In this paper, we\nconstruct DDF operators corresponding to the spacetime linear dilaton field in\nthe limit where the worldsheet theory becomes free. The DDF operator gives\nanother evidence supporting the proposed dual CFT. Furthermore, the DDF\noperator is constructed purely from the $\\rm AdS_3$ fields and thus, strongly\nimplies the existence of $\\mathbb{R}_{\\widetilde{Q}}$ for generic $X$ that\ndefines a consistent background.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
