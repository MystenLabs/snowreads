To mitigate the challenges, global planning,\nsuch as utilizing prior GPS trajectories from OpenStreetMap (OSM), is often\nused to guide the autonomous navigation of robots for mapping. However, due to\nfactors like complex terrain, unexpected body movement, and sensor noise, the\nuncertainty of the robot's pose estimates inevitably increases over time,\nultimately leading to the failure of robotic mapping. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel active loop closure procedure, enabling the robot to actively\nre-plan the previously planned GPS trajectory. The method can guide the robot\nto re-visit the previous places where the loop-closure detection can be\nperformed to trigger the back-end optimization, effectively reducing errors and\nuncertainties in pose estimation. The proposed active loop closure mechanism is\nimplemented and embedded into a real-time OSM-guided robot mapping framework.\nEmpirical results on several large-scale outdoor scenarios demonstrate its\neffectiveness and promising performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
