Through detailed investigation at the\ndevice, circuit, and system levels, we highlight the pivotal synergies between\nSNNs and IMC architectures. Additionally, we emphasize the critical need for\ncomprehensive system-level analyses, considering the inter-dependencies between\nalgorithms, devices, circuit & system parameters, crucial for optimal\nperformance. An in-depth analysis leads to identification of key system-level\nbottlenecks arising from device limitations which can be addressed using\nSNN-specific algorithm-hardware co-design techniques. This review underscores\nthe imperative for holistic device to system design space co-exploration,\nhighlighting the critical aspects of hardware and algorithm research endeavors\nfor low-power neuromorphic solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0ySfTdTNihgO176lU6ZPqk7sdd_UBjsFzKRV_Cycq-k","pdfSize":"2167991"}
