The\npurpose of this study is to analyze and demonstrate adiabaton formation in many\nlevel atomic systems. Here we focus on the analysis of five level M-type and\ndouble tripod systems. It is found that M-type atomic systems are prone to\nintensity dependent group velocity and pulse front steepening which prevents\nthe formation of long range optical adiabatons. In contrast, the double tripod\natomic system is quite favorable for the formation of optical adiabatons\nleading to two different optical field configurations propagating with\ninvariant shape.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IAt4dj0QQ3ALmus660YU6mEZYLb_haf_1S431wwWNvU","pdfSize":"348292"}
