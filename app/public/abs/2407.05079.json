Utilizing a fine-tuned StyleGAN2-ADA model, the system allows\nusers to navigate an array of possible building forms derived from Blanciak's\nsketches. Distinct from common latent space exploration tools that often rely\non projected navigation landmarks, Form Forge provides direct access to\nmanipulate each latent variable, aiming to offer a more granular exploration of\nthe model's capabilities. Form Forge's design is intended to simplify the\ninteraction with a complex, high-dimensional space and to serve as a\npreliminary investigation into how such tools might support creative processes\nin architectural design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gvi2ZhJq93ftAtQwG5eEEP1aMkXhzWjOxU-2svOPq6k","pdfSize":"9187100"}
