In this work, we present a system providing the method and tools\nto produce well-covering tests in ACVP format for cryptographic libraries. The\nsystem achieves better coverage than existing fuzzing methods by using a hybrid\napproach to fuzzing cryptographic primitives. In addition, the system offers a\nframework that allows to creates easily and securely create testing modules for\ncryptographic libraries. The work demonstrates how this system has been used to\nimprove automated testing of NSS (Network Security Services), a popular\ncryptographic library, detect its vulnerabilities and suggest ways to improve\nand further develop the ACVP test format.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_GCtg7MculI5hUVnQ4KmaOZIsVD0VFYRgajnoYy3f88","pdfSize":"258524"}
