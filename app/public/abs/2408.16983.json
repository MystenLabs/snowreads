We identify the\nexpression of physical quantities defined by the four-component Dirac field in\nterms of the two-component Schr\\\"odinger field, which is usually used in\ncondensed matter physics, and clarify its conjugate electromagnetic field. This\nconsideration bridges the fields of condensed matter physics, quantum\nchemistry, and particle physics, and paves the way to electromagnetic control\nof matter. Our findings provide a means of {\\it ab initio} quantification of\nmaterial characters such as chirality and axiality that are unique to\nlow-symmetry materials, and stimulate the systematic search for useful, new\nfunctionalities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ei2acPublcgCwmGeGNW2_au1-sU-8DcYYzG3Rq_dW6k","pdfSize":"1351298"}
