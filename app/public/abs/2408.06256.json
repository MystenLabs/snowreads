However, in optical trap arrays,\nindividually controlling the position and polarization of each trap is\nchallenging, limiting the precise tuning of interactions between adjacent\nparticles. This constraint hinders the study of complex interaction systems. In\nthis work, we introduce a third nanoparticle as a coupler to two initially\nnon-interacting nanoparticles, achieving tunable dipole-dipole coupling\nmediated by the third one. We investigated the effect of the particles' phases\nand positions on the interaction strength and demonstrated its broad\ntunability. Our method allows for precise control of interactions between any\npair of adjacent particles in multi-particle systems, facilitating the further\nuse of levitated nanoparticle arrays in macroscopic quantum mechanics and\nsensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
