This simple post-processing technique can be easily\nintegrated on an external hardware such as an analog circuit, microcontroller,\naudio codec, DSP unit, or within the ASIC chip in a case of MEMS microphones.\nIt significantly reduces microphone distortion across its frequency and dynamic\nrange. It relies on a single parameter, which can be derived from either the\nmicrophone's physical parameters or a straightforward measurement presented in\nthis paper. An optimal estimate of this parameter achieves the best distortion\nreduction, whereas overestimating it never increases distortion beyond the\noriginal level. The technique was tested on a MEMS microphone. Our findings\nindicate that for harmonic excitation the proposed technique reduces the second\nharmonic by approximately 40 dB, leading to a significant reduction in the\nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD). The efficiency of the distortion reduction\ntechnique for more complex signals is demonstrated through two-tone and\nmultitone experiments, where second-order intermodulation products are reduced\nby at least 20 dB.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
