While understanding and predicting the dynamics of romantic\ninteractions used to be exclusive to human judgment, we show that Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can detect romantic attraction during brief\ngetting-to-know-you interactions. Examining data from 964 speed dates, we show\nthat ChatGPT (and Claude 3) can predict both objective and subjective\nindicators of speed dating success (r=0.12-0.23). ChatGPT's predictions of\nactual matching (i.e., the exchange of contact information) were not only on\npar with those of human judges who had access to the same information but\nincremental to speed daters' own predictions. While some of the variance in\nChatGPT's predictions can be explained by common content dimensions (such as\nthe valence of the conversations) the fact that there remains a substantial\nproportion of unexplained variance suggests that ChatGPT also picks up on\nconversational dynamics. In addition, ChatGPT's judgments showed substantial\noverlap with those made by the human observers (mean r=0.29), highlighting\nsimilarities in their representation of romantic attraction that is, partially,\nindependent of accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
