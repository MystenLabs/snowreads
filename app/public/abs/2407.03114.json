In this paper, we construct the orthogonal product sets with strong\nquantum nonlocality in any possible $n$-partite systems, where $n$ is greater\nthan three. Rigorous proofs show that these sets are locally irreducible in\nevery $(n-1)$-partition. They not only possess stronger properties than\nnonlocality and fewer quantum states than the strongest nonlocal sets, but also\nare positive answers to the open question \"how to construct different strength\nnonlocality of orthogonal product states for general multipartite and\nhigh-dimensional quantum systems\" of Zhang et al. [{Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{99},\n062108 (2019)}]. Our results can also enhance one understanding for the\nnonlocality without entanglement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
