The class\nconsists of all clones on finite sets determined by binary relations whose\nprojections to both coordinates have at most two elements. This class can be\nalternatively described up to minion homomorphisms as the class of multisorted\nBoolean clones determined by binary relations. We also introduce and apply the\nconcept of a minion core which provides canonical representatives for\nequivalence classes of clones, more generally minions, on finite sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
