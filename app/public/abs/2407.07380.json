We show that the proposed second-derivative-based\napproach can amplify the heartbeat component in radar signals effectively and\nalso confirm that use of the variational mode extraction method represents an\nefficient way to emphasize the heartbeat component amplified via the\nsecond-derivative-based approach. We demonstrate estimation of the heart\ninterbeat intervals using the proposed approach in combination with the\ntopology method, which is an accurate interbeat interval estimation method. The\nperformance of the proposed method is evaluated quantitatively using data\nobtained from eleven participants that were measured using a millimeter-wave\nradar system. When compared with conventional methods based on the phase of the\ncomplex radar signal, our proposed method can achieve higher accuracy when\nestimating the heart interbeat intervals; the correlation coefficient for the\nproposed method was increased by 0.20 and the root-mean-square error decreased\nby 23%.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
