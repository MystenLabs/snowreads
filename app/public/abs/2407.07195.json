We\nconsider the scattering of spinning black holes and highlight the necessary\ndetails for the calculation of the partition function. We present the\n$\\epsilon$-expansion of the essential two-loop integrals using\nIntegration-by-Parts (IBP) reduction and differential equation techniques,\nwhich we then utilize to compute the linear-in-order spin eikonal phase up to\n3PM. Additionally, we discuss the dependence of the phase on the spin\norientations of the black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
