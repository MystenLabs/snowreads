Since this resonance is indicated into ZZ in a\nCut Based Analysis and into three other modes: WW, H95H125 and A450Z, the\npresent paper is an attempt to understand these apparent contradictions. Our\nconclusion, to be confirmed by ATLAS and CMS experiments, is that strict\nselections for the reaction H650->ZZ mode seem inadequate, cutting as much into\nthe signal than into the background, therefore reducing its statistical\nsignificance. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is that these\nselections are inefficient for a tensor particle produced by VBF and decaying\ninto ZZ with an angular distributions similar to the Drell Yan background. If\ntrue, our description of the various findings in term of the Georgi Machacek\nmodel needs to be deeply revised, which is attempted in the present note. A\nscenario with T650 as a tensor resonance is presented which naturally\naccommodates WW/ZZ and H95H125 decays, while we suggest that A450Z coud come\nfrom a scalar resonance degenerate in mass with T650.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3LDuaLhPY9amDdlKPXes3NQHGuWTsIqF8c0B2xXmm5o","pdfSize":"704842"}
