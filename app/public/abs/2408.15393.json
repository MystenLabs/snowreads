For our analysis, we consider systems of linear ODEs,\nand linear parabolic PDEs. We prove that properly designed PINNs offer\nconsistent and asymptotically stable numerical schemes, thus convergent\nschemes. In particular, we prove that multi-collocation random projection PINNs\nguarantee asymptotic stability for very high stiffness and that\nsingle-collocation PINNs are $A$-stable. To assess the performance of the PINNs\nin terms of both numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, we\ncompare it with other implicit schemes and in particular backward Euler, the\nmidpoint, trapezoidal (Crank-Nikolson), the 2-stage Gauss scheme and the 2 and\n3 stages Radau schemes. We show that the proposed PINNs outperform the above\ntraditional schemes, in both numerical approximation accuracy and importantly\ncomputational cost, for a wide range of step sizes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
