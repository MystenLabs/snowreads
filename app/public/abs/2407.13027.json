Although groundbreaking, it\nstruggles with gene capture yielding high corruption in acquired data. Given\npotential applications, recent efforts have focused on predicting\ntranscriptomic profiles solely from histology images. However, differences in\ndatabases, preprocessing techniques, and training hyperparameters hinder a fair\ncomparison between methods. To address these challenges, we present a\nsystematically curated and processed database collected from 26 public sources,\nrepresenting an 8.6-fold increase compared to previous works. Additionally, we\npropose a state-of-the-art transformer based completion technique for inferring\nmissing gene expression, which significantly boosts the performance of\ntranscriptomic profile predictions across all datasets. Altogether, our\ncontributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression\nprediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future\nresearch on spatial transcriptomics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"VW_EXl7ZN8NkoihZRtPN_VlREmW_8v4BrCOKCyk7glI","pdfSize":"4383698"}
