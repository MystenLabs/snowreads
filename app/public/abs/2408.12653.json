We derive an exact expression for the probability propagator\nand the mean-squared displacement in the clean limit and generalize it for the\ndisordered case using the Liouville operator method. Our analysis reveals that\nin the presence a random static field, the system follows diffusive transport;\nhowever, an increase in the field strength causes a suppression in the\ntransport and thus results in disorder-induced localization. We further extend\nthe analysis for a time-dependent disordered electric field and show that the\ndynamics of mean-squared-displacement deviates from the parabolic path as the\nfield strength increases, unlike the clean limit where ballistic transport\noccurs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
