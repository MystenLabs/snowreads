Here, we show that the Pauli term naturally appears in a known\nfamily of Dirac materials -- the lead-halide perovskites, suggesting a novel\nplayground for the study of analogue QED effects. We outline measurable\nmanifestations of the Pauli term in the phenomena pertaining to (i) the Klein\nparadox and (ii) relativistic corrections to bound states. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that the binding energy of an electron in the vicinity of a\npositively charged defect is noticeably decreased due to the polarizability of\nlead ions and the appearance of a Darwin-like term. Our study adds to\nunderstanding of quantum phenomena in lead-halide perovskites, and paves the\nway for tabletop simulations of analogue Dirac-Pauli equations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
