The neutron star matter has been considered to be\n$\\beta$-equilibrated neutron-proton-electron-muon matter at the core with a\nrigid crust. The multipole moments of a slowly rotating neutron star\ncharacterize its external gravitational field. These variables are dependent on\nthe interior structure of the neutron star described by the equation of state\nof the neutron star matter. The properties of neutron stars, such as the mass,\nthe radius, the dimensionless moment of inertia, the compactness, the Love\nnumber, the dimensionless tidal deformability and the dimensionless quadrupole\nmoment have been calculated and relations among these quantities have been\nexplored. It is found that most of these relations do not depend sensitively on\nthe details of the internal structure of neutron stars. Such universality\nimplies that the measurement of a single quantity appearing in a universal\nrelation would automatically provide information about the others,\nnotwithstanding the fact that those may not be accessible observationally.\nThese can be used to estimate deformability of compact stars through moment of\ninertia measurements, to quantify spin in binary inspirals by breaking\ndegeneracies in the detection of gravitational waves and test General\nRelativity in a way that is independent of nuclear structure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
