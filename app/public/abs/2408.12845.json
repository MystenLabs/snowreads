Existing algorithms assume a small number of items with\na sufficiently large number of copies, which ensures a good utility estimation\nfor all item-agent pairs. However, such an assumption may not hold in many\nreal-life applications, e.g., an online platform that has a large number of\nusers (items) who only use the platform's service providers (agents) a few\ntimes (a few copies of items), which makes it difficult to estimate the utility\nfor all item-agent pairs. To overcome this challenge, we model the online fair\ndivision problem using contextual bandits, assuming the utility is an unknown\nfunction of the item-agent features. We then propose algorithms for online fair\ndivision with sub-linear regret guarantees. Our experimental results also\nverify the different performance aspects of the proposed algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
