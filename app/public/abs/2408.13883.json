The driving force for the grain boundary\nmotion comes from the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility of the material,\nleading to the free energy difference between differently oriented grains. We\nfind that above a critical magnetic field the grain boundary motion is in a\nsteady state, and under this condition, the mobile thermal groove exhibits a\nuniversal behavior scaled surface profiles are timeinvariant and independent of\nthermodynamic parameters. The simulated universal curve agrees well with\nMullins theory of mobile grooves for any groove shape. We extend our study to a\nthree-dimensional polycrystalline thin film with equalsized hexagonal grains.\nWe observe a preferential grain growth depending on the applied magnetic field\ndirection, which can be leveraged for field-assisted texture control of\npolycrystalline thin films. Our study reveals that keeping other conditions the\nsame, the rate of pitting at the vertices of the hexagonal grains substantially\ndecreases in the presence of the external magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
