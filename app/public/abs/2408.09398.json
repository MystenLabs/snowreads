A key distinction\nfrom traditional scenarios is evident here: despite reduced regularity in\nobservables, our method still maintains exponential convergence. In particular,\nwe develop new techniques that yield very precise rates of exponential\nconvergence, as evidenced by numerical simulations. Furthermore, this\ninnovative approach extends to quantitative analyses involving different\nweighting functions employed by others, surpassing the limitations inherent in\nprior research. It also enhances the exponential convergence rates of weighted\nBirkhoff averages along quasi-periodic orbits via analytic observables. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first result on the uniform exponential\nacceleration beyond averages along quasi-periodic or almost periodic orbits,\nparticularly from a quantitative perspective.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
