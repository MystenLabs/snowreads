To address\nthis challenge, we propose Ant Backpressure (Ant-BP), a fully distributed\nrouting scheme that incorporates the multi-path routing capability of SP-BP\ninto ant colony optimization (ACO) routing, which allows packets of different\ncommodities to share link capacity in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner.\nNumerical evaluations show that Ant-BP can improve the latency and delivery\nratio over SP-BP and ACO routing schemes, while achieving the same throughput\nof SP-BP under low-to-medium traffic loads.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
