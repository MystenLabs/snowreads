However, system designers must understand the\ncause of a distribution shift in order to implement the appropriate\nintervention or mitigation strategy and prevent system failure. In this paper,\nwe present a novel framework for diagnosing distribution shifts in a streaming\nfashion by deploying multiple stochastic martingales simultaneously. We show\nthat knowledge of the underlying cause of a distribution shift can lead to\nproper interventions over the lifecycle of a deployed system. Our experimental\nframework can easily be adapted to different types of distribution shifts,\nmodels, and datasets. We find that our method outperforms existing work on\ndiagnosing distribution shifts in terms of speed, accuracy, and flexibility,\nand validate the efficiency of our model in both simulated and live hardware\nsettings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
