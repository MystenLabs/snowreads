Given a graph $G$ with a\nsubset $|T|=k$ of its vertices called terminals, a \\emph{quality-$q$ cut\nsparsifier} is a graph $G'$ that contains $T$, such that, for any partition\n$(T_1,T_2)$ of $T$ into non-empty subsets, the value of the min-cut in $G'$\nseparating $T_1$ from $T_2$ is within factor $q$ from the value of the min-cut\nin $G$ separating $T_1$ from $T_2$. The construction of cut sparsifiers with\ngood (small) quality and size has been a central problem in graph compression\nfor years.\n  Planar graphs and quasi-bipartite graphs are two important special families\nstudied in this research direction. The main results in this paper are new cut\nsparsifier constructions for them in the high-quality regime (where $q=1$ or\n$1+\\varepsilon$ for small $\\varepsilon>0$).\n  We first show that every planar graph admits a planar\nquality-$(1+\\varepsilon)$ cut sparsifier of size $\\tilde\nO(k/\\text{poly}(\\varepsilon))$, which is in sharp contrast with the lower bound\nof $2^{\\Omega(k)}$ for the quality-$1$ case.\n  We then show that every quasi-bipartite graph admits a quality-$1$ cut\nsparsifier of size $2^{\\tilde O(k^2)}$. This is the second to improve over the\ndoubly-exponential bound for general graphs (previously only planar graphs have\nbeen shown to have single-exponential size quality-$1$ cut sparsifiers).\n  Lastly, we show that contraction, a common approach for constructing cut\nsparsifiers adopted in most previous works, does not always give optimal bounds\nfor cut sparsifiers. We demonstrate this by showing that the optimal size bound\nfor quality-$(1+\\varepsilon)$ contraction-based cut sparsifiers for\nquasi-bipartite graphs lies in the range\n$[k^{\\tilde\\Omega(1/\\varepsilon)},k^{O(1/\\varepsilon^2)}]$, while in previous\nwork an upper bound of $\\tilde O(k/\\varepsilon^2)$ was achieved via a\nnon-contraction approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
