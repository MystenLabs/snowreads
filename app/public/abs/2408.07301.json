However, the application of IPM in experiments has been\nlargely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the IPM driven particle rotation by\ncylindrically polarized Gaussian beams with no spin or orbital angular\nmomentum. Theoretical analysis and experimental measurements demonstrate that\ngold microparticles will be rotated in the azimuthal direction while confined\nin the radial direction. We achieved controllable rotation of the particle by\ntuning the cylindrical polarization state. Interestingly, the transfer of IPM\nto a gold particle is demonstrated to be competitive with that of spin angular\nmomentum. These findings hold promising in light-matter interactions and\nparticle manipulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
