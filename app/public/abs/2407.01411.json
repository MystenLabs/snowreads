To achieve\nthis goal, our model uses a hypernetwork to generate the weights of these\nmodules based on the task, the transformer layer, and its position within this\nlayer. Our method combines the benefits of multi-task learning by capturing the\nstructure of all tasks while reducing the task interference problem by\nencapsulating the task-specific knowledge in the generated weights and the\nbenefits of combining different parameter-efficient methods to outperform\nfull-fine tuning. We provide empirical evidence that HyperLoader outperforms\nprevious approaches in most datasets and obtains the best average performance\nacross tasks in high-resource and low-resource scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
