During the initial downlink phase, data\ntransmission occurs via RF link between hovering Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nand the floating buoys at the water surface. As fixed buoy acts as\namplify-and-forward relays, the second UOWC link represents downlink signal\ntransmission from the floating buoy to the underwater device. Best relay\nselection is adopted, meaning that only the buoy with the best estimated\nRF-based UAV-buoy channel will perform signal transmission to an underwater\ndevice. Analytical expression for the outage probability is derived and\nutilized to examine the system's performance behaviour for various UOWC and RF\nchannel conditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
