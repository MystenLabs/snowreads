It is a\ndiscrete-time process in which uninformed actors incrementally receive\ninformation from their informed neighbors or from the outside. Our goal is to\nminimize the number of confused actors - that is, the number of actors who\nreceive contradictory information. We prove upper bounds for the number of\nconfused actors in signed networks and in equivalence classes of signed\nnetworks. In particular, we show that there are signed networks where, for any\ninformation placement strategy, almost 60\\% of the actors are confused.\nFurthermore, this is also the case when considering the minimum number of\nconfused actors within an equivalence class of signed graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
