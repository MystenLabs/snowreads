We realize the Goresky-Hingston\ncoproduct as a map of spectra, and show that the failure of $f$ to entwine the\nspectral coproducts can be characterized by Chas-Sullivan multiplication with\n$[T]$. In particular, when $f$ is a simple homotopy equivalence, the spectral\ncoproducts of $M$ and $N$ agree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
