For a strongly-interacting Bose-Bose\nmixture, we show that the time evolution of the momentum distribution from an\ninitially symmetry-mixed state is quasi-constant for a SU(2) symmetry\nconserving Hamiltonian, while it displays large oscillations in time for the\nsymmetry-breaking case where inter- and intra-species interactions are\ndifferent. Using the property that the momentum distribution operator at strong\ninteractions commutes with the class-sum operator, the latter acting as a\nsymmetry witness, we show that the momentum distribution oscillations\ncorrespond to symmetry oscillations, with a mechanism analog to neutrino\nflavour oscillations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
