In\nthis paper, we present the first systematic study of backdoor attacks on HQNNs.\nWe begin by proposing an attack framework and providing a theoretical analysis\nof the generalization bounds and minimum perturbation requirements for backdoor\nattacks on HQNNs. Next, we employ two classic backdoor attack methods on HQNNs\nand Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to further investigate the robustness\nof HQNNs. Our experimental results demonstrate that HQNNs are more robust than\nCNNs, requiring more significant image modifications for successful attacks.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Qcolor backdoor, which utilizes color shifts as\ntriggers and employs the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)\nto optimize hyperparameters. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness of the Qcolor backdoor.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
