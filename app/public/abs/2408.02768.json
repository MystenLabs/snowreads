The heavy reliance on road transport, coupled with the\nunderutilization of the railway system, results in congested highways,\nprolonged transportation times, higher costs, and increased carbon emissions.\nCalifornia's San Pedro Port Complex (SPPC), the nation's busiest, incurs a\nsignificant share of these challenges. We utilize an agent-based simulation to\nreplicate real-world scenarios, focusing on the intricacies of interactions in\na modified intermodal inbound freight system for the SPPC. This involves\nrelocating container classification to potential warehouses in California,\nUtah, Arizona, and Nevada, rather than exclusively at port areas. Our primary\naim is to evaluate the proposed system's efficiency, considering cost and\nfreight throughput, while also examining the effects of workforce shortages.\nComputational analysis suggests that strategically installing intermodal\ncapabilities in select warehouses can reduce transportation costs, boost\nthroughput, and foster resour\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
