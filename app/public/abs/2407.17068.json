Chaos here is\nunderstood in the sense of the original Sto\\ss zahlansatz, as an almost\ncomplete independence of the particle velocities which we measure by the\nmagnitude of their cumulants up to a finite, but arbitrary order. Known\nspectral gap results imply that typical initial densities converge to uniform\ndistribution on the constant energy sphere at a time which has order of $N$\nexpected collisions. We prove that the finite order cumulants converge to their\nsmall stationary values much faster, already at a time scale of order one\ncollisions. The proof relies on stability analysis of the closed, but\nnonlinear, hierarchy of energy cumulants around the fixed point formed by their\nvalues in the stationary spherical distribution. It provides the first example\nof an application of the cumulant hierarchy method to control the properties of\na microscopic model related to kinetic theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
