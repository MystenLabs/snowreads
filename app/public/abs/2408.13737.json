In 2011, Gun, Murty and Rath studied\nthe nature of special values of the derivatives of even Dirichlet-type\nfunctions and proved that it can be either zero or transcendental. Here for\nsome special cases we characterize the set of functions for which $L'(0,f)$ is\nzero or transcendental. Using a theorem of Ramachandra about multiplicative\nindependence of cyclotomic units we also provide some non-trivial examples of\nfunctions where $L'(0,f)$ is zero. Finally, assuming Schanuel's conjecture we\nderive the algebraic independence of special values of derivatives of\n$L$-functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
