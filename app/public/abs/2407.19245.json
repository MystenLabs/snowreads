This study investigates the $\\alpha$-annealing process\nof the linear Ant System within the infinite-range Ising model to address these\nchallenges. Here, \"linear\" refers to the decision function employed by the\nants. By systematically increasing $\\alpha$, we explore its impact on enhancing\nthe search for the ground state. We derive the Fokker-Planck equation for the\npheromone ratios and obtain the joint probability density function (PDF) in\nstationary states. As $\\alpha$ increases, the joint PDF transitions from a\nmono-modal to a multi-modal state. In the homogeneous fully connected Ising\nmodel, $\\alpha$-annealing facilitates the transition from a trivial solution at\n$\\alpha=0$ to the ground state. The parameter $\\alpha$ in the annealing process\nplays a role analogous to the transverse field in quantum annealing. Our\nfindings demonstrate the potential of $\\alpha$-annealing in navigating complex\noptimization problems, suggesting its broader application beyond the\ninfinite-range Ising model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
