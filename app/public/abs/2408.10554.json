It acknowledges the transformative power of\nGenAI in software code generation, while also cautioning against the inherent\nrisks of bias and errors if left unchecked. Emphasising the irreplaceable value\nof traditional programming, it posits that GenAI is not a replacement but a\ncomplementary tool for writing software code. Ethical considerations are\nparamount with the paper advocating for stringent ethical guidelines to ensure\nGenAI serves the greater good and does not compromise on accountability in\nwriting software code. It suggests a balanced approach, combining human\noversight with AI's capabilities, to mitigate risks and enhance reliability.\nThe paper concludes by proposing guidelines for GenAI utilisation in coding,\nwhich will empower developers to navigate its complexities and employ it\nresponsibly. This approach addresses current ethical concerns and sets a\nfoundation for the judicious use of GenAI in the future, ensuring its benefits\nare harnessed effectively while maintaining moral integrity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0kZDJmHY0UovK2A9cSJMJw_agaQ1HOwaJ0S7O6CfF3A","pdfSize":"234877"}
