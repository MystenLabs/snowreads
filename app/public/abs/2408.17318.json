We scrutinize the evidence for thawing\nquintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show\nthat, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$,\n$w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a\ncompilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that\nthawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of\nthis scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale\n$V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce\nun-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect\non the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative\nvalue of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model\nwe find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
