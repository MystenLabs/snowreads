For a field $\\mathbb{F},$ we consider the $\\mathbb{F}$-path Euler\ncharacteristic $\\chi^\\mathbb{F}(G)$ of a digraph $G$ defined as the alternating\nsum of dimensions of path homology groups with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}.$ If\n$\\Omega_\\bullet(G;\\mathbb{F})$ is a bounded chain complex, the constructed\nbases can be applied to compute $\\chi^\\mathbb{F}(G)$. We provide an explicit\nexample of a digraph $\\mathcal{G}$ whose $\\mathbb{F}$-path Euler characteristic\ndepends on whether the characteristic of $\\mathbb{F}$ is two, revealing the\ndifferences between GLMY theory and the homology theory of spaces. This allows\nus to prove that there is no topological space $X$ whose homology is isomorphic\nto path homology of the digraph $H_*(X;\\mathbb{K})\\cong {\\rm\nPH}_*(\\mathcal{G};\\mathbb{K})$ simultaneously for $\\mathbb{K}=\\mathbb{Z}$ and\n$\\mathbb{K}=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}.$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"nvlV0G_oCYHvzhjC4ezNH8x6NyZtQF9P2cxXfxJXkGg","pdfSize":"254902"}
