It is known\nthat the time-fractional problem with the Fujita exponent in the scale critical\nspace $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^N)$ exhibits the local-in-time solvability in contrast to\nthe unsolvability of the Fujita critical classical semilinear heat equation.\nOur new sufficient conditions take into account the fine structure of\nsingularities of the initial data, in order to show a natural correspondance\nbetween the time-fractional and the classical case for the local-in-time\nsolvability. We also apply our arguments to life span estimates for some\ntypical initial data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
