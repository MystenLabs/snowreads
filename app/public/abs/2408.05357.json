We present SHIELD (Schema-based\nHierarchical Induction for EV supply chain Disruption), a system integrating\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) with domain expertise for EV battery supply chain\nrisk assessment. SHIELD combines: (1) LLM-driven schema learning to construct a\ncomprehensive knowledge library, (2) a disruption analysis system utilizing\nfine-tuned language models for event extraction, multi-dimensional similarity\nmatching for schema matching, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with\nlogical constraints for prediction, and (3) an interactive interface for\nvisualizing results and incorporating expert feedback to enhance\ndecision-making. Evaluated on 12,070 paragraphs from 365 sources (2022-2023),\nSHIELD outperforms baseline GCNs and LLM+prompt methods (e.g., GPT-4o) in\ndisruption prediction. These results demonstrate SHIELD's effectiveness in\ncombining LLM capabilities with domain expertise for enhanced supply chain risk\nassessment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
