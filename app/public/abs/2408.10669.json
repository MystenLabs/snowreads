The key idea is dynamically optimizing the tree structure that\nminimizes the bond mutual information. The proposed method offers enhanced\nperformance and uncovers hidden relational structures in the target data. We\nillustrate potential practical applications with four examples: (i) random\npatterns, (ii) QMNIST hand-written digits, (iii) Bayesian networks, and (iv)\nthe stock price fluctuation pattern in S&P500. In (i) and (ii), strongly\ncorrelated variables were concentrated near the center of the network; in\n(iii), the causality pattern was identified; and, in (iv), a structure\ncorresponding to the eleven sectors emerged.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
