The gradient\nconjecture of R. Thom states that, again for analytic cost functions, whenever\nthe gradient flow trajectory converges, the limit of its unit secants exists.\nOne might think that already the convergence of the gradient flow trajectory to\na critical point is enough to ensure that the unit secants have a limit, but\nthis does not hold in general - the gradient conjecture is to a certain extend\nsharp. We provide a counterexample in case of the missing analyticity\nassumption, that is a smooth (non-analytic) cost function $f$, where the limit\nof unit secants does not exist. In addition, $f$ satisfies even a strong\ngeometric length-distance convergence property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
