Both notions rely on maximally consistent\nsubgroups of agents, with cautious quantifying universally and bold quantifying\nexistentially. As a result, while the cautious distributed belief of a group is\ninconsistent only when all group members are individually inconsistent, the\nbold distributed belief of a group is never inconsistent. The paper discusses\nthese two notions, presenting their respective modalities and semantic\ninterpretations, discussing some of their basic properties, studying whether\nthey preserve doxastic properties from the members of the group, and comparing\nthem not only with standard distributed belief but also with one another, both\nat the level of modalities and at the level of language expressivity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
