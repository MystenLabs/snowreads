While numerous studies have\naddressed the issue of intelligent traffic systems in the context of various\ndisturbances, traffic signal malfunction, a common real-world occurrence with\nsignificant repercussions, has received comparatively limited attention. The\nprimary objective of this research is to mitigate the adverse effects of\ntraffic signal malfunction, such as traffic congestion and collision, by\noptimizing the control of neighboring functioning signals. To achieve this\ngoal, this paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework (MalLight),\nwhich leverages an Influence-aware State Aggregation Module (ISAM) and an\nInfluence-aware Reward Aggregation Module (IRAM) to achieve coordinated control\nof surrounding traffic signals. To the best of our knowledge, this study\npioneers the application of a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based approach to\naddress the challenges posed by traffic signal malfunction. Empirical\ninvestigations conducted on real-world datasets substantiate the superior\nperformance of our proposed methodology over conventional and deep\nlearning-based alternatives in the presence of signal malfunction, with\nreduction of throughput alleviated by as much as 48.6$\\%$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
