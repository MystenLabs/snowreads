The study calculated the average GC motion\nvelocities relative to the Galactic plane in the northern and southern regions\ndepending on the galactic latitude b and distance from the Galactic plane. The\nwork consisted of using the GC parameters to find the proper motion of clusters\nalong the Galactic latitude b and the velocities V of cluster motion in the\nperpendicular direction relative to the Galactic plane for the northern and\nsouthern regions, respectively, and determine the average values of these\nvelocities. The velocities V of GC motion were also found depending on the\ndistance to the Galaxy plane and their average values were determined. The work\nalso determined the average velocity VR of motion of the GC relative to the\ncenter of the galaxy.
