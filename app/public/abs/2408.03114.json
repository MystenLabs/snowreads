For this purpose, by deriving an improved global Carleman\nestimates for linear systems, we obtain the controllability results for the\nstochastic linear systems with a $L^2$-valued source term. Based on it,\ntogether with a Banach fixed point argument, the desired null controllability\nof semilinear systems is derived.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
