Thus, we consider here a scenario where the\nSM is extended with a U(1) gauge group, promoting the lepton number to a local\nsymmetry. The gauge anomaly cancellations necessitate the extension of the\nparticle spectrum with several beyond the SM (BSM) particle fields. The\nextended lepton gauge group breaks around the TeV scale via spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking, and a $Z_2$ symmetry remains, which ensures the stability of\nthe light $Z_2$ odd BSM particles. Interestingly, the particle spectrum of the\nmodel has two distinct dark sectors, with one having a Dirac-type DM and the\nother one containing a Majorana-type DM, thus resulting in a multipartite dark\nmatter scenario. We have explored the available parameter space consistent with\nthe observed dark matter relic density and direct detection measurements for\nboth of the DM particles. Having a Majorana dark matter, we have also studied\nfor the gamma line signatures to constrain the parameter space from the\nindirect dark matter detection experiments like FermiLAT and CTA.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
