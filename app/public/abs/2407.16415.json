We reveal that\nby tuning the third nearest-neighbor hoppings, not only single flat band but\nalso degenerate flat band can be created on the \\Gamma - M line. We provide the\ndetailed conditions to realize them. The coexistence of these bands can be\nalmost realized near the fundamental band gap in graphene with triangular\ndefects in a superhoneycomb arrangement. Our results strongly indicate that\nlong-range electron hopping has a new possibility for designing electronic\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
