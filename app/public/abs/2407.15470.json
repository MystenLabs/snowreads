At the European Southern Observatory\n(ESO) this process entails scheduling the scientific proposals according to\ntheir scientific merit and available observing resources, as well as scheduling\ntechnical, maintenance, and commissioning activities for all operational\ntelescopes of the La Silla Paranal Observatory. After the recent overhaul of\nthe phase 1 proposal submission software, ESO started the development of a new\ntelescopes time allocation and scheduling tool. The new tool makes the\nscheduling process more efficient while optimising the use of observing\nfacilities. Besides scheduling activities and allocating time according to\nscientific merit, available resources, operational and programmatic needs, the\ntool will enable simultaneous scheduling of multiple telescopes to\nappropriately account for dependencies between them. The implementation of this\nnew Time Allocation tool opens the possibility for dynamic re-scheduling of the\ntelescopes, which is a pre-requisite to implementing a \"Yearly Call for\nProposals\" along with the \"Fast Track Channel\" at ESO.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
