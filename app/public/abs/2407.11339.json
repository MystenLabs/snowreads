The time-reversal\nsymmetry of the resonators chain is broken by the spinning of the resonators,\ninstead of external or synthetic magnetic field. Two nonreciprocal\nsingle-photon band gaps can be obtained in the coupled-spinning-resonator\nchain, whose width depends on the angular velocity of the spinning resonator.\nBased on the nonreciprocal band gaps, we can implement a single photon\ncirculator at multiple frequency windows, and the direction of photon cycling\nis opposite for different band gaps. In addition, reciprocal single-photon band\nstructures can also be realized in the coupled-spinning-resonator chain when\nall resonators rotate in the same direction with equal angular velocity. Our\nwork open a new route to achieve, manipulate, and switch nonreciprocal or\nreciprocal single-photon band structures, and provides new opportunities to\nrealize novel single-photon devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
