Advancements in the two-photon polymerization (2PP) fabrication\nprocess introduce additional complexity, necessitating the development of more\nflexible optimization algorithms to enable the creation of multi-material 3D\nstructures with unique properties. This paper presents an efficient\nreverse-mode automatic differentiation framework for finite-difference\ntimedomain (FDTD) simulations that is able to handle several constraints\narising from novel fabrication methods. Our method is based on straight-through\ngradient estimation that enables non-differentiable shape parametrizations. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by creating increasingly complex\nstructures to solve the coupling problem in integrated photonic circuits. The\nresults highlight the potential of our method for future PIC design and\npractical applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
