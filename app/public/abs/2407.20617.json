We calculate two-point\ncorrelation functions with $m_\\pi \\sim 280$ MeV, extracting both the\nfinite-volume spectrum and matrix elements for these states created from the\nvacuum by a vector current. After determining the coupled-channel $\\pi\\pi,\nK\\overline{K}$ scattering amplitudes, we perform the necessary correction for\nthe significant finite-volume effects present in the current matrix elements,\nleading to the timelike form-factors. We find these to be dominated by the\npresence of the $\\rho$ resonance, and we extract its decay constant by an\nanalytic continuation of the amplitudes to the resonance pole. In addition, the\nspacelike pion form-factor is determined on the same lattice configurations,\nand a dispersive parameterization is used to simultaneously describe the\nspacelike and elastic timelike regions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IMge5g_IpFFMnngjLJs6Qx1oUqqjz0ds4y0jr7HDAeI","pdfSize":"3613330","objectId":"0xcb1724e856a26a593865c8fa096c61b42d34da258a75b7f6bf8d0eede4d3f2c0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
