This study\nattempted to fill a vital knowledge gap about the nuanced landscape of\nexaminees' rapid-guessing patterns in CAT in the interim assessment context. We\nanalyzed a sample of 146,519 examinees in Grades 1-8 who participated in a\nwidely used CAT, using hierarchical clustering, a robust data science\nmethodology for uncovering insights in data. We found that examinees'\nrapid-guessing patterns varied across item positions, content domains,\nchronological grades, examinee clusters, and examinees' overall rapid-guessing\nlevel on the test, suggesting a nuanced interplay between testing features and\nexaminees' behavior. Our study contributes to the literature on rapid guessing\nin CATs for interim assessment, offering a comprehensive and nuanced pattern\nanalysis and demonstrating the application of hierarchical clustering to\nprocess data analysis in testing.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2NJB_gtzFPhMXnPWoG-XFdZRw_SW3SzzJq0isaciZ88","pdfSize":"1595068"}
