There are two competing localization channels, ``neutral-mode\nsuperconductivity'' and ``neutral-mode backscattering''. Localization in any of\nthese channels leads to an effective theory of the junction that is\ncharacteristic for FQH effect of bosons, with a minimal integer excitation\ncharge equal to two, and with elementary quasiparticle charge equal to 2/3.\nThese values can be measured by studying shot noise in tunneling experiments.\nUnder the assumption of ballistic transport in the arms connecting the junction\nto contacts, the two-terminal conductance of the junction is found to be 4/3\nfor the former localization channel and 1/3 for the latter. The four-terminal\nconductance matrix reveals in this regime a strong quantized drag between the\nedges induced by neutral-mode localization. The two localization channels lead\nto opposite signs of the drag conductance, equal to $\\pm 1/4$, which can also\nbe interpreted as a special type of Andreev scattering. Coherent random\ntunneling in arms of the device (which are segments of 2/3 edges) leads to\nstrong mesoscopic fluctuations of the conductance matrix. In the case of fully\nequilibrated arms, transport via the junction is insensitive to neutral-mode\nlocalization: The two-terminal conductance is quantized to 2/3 and the drag is\nabsent.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mOs_ETO4ayBapfwJZBIxQ794vqp1aRoc_MfbLGVA0iA","pdfSize":"827288"}
