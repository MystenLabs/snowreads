Despite significant advancements in simulating various components of\nthe digestive system, the rectum has been largely neglected due to societal\nstigma. This study seeks to address this gap by developing soft circular muscle\nactuators (CMAs) and rectum models to replicate the defecation process. Using\nsoft materials, both the rectum and the actuators were fabricated to enable\nseamless integration and attachment. We designed, fabricated, and tested three\ntypes of CMAs and compared them to the simulated results. A pneumatic system\nwas employed to control the actuators, and simulated stool was synthesized\nusing sodium alginate and calcium chloride. Experimental results indicated that\nthe third type of actuator exhibited superior performance in terms of area\ncontraction and pressure generation. The successful simulation of the\ndefecation process highlights the potential of these soft actuators in\nbiomedical applications, providing a foundation for further research and\ndevelopment in the field of soft robotics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
