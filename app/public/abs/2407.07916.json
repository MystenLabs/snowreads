It operates by establishing channels\nbetween users, where Bitcoin is locked and transactions are conducted off-chain\nuntil the channels are closed, with only the initial and final transactions\nrecorded on the blockchain. Routing transactions through intermediary nodes is\ncrucial for users without direct channels, allowing these routing nodes to\ncollect fees for their services. Nodes announce their channels to the network,\nforming a graph with channels as edges. In this paper, we analyze the graph\nstructure of the Lightning Network and investigate the statistical\nrelationships between node properties using machine learning, particularly\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs). We formulate a series of tasks to explore these\nrelationships and provide benchmarks for GNN architectures, demonstrating how\ntopological and neighbor information enhances performance. Our evaluation of\nseveral models reveals the effectiveness of GNNs in these tasks and highlights\nthe insights gained from their application.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
