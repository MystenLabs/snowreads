Two transits\nwere observed on September 28th and September 29th 2022, referred to as Visits\n1 and 2 respectively. Using a combined transit and systematics model for each\nvisit, the best-fit broadband NUV light curves are R$_{\\text{p}}$/R$_{\\star}$\n$=$ 0.136$_{0.0146}^{0.0125}$ for Visit 1 and R$_{\\text{p}}$/R$_{\\star}$ $=$\n0.111$_{0.0190}^{0.0162}$ for Visit 2, appearing an average of 1.54$\\times$\nlarger in the NUV than at optical wavelengths. While the systematics between\nthe two visits vary considerably, the two broadband NUV light curves are\nconsistent with each other. A transmission spectrum with 25 $\\r{A}$ bins\nsuggests a general trend of excess absorption in the NUV, consistent with\nexpectations for ultra-hot Jupiters. Although we see an extended atmosphere in\nthe NUV, the reduced data lack the sensitivity to probe individual spectral\nlines.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
