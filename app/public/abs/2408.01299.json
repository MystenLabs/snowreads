Here, we demonstrate this high standard for\ncharacterization routines with superconducting circuits, a prime platform for\nbuilding large-scale quantum computing systems. We first develop the missing\ntheory allowing for the self-testing of Pauli measurements. We then self-test\nBell pair generation and measurements at the same time, performing a complete\nself-test in a system composed of two entangled superconducting circuits\noperated at a separation of 30 meters. In an experiment based on 17 million\ntrials, we measure an average CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) S-value of\n2.236. Without relying on additional assumptions on the experimental setup, we\ncertify an average Bell state fidelity of at least 58.9% and an average\nmeasurement fidelity of at least 89.5% in a device-independent manner, both\nwith 99% confidence. This enables applications in the field of distributed\nquantum computing and communication with superconducting circuits, such as\ndelegated quantum computing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
