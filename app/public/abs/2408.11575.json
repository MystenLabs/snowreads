The paper begins by introducing the jet bundle\nemanating from the probability space of vector bundles. Subsequently, we derive\nthe contact form of this jet bundle. The central contribution of this work is\nthe derivation of the Hamilton equation for the jet space, which reveals that\nthe jet space of the probability space exhibits a contact structure. Notably,\nthis structure reduces to a symplectic manifold in the context of autonomous\nsystems. This reduction leads to a system equation that parallels the Hamilton\nequation, with the notable distinction that the Hamiltonian is substituted by\nthe derivative of the probability. Our findings suggest the potential for a new\ngeometric approach to addressing stochastic systems, offering a framework that\nmay enhance our understanding and manipulation of these systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
