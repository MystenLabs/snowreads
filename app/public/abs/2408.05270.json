At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo\na drastic change. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have\nbeen extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms,\nincluding, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus\non EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's parameters, we focus on\nEPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a\nmonitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian\neigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. We demonstrate that\nthese EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are\nrigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify\ndynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how the\nunderlying topology can be recovered from experimentally measured quantum jump\ndistributions. Additionally, we establish a duality between certain EPs in the\nLindbladian with regard to the counting field. This allows for an experimental\nobservation of the EP transitions, normally hidden by the Liouvillian dynamics\nof the system, at arbitrary times without applying postselection schemes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
