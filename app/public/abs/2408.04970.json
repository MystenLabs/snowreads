A Mott insulating state appears at\n$\\delta = -0.50$, where all Ni ions are divalent. With increasing oxygen\ncontent, superconductivity appears at $\\delta = 0.00$ and higher, above\napproximately 25 GPa, passing through Anderson localization at $\\delta =\n-0.16$. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ decreases\nwith increasing pressures for both $\\delta = 0.00$ and $+0.12$, with the\npressure dependence of $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ being much stronger in the latter than\nin the former.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
