We show that a particular case involves harmonic Lagrangian\nvector fields on $\\mathbb{H}^2$, which are related to mean surfaces in\n$\\mathbb{HP}^3$. Consequently, we prove that the infinitesimal Douady-Earle\nextension is a harmonic Lagrangian vector field that corresponds to a mean\nsurface in $\\mathbb{HP}^3$ with prescribed boundary data at infinity.\n  We establish both existence and, under certain assumptions, uniqueness\nresults for harmonic Lagrangian extension of a vector field on the circle.\nFinally, we characterize the Zygmund and little Zygmund conditions and provide\nquantitative bounds in terms of the Half-Pipe width.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
