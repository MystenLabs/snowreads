Although the\nproposed methods are applicable to various sports, we demonstrate the approach\nin the context of professional tennis. The value of the approach is that we can\nprovide estimates of the points lost, games lost, sets lost and matches lost\ndue to unforced errors. The methods are based on a bootstrapping procedure\nwhich also yields standard errors for the estimates. The approach is valuable\nin terms of player evaluation, and can also be used for training purposes where\nit is possible to assess the quantification of improvement based on fewer\nunforced errors.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
