This paper introduces the High-Resolution Cloud Detection Network\n(HR-cloud-Net), which utilizes a hierarchical high-resolution integration\napproach. HR-cloud-Net integrates a high-resolution representation module,\nlayer-wise cascaded feature fusion module, and multi-resolution pyramid pooling\nmodule to effectively capture complex cloud features. This architecture\npreserves detailed cloud texture information while facilitating feature\nexchange across different resolutions, thereby enhancing overall performance in\ncloud detection. Additionally, a novel approach is introduced wherein a student\nview, trained on noisy augmented images, is supervised by a teacher view\nprocessing normal images. This setup enables the student to learn from cleaner\nsupervisions provided by the teacher, leading to improved performance.\nExtensive evaluations on three optical satellite image cloud detection datasets\nvalidate the superior performance of HR-cloud-Net compared to existing\nmethods.The source code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/kunzhan/HR-cloud-Net}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jPRq_v3QtAPwTJMMWWPmaYxk-Hu2WMmPZ0LxtwgzTF8","pdfSize":"17033956"}
