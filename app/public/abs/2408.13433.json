The detector and distillation tower\nrequire a reliable cooling source with large cooling power at liquid xenon\ntemperature range. Pulse tube refrigerators and GM refrigerators, which were\nwidely used in previous detectors, have the disadvantages of small cooling\npower, large space occupation, and non-standby mutuality, which become\nbottlenecks of the experiment scale expansion. In this study, an auto-cascade\nrefrigerator with ethanol coolant is developed, and the heat transfer effect is\nimproved by adopting the concentric shaft heat exchanger and after-pumping heat\ntransfer scheme. The 2.5 kW stable cooling power is obtained at 155 K. Further,\nthe feasibility and key technology of the centralized cooling system of 5 kw at\n160 K is discussed. The study can simplify liquid xenon experimental auxiliary\ndevices, which will be helpful for the PandaX-xT experiment scheme and its\nlaboratory infrastructure design.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
