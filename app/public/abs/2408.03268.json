Informative\ntesting procedures for isotropy and covariate effects on the directional\nresponse are proposed. Moreover, a prediction region that achieves the smallest\nvolume in a class of ellipsoidal prediction regions of the same coverage\nprobability is constructed. The efficacy of these inference procedures is\ndemonstrated in simulation experiments. Finally, this new toolkit is used to\nanalyze directional data originating from a hydrology study and a\nbioinformatics application.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
