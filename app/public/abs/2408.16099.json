How can we construct knowledge\nabout these topics? Wikipedia is home to numerous high-quality knowledge\nartifacts about taboo topics like sexual organs and human reproduction. How did\nthese artifacts come into being? How is their existence sustained? This\nmixed-methods comparative project builds on previous work on taboo topics in\nWikipedia and draws from qualitative and quantitative approaches. We follow a\nsequential complementary design, developing a narrative articulation of the\nlife of taboo articles, comparing them to nontaboo articles, and examining some\nof their quantifiable traits. We find that taboo knowledge artifacts develop\nthrough multiple successful collaboration styles and, unsurprisingly, that\ntaboo subjects are the sites of conflict. We identify and describe six themes\nin the development of taboo knowledge artifacts. These artifacts need\n<i>resilient leadership</i> and <i>engaged organizations</i> to thrive under\nconditions of <i>limited identifiability</i> and <i>disjointed sensemaking</i>,\nwhile contributors simultaneously engage in <i>emergent governance</i> and\n<i>imagining public audiences</i>. Our observations have important implications\nfor supporting public knowledge work on controversial subjects such as taboos\nand more generally.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
