Doping materials can\nsignificantly alter their conductivity. In light of this, we have investigated\nthe electrical conductivity of $LaCoO_3$, specifically its temperature\ndependence when doped with Yttrium (Y). The crystal structure of Lanthanum\nYttrium Cobalt oxide $(La_{1-x}Y_x Co O_3)$ adopts a perovskite form,\ncharacterized by the general stoichiometry $ABX_3$, where A and B are cations,\nand X is an anion. This material undergoes a magnetic phase transition between\n$50-100$ K, a structural phase transition between $100-300$ K, and an\ninsulator-to-metal transition at $500$ K. At room temperature, $LaCoO_3$\nexhibits polaron-type hopping conduction. Our aim was to understand the\nelectrical conductivity at $300$ K and how it varies with temperature when\n$La^{3+}$ is replaced by $Y^{3+}$. The electrical properties of the perovskite\ncrystal are consistent with small polaron hopping conduction, which\ntheoretically follows Mott's variable range hopping model, where conductivity\nobeys an exponential law, and resistivity follows an inverse exponential\npattern. In this work, we compare the experimental resistivity graph with the\ntheoretical inverse of the conductivity graph, showing that our experimental\nresults align with the polaron hopping conduction model within a certain range.\nAdditionally, the experiment confirms polymorphism in various cases. We\nobserved that increasing the concentration of $Y^{3+}$ enhances the metallic\nproperties of $La_{1-x} Y_x Co O_3$, and we found a significant correlation\nbetween conductivity and symmetry. Furthermore, the study highlights the\nmaterial's phase transitions and polymorphic behavior.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2MGh7gC-N6UW6lS4kQwIXrt7GMIs3IpMDSEFbREU_1M","pdfSize":"1368143"}
