We employ a\nholography-inspired technique to derive the Bogoliubov coefficients. We\nconsider both black holes in equilibrium and black holes attached to a bath. In\nthe latter case, we compute semiclassical deviations from the thermal spectrum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
