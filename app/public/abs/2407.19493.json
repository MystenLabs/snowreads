Therefore, multimodal fake\nnews detection has recently garnered increased attention. However, the existing\ndatasets are comprised of user-uploaded videos and contain an excess amounts of\nsuperfluous data, which introduces noise into the model training process. To\naddress this issue, we construct a dataset named Official-NV, comprising\nofficially published news videos. The crawl officially published videos are\naugmented through the use of LLMs-based generation and manual verification,\nthereby expanding the dataset. Furthermore, the proposed dataset is benchmarked\nagainst several baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness in multimodal news\ndetection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
