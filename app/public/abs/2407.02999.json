In light of this, we observe the electronic\nstructure by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and unveil its\ndirect relationship with the magnetism in this compound. The Fermi surface and\nband dispersions are demonstrated to have a good agreement with the density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations carried out with careful consideration of\nthe crystal superstructure. Most importantly, we find that the\nthree-dimensional Fermi surface has extended nesting which matches well the\nq-vector of the magnetic order detected by recent scattering measurements. The\nconsistency we find among ARPES, DFT, and the scattering measurements suggests\nthe Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction involving itinerant\nelectrons to be the formation mechanism of skyrmions in Gd2PdSi3.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
