The nodes have several quantum memories, and the problem is how to\ncoordinate entanglement purification in each of the links, and entanglement\nswapping across links, so as to achieve the goal above. We show that\nentanglement swapping (i.e, deciding on the pair of qubits from each link to\nperform swapping on) is equivalent to finding a max-weight matching on a\nbipartite graph. Further, entanglement purification (i.e, deciding which pairs\nof qubits in a link will undergo purification) is equivalent to finding a\nmax-weight matching on a non-bipartite graph. We propose two polynomial\nalgorithms, the Purify-then-Swap (PtS) and the Swap-then-Purify (StP) ones,\nwhere the decisions about purification and swapping are taken with different\norder. Numerical results show that PtS performs better than StP, and also that\nthe omission of purification in StP gives substantial benefits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H_9Ri0a0vFG8315e5YBrfbYIjSuC3PjSr-tAOSjFS7w","pdfSize":"431676","objectId":"0x5c59773312093a93680d324aad5bed50253b1ed125b257e6cdeeab9cb4ef3059","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
