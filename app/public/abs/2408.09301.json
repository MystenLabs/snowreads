We study\nthe natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using\nergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following\ndiscrete problem: given a lattice $\\Lambda\\subset \\mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be\nthe image in $\\mathbb{Z}^r/\\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the\nMotzkin density of $D$ in $\\mathbb{Z}^r/\\Lambda$. We study in particular the\nperiodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density\nin $\\mathbb{Z}^r/\\Lambda$? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic\ntiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand,\nwe prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case\nrank$(\\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the\ncase rank$(\\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\\leq 3$. It follows that,\nfor up to three missing differences, the Motzkin density in a compact abelian\ngroup is always a rational number.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
