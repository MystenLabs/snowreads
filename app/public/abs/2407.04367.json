By a seminal result of Haxell, there must be some independent set of\nthe graph that is transversal to the blocks, a so-called independent\ntransversal. We show that, if moreover $t\\ge2\\Delta+1$, then every independent\ntransversal can be transformed within the space of independent transversals to\nany other through a sequence of one-vertex modifications, showing connectivity\nof the so-called reconfigurability graph of independent transversals.\n  This is sharp in that for $t=2\\Delta$ (and $\\Delta\\ge 2$) the connectivity\nconclusion can fail. In this case we show furthermore that in an essential\nsense it can only fail for the disjoint union of copies of the complete\nbipartite graph $K_{\\Delta,\\Delta}$. This constitutes a qualitative\nstrengthening of Haxell's theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
