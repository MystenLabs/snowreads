We give a simple new proof\nunder a slightly stronger assumption on the regularity of $W$ with respect to\nthe phase parameter. The simplicity of the proof allows us to easily find\nmultiple generalizations in other directions, including stochastic potentials\nand potentials which may become zero outside the wells ('voids'). The\ntheoretical results are complemented by numerical experiments.\n  Our main message is that, across a wide variety of settings, nothing that\nlooks sufficiently homogeneous at the transition length scale between phases,\naffects the limiting behavior in the slightest. The notable exception is the\nsetting of potentials with spatially varying potential wells, where a stronger\nscale separation $\\delta \\ll \\varepsilon^{3/2}$ is needed. Based on the\nanalysis, we further provide a modified Modica-Mortola type energy which does\nnot require such a scale separation.\n  The theoretical analysis is complemented by numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
