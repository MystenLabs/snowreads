A\ndistinguishing feature of our equations is the inclusion of a half-order time\nderivative term on their right-hand side. We anticipate that such equations\nwill prove useful in various problems involving time evolution terms. Notably,\nthe coefficients of the equations exhibit significant irregularity, being\nmerely measurable with respect to the temporal variable or one spatial\nvariable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
