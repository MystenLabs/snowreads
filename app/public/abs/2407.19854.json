As a consequence, Rabi hot spots and\ndephasing sweet lines are extremely sharp and call for a careful alignment of\nthe magnetic field in Ge spin qubit devices. We investigate how the $g$-factors\ncan be engineered by strains. We show that uniaxial strains can raise in-plane\n$g$-factors above unity while leaving $g_z^*$ essentially constant. We discuss\nhow the etching of an elongated mesa in a strained buffer can actually induce\nuniaxial (but inhomogeneous) strains in the heterostructure. This broadens the\noperational magnetic field range and enables spin manipulation by shuttling\nholes between neighboring dots with different $g$-factors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
