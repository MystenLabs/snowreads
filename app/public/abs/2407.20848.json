This study introduces BMach, an advanced\nBayesian optimization algorithm that refines $U_{eff}$ by incorporating\nelectronic properties, such as band gaps and eigenvalues, alongside structural\nproperties like lattice parameters. Implemented within the Quantum Espresso\nplatform, BMach demonstrates superior accuracy and reduced computational cost\ncompared to traditional methods. The BMach-optimized $U_{eff}$ values yield\nelectronic properties that align closely with experimental and high-level\ntheoretical results, providing a robust framework for high-throughput materials\ndiscovery and detailed electronic property characterization across diverse\nmaterial systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
