We observe that the unconstrained open-loop Nash equilibrium\ncoincides with the LQR in an augmented space, thus deriving an explicit\nexpression of the cost-to-go. With such cost-to-go as a terminal cost, we show\nasymptotic stability for the receding-horizon solution of the finite-horizon,\nconstrained game. Furthermore, we show that the problem is equivalent to a\nnon-symmetric variational inequality, which does not correspond to any Nash\nequilibrium problem. For unconstrained closed-loop Nash equilibria, we derive a\nreceding-horizon controller that is equivalent to the infinite-horizon one and\nensures asymptotic stability.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nxmXDBaaFfrRzsssVevzz1xxKXljHD2_anE3_DIQuNI","pdfSize":"851423"}
