The notion of\n$\\mathcal{M}$-points generalizes the concepts of integral points, Campana\npoints and Darmon points. We introduce and study $M$-approximation over number\nfields and function fields, which is a notion that generalizes weak and strong\napproximation. We show that this property implies that the set of\n$\\mathcal{M}$-points is not thin. We then give a simple characterisation of\nwhen a split toric variety satisfies $M$-approximation, generalizing work of\nNakahara and Streeter. Further, we determine when the set of\n$\\mathcal{M}$-points on a split toric variety is thin.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
