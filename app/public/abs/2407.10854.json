We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow\nmap learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move\ntoward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent\nwork on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network\nstructure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data\navailable only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In\nparticular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear\ntransformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis\nbefore being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a\ndrastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with\nprevious flow map models for nodal space learning. This primarily allows for\nsmaller training data sets, but also enables reduced training times.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
