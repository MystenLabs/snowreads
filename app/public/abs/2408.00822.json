Below this limit, cooling brown dwarfs evolve into stable dark\nmatter-powered objects that we name dark dwarfs. The timescale of this\ntransition depends on the ambient dark matter density $\\rho_{\\rm DM}$ and\ncircular velocity $v_{\\rm DM}$ but is independent of the dark matter mass. We\npredict a population of dark dwarfs close to the galactic center, where the\ndark matter density is expected to be $\\rho_{\\rm DM}\\gtrsim 10^{3}$ GeV/cm$^3$.\nAt larger galactic radii the dark matter density is too low for these objects\nto have yet formed within the age of the universe. Dark dwarfs retain their\ninitial lithium-7 in mass ranges where brown/red dwarfs would destroy it,\nproviding a method for detecting them.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
