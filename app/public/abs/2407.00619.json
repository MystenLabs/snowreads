An earthquake is the main factor\ncontributing to the concrete gravity dam's failure. In recent years, there has\nbeen a rise in efforts globally to make dams safe under dynamic loading.\nNumerical modeling of dams under earthquake loading yields substantial insights\ninto dams' fracture and damage progression. In the present work, a\nparticle-based computational framework is developed to investigate the failure\nof the Koyna dam, a concrete gravity dam in India exposed to dynamic loading.\nThe dam-foundation system is considered here. The numerically obtained crack\nresults in the concrete dam are compared with the available experimental\nresults. The findings are consistent with one another.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
