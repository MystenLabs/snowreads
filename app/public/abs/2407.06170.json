Our co-design methodology includes a novel\nevaluation technique for assessing the layer-wise neural network sensitivity to\nquantization, facilitating an optimal balance between accuracy, latency, and\nFPGA resource utilization. Utilizing the FINN library, we developed a bespoke\nFPGA dataflow accelerator that integrates on-chip weights and activation\nfunctions to minimize latency and energy consumption. Our implementation is 7.7\ntimes faster and 19.5 times more energy-efficient than the best-reported values\nin the existing spacecraft pose estimation literature. Furthermore, our\ncontribution includes the first real-time, open-source implementation of such\nalgorithms, marking a significant advancement in making efficient spacecraft\npose estimation algorithms widely accessible.
