This paper employs agent-based modeling (ABM) to explore\nthese implications, predicting the impact of generative AI on societal\nframeworks. The ABM integrates individual, business, and governmental agents to\nsimulate dynamics such as education, skills acquisition, AI adoption, and\nregulatory responses. This study enhances understanding of AI's complex\ninteractions and provides insights for policymaking. The literature review\nunderscores ABM's effectiveness in forecasting AI impacts, revealing AI\nadoption, employment, and regulation trends with potential policy implications.\nFuture research will refine the model, assess long-term implications and\nethical considerations, and deepen understanding of generative AI's societal\neffects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
