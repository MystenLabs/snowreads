AlphaPEM is a dynamic one-dimensional (1D)\nphysics-based PEM fuel cell system simulator, programmed in Python and\nexperimentally validated. It offers a good balance between accuracy and\nexecution speed. The modular architecture allows for addition of new features,\nand it has a user-friendly graphical interface. An automatic calibration method\nis proposed to match the model to the studied machine. The software provides\ninformation on the internal states of the system in response to any current\ndensity and can produce polarization and EIS curves. AlphaPEM facilitates the\nuse of a model in embedded conditions, allowing real-time modification of the\nfuel cell's operating conditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
