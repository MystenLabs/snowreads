As supply chains become increasingly complex, traditional methods of\nroot cause analysis struggle to capture the intricate interrelationships\nbetween various factors, often leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal\ndecision-making. Our approach addresses these challenges by leveraging causal\ndiscovery to identify the true causal relationships between operational\nvariables, and reinforcement learning to iteratively refine the causal graph.\nThis method enables the accurate identification of key drivers of late\ndeliveries, such as shipping mode and delivery status, and provides actionable\ninsights for optimizing supply chain performance. We apply our approach to a\nreal-world supply chain dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering\nthe underlying causes of delivery delays and offering strategies for mitigating\nthese risks. The findings have significant implications for improving\noperational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability within\nsupply chains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rB2lYQEiHIwfpn4ttJWHWXEMfYcqFKXGwPc77w8D_aQ","pdfSize":"951481"}
