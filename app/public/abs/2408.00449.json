If this is the case, then the configuration space is, generically,\na smooth complex curve, and can be seen as a Riemann surface. The property of\ninterest in this paper is the genus of this curve. Using tropical geometry, we\ngive an algorithm to compute this genus. We provide an implementation in Python\nand give various examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yHglabtFyfJ9wP4vx8ITtaJ4_F04wnzUYddP38ixy7k","pdfSize":"737118","txDigest":"9JpU5ikNNZp6HVdWC3ULAUQeeMxBQk9c4QSixoLLipPh","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
