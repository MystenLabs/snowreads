To sense the targets, the AP transmits a train of uniformly-spaced\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) pulses, and then perceives\nthe targets based on the echoes from the AP-IRS-targets-IRS-AP channel. To\nresolve an inherent scaling ambiguity associated with IRS-assisted NLOS\nsensing, we propose a two-phase sensing scheme by exploiting the diversity in\nthe illumination pattern of the IRS across two different phases. Specifically,\nthe received echo signals from the two phases are formulated as third-order\ntensors. Then a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition-based method is developed\nto estimate each target's parameters including the direction of arrival (DOA),\nDoppler shift and time delay. Our analysis reveals that the proposed method\nachieves reliable NLOS sensing using a modest quantity of pulse/subcarrier\nresources. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the\nproposed method under the challenging scenario where the degrees-of-freedom\nprovided by the AP-IRS channel are not enough for resolving the scaling\nambiguity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
