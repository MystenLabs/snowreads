Though CS-LIMs lead to a\nbreakthrough in climate sciences, their mathematical background and properties\nare worth further exploration. This study focuses on the mathematical\nperspective of CS-LIMs and introduces two variants: e-CS-LIM and l-CS-LIM. The\nformer refines the original CS-LIM using the interval-wise linear Markov\napproximation, while the latter serves as an analytic inverse model for the\nlinear periodic stochastic systems. Although relying on approximation, e-CS-LIM\nconverges to l-CS-LIM under specific conditions and shows noise-robust\nperformance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that each CS-LIM reveals the\ntemporal structure of the system. The e-CS-LIM optimizes the original model for\nbetter dynamics performance, while l-CS-LIM excels in diffusion estimation due\nto reduced approximation reliance. Moreover, CS-LIMs are applied to real-world\nENSO data, yielding a consistent result aligning with observations and current\nENSO understanding.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
