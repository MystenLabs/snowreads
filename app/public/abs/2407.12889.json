However,\nguiding a pre-trained diffusion model to generate elements from previously\nunlabeled data is significantly more challenging. One of the possible solutions\nwas given by the ADM-G guiding approach. Although ADM-G successfully generates\nelements from the given class, there is a significant quality gap compared to a\nmodel originally conditioned on this class. In particular, the FID score\nobtained by the ADM-G-guided diffusion model is nearly three times lower than\nthe class-conditioned guidance. We demonstrate that this issue is partly due to\nADM-G providing minimal guidance during the final stage of the denoising\nprocess. To address this problem, we propose GeoGuide, a guidance model based\non tracing the distance of the diffusion model's trajectory from the data\nmanifold. The main idea of GeoGuide is to produce normalized adjustments during\nthe backward denoising process. As shown in the experiments, GeoGuide surpasses\nthe probabilistic approach ADM-G with respect to both the FID scores and the\nquality of the generated images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4ghTx31ZReA4IbFckSN-YTd8Z2qu-lLeKcNV_NVLUoA","pdfSize":"26148286"}
