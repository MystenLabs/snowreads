The magnetic excitations emerge from the\nBrillouin zone boundary at the high symmetry $Y$ and $T$ points and disperse\nalong the crystallographic $\\hat{b}$-axis. In applied magnetic fields to at\nleast $\\mu_0 H=11$~T along the $\\hat{c}-$axis, the magnetism is found to be\nfield-independent in the $(hk0)$ plane. The scattering intensity is consistent\nwith that expected from U$^{3+}$/U$^{4+}$ $f$-electron spins with preferential\norientation along the crystallographic $\\hat{a}$-axis, and a fluctuating\nmagnetic moment of 2.3(7) $\\mu_B$. These characteristics indicate that the\nexcitations are due to intraband spin excitons arising from $f$-electron\nhybridization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XDCYrb_glrG14HMf83hJnNRKZwlJT32IhCqss6oJpJQ","pdfSize":"1492339"}
