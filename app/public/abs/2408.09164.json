The\nframework focuses on efficient solution strategies for the coupled system of\nfluid flow equations and thermodynamic constraints. A key contribution lies in\nproposing a new set of equations for phase equilibrium calculations which\nsimplifies the traditional vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations for\ntwo-phase CO2 mixtures. The first major novelty resides in the reduction of the\nconventional four-equation VLE system to a single equation, enabling efficient\nsolution using a non-linear solver. This significantly reduces computational\ncost compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a second novelty is\nintroduced by deriving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) directly from\nthe UV-Flash equation. This ODE can be integrated alongside the governing fluid\nflow equations, offering a computationally efficient approach for simulating\ndepressurization processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
