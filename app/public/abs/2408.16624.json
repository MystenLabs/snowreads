In this work, we present a novel way to model and\naccount for sand ripples present on the bottom of the ocean while calculating\ntrajectories for the autonomous vehicles by means of a stochastic optimal\ncontrol framework. It is known from the scientific literature that these\nripples impact the sea mine detection capabilities of the autonomous vehicles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
