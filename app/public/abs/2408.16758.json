In\nthis work, we investigate the dual problem: finding the minimum size of a\n$k$-uniform hypergraph with no singleton intersections, such that adding any\nmissing hyperedge forces a singleton intersection. These problems, known as\nsaturation and semi-saturation, are typically challenging. Our focus is on an\nelementary-to-state case in the line of work by Erd\\H{o}s, F\\\"uredi and Tuza.\nWe establish tight linear bounds for $k=4$, marking one of the first\nnon-obvious cases with such a bound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ATGpB2vCAZCyvJ3YIGRg8PNX6_Xs489-nnZgSTxyh34","pdfSize":"188987"}
