However, it is a very well-known NP-hard\nproblem to find the global minimizer to the QAP. In this work, we study the\nsemidefinite relaxation (SDR) of the QAP and investigate when the SDR recovers\nthe global minimizer. In particular, we consider the two input matrices satisfy\na simple signal-plus-noise model, and show that when the noise is sufficiently\nsmaller than the signal, then the SDR is exact, i.e., it recovers the global\nminimizer to the QAP. It is worth noting that this sufficient condition is\npurely algebraic and does not depend on any statistical assumption of the input\ndata. We apply our bound to several statistical models such as correlated\nGaussian Wigner model. Despite the sub-optimality in theory under those models,\nempirical studies show the remarkable performance of the SDR. Our work could be\nthe first step towards a deeper understanding of the SDR exactness for the QAP.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
