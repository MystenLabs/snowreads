We first study $\\mathrm{D^0X}$ transitions in an isotopically purified\nsilicon-28 bulk doped sample under controlled uniaxial stress, confirming the\nvalidity of existing models in the low strain ($\\lesssim 10^{-5}$) regime. We\nthen demonstrate the localised photoconductive detection of a few thousand\ndonors illuminated by a 1078 nm resonant laser with $4~\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ spot\nfocused on a microfabricated device consisting of an implanted phosphorus layer\nbetween a pair of metallic contacts. We observe local variations in the\nstrained exciton peak splitting from $10~\\mathrm{\\mu eV}$ to $200~\\mathrm{\\mu\neV}$, and obtain scanning microscopy stress maps in good agreement with\nfinite-element-model thermal stress simulations. Our results suggest a\npotential use of donor bound excitons for in-situ stress sensing, and\ndemonstrate pathways for the miniaturisation of $\\mathrm{D^0X}$ photoconductive\ndetection.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
