A vertex\n$u$ is called b-vertex in $(G,c)$ if all colors except $c(u)$ appear in the\nneighborhood of $u$. By a ${\\rm b}^{\\ast}$-coloring of $G$ using colors $\\{1,\n\\ldots, k\\}$ we define a proper vertex coloring $c$ such that there is a\nb-vertex $u$ (called nice vertex) such that for each $j\\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$\nwith $j\\not=c(u)$, $u$ is adjacent to a b-vertex of color $j$. The ${\\rm\nb}^{\\ast}$-chromatic number of $G$ (denoted by ${\\rm b}^{\\ast}(G)$) is the\nlargest integer $k$ such that $G$ has a ${\\rm b}^{\\ast}$-coloring using $k$\ncolors. Every graph $G$ admits a ${\\rm b}^{\\ast}$-coloring which is an\nimprovement over the famous b-coloring. A z-coloring of $G$ is a coloring $c$\nusing colors $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$ containing a nice vertex of color $k$ such\nthat for each two colors $i<j$, each vertex of color $j$ has a neighbor of\ncolor $i$ in the graph (i.e. $c$ is obtained from a greedy coloring of $G$). We\nprove that ${\\rm b}^{\\ast}(G)$ cannot be approximated within any constant\nfactor unless $P=NP$. We obtain results for ${\\rm b}^{\\ast}$-coloring and\nz-coloring of block graphs, cacti, $P_4$-sparse graphs and graphs with girth\ngreater than $4$. We prove that z-coloring and ${\\rm b}^{\\ast}$-coloring have a\nlocality property. A linear 0-1 programming model is also presented for\nz-coloring of graphs. The positive results suggest that researches can be\nfocused on ${\\rm b}^{\\ast}$-coloring (or z-coloring) instead of b-coloring of\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kWr-lDm6ft1kyw3Wqh-bGWozj7DF4OUi5tUY_a1asV8","pdfSize":"202515"}
