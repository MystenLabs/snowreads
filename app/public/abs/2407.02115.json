We have studied the giant nebula associated with the Teacup\n(z=0.085) quasar based on VLT MUSE integral field spectroscopy to investigate\nwhether the well known giant (~10 kpc) active galactic nucleus (AGN) induced\noutflow has an impact on the distribution of heavy elements in and outside the\nhost galaxy. For this, we have mapped the O/H and N/O abundances in two spatial\ndimensions across the giant nebula and within the galaxy by means of comparing\nemission line ratios with photoionisation model predictions. We have found that\nthe widely studied AGN driven outflow responsible for the 10 kpc ionised bubble\nis enhancing the gas metal abundance up to 10 kpc from the AGN. O/H is solar or\nslightly higher in the bubble edges, in comparison with the subsolar abundances\nacross the rest of the nebula (median O/H~0.63 O/H_sun)). The main conclusion\nis that AGN feedback can produce metal enrichment at large extranuclear\ndistances in galaxies (>~10 kpc).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
