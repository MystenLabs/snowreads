To identify its presence\nin a generic state, one can, for example, check for existence of a\ndecomposition of separable states. A natural extension is a genuine\nmultipartite entanglement (GME), understood as nonexistenence of a\ndecomposition into biseparable states (later called biseparable decomposition,\nBD). In this contribution we revisit activation of GME. We discuss few examples\nof states, which are decomposable into a mixture of biproduct states. However,\nafter merging two copies of these states, we certify nonexistence of BD with\nwitness operators. This seems to challenge our understanding of GME as a\nseparate resource. It turns out that it requires a careful consideration of the\nphysical context. We stress that activation of GME from multiple copies of\nGME-free states necessarily involves entangling operations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p0SqQzLe6VbXrESoMdAYXkApnvYxxnGhr8uG_lNFC4o","pdfSize":"415549","objectId":"0xf86ea3313a7f857a8a8c546573c0e863a1e788c39baba00c91fb31d8172cfd55","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
