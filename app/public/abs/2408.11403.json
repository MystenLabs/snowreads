We then apply the surgery machine to obtain the\ncorresponding results for manifolds. Thereafter, we focus on the case when $X$\nis a smooth homology sphere and deduce results about the homotopy type of the\nspace of block embeddings of $X$ in a sphere.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
