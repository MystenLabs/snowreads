We\nshow that the associated slow manifold is represented coordinate-free as the\nimage of a section over the nonholonomic distribution. We propose a novel\ninvariance condition based on covariant derivatives and prove that this\ncondition is equivalent to the classical invariance condition based on time\nderivatives. Accordingly, we propose a novel recursive procedure to approximate\nthe slow manifold based on the covariant derivatives of a formal power series\nexpansion of the section. Using this recurrence relation, we derive, up to\nsecond order, approximations of the slip velocities residing in the slow\nmanifold, as well as the associated approximated dynamics up to first order.\nLastly, we illustrate our approach with a case study of a vertical rolling\ndisk.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0Tg8r_yQkLgQhGyWwlTLGl4XtEJXyayqwf8RH5DPpTs","pdfSize":"396948","txDigest":"HKAspGoeMYbXBdyVcWNvTfejRFWN3msahvA1rrKykotL","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
