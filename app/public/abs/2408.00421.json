However, existing methods lack personalisation and\nrely on manually crafted ML algorithms or pipelines, which can introduce\ninefficiencies and biases into the process. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel evolutionary-based automated ML method (AutoML) specifically\ndesigned for predicting small molecule properties, with a particular focus on\npharmacokinetics. Leveraging the advantages of grammar-based genetic\nprogramming, our AutoML method streamlines the process by automatically\nselecting algorithms and designing predictive pipelines tailored to the\nparticular characteristics of input molecular data. Results demonstrate\nAutoML's effectiveness in selecting diverse ML algorithms, resulting in\ncomparable or even improved predictive performances compared to conventional\napproaches. By offering personalised ML-driven pipelines, our method promises\nto enhance small molecule research in drug discovery, providing researchers\nwith a valuable tool for accelerating the development of novel therapeutic\ndrugs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
