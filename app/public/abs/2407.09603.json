The leading effect arises from the change in the ALP decay constant\nacross the interface, which naturally follows from shift-symmetric interactions\nwith the corresponding order parameter. Specifically, we show that for thin\nwalls moving relativistically, an ALP background -- such as e.g. axion dark\nmatter -- gives rise to a frictional force on the interface that is\nproportional to $\\gamma^2$, with $\\gamma$ the Lorentz factor of the wall, and\nthat this effect is present in both the oscillating and frozen axion regimes.\nWe explore the broader consequences of this effect for bubble and domain walls\nin the early universe, and show that this source of friction can be present\neven in the absent of a conventional medium such as radiation or matter.\nPossible implications include modifications to the dynamics of bubble and\ndomain walls and their corresponding gravitational wave signatures, as well as\nthe generation of a dark radiation component of ALPs in the form of\nultra-relativistic `axion shells' with Lorentz factor $\\gamma_\\text{shell}\n\\simeq 2\\gamma^2 \\gg 1$ that may remain relativistic until the present day.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
