If true, the conjecture would be a strengthening\nof the hard direction of the classical Cheeger's inequality. Morris and Peres\nproved Houdr\\'e and Tetali's conjecture up to an additional log factor, using\ntechniques from evolving sets. We present the following related results on this\nconjecture.\n  - We provide a family of counterexamples to the conjecture of Houdr\\'e and\nTetali, showing that the logarithmic factor is needed.\n  - We match Morris and Peres's bound using standard spectral arguments.\n  - We prove that Houdr\\'e and Tetali's conjecture is true for any constant $p$\nstrictly bigger than $\\frac12$, which is also a strengthening of the hard\ndirection of Cheeger's inequality.\n  Furthermore, our results can be extended to directed graphs using Chung's\ndefinition of eigenvalues for directed graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
