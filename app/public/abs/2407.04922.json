In\nmaterials science, microstructure image segmentation plays a pivotal role in\nunderstanding alloy properties. However, conventional supervised modelling\nalgorithms often necessitate extensive annotations and intricate optimization\nprocedures. The segmentation anything model (SAM) introduces a fresh\nperspective. By combining SAM with domain knowledge, we propose a novel\ngeneralized algorithm for alloy image segmentation. This algorithm can process\nbatches of images across diverse alloy systems without requiring training or\nannotations. Furthermore, it achieves segmentation accuracy comparable to that\nof supervised models and robustly handles complex phase distributions in\nvarious alloy images, regardless of data volume.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
