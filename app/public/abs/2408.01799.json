We experimentally\nobserve a $g^{(2)}(0) > 0.5 \\to 1$ for the coupled emitter system and a drastic\ndecrease in the singlet and triplet lifetimes by a factor of $\\approx 6$,\nindicating an interaction between the two emitters, which indicates\nsuperradiant behaviour. We theoretically study the dissipative dynamics of the\ninteraction of the emitter system with the excitation light at a finite\ntemperature for three cases (single emitter, two emitters with and without\ndipole-dipole coupling) by solving the Lindblad master equation and providing\nan analytical expression for the second-order correlation function. We observe\nthat from the master equation, the populations and coherences mix for the two\nemitters' cases. Through this, we support our experimental results and discuss\nsuperradiance from our system. Finally, we discover a reliable quantum random\nnumber generation rate of $\\sim 200$ kHz from the coupled emitter system, at\nlow pump powers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
