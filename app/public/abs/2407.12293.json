Use of a single network to solve coupled PDEs on large\ndomains requires a large number of network parameters and incurs a significant\ncomputational cost. We introduce coupled EDNN (C-EDNN) to solve systems of PDEs\nby using independent networks for each state variable, which are only coupled\nthrough the governing equations. We also introduce distributed EDNN (D-EDNN) by\nspatially partitioning the global domain into several elements and assigning\nindividual EDNNs to each element to solve the local evolution of the PDE. The\nnetworks then exchange the solution and fluxes at their interfaces, similar to\nflux-reconstruction methods, and ensure that the PDE dynamics are accurately\npreserved between neighboring elements. Together C-EDNN and D-EDNN form the\ngeneral class of Multi-EDNN methods. We demonstrate these methods with aid of\ncanonical problems including linear advection, the heat equation, and the\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations in Couette and Taylor-Green flows.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
