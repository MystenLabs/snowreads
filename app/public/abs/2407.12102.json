We compute the equation of state of the unpolarized system as a\nfunction of the scattering length with particular attention paid to the unitary\nlimit, where the effect of the effective range of the interaction is explored.\nWe have also computed the pair distribution function and the momentum\ndistribution over a range of interaction strengths to provide information about\nthe structure of the system. Finally, we have computed the heavy/light\nquasiparticle spectrum. Our theoretical predictions, based on Quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations, can be tested by future experiments with ultracold\nfermionic gases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
