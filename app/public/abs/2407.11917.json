Optimisation of\nthese simulators is especially challenging for stochastic simulators and higher\ndimensions. To address these issues, we utilise a deep generative surrogate\napproach to model the black box response for the entire parameter space. We\nthen leverage this knowledge to estimate the proposed uncertainty based on the\nWasserstein distance - the Wasserstein uncertainty. This approach is employed\nin a posterior agnostic gradient-free optimisation algorithm that minimises\nregret over the entire parameter space. A series of tests were conducted to\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust to the shape of both the black box\nfunction and the stochastic response of the black box than state-of-the-art\nmethods, such as efficient global optimisation with a deep Gaussian process\nsurrogate.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
