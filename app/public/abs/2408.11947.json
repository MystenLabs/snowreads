The absorbed electromagnetic power\nincreases the skin temperature. Wherever it is above a temperature threshold,\nthermal nociceptors are activated and transduce an electrical signal. When the\nactivated skin volume reaches a threshold, the flight signal is initiated.\nAfter the delay of human reaction time, the flight action is materialized when\nthe subject moves away or the beam power is turned off. The injury risk is\nquantified by the thermal damage parameter calculated in the Arrhenius\nequation. It depends on the beam power density absorbed into the skin, which is\nnot measurable. In addition, the volume threshold for flight initiation is\nunknown. To circumference these difficulties, we normalize the formulation and\nwrite the thermal damage parameter in terms of the occurrence time of flight\naction, which is reliably observed in exposure tests. This thermal injury\nformulation provides a viable framework for investigating the effects of model\nparameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
