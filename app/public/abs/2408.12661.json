{"id":"2408.12661","title":"Non-Borda elections under relaxed IIA conditions","authors":"Gabriel Gendler","authorsParsed":[["Gendler","Gabriel",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2024 18:08:42 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-26","timestamp":1724350122000,"abstract":"  Arrow's celebrated Impossibility Theorem asserts that an election rule, or\nSocial Welfare Function (SWF), between three or more candidates meeting a set\nof strict criteria cannot exist. Maskin suggests that Arrow's conditions for\nSWFs are too strict. In particular he weakens the \"Independence of Irrelevant\nAlternatives\" condition (IIA), which states that if in two elections, each\nvoter's binary preference between candidates $c_i$ and $c_j$ is the same, then\nthe two results must agree on their preference between $c_i$ and $c_j$.\nInstead, he proposes a modified IIA condition (MIIA). Under this condition, the\nresult between $c_i$ and $c_j$ can be affected not just by the order of $c_i$\nand $c_j$ in each voter's ranking, but also the number of candidates between\nthem. More candidates between $c_i$ and $c_j$ communicates some information\nabout the strength of a voter's preference between the two candidates, and\nMaskin argues that it should be admissible evidence in deciding on a final\nranking.\n  We construct SWFs for three-party elections which meet the MIIA criterion\nalong with other sensibility criteria, but are far from being Borda elections\n(where each voter assigns a score to each candidate linearly according to their\nranking). On the other hand, we give cases in which any SWF must be the Borda\nrule.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
