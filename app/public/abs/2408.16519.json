So far, research on this phenomenon has been limited to\nfundamental physics and electronic applications, leaving its potential for\nelectromechanical actuation unexplored. In this work, we design an atomic-scale\nactuator based on sliding ferroelectricity and field-tunable interfacial\nfriction. With a prototype based on parallelly stacked bilayer h-BN sandwiched\nbetween gold contacts, we show how an alternating electric field can drive the\nbilayer into controlled crawling motions and how uniaxial strain can steer the\ncrawl direction. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the actuator's\nrobust operation under a wide range of drive signals, friction scales, and\nfrictional variations. We further provide experimental directions on how to\nrealize field-tunable friction on h-BN interfaces. The wireless-ready actuation\nmechanism can be generalized to many 2D material systems possessing sliding\nferroelectricity and integrated into flexible electronics platforms, opening\nnew avenues in the development of intelligent nanorobotics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nz0IFDpiyEb5DwIgJvX82TMgmZB40jmvigw0qd34z4U","pdfSize":"12527309"}
