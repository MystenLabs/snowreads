In a given\nsubdomain, it is required to minimize the density of tumor cells, while the\ndrug concentration in tissue is limited by given minimal and maximal values.\nBased on derived estimates of the solution of the controlled system, the\nsolvability of the control problem is proved. The problem is reduced to an\noptimal control problem with a penalty. An algorithm for solving the optimal\ncontrol problem with a penalty is constructed and implemented. The efficiency\nof the algorithm is illustrated by a numerical example.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R8B3kbgMMTl6OBLgO-xUXTwLKtuhQ4qNd0xbalY0EJ8","pdfSize":"169739","objectId":"0xee54f7f593f657a09f93558d70124e3f8568dab57f9c9205f63e7622dcc2e4c2","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
