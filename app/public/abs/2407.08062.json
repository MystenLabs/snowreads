Two events (a band or a bump) are defined in terms\nof given non-negative integers $0\\le l\\le u \\le s$, not necessarily with\n$l+u=s$. We derive expressions for the joint stopping time distribution and\noutcome band or bump in terms of rectangular event probabilities for central\nmultiple hyper-geometric random variables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
