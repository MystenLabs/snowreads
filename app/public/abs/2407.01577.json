Strategies\nbased on reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities\nin addressing algorithmic trading problems. However, the trading patterns\ndiffer among market conditions due to shifted distribution data. Ignoring\nmultiple patterns in the data will undermine the performance of RL. In this\npaper, we propose MOT,which designs multiple actors with disentangled\nrepresentation learning to model the different patterns of the market.\nFurthermore, we incorporate the Optimal Transport (OT) algorithm to allocate\nsamples to the appropriate actor by introducing a regularization loss term.\nAdditionally, we propose Pretrain Module to facilitate imitation learning by\naligning the outputs of actors with expert strategy and better balance the\nexploration and exploitation of RL. Experimental results on real futures market\ndata demonstrate that MOT exhibits excellent profit capabilities while\nbalancing risks. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the components\nof MOT.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
