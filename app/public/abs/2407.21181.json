The goal of the estimator is to\nreconstruct an estimate of the real-time signal value from causally received\nsamples. Our study focuses on the optimal online strategy for both sampling and\ntransmission, aiming to minimize the mean square estimation error. We establish\nthat the optimal strategy involves threshold policies for both sampling and\ntransmission, and we derive the optimal thresholds. We utilize Lagrange\nrelaxation and backward induction as our methodology, revealing the problem of\nminimizing estimation error, under the assumption that sampling and\ntransmission times are independent of the observed Wiener process. Our\ncomparative analysis demonstrates that the estimation error achieved by the\noptimal joint sampling and transmission policy is significantly lower than that\nof age-optimal sampling, zero-wait sampling, periodic sampling, and policies\nthat optimize only the sampling times.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
