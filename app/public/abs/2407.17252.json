These measurements are based on\nthe $w_0w_a$CDM model of dark energy. The evidence is less in other dark energy\nmodels such as the $w$CDM model. To avoid imposing a dark energy model, we\nreconstruct the distance measures and the equation of the state of dark energy\nindependent of any dark energy model and driven only by observational data. To\nthis end, we use both single-task and multi-task Gaussian Process regression.\nOur results show that the model-agnostic evidence for dynamical dark energy is\nmuch less than the evidence from DESI with the $w_0w_a$CDM model. Our analysis\nalso provides model-independent constraints on cosmological parameters such as\nthe Hubble constant and the matter-energy density parameter at present. We find\nthat the reconstructed values of these parameters are not consistent with the\nresults reported in DESI with the $w_0w_a$CDM model. However, they are almost\nconsistent with DESI for the $w$CDM model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
