In this paper, we analytically establish\nan exact bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) for the spectral winding topology\nby adopting mixed boundary conditions (MBCs). By presenting analytical\nsolutions of a class of one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with\nnearest-neighbor hoppings identical for different components, we demonstrate\nthat the emergence of skin modes further requires the absolute value of\nspectral winding number exceeding a threshold determined by the MBCs. In\ncontrast to most topological phases, this exact BBC of spectral winding\ntopology is not only robust against disorder, but also favored by it, as\ndisorder can restore the correspondence in certain cases where it is originally\nviolated. Finally, we extend our analysis to a more general model by relaxing\nthe restriction on hopping parameters, verifying the universality of the exact\nBBC under MBCs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
