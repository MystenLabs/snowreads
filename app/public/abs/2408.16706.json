The\nstate-of-the-art methods, Arvada and Treevada, employ heuristic approaches to\ngeneralize grammar rules, initiating from flat parse trees and exploring\ndiverse generalization sequences. We have observed that these approaches suffer\nfrom low quality and readability, primarily because they process entire example\nstrings, adding to the complexity and substantially slowing down computations.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method that segments example\nstrings into smaller units and incrementally infers the grammar. Our approach,\nnamed Kedavra, has demonstrated superior grammar quality (enhanced precision\nand recall), faster runtime, and improved readability through empirical\ncomparison.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MLmTQyoUcrzRNrg9Okb3hbQas0ifTUVGfHv1RJWVYfQ","pdfSize":"980172"}
