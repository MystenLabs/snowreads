The optimal hedging strategy is obtained through a deep\npolicy gradient-type reinforcement learning algorithm, with a novel hybrid\nneural network architecture improving the training performance. The favorable\ninclusion of forward-looking information embedded in the volatility surface\nallows our procedure to outperform several conventional benchmarks such as\npractitioner and smiled-implied delta hedging procedures, both in simulation\nand backtesting experiments.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
