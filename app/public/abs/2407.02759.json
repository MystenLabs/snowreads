We address this by treating\nscenarios like search, recommendation, and advertising as a cooperative,\npartially observable multi-agent decision problem. We introduce the Multi-Agent\nRecurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (MARDPG) algorithm, which aligns\ndifferent scenarios under a shared objective and allows for strategy\ncommunication to boost overall performance. Our results show marked\nimprovements in metrics such as click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, and\ntotal sales, confirming our method's efficacy in practical settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
