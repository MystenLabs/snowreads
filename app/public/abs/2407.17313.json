The hydrodynamic\nexpansion which occurs in later stages then gives rise to correlations among\noutgoing particles which depend weakly on their relative rapidity. Azimuthal\ncorrelations, through which anisotropic flow ($v_n(p_T)$) is defined, have been\nthe most studied. Here we study a new observable introduced in 2020 by Schenke,\nShen and Teaney and dubbed $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change in\nthe $p_T$ spectrum induced by a fluctuation. We describe how it can be\nmeasured. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we make quantitative predictions for\n$v_0(p_T)$ of charged and identified hadrons. We then discuss how $v_0(p_T)$\nrelates to two phenomena which have been measured: The increase of the mean\ntransverse momentum in ultracentral collisions, and the event-by-event\nfluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[ p_T]$. We show that\n$v_0(p_T)$ determines the dependence of these quantities on the $p_T$ cuts\nimplemented in the analysis. We quantitatively explain the rise of\n$\\sigma_{p_T}$ observed by ATLAS as the upper $p_T$-cut is increased from $2$\nto $5$~GeV/$c$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
