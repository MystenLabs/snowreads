For this purpose, a 4-machine 11-bus IEEE benchmark model is modified by\nconsidering GFCs replacing synchronous generators that led to unstable\nsubsynchronous oscillations (SSOs). We aim to: (a) understand if transmission\nnetwork dynamics should be considered in such cases, (b) revisit the\nspace-phasor-calculus (SPC) in d-q frame under balanced condition that captures\nsuch phenomena and lends itself to eigenvalue analysis, and (c) emphasize\nlimitations of such models while underscoring their importance for large-scale\npower system simulations. Time-domain and frequency-domain results from SPC and\nquasistationary phasor calculus (QPC) models are compared with electromagnetic\ntransient (EMT)-based simulations. It is shown that models with transmission\nline dynamics in SPC framework can capture the SSO mode while QPC models that\nneglect these dynamics fail to do so.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JkIu2vfjxiPN2FkpyPq6zziqJuiGxJn1mFp-lU2l7qg","pdfSize":"2336147","objectId":"0x41a8d5bf7a336698cd8b4acccd70d2c5f8565424431e776d46a8daa672557868","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
