Hence the adjoint of a\nheptagon is a plane quartic. We prove that a general plane quartic is the\nadjoint of exactly 864 distinct complex heptagons. This number had been\nnumerically computed by Kohn et al. We use intersection theory and the Scorza\ncorrespondence for quartics to show that 864 is an upper bound, complemented by\na lower bound obtained through explicit analysis of the famous Klein quartic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5E3jAGHmULqHuSMSr5GrKhDp6V6cCv6cAhJkkpIUs6A","pdfSize":"698985"}
