In this general setting we\nderive speeds of propagation in both radial and angular directions for gravity\nwaves and compare them with the speed of light in the case of minimally coupled\nphoton. In particular, we find that the class of beyond Horndeski theories,\nwhich satisfy the equality of gravity waves' speed to the speed of light over a\ncosmological background, feature gravity waves propagating at luminal speeds\nabove a time-dependent inhomogeneous background as well.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
