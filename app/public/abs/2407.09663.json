The solutions obtained\nhere have the important property that the associated closed time-like curves\nare always restricted to a compact domain of space-time. We compare this\nproperty with those of analogous solutions in General Relativity (GR).\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
