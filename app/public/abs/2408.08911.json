The inverse problem is notably\nchallenging due to factors such as nonlinear coupling, the necessity for\nmulti-parameter reconstruction, constraints on probability measures, and the\nlimited availability of measurement information. To address these challenges,\nwe propose an innovative approach grounded in a higher-order linearization\nmethod. This method is tailored for inverse problems in MFG systems that\ninvolve Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Initially, we present unique\nreconstruction results for the cost function and internal topological structure\nof the MFG system under various homogeneous boundary conditions. Subsequently,\nwe extend these results to accommodate inhomogeneous boundary conditions. These\nfindings greatly enhance our understanding of simultaneous reconstruction in\ncomplex MFG systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
