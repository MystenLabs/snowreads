The approximation error\nis measured by the norm of the weighted Lebesgue space $L_{q,w}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$.\nThe weight $w$ is a tensor-product Freud weight. For $1\\le p,q \\le \\infty$ and\n$d=1$, we prove that the polynomial approximation by de la Vall\\'ee Poussin\nsums of the orthonormal polynomial expansion of functions with respect to the\nweight $w^2$, is asymptotically optimal in terms of relevant linear $n$-widths\n$\\lambda_n\\big(\\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\\mathbb{R}, L_{q,w}(\\mathbb{R})\\big)$ and\nKolmogorov $n$-widths $d_n\\big(\\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\\mathbb{R}),\nL_{q,w}(\\mathbb{R})\\big)$ for $1\\le q \\le p <\\infty$. For $1\\le p,q \\le \\infty$\nand $d\\ge 2$, we construct linear methods of hyperbolic cross polynomial\napproximation based on tensor product of successive differences of\ndyadic-scaled de la Vall\\'ee Poussin sums, which are counterparts of hyperbolic\ncross trigonometric linear polynomial approximation, and give some upper bounds\nof the error of these approximations for various pair $p,q$ with $1 \\le p, q\n\\le \\infty$. For some particular weights $w$ and $d \\ge 2$, we prove the right\nconvergence rate of $\\lambda_n\\big(\\boldsymbol{W}^r_{2,w}(\\mathbb{R}^d),\nL_{2,w}(\\mathbb{R}^d)\\big)$ and $d_n\\big(\\boldsymbol{W}^r_{2,w}(\\mathbb{R}^d),\nL_{2,w}(\\mathbb{R}^d)\\big)$ which is performed by a constructive hyperbolic\ncross polynomial approximation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
