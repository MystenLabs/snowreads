Our theory explains why the\nlargest observed electron-phonon couplings $\\lambda\\le 4$ as well as the\nmechanism of metastable superconductivity with higher $T_c$. We conclude based\non our theory and analysis of experimental data that room-temperature\nsuperconductivity is feasible but only in hydrogen compounds.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
