We introduce MentalAgora, a novel framework\nemploying large language models enhanced by interaction between multiple agents\nfor tailored mental health support. This framework operates through three\nstages: strategic debating, tailored counselor creation, and response\ngeneration, enabling the dynamic customization of responses based on individual\nuser preferences and therapeutic needs. We conduct experiments utilizing a\nhigh-quality evaluation dataset TherapyTalk crafted with mental health\nprofessionals, shwoing that MentalAgora generates expert-aligned and user\npreference-enhanced responses. Our evaluations, including experiments and user\nstudies, demonstrate that MentalAgora aligns with professional standards and\neffectively meets user preferences, setting a new benchmark for digital mental\nhealth interventions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ior8q2pjwX0CF1GZA4G7cAN7PL8AEelmu9x6NV7L-D4","pdfSize":"1446024"}
