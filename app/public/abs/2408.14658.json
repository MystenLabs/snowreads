Also, due to their increasing size,\nhandling large KGs in their entirety entails scalability issues. These two\naspects asks for efficient methods to extract subgraphs of interest from\nexisting KGs. To this aim, we introduce KGPrune, a Web Application that, given\nseed entities of interest and properties to traverse, extracts their\nneighboring subgraphs from Wikidata. To avoid topical drift, KGPrune relies on\na frugal pruning algorithm based on analogical reasoning to only keep relevant\nneighbors while pruning irrelevant ones. The interest of KGPrune is illustrated\nby two concrete applications, namely, bootstrapping an enterprise KG and\nextracting knowledge related to looted artworks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
