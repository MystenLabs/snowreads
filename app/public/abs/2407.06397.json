Recent efforts tackle the problem via the extraction of\nphysically-based parameters that can then be rendered under arbitrary lighting,\nbut they are limited in the range of scenes they can handle, usually\nmishandling glossy scenes. We propose RRM, a method that can extract the\nmaterials, geometry, and environment lighting of a scene even in the presence\nof highly reflective objects. Our method consists of a physically-aware\nradiance field representation that informs physically-based parameters, and an\nexpressive environment light structure based on a Laplacian Pyramid. We\ndemonstrate that our contributions outperform the state-of-the-art on parameter\nretrieval tasks, leading to high-fidelity relighting and novel view synthesis\non surfacic scenes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
