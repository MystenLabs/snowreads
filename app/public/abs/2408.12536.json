We first revisit a\nwell-known gradientplay dynamics from a passivity-based perspective, and\naddress that the strict monotonicity on pseudo-gradients is a critical\nassumption to ensure the exact convergence of the dynamics. Then we propose two\nnovel passivity-based gradient-play dynamics by introducing parallel\nfeedforward compensators (PFCs) and output feedback compensators (OFCs). We\nshow that the proposed dynamics can reach exact GNEs in merely monotone regimes\nif the PFCs are strictly passive or the OFCs are output strictly passive.\nFollowing that, resorting to passivity, we develop a unifying framework to\ngeneralize the gradient-play dynamics, and moreover, design a class of explicit\npassive-based dynamics with convergence guarantees. In addition, we explore the\nrelation between the proposed dynamics and some existing methods, and extend\nour results to partial-decision information settings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
