In this article we expand the\noctupole operator $\\mathcal{O}^3_\\mu$ in the $SU(3)$ second quantization\nformalism and use it to formulate an octupole-octupole residual interaction\n$\\mathcal{O}^3\\cdot \\mathcal{O}^3$ which is incorporated in Elliott's model\nHamiltonian. We compute the matrix elements of this extended Hamiltonian and\nuse them to calculate energy levels and analyse the $B(E3; 3^-_1\\rightarrow\n0^+_1)$ transition strength of the isotope $^{224}$Th using the\nsemi-microscopic algebraic quartet model (SAQM) based on the proxy-$SU(3)$\nscheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oMxPcHQh3GEawrJ7dJZusTVvsHgjEVygq0rx69phrMw","pdfSize":"4314305"}
