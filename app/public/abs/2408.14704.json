Their qualities have\npiqued interest at longer wavelengths where their small size compares favorably\nto impedance-matched antennas. Here, we compare the signal detection\nsensitivity of cm-scale Rydberg sensors to similarly sized room-temperature\nelectrically small antennas with active and passive receiver backends. We\npresent and analyze effective circuit models for each sensor type, facilitating\na fair sensitivity comparison for cm-scale sensors. We calculate that\ncontemporary Rydberg sensor implementations are less sensitive than unmatched\nantennas with active amplification. However, we find that idealized Rydberg\nsensors operating with a maximized atom number and at the standard quantum\nlimit may perform well beyond the capabilities of antenna-based sensors at room\ntemperature, the sensitivities of both lying below typical atmospheric\nbackground noise.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"pltOwmivdWUwm5L3dR3BXczPLtavozoRkDj8NKxMKRk","pdfSize":"855492"}
