We\nshow that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for metric spaces\nwith bounded geometry that admit an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure. As an\napplication, the relative expanders constructed by Arzhantseva and Tessera, as\nwell as the box space derived from an extension of Haagerup groups by amenable\ngroups, are shown to exhibit the A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure.\nConsequently, their maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjectures are affirmed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
