The degenerate metric is set to be\ncompatible with the contact structure. The compatibility condition is defined\nin this paper. Our construction yields a Ricci tensor of a particularly simple\nform, which leads to a solution of the Einstein equation with a null dust and\ncosmic strings. The solution includes two arbitrary functions: the energy\ndensity of the null dust and the number density of the cosmic strings. When\nthere exist the cosmic strings, the spacetime is of Petrov type D. Otherwise,\nthe spacetime is conformally flat. For some simple matter densities, we examine\nthe Einstein equation in detail.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
