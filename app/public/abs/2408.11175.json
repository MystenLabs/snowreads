In this paper we present\nthe results of a study of the horizontal distribution of chromium in the\natmosphere of Ap star HD 152564 reconstructed with the Doppler Imaging\ntechnique. We reveal that the region of increased chromium abundance forms a\nring perpendicular to the rotational equator. The passage of these regions\nacross the visible hemisphere of the star should contributes to the observed\nlight variability. Comparison with the previously obtained results shows that\nthe character of the horizontal distribution of chromium in the atmosphere of\nHD 152564 is different from distribution of other investigated elements, which\nin turn also possess a significant diversity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
