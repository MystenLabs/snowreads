Such ability, largely based on non-verbal\ncommunication, is also a key to having natural and pleasant interactions with\nartificial agents, like robots. In this work, we discuss a preliminary\nexperiment on the use of head pose as a visual cue to understand and anticipate\naction goals, particularly reaching and transporting movements. By reasoning on\nthe spatio-temporal connections between the head, hands and objects in the\nscene, we will show that short-range anticipation is possible, laying the\nfoundations for future applications to human-robot interaction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
