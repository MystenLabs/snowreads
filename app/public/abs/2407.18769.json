By assuming piecewise constant inputs, we formulate the\ndiscrete system matrices of the discounted LQ-OCPs into systems of differential\nequations. Subsequently, we derive the discrete-time equivalent of the\ndiscounted LQ-OCP by solving these systems. This paper presents three numerical\nmethods for solving the proposed differential equations systems: the\nfixed-time-step ordinary differential equation (ODE) method, the step-doubling\nmethod, and the matrix exponential method. Our numerical experiment\ndemonstrates that all three methods accurately solve the differential equation\nsystems. Interestingly, the step-doubling method emerges as the fastest among\nthem while maintaining the same level of accuracy as the fixed-time-step ODE\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fD3Nu-2p4gYkZZXzg3D7HBMcfCFh1SHZbAAdRodw6Ak","pdfSize":"237529"}
