They describe the time evolution of the frequency of an\nallele in a well-mixed population with fixed size. We propose a simple and\ntractable model which bridges the Wright-Fisher and the Moran descriptions. We\nassume that a fixed fraction of the population is updated at each discrete time\nstep. In this model, we determine the fixation probability of a mutant in the\ndiffusion approximation, as well as the effective population size. We\ngeneralize our model, first by taking into account fluctuating updated\nfractions or individual lifetimes, and then by incorporating selection on the\nlifetime as well as on the reproductive fitness.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wu1ovBB6QcV1Tayk9kX892mO_-1pCovmK8KBF0-KPbQ","pdfSize":"537518"}
