With\nthe PDE represented as a computational graph, we facilitate the seamless\nintegration of symbolic and numeric information inherent in a PDE. A graph\nTransformer and an implicit neural representation (INR) are employed\nsubsequently to generate mesh-free predicted solutions. We generated a dataset\nwith up to three million samples involving diverse one-dimensional PDEs to\npretrain our model. Compared with baseline models trained specifically on\nbenchmark datasets, our pretrained model achieves comparable accuracy via\nzero-shot inference, and the advantage expands after finetuning. For PDEs new\nor unseen in the pretraining stage, our model can adapt quickly by finetuning\non a relatively small set of examples from the target equation. Additionally,\nPDEformer-1 demonstrates promising results in the inverse problem of PDE scalar\ncoefficient recovery and coefficient field recovery.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
