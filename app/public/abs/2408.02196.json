It is known that\ntiling $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with translated copies with a set of $8$ tiles is\nundecidable. Greenfeld and Tao gave strong evidence in a series of works that\nfor sufficiently large dimension $n$, the translational tiling problem for\n$\\mathbb{Z}^n$ might be undecidable for just one tile. This paper shows the\nundecidability of translational tiling of $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ with a set of $6$\ntiles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
