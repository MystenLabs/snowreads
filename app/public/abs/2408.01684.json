The study of\nSIMs and high frequency propagation make the study of the performance in the\nnear field of crucial importance. Hence, in this work, we focus on SIM-assisted\nmultiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in the near\nfield region. To this end, we formulate the weighted sum rate maximisation\nproblem in terms of the transmit power and the phase shifts of the SIM. By\napplying a block coordinate descent (BCD)-relied algorithm, numerical results\nshow the enhanced performance of the SIM in the near field with respect to the\nfar field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mwPOjNwGqAgY7JqYrYEhUpFx3N3uXxUvoo4AgIJXp50","pdfSize":"1353462","txDigest":"2GWY7TGWSS2cb7imQsvwBFQuJnYeBAZsuCH2fraRQfzY","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
