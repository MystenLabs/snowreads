However, it neglects query-document similarity and lacks semantic\nunderstanding, limiting its performance. We revisit BM25 and introduce BMX, a\nnovel extension of BM25 incorporating entropy-weighted similarity and semantic\nenhancement techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BMX consistently\noutperforms traditional BM25 and surpasses PLM/LLM-based dense retrieval in\nlong-context and real-world retrieval benchmarks. This study bridges the gap\nbetween classical lexical search and modern semantic approaches, offering a\npromising direction for future information retrieval research. The reference\nimplementation of BMX can be found in Baguetter, which was created in the\ncontext of this work.
