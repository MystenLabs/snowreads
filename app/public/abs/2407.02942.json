There have been some significant researches in this direction, in the\nlast decade. However, almost all existing techniques fail to detect this form\nof forgery, when the first compression factor is greater than the second. We\naddress this problem in re compression based forgery detection, here Recently,\nMachine Learning techniques have started gaining a lot of importance in the\ndomain of digital image forensics. In this work, we propose a Convolution\nNeural Network based deep learning architecture, which is capable of detecting\nthe presence of re compression based forgery in JPEG images. The proposed\narchitecture works equally efficiently, even in cases where the first\ncompression ratio is greater than the second. In this work, we also aim to\nlocalize the regions of image manipulation based on re compression features,\nusing the trained neural network. Our experimental results prove that the\nproposed method outperforms the state of the art, with respect to forgery\ndetection and localization accuracy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
