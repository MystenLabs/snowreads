But, any theory must be consistent with their evolution equations\nhaving the mathematical form of advection-diffusion equations.\nAdvection-diffusion equations have a remarkable feature. When the diffusion is\nextremely weak but non-zero, its magnitude makes only a small difference even\nwhen varied over sixteen orders of magnitude. This is true when the advective\nvelocity is chaotic -- the exponential separation of neighboring streamlines --\nas natural flows generally are. Even highly turbulent flows have in addition to\neddies large-scale coherent flows, such as the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic,\nwhich dominates their transport effects on longest scales. Basic physics and\neasily understood mathematics place important constraints, which are explained.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
