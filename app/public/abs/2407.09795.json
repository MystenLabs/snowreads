Findings from subway and mobile phone data indicate a significant\ndecrease in the floating population during extreme heat wave, underscoring the\nthermal vulnerability of urban areas. However, urban regions with higher\ncomplexity demonstrate resilience, attracting more visitors despite high\ntemperatures. Our results suggest the centrality of economic complexity in\nurban resilience against climate-induced stressors. Additionally, it implies\nthat high-complexity small businesses' clusters can serve as focal points for\nsustaining urban vitality in the face of thermal shocks within city. In the\nlong run perspective, our results imply the possibility that people are more\nconcentrated in high complexity region in the era of global warming.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p9YesGMZPd-NieXNvW7l5lUWj80AlY4GMU7Ow9cXXSU","pdfSize":"27857775","objectId":"0x32fac8a519f53ef3e45a5005f9f3073b36b2b5087b0dc198f10e58aad2ce9b0a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
