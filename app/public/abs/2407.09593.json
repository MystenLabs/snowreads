We systematically analyze the renormalization group evolution (RGE)\nof tree-generated operators in the SILH+TQ scenario, finding large mixings of\nflavor non-universal operators into those affecting electroweak precision\nobservables. We show that these model-independent RG contributions are more\nimportant than typical estimates for finite parts. Flavor non-universal effects\nare completely captured by examining three options for the top mixing: fully\ncomposite $q_L^3$, equal compositeness, and fully composite $t_R$. In the most\nphenomenologically viable case of a fully composite $t_R$, we show that the\nstrongest bound on the natural parameter space comes from next-to-leading log\nrunning of the 4-top operator $O_{tt} = (\\bar t_R \\gamma_\\mu t_R)(\\bar t_R\n\\gamma^\\mu t_R)$ into the Peskin-Takeuchi $T$ parameter. In general, we find\nthat this 2-loop effect allows existing electroweak precision data to give a\nbetter constraint on 4-top operators compared to high-energy probes from top\nproduction at the LHC. Independent of the top mixing, we find that a future\ntera-$Z$ machine such as FCC-ee has the potential to probe composite Higgs\nmodels up to a scale of $m_* \\gtrsim 25$ TeV, and test the naturalness of the\nelectroweak scale at the $\\lesssim 10^{-4}$ level.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
