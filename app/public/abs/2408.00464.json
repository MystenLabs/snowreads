Such logic qubits have a biased\nnoise channel that the bit-flip error dominates over all the other errors. In\nthis manuscript, we propose an optimally robust protocol using the control\nmethod of shortcuts to adiabaticity to realize a nearly perfect population\ninversion in a cat-state qubit. We construct a shortcut based on the\nLewis-Riesenfeld invariant and examine the stability versus different types of\nperturbations for the fast and robust population inversion. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate that the population inversion can be mostly insensitive\nto systematic errors in our protocol. Even when the parameter imperfection rate\nfor bit-flip control is $20\\%$, the final population of the target state can\nstill reach $\\geq 99\\%$. The optimally robust control provides a feasible\nmethod for fault-tolerant and scalable quantum computation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
