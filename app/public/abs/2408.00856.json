To estimate\nthis penalty parameter, previous work uses simple models such as linear or\ntree-based models. This study introduces a novel deep learning method for\npredicting penalty parameters, leading to demonstrably improved changepoint\ndetection accuracy on large benchmark supervised labeled datasets compared to\nprevious methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
