The\nperformance is demonstrated on the canonical heavy Fermion metal YbRh2Si2.\nThermometry is provided by a fast current sensing noise thermometer. This\nsingle thermometer enables us to cover a wide temperature range of interest\nfrom 175 $\\mu$K to 90 mK with temperature independent relative precision.\nTemperatures are tied to the international temperature scale with a single\npoint calibration. A superconducting solenoid surrounding the cell provides the\nsample field for tuning its properties and operates a superconducting heat\nswitch. Both adiabatic and relaxation calorimetry techniques, as well as\nmagnetic field sweeps, are employed. The design of the calorimeter results in\nan addendum heat capacity which is negligible for the study reported. The keys\nto sample and thermometer thermalisation are the lack of dissipation in the\ntemperature measurement and the steps taken to reduce the parasitic heat leak\ninto the cell to the tens of fW level.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
