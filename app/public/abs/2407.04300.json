The starting point is the two-dimensional\nEnskog-Boltzmann-Lorentz kinetic equation with appropriated boundary\nconditions. It is integrated over the transversal coordinate to get an\napproximated one-dimensional kinetic equation, keeping the relevant properties\nof the original one. Then, a macroscopic equation for the time evolution of the\nlongitudinal density is derived, by means of a modified Chapman-Enskog\nexpansion method, that takes into account the inhomogeneity of the equilibrium\nlongitudinal density. This transport equation has the form of the\nphenomenological Ficks-Jacobs equation, but with an effective diffusion\ncoefficient that contains corrections associated to the variation of the slope\nof the equilibrium longitudinal density profile.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
