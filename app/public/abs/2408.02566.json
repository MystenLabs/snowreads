Here we propose to use instead\nfractional excitations inherent to quantum spin liquids (QSLs) as an\nalternative, which are sensitive to external fields and can induce a very\ndistinctive magnetocaloric effect. With state-of-the-art tensor-network\napproach, we compute low-temperature properties of Kitaev honeycomb model. For\nthe ferromagnetic case, strong demagnetization cooling effect is observed due\nto the nearly free $Z_2$ vortices via spin fractionalization, described by a\nparamagnetic equation of state with a renormalized Curie constant. For the\nantiferromagnetic Kitaev case, we uncover an intermediate-field gapless QSL\nphase with very large spin entropy, possibly due to the emergence of spinon\nFermi surface. Potential realization of topological excitation cooling in\nKitaev materials is also discussed, which may offer a promising pathway to\ncircumvent existing limitations in the paramagnetic hydrates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iRwYqMbYG7YMKhYls4gZJyLOWhJZRH8p2QW--3RA2Yw","pdfSize":"11927391"}
