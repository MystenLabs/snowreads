Due to its use in forensic\ninvestigations and use by forensic experts in court, it is important that error\nrates for this technology are reliable for a wide range of evidence image\ntypes. In particular, images with off-nominal exposures are not uncommon. This\npaper presents a preliminary investigation of the impact that images with\ndifferent exposure types - too dark or too light - have on error rates for PRNU\nsource camera identification. We construct a new dataset comprised of 8400\ncarefully collected images ranging from under-exposed (too dark) to nominally\nexposed to over-exposed (too bright). We first establish baseline error rates\nusing only nominally exposed images, resulting in a true-positive rate of 100%\nand a true-negative rate of 99.92%. When off-nominal images are tested, we find\nstriking results: the true-negative rate for under-exposed images is 99.46% (a\nfalse-positive rate of roughly one in two hundred, typically unacceptable in a\nforensic context), and for over-exposed images the true-positive rate falls to\n82.90%. Our results highlight the importance of continued study of error rates\nfor the PRNU source camera identification to assure adherence to the high\nstandards set for admissibility of forensic evidence in court.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
