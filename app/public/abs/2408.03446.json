However, drivers are often reluctant to share\ntheir data due to privacy concerns. The Federated Vehicular Network (FVN) is a\npromising technology that tackles these concerns by transmitting model\nparameters instead of raw data, thereby protecting the privacy of drivers.\nNevertheless, the performance of Federated Learning (FL) in a vehicular network\ndepends on the joining ratio, which is restricted by the limited available\nwireless resources. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to apply\nNon-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) to improve the joining ratio in a FVN.\nSpecifically, a vehicle selection and transmission power control algorithm is\ndeveloped to exploit the power domain differences in the received signal to\nensure the maximum number of vehicles capable of joining the FVN. Our\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed NOMA-based strategy increases\nthe joining ratio and significantly enhances the performance of the FVN.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
