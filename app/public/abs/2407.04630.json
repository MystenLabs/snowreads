So far,\nexperiments have implemented a two-site chain with limited protection. We\npropose a protocol for scaling up the Kitaev chain that is accessible to\ncurrent experiments and optimizes the Majorana protection. To this end, we make\nuse of the fact that the relative sign of normal and superconducting hoppings\nmediated by an Andreev bound state can be changed by electrostatic gates. In\nthis way, our method only relies on the use of individual electrostatic gates\non hybrid regions, quantum dots, and tunnel barriers, respectively, without the\nneed for individual magnetic flux control, greatly simplifying the device\ndesign. Our work provides guidance for realizing a topologically protected\nKitaev chain, which is the building block of error-resilient topological\nquantum computation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
