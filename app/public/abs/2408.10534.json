We find an exact answer to this when $n$ is\nprime and $p \\neq n$, and also when $n = 4$ and $p \\neq 2$. Our answers are\nrational functions in $p$. This relates to previous work done to find exact\nproportions of $p$-adic polynomials of degree $n$ which have $k$ roots.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
