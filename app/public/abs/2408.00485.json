The wind is inevitable in\nLLAGNs, mainly interpreted indirect way, also the evidences are growing for the\npresence of wind in outer thin disk. We present a hydrodynamics HD model for\nwind from outer thin disk where the main driver is the inner disk irradiation\n(which is parameterized by a number $x$ in hydrostatic equilibrium equation\nwith a slightly unbalancing role). The model works for a low intense\nirradiation or from a height $z_s$ in optically thin medium. We solve the model\nequations in cylindrical coordinate along the $z$-axis for a given radius $r$\nwith assuming a tiny vertical speed $v_z$ ($\\ll c_s$ sound speed). The sonic\npoint conditions assure an isobaric regime above the sonic height ($z^{max}$),\nin addition from the height $z_f (\\ll z^{max}$) the radial pressure gradient\nalso supports the fluid rotation, and both conjointly assure a wind ejection\nfrom the $z^{max}$ with fluid speed. The $z^{max}$ increases with $x$, and\nbeyond a large $z^{max}$ (say $z^{max}_t$ corresponded to maximum $x$) there is\nno physical solution. We start the computation from outer radius $r_o^{thin}$\nto inner $r_{in}^{thin}$ with Bondi mass accretion rate $\\dot{M}_{Bondi}$, to\nexplore the $r$ dependency of mass inflow rate $\\dot{M}$ and wind properties.\nWe constrain the model by fixing $\\dot{M}$ at $r_{in}^{thin}$ from the\nobservations of NGC 1097, and check the feasibility of model by comparing the\nenergetics with observed bolometric luminosity. The wind is an equatorial with\nviewing angle $i>85$degree, and capable to generate red-/blue-shifted lines, it\nwould be a general characteristics for LLAGNs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
