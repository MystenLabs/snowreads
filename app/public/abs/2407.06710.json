This fish-bone model captures the\nflexural displacements of the bridge deck's mid-line, and each chordal\nfilament's rotation angle from the centerline. These two dynamics are strongly\ncoupled through the effect of cable-hanger, appearing through a sublinear\nfunction. Additionally, a structural nonlinearity of Woinowsky-Krieger type is\nincluded, allowing for large displacements. Well-posedness of weak solutions is\nshown and long-time dynamics are studied. In particular, to force the dynamics,\nwe invoke a non-conservative potential flow approximation which, although\ngreatly simplified from the full multi-physics fluid-structure interaction,\nprovides a driver for non-trivial end behaviors. We describe the conditions\nunder which the dynamics are uniformly stable, as well as demonstrate the\nexistence of a compact global attractor under all nonlinear and\nnon-conservative effects. To do so, we invoke the theory of quasi-stability,\nfirst explicitly constructing an absorbing ball via stability estimates and,\nsubsequently, demonstrating a stabilizability estimate on trajectory\ndifferences applied to the aforesaid absorbing ball. Finally, numerical\nsimulations are performed to examine the possible end behaviors of the\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
