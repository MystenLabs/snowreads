In this\npaper, we introduce a new technique based on group theory tools through\nmulti-agent constraint optimization techniques, designed for the dynamic\nlandscapes of satellite operations. Inspired by group actions, our method\nmodels the planning problem for observing Earth targets as a cooperative game\nto achieve computational efficiency while simultaneously reducing computational\ncomplexity. Designed for the complex task of planning constellation of\nsatellites, our methodology provides a feasible solution to the inherent\nchallenges of multi-agent optimization under state constraints and subject to\nuncertainties. Our approach can offer avenues for improving mission efficiency\nand reducing costs. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the good\nperformance of the approach in the presence of inter-satellite links.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
