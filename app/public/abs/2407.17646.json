It is studied when the operator is\nwell defined, bounded and compact. To this aim, we study when it can be\nrepresented as an integral operator. We observe important differences with the\nbehaviour of the Ces\\`aro-type operator acting on these spaces, getting that\nboundedness and compactness are equivalent concepts for some standard weights.\nFor the space of bounded holomorphic functions on the disc and for the Wiener\nalgebra, we get also this equivalence, which is characterized in turn by the\nsummability of the moments of the measure $\\mu.$ In the latter case, it is also\nequivalent to nuclearity. Nuclearity of the generalized Hilbert operator acting\non related spaces, such as the classical Hardy space, is also analyzed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
