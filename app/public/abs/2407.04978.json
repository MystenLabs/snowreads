This phase transition results in an abrupt change of\nthe pressure from negative to positive values, effectively eliminating\npolyelectrolyte mediated bridging attraction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
