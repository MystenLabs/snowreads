While this method has worked very well for many types of\ntasks, it isn't the only type of intelligence that exists in nature. In this\nwork, we study the ways in which intelligent behavior can be created without a\nseparate and explicit brain for robot control, but rather solely as a result of\nthe computation occurring within the physical body of a robot. Specifically, we\nshow that adaptive and complex behavior can be created in voxel-based virtual\nsoft robots by using simple reactive materials that actively change the shape\nof the robot, and thus its behavior, under different environmental cues. We\ndemonstrate a proof of concept for the idea of closed-loop morphological\ncomputation, and show that in our implementation, it enables behavior mimicking\nlogic gates, enabling us to demonstrate how such behaviors may be combined to\nbuild up more complex collective behaviors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"__-C8nHcVCjSEXsCM9tI8hHB9-K_tVZMnZssBkZGFlo","pdfSize":"2093986"}
