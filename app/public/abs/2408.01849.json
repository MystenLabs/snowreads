A BCFL is a context-free language (CFL)\ncorresponding to an incomplete string with holes, which can be completed by\nvalid terminals. To solve this problem, we introduce an algebraic datatype that\ncompactly represents candidate parse forests for porous strings. Once\nconstructed, sampling trees is a straightforward matter of sampling integers\nuniformly without replacement, then lazily decoding them into trees.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
