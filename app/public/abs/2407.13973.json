To this end, we\npropose an artificial noise (AN)-aided rate-splitting (RS)-based secure\nbeamforming scheme. Our design considers the dual use of common messages and\nplaces the research emphasis on hiding the private messages for secure\ncommunication. In particular, leveraging AN-aided RS-based beamforming, we aim\nto maximize the focused secrecy sum-rate (F-SSR) by jointly designing transmit\ninformation and AN beamforming while satisfying the desired received\nconstraints for the private messages at IoT devices (IoDs), and per-antenna\ntransmit power constraint at base station. Then, we proposed a two-stage\nalgorithm to iteratively find the optimal solution. By transforming non-convex\nterms into linear terms, we first reformulate the original problem as a convex\nprogram. Next, we recast the optimization problem to an unconstrained problem\nto obtain the global optimal solutions. Utilizing the duality framework, we\nfurther develop an efficient algorithm based on a barrier interior point method\nto solve the reformulated problem. Simulation results validate the superior\nperformance of our proposed schemes.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"NYzGktFhM4-y7u3ZBwVeRxRWphZXVOCajyZ-0bJhZjM","pdfSize":"449695"}
