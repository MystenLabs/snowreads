The finite-temperature topological invariants for the HOTIs\ncan be constructed by generalizing the Resta's polarization for the ground\nstate to the ensemble geometric phase (EGP) for the mixed states, [C.-E.\nBardyn, L.

The EGP is consistent with\nthe Resta's polarization both at zero temperature and at finite temperatures in\nthe thermodynamic limit. {We find that the temperature can change the critical\npoint and thus induces a phase transition from a topologically-trivial phase to\na nontrivial phase in a finite-size system, manifesting changes in the winding\nof the EGP.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ppiol5xWo9nK86WhVjyy1uGHizZt_I1rYgwFOIWBr70","pdfSize":"3692647"}
