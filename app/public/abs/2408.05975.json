Initially focused on\nUML and the Model-Driven Architecture approach, the literature has been\nevolving towards the usage of more general concepts such as Model-Driven\nDevelopment or Model-Driven Engineering. With the emergence of Low-Code\nsoftware development platforms, the modeling community has been studying how\nthese two fields may combine and benefit from each other, thus leading to the\npublication of a number of works in recent years. In this paper, we present a\nmetascience study of Low-Code. Our study has a two-fold approach: (1) to\nexamine the composition (size and diversity) of the emerging Low-Code\ncommunity; and (2) to investigate how this community differs from the\n\"classical\" model-driven community in terms of people, venues, and types of\npublications. Through this study, we aim to benefit the low-code community by\nhelping them better understand its relationship with the broader modeling\ncommunity. Ultimately, we hope to trigger a discussion about the current and\npossible future evolution of the low-code community as part of its\nconsolidation as a new research field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qcaZil-sQEgwBB4MT7IeC-JvLVu-EQls1wjbdKKNvLk","pdfSize":"577152"}
