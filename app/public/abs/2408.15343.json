The\nGoldberger-Wise field, with appropriate bulk and brane potentials, is utilized\nto fix the brane positions. However, not all configurations with fixed brane\npositions are stable. Stability against small scalar perturbations of the\nmetric and the Goldberger-Wise field is analyzed in detail. This stability is\nclosely related to the spectrum of radions: namely, the existence of any\ntachyonic radion indicates instability, while models with positive squared\nmasses for all radions are stable. The necessary and sufficient conditions for\neach of these possibilities are derived and constitute the main result of this\npaper. Additionally, some properties of radions, particularly their relation to\ndistances between and along branes, are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
