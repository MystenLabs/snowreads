Photovoltaic (PV) panel faults caused by weather,\nground leakage, circuit issues, temperature, environment, age, and other damage\ncan take many forms but often symptomatically exhibit temperature differences.\nIncluded is a mini survey to review these common faults and PV array fault\ndetection approaches. Among these, infrared thermography cameras are a powerful\ntool for improving solar panel inspection in the field. These can be combined\nwith other technologies, including image processing and machine learning. This\nposition paper examines several computer vision algorithms that automate\nthermal anomaly detection in infrared imagery. We demonstrate our infrared\nthermography data collection approach, the PV thermal imagery benchmark\ndataset, and the measured performance of image processing transformations,\nincluding the Hough Transform for PV segmentation. The results of this\nimplementation are presented with a discussion of future work.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
