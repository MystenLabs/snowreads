Typically such results are compared with\nthe trivial upper bound $O(X^{n^2-1})$, where $X$ is the cardinality of\n$\\mathcal X$. Here we show that even for arbitrary sets $\\mathcal X\\subseteq\n\\mathbb R$,some recent results from additive combinatorics enable us to obtain\na stronger bound with a power saving.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
