The mean-field dynamics is\nreduced to a self-consistent stochastic single-oscillator problem which we\nanalyze perturbatively and by numerical simulations. We elucidate the influence\nof the asymmetry on the correlation and response function of the system as well\nas on the distribution of the order parameter. The so-called volcano transition\nis shown to be robust with respect to a small degree of coupling asymmetry but\nto disappear when the antisymmetry in the couplings outweighs the symmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
