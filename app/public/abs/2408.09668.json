A recent highlight along this research\nline consists of the derivation of the nonuniversal Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) EOS\nfor an ultracold quantum bosonic gas with finite-range interatomic interactions\nusing one-loop effective path-integral field theory. The purpose of this work\nis to extend Salasnich's pioneering work to uncover beyond-LHY corrections to\nthe EOS by employing the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) effective field\ntheory, leveraging its two-loop approximation. In this end, we expand\nSalasnich's remarkable findings of EOS to the next leading order characterized\nby $\\left(\\rho a_{\\text{s}}^{3}\\right)^{2}$, with $\\rho$ and $a_{\\text{s}}$\nbeing the density and the $s$-wave scattering length. Notably, we derive\nanalytical expressions for quantum depletion and chemical potential,\nrepresenting the next-to-LHY corrections to nonuniversal EOS induced by\nfinite-range effects. Moreover, we propose an experimental protocol of\nobserving the nonuniversal next-to-LHY corrections to the EOS by calculating\nfractional frequency shifts in the breathing modes. The nonuniversal beyond-LHY\nEOS in this work paves the way of using LHY effects in quantum simulation\nexperiments and for investigations beyond the LHY regime.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"7tmUuSG-R8iPUKXd1ZfE7Z8lQ337JxMZxpvCyKg7Has","pdfSize":"971966"}
