We assume that the\nimpact of a big social/environmental event spills into neighboring regions.\nUsing Identifying Code Sets (ICSes), we can deploy sensors in such a way that\nthe region in which an event takes place can be uniquely identified, even with\nfewer sensors than regions. As Earth is almost a sphere, we use a soccer ball\nas a model. We construct a Soccer Ball Graph (SBG), and provide human-oriented,\nanalytical proofs that 1) the SBG has at least 26 ICSes of cardinality ten,\nimplying that there are at least 26 different ways to deploy ten satellites to\nmonitor the Earth and 2) that the cardinality of the minimum Identifying Code\nSet (MICS) for the SBG is at least nine. We then provide a machine-oriented\nformal proof that the cardinality of the MICS for the SBG is in fact ten,\nmeaning that one must deploy at least ten satellites to monitor the Earth in\nthe SBG model. We also provide machine-oriented proof that there are exactly 26\nICSes of cardinality ten for the SBG.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
