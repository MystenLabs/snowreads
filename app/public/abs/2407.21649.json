Harada proposed a theory relating gravity to the Cotton tensor,\ndubbed as ''Cotton gravity'' (CG). This is an extension of General Relativity\nsuch that every solution of the latter turns out to be a solution of the former\n(but the converse is not true) and, furthermore, it is possible to derive the\ncosmological constant as an integration constant within it. In this work we\ninvestigate CG by coupling it to both non-linear electrodynamics (NLED) and\nscalar fields. We study static and spherically symmetric solutions implementing\na bouncing behaviour in the radial function so as to avoid the development of\nsingularities, inspired by the Simpson-Visser black bounce and the Bardeen\nmodel, both interpreted as magnetic monopoles. We identify the NLED Lagrangian\ndensity and the scalar field potential generating such solutions, and\ninvestigate the corresponding gravitational configurations in terms of\nhorizons, behaviour of the metric functions, and regularity of the Kretchsman\ncurvature scalar. Our analysis extends the class of non-singular geometries\nfound in the literature and paves the ground for further analysis of black\nholes in CG.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
