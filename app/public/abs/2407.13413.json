We show that\n$\\{m(c)\\}_{c>0}$ is combinatorially computable from $F$ and the resolution\ngraph $\\Gamma$ of $\\phi$, and we provide several formulae. We also extend\nBudur's result (valid for $(X,o)=(\\mathbb{C}^2,0)$), which makes an\nidentification of $\\sum_{c\\in[0,1]}m(c)t^c$ with a certain Hodge spectrum. In\nour general case we use Hodge spectrum with coefficients in a mixed Hodge\nmodule. We show that $\\{m(c)\\}_{c\\leq 0}$ usually depends on the analytic type\nof $(X,o)$. However, for some distinguished analytic types we determine it\nconcretely. E.g., when $(X,o)$ is weighted homogeneous (and $F$ is associated\nwith the central vertex), we recover $\\sum_cm(c)t^c$ from the Poincar\\'e series\nof $(X,o)$ and when $(X,o)$ is a splice quotient then we recover\n$\\sum_cm(c)t^c$ from the multivariable topological Poincar\\'e (zeta) function\nof $\\Gamma$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SdqG3ETnuneyrWEFS7HVlu_kYnlmQHBAfZBLFXBg47g","pdfSize":"278452"}
