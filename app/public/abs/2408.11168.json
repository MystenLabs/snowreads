Over the past few\nyears, we have demonstrated that the X-ray source can generate nearly 100%\npolarized X-rays at various energies from 183 eV (Boron K$\\alpha$) to 705 eV\n(Fe L$\\alpha$) using a laterally graded multilayer coated mirror (LGML)\noriented at 45\\deg\\ to the source. The position angle of the polarization can\nbe rotated through a range of roughly 150\\deg. In a downstream chamber, we can\norient a Princeton Instruments MTE1300B CCD camera to observe the polarized\nlight either directly or after reflection at 45\\deg\\ by a second LGML. In\nsupport of the REDSoX Polarimeter project, we have tested four other detectors\nby directly comparing them to the PI camera. Two were CCD cameras: a Raptor\nEagle XV and a CCID94 produced by MIT Lincoln Laboratories, and two had sCMOS\nsensors: the Sydor Wraith with a GSENSE 400BSI sensor and a custom Sony IMX290\nsensor. We will show results comparing quantum efficiencies and event images in\nthe soft X-ray band.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
