We prove that this iterative method retains\nNewton's quadratic convergence but has less restrictive sufficient conditions\nfor convergence than Newton and also is unconditionally stable under a small\ndata condition. In this sense, Picard-Newton can be considered as a Newton\niteration that is nonlinearly preconditioned with Picard. Our numerical tests\nillustrate this quadratic convergence and stability on benchmark problems.\nFurthermore, the tests show convergence for significantly higher Rayleigh\nnumber than both Picard and Newton, which illustrates the larger convergence\nbasin of Picard-Newton that the theory predicts. We also introduce Anderson\nacceleration into the Picard step in our Picard-Newton numerical tests, and\nthis enables convergence for even higher Rayleigh number.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TM8wAKCubBRuMDBnSLZ-zdB9bRlvGOiQ0Xvacm_BMp0","pdfSize":"1848254"}
