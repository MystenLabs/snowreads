This work addresses the problem of\nreassigning passengers to specific time slots for crossing security, aiming to\nmitigate these inefficiencies. We frame this problem as a Minimum Cost Network\nFlow (MCNF) problem, enabling us to solve it exactly in polynomial time due to\nits linear programming structure. Our approach redistributes passenger demand\nacross different time intervals. By optimizing the reassignment of passengers\nto sigma-minute time slots, we achieve significant improvements in throughput\nand reductions in waiting time. Preliminary results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in enhancing operational efficiency and passenger\nsatisfaction. The MCNF formulation offers a scalable and adaptable solution,\nproviding long-term benefits for airport security management.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-9YLt5eYsb64IFhYWrA7xfRB9NiIgwY_-7RcprDWemI","pdfSize":"1149129","objectId":"0x8019695ab3e35387c297b7fae172630e0467a0ad54328773b5760164bc12e231","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
