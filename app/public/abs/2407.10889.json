Herein, we analyze\nthe electronic structure of two members of this family, Mg$_2$IrH$_6$ and\nCa$_2$IrH$_6$, showing why the former may possess superconducting properties\nrivaling those of the cuprates, whereas the latter does not. Within\nMg$_2$IrH$_6$ the vibrations of the IrH$_6^{4-}$ anions are key for the\nsuperconducting mechanism, and they induce coupling in the $e_g^*$ set, which\nare antibonding between the H 1$s$ and the Ir $d_{x^2-y^2}$ or $d_{z^2}$\norbitals. Because calcium possesses low-lying d-orbitals, $e_g^* \\rightarrow$\nCa $d$ back-donation is preferred, quenching the superconductivity. Our\nanalysis explains why high critical temperatures were only predicted for second\nor third row X metal atoms, and may hold implications for superconductivity in\nother systems where the antibonding anionic states are filled.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
