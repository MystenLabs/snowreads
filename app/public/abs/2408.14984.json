However, they always suffer from the\nnon-preservation of steady-state solution and original energy dissipation law.\nTo overcome these disadvantages, some new integrating factor methods are\ndeveloped by using two classes of difference correction, including the\ntelescopic correction and nonlinear-term translation correction, enforcing the\npreservation of steady-state solution. Then the original energy dissipation\nproperties of the new methods are examined by using the associated differential\nforms and the differentiation matrices. As applications, some new integrating\nfactor Runge-Kutta methods up to third-order maintaining the original energy\ndissipation law are constructed by applying the difference correction\nstrategies to some popular explicit integrating factor methods in the\nliterature. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to support our theory\nand to demonstrate the improved performance of new methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ehl0pGdIPdtakhtoew0MUTE3IkBXORKituXa3R8d9XU","pdfSize":"2143102"}
