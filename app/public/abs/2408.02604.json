By incorporating a Carreau shear-thinning viscosity\nmodel into the N-S problem, we devise an algorithm that learns the most likely\nCarreau parameters of a shear-thinning fluid, and estimates their\nuncertainties, from velocimetry data alone. We then conduct a flow-MRI\nexperiment to obtain velocimetry data of an axisymmetric laminar jet through an\nidealised medical device (FDA nozzle) for a blood analogue fluid. We show that\nthe algorithm can successfully reconstruct the flow field by learning the most\nlikely Carreau parameters, and that the learned parameters are in very good\nagreement with rheometry measurements. The algorithm accepts any algebraic\neffective viscosity model, as long as the model is differentiable, and it can\nbe extended to more complicated non-Newtonian fluids (e.g. Oldroyd-B fluid) if\na viscoelastic model is incorporated into the N-S problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ocwrF73oXw7tTvPZoWNq4HK4RLHmimrvwL1KKNvF7g4","pdfSize":"2620193","txDigest":"B5NysRPyDPLHGcMw4XuKjAThCucmye64PQBJQA9Xrd3R","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
