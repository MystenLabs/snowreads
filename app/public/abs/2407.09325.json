We\nemploy an effective Hamiltonian within the framework of the Standard Model\nEffective Field Theory (SMEFT) to consider generalized dimension-6 semileptonic\n$c\\to s$ operators of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector and tensor\ntypes. We rely on Lattice QCD (LQCD) for the hadronic transition form factors,\nusing heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) to determine those that have not yet\nbeen obtained on the lattice. Uncertainties due to the truncation of the NP\nHamiltonian and different implementations of HQSS are taken into account. As a\nresult, we unravel the NP discovery potential of the $\\Lambda_c\\to \\Lambda$\nsemileptonic decay in different observables. Our findings indicate high\nsensitivity to NP in lepton flavour universality ratios, probing multi-TeV\nscales in some cases. On the theoretical side, we identify LQCD uncertainties\nin axial and vector form factors as critical for improving NP sensitivity,\nalongside better SMEFT uncertainty estimations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
