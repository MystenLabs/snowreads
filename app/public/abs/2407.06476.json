Focusing on fluids for which the most relevant non-Newtonian\naspect of the thin-gap flow is shear-thinning, we introduce a history-dependent\naspect into the algorithm, modeling shear-rate-dependent fluid viscosity. The\nmain finding is that the morphology of the emerging patterns, characterized by\nthe fractal dimension, is modified in a nontrivial manner by the shear-thinning\nnature of the displaced fluid. In particular, we consistently find that\nshear-thinning leads to the formation of patterns characterized by a smaller\nfractal dimension, compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
