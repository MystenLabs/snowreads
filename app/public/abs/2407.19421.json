However, PINNs face persistent challenges\nwith stiffness in gradient flow, which limits their predictive capabilities.\nThis paper presents an improved PINN (I-PINN) to mitigate gradient-related\nfailures. The core of I-PINN is to combine the respective strengths of neural\nnetworks with an improved architecture and adaptive weights containingupper\nbounds. The capability to enhance accuracy by at least one order of magnitude\nand accelerate convergence, without introducing extra computational complexity\nrelative to the baseline model, is achieved by I-PINN. Numerical experiments\nwith a variety of benchmarks illustrate the improved accuracy and\ngeneralization of I-PINN.
