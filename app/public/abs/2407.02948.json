This paper studies the\noptimal information policy to persuade an information-avoidant patient to\nundergo the test and make the best choice that maximizes his health. The\npatient sequentially decides whether to take the test and the optimal treatment\nplan. The information provided is about the background knowledge of the\ndisease, which is complementary with the test result, and disclosure can take\nplace both before and after the test decision. The optimal information policy\ndepends on whether the patient is willing to be tested when he is completely\npessimistic. If so, the optimal policy features \\textit{preemptive warning}:\nthe disclosure only takes place before the test, and the bad news guarantees\nthe patient to be tested and be treated even without further information. If\nnot, the optimal policy constructs an \\textit{information greenhouse}: an\ninformation structure that provides high anticipatory utility is committed when\nthe patient is tested and the test result is bad. I consider extensions to\ngeneral information preference and ex ante participation constraint.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9pDvrNgU8KDsPvKuVZRlMnaEuoTLJIBhSre2HRrNBMc","pdfSize":"529174"}
