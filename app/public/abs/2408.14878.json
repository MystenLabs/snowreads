We have analysed five different models of $f(Q,T)$ gravity and tested\nthem against Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometer data, Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations data and Pantheon data. We put stringent constraints on the\n$f(Q,T)$ gravity models, $f(Q,T) = Q^{n} +\\beta T$ $(n=1,2,3)$, $f(Q,T)=-\\alpha\nQ-\\beta T^{2}$ and $f(Q,T)=Q^{-2}T^{2}$ along with other cosmological\nparameters such as deceleration parameter, equation of state parameter and\ndemonstrate their alignment with the $\\Lambda CDM$ model and the observational\ndata. We show that these models have the capability to alleviate the Hubble\ntension, by predicting the present value of the Hubble parameter close to\n$74$km/s/Mpc. $f(Q,T)$ gravity theory introduces alterations in the background\nevolution and imposes a friction term in the propagation of gravitational\nwaves, this phenomenon has also been examined. We have shown their agreement\nwith the Gravitational Wave (GW) luminosity distance with the Electromagnetic\n(EM) counter part data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced VIRGO across different\nobserving runs capturing coalescence of Binary Neutron Stars (BNS), mergers of\nBinary Black Holes (BBHs), and Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) binaries with EM\ncounterparts.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
