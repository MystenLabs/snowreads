For instance, like the lowest LL, topological exact flat bands with\nideal quantum geometry can be constructed using the same holomorphic function\nstructure, $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}} = f_{\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}_0}(z)\n\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}_0}$, where $f_{\\mathbf{k}}(z)$ is a holomorphic function. This\nholomorphic structure has been the foundation of existing knowledge on\nconstructing ideal topological flat bands. In this Letter, we report a new\nfamily of ideal topological flat bands where the $f$ function does not need to\nbe holomorphic. We provide both model examples and universal principles, as\nwell as an analytic method to construct the wavefunctions of these flat bands,\nrevealing their universal properties, including ideal quantum geometry and a\nChern number of $C = \\pm 2$ or higher.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8ECIL-Jjz3UBaVYrQh2DtqxeCMkMvi-FUllXsOfKE2w","pdfSize":"3794485"}
