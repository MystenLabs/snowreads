We exploit and refine the results of [25](Phuc, Torres 2017), in\nparticular exploring the relation with divergence-measure fields and proving\nthe stability of the perimeter bound from sets to $BV$ functions under a\nsuitable approximation of the given measure. As an important tool, we obtain a\nrefinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation for $BV$ functions, which is\nof separate interest in itself and, in the context of Anzellotti's pairing\ntheory for divergence-measure fields, implies a new way of approximating\n$\\lambda$-pairings, as well as new bounds for their total variation. These\nresults are also relevant due to their application in the study of weak\nsolutions to the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure\ndata, which is explored in a subsequent work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
