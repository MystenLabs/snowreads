To enable litigants to make\ninformed decisions, we present a novel dataset of 310,876 U.S. civil lawsuits\nand we apply an algorithm that generalizes the Bradley-Terry model to assess\nlaw firm effectiveness. We find that our outcome-based ranking system better\naccounts for future performance than traditional reputation-based rankings,\nwhich often fail to reflect future legal performance. Moreover, this\npredictability decays to zero as the number of interactions between law firms\nincreases, providing new evidence to the long-standing debate about whether\nlitigation win rates approach 50\\% as information asymmetry diminishes. By\nprioritizing empirical results, our approach aims to provide a more equitable\nassessment of law firm quality, challenging existing prestige-focused metrics,\nand levels the playing field between litigants.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
