We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the\nguiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in\nnoncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level\ndegeneracy ($N_{\\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the\nresulting theory describes $N_{\\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating\nin \\emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the\nbosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\\theta$-term.\nBy properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and\nmagnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat,\nLandau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de\nHaas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological\n$\\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated\ngapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of\nbosonization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dHGZancak6qIqhJPy94w6uS6k4mCNADLIa82IystvT0","pdfSize":"1477621"}
