In this\nattack, the attacker injects a malicious instruction into third party data\nwhich an LLM is likely to consume when assisting a user, who is the victim.\nXPIA is often used as a means for data exfiltration, and the estimated cost of\nthe average data breach for a business is nearly $4.5 million, which includes\nbreaches such as compromised enterprise credentials. With the rise of\ngradient-based attacks such as the GCG suffix attack, the odds of an XPIA\noccurring which uses a GCG suffix are worryingly high. As part of my work in\nMicrosoft's AI Red Team, I demonstrated a viable attack model using a GCG\nsuffix paired with an injection in a simulated XPIA scenario. The results\nindicate that the presence of a GCG suffix can increase the odds of successful\ndata exfiltration by nearly 20%, with some caveats.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
