The nearest neighbour is defined by the Euclidean distance\nin three-dimensional space. The resulting directed nearest neighbour graphs\nthat are used to define the clusters are split up in an iterative procedure\nwith MPI remote memory access (RMA) communication. The method has been\nimplemented as part of the elliptical parcel-in-cell (EPIC) method targeting\ngeophysical fluid flows. The parallel scalability of the algorithm is discussed\nby means of an artificial and a standard fluid dynamics test case. The cluster\nalgorithm shows good weak and strong scalability up to 16,384 cores with a\nparallel weak scaling efficiency of about 80% for balanced workloads. In poorly\nbalanced problems, MPI synchronisation dominates execution of the cluster\nalgorithm and thus drastically worsens its parallel scalability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7w3DjApS8FU_BLLAUKCch49rc8iwEknNHVTBqv97oJk","pdfSize":"7691952"}
