The influences of rotational effect on the properties of the $ J /\n\\psi$ and the $ \\Upsilon ( 1 S )$ are investigated by incorporating rotation\nmedium into the holographic QCD. It is found that temperature, chemical\npotential, and rotational radius effects enhance the dissociation process of\nthe $ J / \\psi$ and the $ \\Upsilon ( 1 S )$ states within the medium. This\nrotation-induced effect is more significant for heavy vector mesons in the\ntransverse direction than that of the longitudinal direction. The first\nholographic study on the influence of the radius of a homogeneous rotating\nsystem on the vector meson spectrum is proposed. It is found that increasing in\nrotation radius promotes the dissociation of vector mesons of the $ J / \\psi$\nand $ \\Upsilon ( 1 S )$. We also find that the dissociation perpendicular to\nthe direction of rotational angular velocity is more significant than that\nparallel to it at large rational radius.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xtbIcLV1P_C_xgBCV8AgIh2jBVU1VdpNu9QpFKGPtIA","pdfSize":"397552"}
