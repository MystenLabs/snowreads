In this paper, we introduce a subring (refer to the Anderson\nring) of both the Nagata ring and the Serre's conjecture ring (up to\nisomorphism), and investigate properties of the Anderson rings. Additionally,\nwe compare the properties of the Anderson rings with those of Nagata rings and\nSerre's conjecture rings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
