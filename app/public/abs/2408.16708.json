In observational studies, aliasing occurs when certain combinations\nof covariates -- e.g., time period and various eligibility criteria for\ntreatment -- perfectly predict the treatment that an individual will receive,\nso a covariate combination is aliased with a particular treatment. In this\nsituation, when a contrast among several groups is used to estimate a treatment\neffect, collections of individuals defined by contrast weights may be balanced\nwith respect to summaries of low-order interactions between covariates and\ntreatments, but necessarily not balanced with respect to summaries of\nhigh-order interactions between covariates and treatments. We develop a theory\nof aliasing in observational studies, illustrate that theory in an\nobservational study whose aliasing is more robust than conventional\ndifference-in-differences, and develop a new form of matching to construct\nbalanced confounded factorial designs from observational data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YF182GvTJd3g49dGb3dJjdx2oZ7Hn_GbZS3QZBGfOHY","pdfSize":"323962"}
