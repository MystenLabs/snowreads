Traditional visual spatial\nrelationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial\nrelationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge\nand lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large\nLanguage-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD,\nwhich is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended\ndescription of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first\nconstructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs\nfor the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and\nVision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports\nhigh-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to\nrefine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy.\nLLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can\nfollow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object\nrelationships in images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
