While so far most studies have relied on static changes\nof screening through doping or gating, here we demonstrate that screening can\nalso drive the onset of distinct quantum states on the ultrafast timescale. By\nusing time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we show that intense\noptical excitation can drive 1T-TiSe$_2$, a prototypical charge density wave\nmaterial, almost instantly from a gapped into a semimetallic state. By\nsystematically comparing changes in bandstructure over time and excitation\nstrength with theoretical calculations we find that the appearance of this\nstate is likely caused by a dramatic reduction of the screening length. In\nsummary, this work showcases how optical excitation enables the screening\ndriven design of a non-equilibrium semimetallic phase in TiSe$_2$, possibly\nproviding a general pathway into highly screened phases in other strongly\ncorrelated materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"N5s4kYyY_1mOecYPgC-dV6zS79fL0UCjXd3u2EQyj2M","pdfSize":"3435387"}
