In this way, we complete the classification of infinitesimal\nsymmetries of real-analytic Levi-nonflat hypersurfaces in complex two-space.\nThe classification of holomorphic vector fields obtained in the paper has very\ninteresting overlaps with the recent Lombardi-Stolovitch classification theory\nfor holomorphic vector fields at a singularity. In particular, we show that\nmost of the resonances arising in Lombardi-Stolovitch theory do not occur under\nthe presence of (Levi-nonflat) integral manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g-gpclrrhep4rLL6oTATRROMa56c9uS2h8-mOl5whnI","pdfSize":"315726"}
