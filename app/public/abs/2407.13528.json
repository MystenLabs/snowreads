A significant\nadvantage of this idea is the reduction of the time of the design process\nretrieved from a surrogate model of the resonant half-wave dipole antenna\nembedded in a medium. However, the design of a new electromagnetic energy\nharvester with a deep-subwavelength thickness (~ 0.004{\\lambda}) is the major\nconcern of this work. The proposed structure shows an enhanced level of\nabsorption. Decreasing the thickness of metasurface as a new classification of\nenergy harvester, we have managed to demonstrate the stability of the\nefficiency. In addition, this metasurface energy harvester proved to maintain a\nrelatively constant performance (efficiency and HPBW more than 85% and 7%,\nrespectively) as the angle of the EM incident wave was changed over a range of\n75 degrees in the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
