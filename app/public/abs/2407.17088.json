Recently,\nvarious continuous-frequency measurement schemes have emerged. However, when\nthe MW detuning surpasses 1 GHz, the sensitivity degrades by over an order of\nmagnitude compared to resonant measurements. In this paper, we successfully\nextend the response frequency range by harnessing a controlled driving field in\nconjunction with a quantum mixer and heterodyne technology, theoretically\nenabling infinite scalability. Notably, second-order effects stemming from\nquantum mixing necessitate careful consideration to ensure accurate electric\nfield measurements. In addition, compared to resonant measurements, the\nsensitivity decline for far-detuned MW fields exceeding 1 GHz is less than\ntwice, representing a significant improvement of several orders of magnitude\nover alternative schemes. Furthermore, the sensitivity of far-detuned MW fields\ncan be efficiently enhanced by augmenting the intensity and frequency of the\ncontrolled field. For detunings ranging from 100 MHz to 2 GHz, we present\noptimal sensitivity values and the corresponding methods to achieve them. Our\nfindings pave the way for Rydberg atom-based MW receivers characterized by both\nhigh sensitivity and an exceptionally broad bandwidth.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
