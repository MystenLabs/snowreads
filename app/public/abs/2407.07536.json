Our contribution lies in\nintroducing character-level annotations for frequently used characters, in our\ncase the trigram kai and four additional letters (epsilon, kappa, mu, omega),\nin Greek texts. We use a state-of-the-art writer retrieval approach based on\nNetVLAD and compare a character-level-based feature aggregation method against\nthe current default baseline of using small patches located at SIFT keypoint\nlocations for building the page descriptors. We demonstrate that by using only\nabout 15 characters per page, we are able to boost the performance up to 4% mAP\n(a relative improvement of 11%) on the GRK-120 dataset. Additionally, our\nqualitative analysis offers insights into the similarity scores of SIFT patches\nand specific characters. We publish the dataset with character-level\nannotations, including a quality label and our binarized images for further\nresearch.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"414PNUDw8Kp7akPzJRl8PgklCZeVyVF3jDxdlyHQEy8","pdfSize":"7711829"}
