An Exannaagent considers the values of itself and others when\nproviding rationales for its actions and evaluating the rationales provided by\nothers. Via multiagent simulation, we demonstrate that considering values in\ndecision making and producing rationales, especially for norm-deviating\nactions, leads to (1) higher conflict resolution, (2) better social experience,\n(3) higher privacy, and (4) higher flexibility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5gCMYdzUnGdrip6bYPbyc9aR00IfOol8Kxcdk8COQtM","pdfSize":"552556","txDigest":"EpctYZxcvteQouduiPJuDiNxQye61g5VAuCD4rh6sNZK","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
