This motivates the development of heuristic approaches\nthat enhance efficiency even marginally. We propose a novel approach for\nexploring paths in a 2D grid, specifically designed for easy integration with\nthe Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA), a powerful quantum heuristic.\nOur contribution includes: 1) An objective function tailored to solve the\nmulti-vehicle CPP using QAOA. 2) Theoretical proofs guaranteeing the validity\nof the proposed approach. 3) Efficient construction of QAOA operators for\npractical implementation. 4) Resource estimation to assess the feasibility of\nQAOA execution. 5) Performance comparison against established algorithms like\nthe Depth First Search. This work paves the way for leveraging quantum\ncomputing in optimizing multi-vehicle path planning, potentially leading to\nreal-world advancements in various applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R08ZDg5kmRd7Iyshgf8Ki72NiRooryBOb6DRwTWyYyA","pdfSize":"541458"}
