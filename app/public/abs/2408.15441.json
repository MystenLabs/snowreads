While fractionally charged valence quarks are understood\nconventionally to each carry a baryon number of 1/3, the baryon junction, a\nnon-perturbative Y-shaped topology of neutral gluons, has also been proposed as\nan alternative entity tracing the baryon number. Neither scenario has been\nverified experimentally. The STAR Collaboration reports measurements at\nmid-rapidity of baryon number ($\\boldsymbol{B}$) over the electric charge\nnumber difference ($\\boldsymbol{\\Delta Q}$) in isobar nuclear collisions, and\nthe net-proton yield along rapidity in photonuclear collisions. A larger\n$\\boldsymbol{B/\\Delta Q}$ ratio and less asymmetric net-proton yield are\nobserved than predicted from models assigning baryon number to valence quarks.\nThese findings, corroborated by previous measurements in Au+Au collisions,\ndisfavor the valence quark picture.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_ZOXo8MueEJWlaWDdB0nDOl6dvk2fXMf1ftIIE5IYJA","pdfSize":"4549493"}
