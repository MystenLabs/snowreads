This exceptional performance is attributed to its unique\nmicrostructure, which includes Long-Period Stacking Ordered (LPSO) phases or\nthe distinctive microstructure derived from the LPSO phase, referred to as the\nMille-Feuille structure (MFS). This study systematically compares the\ntraditional ingot metallurgy method with the rapid solidification technique,\ncoupled with diverse heat treatments and extrusion processes. Microscopic\nanalyses reveal variations in the presence of LPSO phases, Mille-Feuille\nstructure, and grain size, leading to divergent mechanical and corrosion\nproperties. The rapid solidification approach stands out, ensuring superior\nmechanical properties alongside a reasonable corrosion rate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
