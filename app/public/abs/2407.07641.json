We\nfirst consider MMS allocations, allocations that give every agent at least her\nmaximin share. Such allocations are guaranteed to exist for simple classes of\nvaluation functions. We consider the expected number of bits that each agent\nneeds to transmit, on average over all agents. For unit demand valuations, we\nshow that this number is only $O(1)$ (but $\\Theta(\\log n)$, if one seeks EF1\nallocations instead of MMS allocations), for binary additive valuations we show\nthat it is $\\Theta(\\log \\frac{m}{n})$, and for 2-valued additive valuations we\nshow a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\frac{m}{n})$.\n  For general additive valuations, MMS allocations need not exist. We consider\na notion of {\\em approximately proportional} (Aprop) allocations, that\napproximates proportional allocations in two different senses, being both Prop1\n(proportional up to one item), and $\\frac{n}{2n-1}$-TPS (getting at least a\n$\\frac{n}{2n-1}$ fraction of the {\\em truncated proportional share}, and hence\nalso at least a $\\frac{n}{2n-1}$ fraction of the MMS). We design randomized\nprotocols that output Aprop allocations, in which the expected average number\nof bits transmitted per agent is $O(\\log m)$. For the stronger notion of MXS\n({\\em minimum EFX share}) we show a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\frac{m}{n})$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
