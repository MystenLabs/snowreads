In some\nrecent work the thermal sector of this theory was investigated by a\nrenormalization group computation based on perturbed conformal field theory.\nHere we apply the same approach to study instead the magnetic sector. In\nparticular we compute the leading corrections to the Potts spin scaling\ndimension. Our results include as a special case the long-range disorder Ising\nmodel. We compare our prediction to Monte-Carlo simulations. Finally, by\nstudying the magnetization scaling function, we show a clear numerical evidence\nof a cross-over between the long-range and the short-range class of\nuniversality.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
