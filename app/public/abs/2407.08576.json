However, current theoretical and computational models for\nresonances cannot yet rival the level of accuracy achieved by bound-state\nmethodologies. Here, we generalize selected configuration interaction (SCI) to\ntreat resonances using the complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique. By\nmodifying the selection procedure and the extrapolation protocol of standard\nSCI, the resulting CAP-SCI method yields resonance positions and widths of full\nconfiguration interaction quality. Initial results for the shape resonances of\n\\ce{N2-} and \\ce{CO-} reveal the important effect of high-order correlation,\nwhich shifts the values obtained with CAP-augmented equation-of-motion\ncoupled-cluster with singles and doubles by more than \\SI{0.1}{\\eV}. The\npresent CAP-SCI approach represents a cornerstone in the development of\nhighly-accurate methodologies for resonances.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
