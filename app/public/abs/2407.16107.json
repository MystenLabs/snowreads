We implement adaptive, tetris-adaptive variational\nquantum eigensolver (VQE), and entanglement forging to reduce computational\nresource requirements. We run VQE experiments on IBM quantum processing units\nand use error mitigation, including twirled readout error extinction (TREX) and\nzero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) to reduce noise. Our results affirm the\nusefulness of VQE on noisy quantum hardware and pave the way for the usage of\nVQE related methods for large molecules.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
