Accordingly, the concept of lensing images has\nbeen generalized to include complex solutions of the lens equation referred to\nas \"imaginary images\", and more radically, to the Lefschetz thimbles which are\na sum of steepest descent contours connecting the real and imaginary images in\nthe complex domain. In this wave-optics-based theoretical framework of lensing,\nwe study the \"Stokes phenomena\" as the change of the topology of the Lefschetz\nthimbles. Similar to the well-known caustics at which the number of geometric\nimages changes abruptly, the corresponding Stokes lines are the boundaries in\nthe parameter space where the number of effective imaginary images changes. We\nmap the Stokes lines for a few lens models. The resulting Stokes line-caustics\nnetwork represents a unique feature of the lens models. The observable\nsignature of the Stokes phenomena is the change of interference behavior, in\nparticular the onset of frequency oscillation for some Stokes lines. We also\ndemonstrate high-order Stokes phenomena where the system has a continuous\nnumber of effective images but with an abrupt change in the way they are\nconnected to each other by the Lefschetz thimbles. Their full characterization\ncalls for an analogy of the catastrophe theory for caustics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
