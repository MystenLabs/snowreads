This concept has previously been used to\nmodel lexical ambiguity. In this paper, we consider metaphor as a type of\nlexical ambiguity, and examine whether metaphorical meaning can be effectively\nmodelled using mixtures of word senses. We find that modelling metaphor is\nsignificantly more difficult than other kinds of lexical ambiguity, but that\nour best-performing density matrix method outperforms simple baselines as well\nas some neural language models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LoOQRAOAXso3m3FIWqFc1-5WQLmJTr9XtAz921y1DE8","pdfSize":"637956"}
