This paper series explores how the dynamical state of galaxy clusters\naffects their galaxy populations' physical and morphological properties. The\nprimary aim of this first paper is to evaluate the dynamical state of 87\nmassive ($M_{500} \\geq 1.5 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$) galaxy clusters at low\nredshifts ($0.10 \\leq z \\leq 0.35$). This will allow us to have a\nwell-characterized sample for analyzing physical and morphological properties\nin our next work. We employ six dynamical state proxies utilizing optical and\nX-ray imaging data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to integrate\nthese proxies effectively, allowing for robust classification of galaxy\nclusters into relaxed, intermediate, and disturbed states based on their\ndynamical characteristics. The methodology successfully segregates the galaxy\nclusters into the three dynamical states. Examination of the galaxy\ndistributions in optical wavelengths and gas distributions in X-ray further\nconfirms the consistency of these classifications. The clusters' dynamical\nstates are statistically distinguishable, providing a clear categorization for\nfurther analysis.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
