The proposed architecture provides significant sensitivity\neven for short interaction times between the ancillae comprised in the\nthermometer and the system to be probed, and a small number of\ninformation-acquiring collisions. The assessment of the flow of information\ntaking place within the layered thermometer and between system and thermometer\nreveals that the tuning of the mutual backflow of information has a positive\ninfluence on the precision of thermometry, and helps unveiling the\ninformation-theoretic mechanisms behind the working principles of the proposed\narchitecture.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
