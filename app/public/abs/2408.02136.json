We present a\ngeneral combinatorial dipole-removal argument for a large class of discrete\nmodels including XY systems and screw dislocation models, allowing to prove\nsharp conditions under which controlled flux and boundary energy guarantee to\nhave minimizers with zero or one charges in the interior. The argument uses the\nmax-flow min-cut theorem in combination with an ad-hoc duality for planar\ngraphs, and is robust with respect to changes of the function defining the\ninteraction energies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
