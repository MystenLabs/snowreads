The vector fields, Hamiltonian\nfunctions, symplectic form and constants of the motion of the Euclidean classes\nare recovered by a contraction process. The construction is based on the\nstructure of certain subalgebras of the so-called conformal algebras of the\ntwo-dimensional Cayley-Klein spaces. These curved Lie-Hamilton classes allow us\nto generalize naturally the Riccati, Kummer-Schwarz and Ermakov equations on\nthe Euclidean plane to curved spaces, covering both the Riemannian and\nLorentzian possibilities, and where the curvature can be considered as an\nintegrable deformation parameter of the initial Euclidean system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
