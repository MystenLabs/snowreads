The workshop was organized into five thematic sessions: \"how far beyond\nlinear\" discusses issues of truncation and validity in interpretation of\nresults with an eye towards practicality; \"reconstruction-level results\" visits\nthe question of how best to design analyses directly targeting inference of EFT\nparameters; \"logistics of combining likelihoods\" addresses the challenges of\nbringing a diverse array of measurements into a cohesive whole; \"unfolded\nresults\" tackles the question of designing fiducial measurements for later use\nin EFT interpretations, and the benefits and limitations of unfolding; and\n\"building a sample library\" addresses how best to generate simulation samples\nfor use in data analysis. This document serves as a summary of presentations,\nsubsequent discussions, and actionable items identified over the course of the\nworkshop.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
