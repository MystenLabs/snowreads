The distribution of\ntransverse momentum that enter into these collisions differs from that in\nDrell-Yan collisions with free nucleons in two distinct ways: the intrinsic\nparton structure of the TMDs are altered, the perturbative dynamics undergo\nadditional modification due to interactions with the nuclear medium. In this\npaper, we focus on the perturbative dynamics, which we demonstrate enter from\nforward scattering between the parton constituents of the proton and the\nnuclear medium. We then derive these partonic contributions to the TMD\nDrell-Yan cross section up to next-to-leading order in the strong coupling\nconstant and to the first order in the medium opacity. We demonstrate that the\ncollinear and rapidity divergences related to parton showers in matter lead to\ni) an in-medium renormalization group equation that encodes the transverse\nmomentum dependence of parton energy loss, and ii) a\nBalitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov evolution equation for the forward scattering\ncross section. We discuss the relation of our results to the phenomenological\nextraction of nuclear TMDs and apply the new formalism to Drell-Yan production\nat small transverse momenta in $p$+$A$ reactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
