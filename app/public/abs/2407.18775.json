We\ndiscuss how the different photophysical processes manifest as features of the\ninterference pattern, and determine the accuracy of molecular parameters\nestimated from a realistic measurement with finite particle numbers. The\nanalysis is based on an analytic calculation in Wigner representation, which\naccounts for the laser-induced coherent and incoherent dynamics, for the finite\nlongitudinal and transverse coherence in the matter-wave beam, the\ngravitational and Coriolis acceleration, and an imperfect standing laser wave.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
