This provides a general framework to obtain\ncorrectness conditions for causal learning, and has the following implications.\nWe provide exact correctness conditions for the PC algorithm, which are then\nrelated to correctness conditions of some other existing causal discovery\nalgorithms. We show that the sparsest Markov representation condition is the\nweakest correctness condition resulting from existing notions of minimality for\nmaximal ancestral graphs and directed acyclic graphs. We also reason that\nadditional knowledge than just Pearl-minimality is necessary for causal\nlearning beyond faithfulness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"CDeGwiGlVKwZ3h4CSo_WyCR0xAEzJhN62bb6tJ8_VxE","pdfSize":"418607"}
