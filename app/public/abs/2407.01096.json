The existence of these processes can alleviate\ncertain constraints and substantially modify the indirect detection signal. In\nthis paper, we study current indirect detection constraints on the\nsemi-annihilation of inert scalar multiplets. We show that there exist gauge\nnumbers for which dark matter can be thermally produced and be compatible with\nindirect detection constraints even for very cuspy galactic dark matter density\nprofiles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
