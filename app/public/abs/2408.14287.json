Here we\nexplore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event\ndetected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of\na subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more\nexotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence\nlevel already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal\ndeformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole\nwould have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the\nmeasurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule\nout or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
