Despite their importance, ADEs are often under-reported in official\nchannels. Some research has therefore turned to detecting discussions of ADEs\nin social media. Impressive results have been achieved in various attempts to\ndetect ADEs. In a high-stakes domain such as medicine, however, an in-depth\nevaluation of a model's abilities is crucial. We address the issue of thorough\nperformance evaluation in English-language ADE detection with hand-crafted\ntemplates for four capabilities: Temporal order, negation, sentiment, and\nbeneficial effect. We find that models with similar performance on held-out\ntest sets have varying results on these capabilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
