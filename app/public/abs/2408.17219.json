Our results reconstruct the\nunderlying field $X$ from the multiplicative chaos measure $\\nu_{\\gamma,X}$.\nThe new feature of our results is that we allow the dimension $d$ to be\narbitrary and cover also the critical case $\\gamma=\\sqrt{2d}$. In the\nsub-critical regime $\\gamma<\\sqrt{2d}$, we allow the fields to be mildly\nnon-Gaussian, that is, the field has the decomposition $X=G+H$ with a\nlog-correlated Gaussian field $G$ and a H\\\"older-continuos (not necessarily\nGaussian) field $H$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
