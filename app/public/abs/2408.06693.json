Leveraging the density estimates from these models,\nour approach, the Diffusion Classifier for 3D Objects (DC3DO), enables\nzero-shot classification of 3D shapes without additional training. On average,\nour method achieves a 12.5 percent improvement compared to its multiview\ncounterparts, demonstrating superior multimodal reasoning over discriminative\napproaches. DC3DO employs a class-conditional diffusion model trained on\nShapeNet, and we run inferences on point clouds of chairs and cars. This work\nhighlights the potential of generative models in 3D object classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
