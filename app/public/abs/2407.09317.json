We investigate the staircase of\nstructural phase transitions in layered IrTe$_2$ for which a number of\npotential transition mechanisms have been postulated. The spatial coexistence\nof multiple phases on the micron scale has prevented a detailed analysis of the\nelectronic structure. By exploiting micro-ARPES obtained with synchrotron\nradiation we extract the electronic structure of the multiple structural phases\nin IrTe$_2$ in order to address the mechanism underlying the phase transitions.\nWe find direct evidence of lowered energy states that appear in the\nlow-temperature phases, states previously predicted by \\textit{ab initio}\ncalculations and extended here. Our results validate a proposed scenario of\nbonding and anti-bonding states as the driver of the phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y0g-4a_fmlcHyD0RMEU_YinOz0JV40HRsVMCJ2-8UN4","pdfSize":"6910547","objectId":"0xed93fde0ce67f611971c843269980314aa108d768b5d15bca15a045953dc3a45","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
