We are able to combine a local solvation model --\npermitting examination of the interplay between electric forces and the\nion-solvent binding -- with a full electrolyte model. Using this, we can\ninvestigate double layer structures for a wide range of electrolytes,\nespecially including highly concentrated solutions. We find that some of the\nparameters of our model significantly affect the solvent concentration at the\nelectrode surface, and thereby the rate of solvent decomposition. Firstly, an\nincreased salt concentration weakens the solvation shells, making it possible\nto strip the solvent in the EDL before the ions reach the surface. The strength\nof the ion-solvent interaction also affects at which potential difference the\nsolvation shells removed. We are therefore able to qualitatively predict EDL\nstructures for different electrolytes based on parameters like molecule size,\nsolvent binding energy and salt concentration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
