In\ncontrast, smaller language models such as MiniCPM offer more sustainable\nscalability, but often underperform without specialized optimization. In this\npaper, we explore the enhancement of smaller language models through the\nimprovement of their text embeddings. We select three language models, MiniCPM,\nPhi-2, and Gemma, to conduct contrastive fine-tuning on the NLI dataset. Our\nresults demonstrate that this fine-tuning method enhances the quality of text\nembeddings for all three models across various benchmarks, with MiniCPM showing\nthe most significant improvements of an average 56.33% performance gain.
