We highlight an\nintriguing link between the Maximal Certified Radius (MCR) of a classifier\nrepresenting a space's occupancy and the space's Signed Distance Function\n(SDF). Leveraging this relationship, we propose to use the certification method\nof randomized smoothing (RS) to compute SDFs. Since RS' high computational cost\nprevents its practical usage as a way to compute SDFs, we propose an algorithm\nto efficiently run RS in low-dimensional applications, such as 3D space, by\nexpressing RS' fundamental operations as Gaussian smoothing on pre-computed\nvoxel grids. Our approach offers an innovative and practical tool to compute\nSDFs, validated through proof-of-concept experiments in novel view synthesis.\nThis paper bridges two previously disparate areas of machine learning, opening\nnew avenues for further exploration and potential cross-domain advancements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
