To this end, watermarking has been adapted to\nLLM, enabling a simple and effective way to detect and monitor generated text.\nHowever, while the existing methods can differentiate between watermarked and\nunwatermarked text with high accuracy, they often face a trade-off between the\nquality of the generated text and the effectiveness of the watermarking\nprocess. In this work, we present a novel type of LLM watermark, Sparse\nWatermark, which aims to mitigate this trade-off by applying watermarks to a\nsmall subset of generated tokens distributed across the text. The key strategy\ninvolves anchoring watermarked tokens to words that have specific\nPart-of-Speech (POS) tags. Our experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed watermarking scheme achieves high detectability while generating text\nthat outperforms previous LLM watermarking methods in quality across various\ntasks\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i7xbrjnw-Tl-POKC9IiLRQmqBEOIOy3duokCs9ITc-I","pdfSize":"1232106"}
