We chose to explore predictions of austral\nspringtime rainfall in SE Australia regions based on the surrounding ocean\nsurface temperatures during the winter. In the first stage, we search for\ncorrelations between the target rainfall and both the standard ocean climate\nindicators as well as the time series of surface temperature data expanded in\nterms of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs). In the case of the Indian\nOcean, during the winter the dominant EOF shows stronger correlation with the\nfuture rainfall than the commonly used Indian Ocean Dipole. Information sources\nwith the strongest correlation to the historical rainfall data are then used as\ninputs into deep learning artificial neural networks. The resulting hindcasts\nappear accurate for September and October and less reliable for November. We\nalso attempt to forecast the rainfall in several regions for the coming austral\nspring.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oFWfmRObk1Ep0YWJFHShYzIcYxNjVFxcirzUna_KnaI","pdfSize":"1033217"}
