Each selects an arrival time to a destination,\nthe earlier one fetching a higher reward. There is, however, an inherent\npenalty in arriving too early as well as a risk in traveling alone. This gives\nrise to the possibility of the agents cooperating by traveling together while\ncompeting for the reward. In our prior work [1] we studied this problem as a\nsequential game among a set of $N$ competing agents in continuous time, and\ndefined the formation of a group traveling together as arriving at exactly the\nsame time. In the present study, we relax this definition to allow arrival\ntimes within a small window, and study a 2-agent game in both continuous and\ndiscrete time, referred to as the flock formation game. We derive and examine\nthe properties of the subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) of this game.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
