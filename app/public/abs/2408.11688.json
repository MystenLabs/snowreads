While typically this is done by\nhuman healthcare workers, there is a significant societal interest to enable\nrobots to do this test to reduce exposure to patients and to free up human\nresources. The task is challenging from the robotics perspective because of the\ndexterity and safety requirements. While other works have implemented specific\nhardware solutions, our research differentiates itself by using a ubiquitous\nrigid robotic arm. This work presents a case study where we investigate the\nstrengths and challenges using compliant control system to accomplish NP swab\ntests with such a robotic configuration. To accomplish this, we designed a\nforce sensing end-effector that integrates with the proposed torque controlled\ncompliant control loop. We then conducted experiments where the robot inserted\nNP swabs into a 3D printed nasal cavity phantom. Ultimately, we found that the\ncompliant control system outperformed a basic position controller and shows\npromise for human use. However, further efforts are needed to ensure the\ninitial alignment with the nostril and to address head motion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
