A transformable leg-wheel design is\nconsidered and characterized in terms of key locomotion characteristics as a\nfunction of the design. Kinematic analysis is conducted based on a generalized\nfour-bar mechanism driven by a coaxial hub arrangement. The analysis is used to\ninform the design of a central pattern generator to control the robot by\nmapping oscillator states to wheel-leg trajectories and implementing\ndifferential steering within the oscillator network. Three oscillator models\nare used as the basis of the CPGs, and their performance is compared over a\nrange of inputs. The CPG-based controller is used to drive the developed robot\nprototype on level ground and over obstacles. Additional simulated tests are\nperformed for uneven terrain negotiation and obstacle climbing. Results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of CPG control in transformable wheel-legged\nrobots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
