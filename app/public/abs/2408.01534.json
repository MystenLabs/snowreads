However, the current\nstate-of-the-art DNN models can not provide a balanced solution among accuracy,\nspeed, and model size. This paper proposes an efficient real-time object\ndetection framework on resource-constrained hardware devices through hardware\nand software co-design. The Tensor Train (TT) decomposition is proposed for\ncompressing the YOLOv5 model. By unitizing the unique characteristics given by\nthe TT decomposition, we develop an efficient hardware accelerator based on\nFPGA devices. Experimental results show that the proposed method can\nsignificantly reduce the model size and improve the execution time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
