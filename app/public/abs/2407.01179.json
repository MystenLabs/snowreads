The cyclicity rank of $\\Delta$ is\nthe minimal number of cyclic subgroups that the quotient group of $\\Delta$\nsplits into. It is known that up to dimension $d \\leq 4$, every empty lattice\n$d$-simplex is cyclic, meaning that its cyclicity rank is at most $1$. We\ndetermine the maximal possible cyclicity rank of an empty lattice $d$-simplex\nfor dimensions $d \\leq 8$, and determine the asymptotics of this number up to a\nlogarithmic term.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
