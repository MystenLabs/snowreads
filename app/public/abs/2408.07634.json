Our main result is a proof that Minkowski measurability is a\nsufficient condition for the existence of best packing asymptotics on monotone\nrearrangements of these sets. For each such set, the main result provides an\nexplicit constant of proportionality $p_d,$ depending only on the Minkowski\ndimension $d,$ that relates its packing limit and Minkowski content. We later\nuse the Digamma function to study the limiting value of $p_d$ as $d\\to 1^-.$\nFor sharpness, we use renewal theory to prove that the packing constant of the\n$(1/2,1/3)$ Cantor set is less than the product of its Minkowski content and\n$p_d$. We also show that the measurability hypothesis of the main theorem is\nnecessary by demonstrating that a monotone rearrangement of the complementary\nintervals of the 1/3 Cantor set has Minkowski dimension\n$d=\\log2/\\log3\\in(0,1),$ is not Minkowski measurable, and does not have\nconvergent first-order packing asymptotics. The aforementioned characterization\nof Minkowski measurability further motivates the asymptotic study of an\ninfinite multiple subset sum problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
