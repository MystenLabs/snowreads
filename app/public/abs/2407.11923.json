In this analysis, we integrate both\nof these effects within a unified analytical framework and use it to determine\nupper bounds on the parameter space of a nearly scale-invariant non-helical PMF\nin the light of the global 21-cm signal observed by EDGES. Our findings reveal\nthat the joint consideration of both effects furnishes constraints of the order\n$B_0\\lesssim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ nG on the present-day magnetic field\nstrength, which are considerably tighter compared to earlier analyses. We\nsubsequently explore the prospects of detecting such a magnetized 21-cm power\nspectrum at the upcoming SKA-Low mission. For the relevant parameters of the\nPMF ($B_0$ and $n_{\\!_{B}}$) and the excess radio background ($\\xi$), SNR\nestimation and Fisher forecast analysis indicate that it may be possible to\nconstrain these three parameters with relative $1\\sigma$ uncertainties\n$\\lesssim10\\%$ and an associated SNR $\\gtrsim10$ at SKA-Low. This also leads to\npossible correlations among these three parameters, thus revealing intriguing\ntrends of interplay among the various physical processes involved.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
