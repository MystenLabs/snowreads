While Vision Transformer-based models have made significant progress,\ncurrent semantic segmentation methods often struggle with precise predictions\nin localized areas like object boundaries. To tackle this challenge, we\nintroduce a new semantic segmentation architecture, ``MacFormer'', which\nfeatures two key components. Firstly, using learnable agent tokens, a Mutual\nAgent Cross-Attention (MACA) mechanism effectively facilitates the\nbidirectional integration of features across encoder and decoder layers. This\nenables better preservation of low-level features, such as elementary edges,\nduring decoding. Secondly, a Frequency Enhancement Module (FEM) in the decoder\nleverages high-frequency and low-frequency components to boost features in the\nfrequency domain, benefiting object boundaries with minimal computational\ncomplexity increase. MacFormer is demonstrated to be compatible with various\nnetwork architectures and outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and\nefficiency on benchmark datasets ADE20K and Cityscapes under different\ncomputational constraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
