The study addresses the challenge of extracting equations from data,\nparticularly in the study of brain activity using electrophysiological data,\nwhich is often limited by insufficient information. The study provides a brief\nreview of existing open-source equation derivation approaches in the context of\nmodeling brain activity. The section below introduces a novel algorithm that\nemploys incomplete data and prior domain knowledge to recover differential\nequations. The algorithm's practicality in real-world scenarios is demonstrated\nthrough its application on both synthetic and real datasets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8IprT_GK3kRegxYjz82yh2tC70-0uP-fV_dbhRnXmhs","pdfSize":"1916154","objectId":"0x5f178031d6169d08c75bd58e1ed481095d865045b55272dbef9e8dcb87aec79a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
