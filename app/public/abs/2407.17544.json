While\nsome promising results have been obtained, application to specific domains\nraises several general issues including the control of specialized domain\ntools, the lack of existing datasets for training and evaluation, and the\nnon-triviality of automated system evaluation and improvement. In this paper,\nwe present a case-study where we examine these issues in the context of a\nspecific domain. Specifically, we present an automated math visualizer and\nsolver system for mathematical pedagogy. The system orchestrates mathematical\nsolvers and math graphing tools to produce accurate visualizations from simple\nnatural language commands. We describe the creation of specialized data-sets,\nand also develop an auto-evaluator to easily evaluate the outputs of our system\nby comparing them to ground-truth expressions. We have open sourced the\ndata-sets and code for the proposed system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
