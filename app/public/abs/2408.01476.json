Specifically, we derive this black\nhole solution by employing a metric potential where the components are equal,\nthat is, $g_{tt}=g_{rr}$. In our research, we achieve several accomplishments,\nincluding fixing the characteristics of the scalar field, and the Gauss-Bonnet\nterm. We thoroughly examine the physical properties associated with such black\nhole and show that we have supplementary terms when compared to the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole solution. These additional terms are of the\norder $O(\\frac{1}{r^6})$ and $O(\\frac{1}{r^9})$. The presence of these\nsupplementary terms can be attributed to the impact of the scalar function\ndenoted as $\\xi$. Such expressions play a crucial role in generating the\nmulti-horizon black hole solution. The presence of these extra terms\nfacilitates the derivation of a modified first law of thermodynamics and the\ncorresponding Smarr relation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
