Then, to propose\ntreatments, avoid recurrence, and improve the patient's life quality, we need\nto analyze this disease from a biophysical perspective with a solid\nmathematical formulation. In this paper we introduce a novel deterministic\nmodel for the evolution of tumors under several conditions (untreated tumors\nand treated tumors using chemotherapy). Our model is characterized by a\nsecond-order differential equation, whose origin and interpretation are\npresented by exploiting our understanding of fluid mechanics (via continuity\nequations) and the theory of differential equations. Additionally, we show that\nour model can fit various experimental data sets. Thus, we prove that our\nnuanced and general model can describe accelerated growth, as well as\ncytostatic and cytotoxic effects. All in all, our model opens up a new window\nin the understanding of tumor evolution and represents a promising connection\nbetween the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of cancer.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
