In this paper, information theory is\nused as the primary tool to provide a framework for the analysis of temporal\nGNNs. For this reason, the concept of information bottleneck is used and\nadjusted to be suitable for a temporal analysis of such networks. To this end,\na new definition for Mutual Information Rate is provided, and the potential use\nof this new metric in the analysis of temporal GNNs is studied.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
