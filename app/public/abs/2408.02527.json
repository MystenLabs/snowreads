Some of such systems, e.g. the mapping in\nthe so-called 3x+1 problem proposed by Collatz, is conjectured to have a single\nglobal attractor, whereas other systems, e.g. linear congruence, could be\nergodic. Here we demonstrate that an operation that is based on digital\nreversal, has a spectrum of dynamical behaviors, including 2-cycle, 12-cycle,\nperiodic attractors with other cycle lengths, and diverging limiting dynamics\nthat escape to infinity. This dynamical system has infinite number of cyclic\nattractors, and may have unlimited number of cycle lengths. It also has\npotentially infinite number of diverging trajectories with a recurrent pattern\nrepeating every 8 steps. Although the transient time before settling on a\nlimiting dynamics is relatively short, we speculate that transient times may\nnot have an upper bound.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
