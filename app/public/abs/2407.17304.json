We obtain a strip $\\{z \\in\n\\mathbb C:\\: {\\rm Re}\\: s > \\beta\\}$ with infinite number of poles. For\n$\\eta_D$ we prove the same result assuming the boundary real analytic.\nMoreover, for $\\eta_N$ we obtain a characterisation of $\\beta$ by the pressure\n$P(2G)$ of some function $G$ on the space $\\Sigma_A^f$ related to the dynamical\ncharacteristics of the obstacle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
