We prove that, under\ncertain technical assumptions, the degeneracy locus of the universal sheaf over\nthe moduli space of stable sheaves is either empty or an irreducible\nCohen-Macaulay variety of the expected dimension. We also provide a criterion\nfor when the degeneracy locus is non-empty. This result generalizes the work of\nBayer, Chen, and Jiang for the Hilbert scheme of points on surfaces.\n  The above result is a special case of a general phenomenon: for a perfect\ncomplex of Tor-amplitude [0,1], the geometry of the degeneracy locus is closely\nrelated to the geometry of the derived Grassmannian. We analyze their\nbirational geometry and relate it to the incidence varieties of derived\nGrassmannians. As a corollary, we prove a statement previously claimed by the\nauthor in arXiv:2408.06860.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EbXC5R4mrzvglUpvrKBUYTwiTZSiEv4L5j34k_9_zdg","pdfSize":"252777"}
