Quite\nremarkably, the free energy was found to be accurate to a few percent over the\nentire range of temperatures and quartic coupling constant. In addition, the\nkey features of the exact partition function were successfully reproduced.\nAccurate analytic expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies\nas function of $g$ were derived. In this work, we extend our results to the\ncalculation of the full energy spectrum. We also generalize our study of the\nquartic oscillator to the case of the anharmonic oscillator with sextic and\noctic couplings. The energy levels found are accurate for all couplings and\nprincipal quantum numbers considered here (up to $n=8$), confirming this model\npartition function as a good and faithful approximation of the exact one.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WJo7j2EmgAvS9dPzH6UeCPpx5P1leX0wuJDb5gX2TJg","pdfSize":"407112","txDigest":"3LoU3emb3N4JmUVmw16SbBjqx65pirXAjK9Gq8ajXu2T","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
