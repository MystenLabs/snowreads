This is\ncrucially different from a three-dimensional case with exponential screening.\nThe long-range action of electric fields results in the effective inflow of\nelectrons from high-doped regions to low-doped regions of a 2D heterostructure.\nIn graphene and other materials with linear energy spectrum for electrons, such\ninflow in low-doped regions also occurs, but its effectiveness is dependent on\ndoping level. This can be used for fabricating high-mobility conducting\nchannels. We provide the theory for determining electron potential and\nconcentration in a periodically doped graphene sheet along one dimension taking\ninto account all effects of long-range 2D screening. This results in a\nsubstantially nonlinear integro-differential problem, which is solved\nnumerically via computationally cheap algorithm. Similar nonlinear problems\narise in a wide range of doped 2D heterostructures made of linear spectrum\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
