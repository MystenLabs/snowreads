In particular, these errors involved the Dirac\nequation in the 3+1 dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, tetrad field, curved\ngamma matrices, and the time-independent Dirac equation written in terms of the\ninner/scalar product between the gamma matrices and the orbital angular\nmomentum (i.e., $\\vec{\\gamma}\\cdot\\vec{L}$). Besides, the strange/peculiar\nthing about all this is that even Senjaya \\cite{Senjaya} citing Collas and\nKlein \\cite{Collas}, where the (mathematical) formalism is correct, everything\nindicates that he ``ignored'' or ``forgot'' to use such formalism in your\npaper. Therefore, using Ref. \\cite{Collas}, we show here the correct form of\nthe errors made by Senjaya \\cite{Senjaya}.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
