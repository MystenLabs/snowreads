The resulting expressions are functions of the physical parameters\n(temperature, doping level of the substrate, material band gap), which makes it\npossible to evaluate the influence of technological factors on the latchup\nparameters. In particular, an explicit formula was obtained for the critical\ncharge for single event latchup as a function of process parameters and\ntemperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
