Its detection relies on the\navailability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud\nquasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EoR is still poorly\nconstrained due to limited observations. Here, we use a physics-driven model to\nforecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the\nmodel using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington\naccretion, the model yields an average lifetime of $t_{\\rm q} \\sim 10^{5.3}$yr\nfor quasars at $z\\sim6$, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar\nproximity zone pre-study. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars\nevolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable\nradio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21-cm forest studies challenging.\nWith a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a one-year sky\nsurvey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20\nradio-loud quasars at $z\\sim 9$, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve\nindividual 21-cm forest lines.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
