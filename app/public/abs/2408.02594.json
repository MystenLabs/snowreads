Specifically we consider low-rank completion of the block-Hankel\nmatrix representation of a time-series. Simulation experiments are used to\ncompare the method with five recognised imputation techniques with varying\nlevels of computational effort. The Hankel Imputation (HI) method is seen to\nperform competitively at interpolating missing time-series data, and shows\nparticular potential for reproducing sharp peaks in the data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0DTezFZHNWMt25J7a9_meZ-v1ZREAqf-BoR74ah0ezc","pdfSize":"758306"}
