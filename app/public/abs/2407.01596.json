Goal here is to train\nclassification models to accurately identify the shapes of grid areas within\ntwo different square mazes made up with irregular shaped walls. Due to the use\nof different shapes for the walls, a classification model trained in one maze\nthat captures its structure does not generalize for the other. This issue is\nresolved by adopting FL framework between the robots that explore only one maze\nso that the collective knowledge allows them to operate accurately in the\nunseen maze. This illustrates the effectiveness of FL in real-world\napplications in terms of enhancing classification accuracy and robustness in\nmaze discovery tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AcGYTN27To7L19bjV5CmpXU-JUw03nYSPXZk5u1KHbI","pdfSize":"7057550","objectId":"0xc241188761214236e20b7d89cf1a2488157fc8b796a1052be3054ce6f76abf6d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
