A key\nobstacle to such research has been the absence of a suitable framework. To\nresolve this obstacle, we release PyJama, a fully-differentiable open-source\nlibrary that adds jamming and anti-jamming functionality to NVIDIA Sionna. We\ndemonstrate the utility of PyJama (i) for realistic MIMO simulations by showing\nexamples that involve forward error correction, OFDM waveforms in time and\nfrequency, realistic channel models, and mobility; and (ii) for learning to\njam. Specifically, we use stochastic gradient descent to optimize jamming power\nallocation over an OFDM resource grid. The learned strategies are non-trivial,\nintelligible, and effective.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
