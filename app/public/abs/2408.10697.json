We also obtain higher order identities, which interestingly\ninclude well-known numbers like double factorial, Oblong numbers and Stirling\nnumbers of second kind. All functional identities are obtained in $L^{p}$ for\n$p\\in (1,\\infty)$ without the real-valued function assumption, which give a\nsimple and direct understanding of the corresponding inequalities as well as\nthe nonexistence of nontrivial extremizers. As applications, we obtain\nCaffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities with logarithmic weights, which in\na particular case give the critical case of the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl type\nuncertainty principle. We also discuss these results in the setting of Folland\nand Stein's homogeneous Lie groups. A special focus is devoted to stratified\nLie groups, where Sobolev type inequalities become intricately intertwined with\nthe properties of sub-Laplacians and more general subelliptic partial\ndifferential equations. The obtained results are already new even in the\nclassical Euclidean setting with respect to the range of parameters and the\narbitrariness of the choice of any homogeneous quasi-norm. Most inequalities\nare obtained with sharp constants.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
