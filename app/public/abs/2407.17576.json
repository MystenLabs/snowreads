The scheme achieves all rate tuples in Marton's\nregion for two receiver BCs without time-sharing or rate-splitting. Simulations\nwith short polar codes show that the method reduces the gap to capacity as\ncompared to time-sharing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
