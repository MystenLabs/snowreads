It has been shown\nhere, that a generic `fluid frame transformation' including all orders of\ngradient corrections can recast a stable-causal hydrodynamic theory that (i)\nonly includes fundamental fluid variables (velocity and temperature) but\nrequires to be in a general hydrodynamic frame other than the Landau or Eckart,\nto a theory that is (ii) pathology free in Landau frame but needs newer degrees\nof freedom. Since frame choice provides the first principle field definitions\nand degrees of freedom indicate the number of conserved quantities, the\ncausality and stability of a theory seem to require a consensus between the two\nunless the derivative correction goes to infinity. The key finding of this work\nis to indicate a connection between these different formalisms, that lead to a\ncausal and stable hydrodynamic theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NOpWsbXfhM1JINF7YkHea38NFfaozx0KoIo_CGB3sCM","pdfSize":"112837"}
