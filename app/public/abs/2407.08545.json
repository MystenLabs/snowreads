Additionally, we employ a\nwindow-based attention module (WAM) to capture pixel correlations, especially\nfor high contrast regions in the image. We also construct a diverse SC image\ncompression dataset (SDU-SCICD2K) for training, including text, charts,\ngraphics, animation, movie, game and mixture of SC images and NS images.\nExperimental results show our method, more suited for SC than NS data,\noutperforms existing LIC methods in rate-distortion performance on SC images.\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/SunshineSki/OMR Net.git.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
