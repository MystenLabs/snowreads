While this notion gains heightened importance\nduring extreme and highly volatile periods, state-of-the-art methods primarily\nfocus on causality within the body of the distribution, often overlooking\ncausal mechanisms that manifest only during extreme events. Our framework is\ndesigned to infer causality mainly from extreme events by leveraging the causal\ntail coefficient. We establish equivalences between causality in extremes and\nother causal concepts, including (classical) Granger causality, Sims causality,\nand structural causality. We prove other key properties of Granger causality in\nextremes and show that the framework is especially helpful under the presence\nof hidden confounders. We also propose a novel inference method for detecting\nthe presence of Granger causality in extremes from data. Our method is\nmodel-free, can handle non-linear and high-dimensional time series, outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods in all considered setups, both in performance\nand speed, and was found to uncover coherent effects when applied to financial\nand extreme weather observations.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
