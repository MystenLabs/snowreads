This paper examines how groups\nengaged in caste-based discrimination leverage platform affordances of the\nsocial media site X (formerly Twitter) to circulate and reinforce caste\nideologies. Our analysis builds upon previous HCI conceptualizations of online\nharms and safety to inform how to address caste-based othering. We offer\ntheoretical and methodological suggestions for critical HCI research focused on\nstudying the mechanisms of power along other social categories.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
