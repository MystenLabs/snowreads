Traditionally, for Markovian open\nquantum systems, this has been achieved using first and second-order\nTrotter-Suzuki product formulas or probabilistic algorithms. In this work, we\nintroduce novel non-probabilistic algorithms for simulating Markovian open\nquantum systems using randomisation. Our methods, including first and\nsecond-order randomised Trotter-Suzuki formulas and the QDRIFT channel, not\nonly maintain the physicality of the system's evolution but also enhance the\nscalability and precision of quantum simulations. We derive error bounds and\nstep count limits for these techniques, bypassing the need for the mixing lemma\ntypically employed in Hamiltonian simulation proofs. We also present two\nimplementation approaches for these randomised algorithms: classical sampling\nand quantum forking, demonstrating their gate complexity advantages over\ndeterministic Trotter-Suzuki product formulas. This work is the first to apply\nrandomisation techniques to the simulation of open quantum systems,\nhighlighting their potential to enable faster and more accurate simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
