These\ncompounds undergo an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \\sim$ 26 K for\nCoTi$_2$O$_5$ and $T_N \\sim$ 40 K for FeTi$_2$O$_5$. We perform ultrasound\nvelocity measurements on single crystals of CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$.\nThe measurements of these compounds reveal that the symmetry-lowering elastic\nmodes of shear elastic moduli exhibit unusual elastic softness in the\nparamagnetic phase above $T_N$. This elastic softness indicates the presence of\nspin-lattice-coupled fluctuations above $T_N$ that should be a precursor to the\nsymmetry-lowering lattice distortion at $T_N$. Furthermore, it is revealed that\nthe magnitude of the unusual elastic softness is larger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than\nin FeTi$_2$O$_5$, which indicates that the spin-lattice coupling is stronger in\nCoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$. The present study suggests that\nCoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ are unique spin Jahn--Teller systems with low\ncrystal symmetry, where, although the nature of exchange interactions is\nquasi-one-dimensional, the three-dimensional spin-lattice coupling releases the\nfrustration by further lowering the crystal symmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
