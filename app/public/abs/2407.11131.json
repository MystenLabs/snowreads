In contrast to\nthe classical Navier-Stokes system in the Euclidean setting, the diffusion is\nnot elliptic but only hypoelliptic, and the commutator of the Leray projector\nand the hypoelliptic Laplacian is of order two. Yet, we study the existence of\nsolutions in two different settings: within the $L^2$ setting which provides\nglobal existence of weak solutions; within a critical scale-invariant\nSobolev-type space, associated with the regularity of the generators of the\nfirst stratum of the Lie algebra of right-invariant vector fields. In this\nlatter class, we establish global existence of solutions for small data and a\nstability estimate in the energy spaces which ensures the uniqueness of the\nsolutions in this class. Furthermore, we show in this setting that these\nsolutions instantly become analytic in the vertical direction. Surprisingly, we\nobtain a larger lower bound of the radius of analyticity in the vertical\ndirection for large times than for the usual incompressible Navier-Stokes\nsystem in the Euclidean setting. Finally, using the structure of the system, we\nrecover the $\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ smoothness in the other directions by using\nthe analyticity in the vertical variable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
