While single-channel despeckling has widely\nbenefited from the application of deep learning techniques, extensions to\nmulti-channel SAR images are much more challenging.This paper introduces\nMuChaPro, a generic framework that exploits existing single-channel despeckling\nmethods. The key idea is to generate numerous single-channel projections,\nrestore these projections, and recombine them into the final multi-channel\nestimate. This simple approach is shown to be effective in polarimetric and/or\ninterferometric modalities. A special appeal of MuChaPro is the possibility to\napply a self-supervised training strategy to learn sensor-specific networks for\nsingle-channel despeckling.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
