This\npaper investigates how spin correlations can restore (\"resurrect\") the\ninterference contributions of the $\\tau$ lepton's anomalous dipole moment. We\nfirst illustrate the mechanism for this interference restoration using a simple\nquantum mechanical example. We then calculate the sensitivity of these spin\ncorrelations to new physics. Additionally, we compute quantum information\nobservables, namely measures of entanglement, Bell inequality violation, and\nthe irreducible quantum uncertainty of the $\\tau\\tau$ state. Our findings show\nthat spin correlation observables outperform both the cross-section and quantum\ninformation observables, by providing greater sensitivity to new physics and\npreserving information about $CP$ violation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
