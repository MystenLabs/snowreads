Fog computing\nemerges as a solution, bringing computation, storage, and networking closer to\ndata sources. This study explores the role of Deep Reinforcement Learning in\nenhancing fog computing's task offloading, aiming for operational efficiency\nand robust security. By reviewing current strategies and proposing future\nresearch directions, the paper shows the potential of Deep Reinforcement\nLearning in optimizing resource use, speeding up responses, and securing\nagainst vulnerabilities. It suggests advancing Deep Reinforcement Learning for\nfog computing, exploring blockchain for better security, and seeking\nenergy-efficient models to improve the Internet of Things ecosystem.\nIncorporating artificial intelligence, our results indicate potential\nimprovements in key metrics, such as task completion time, energy consumption,\nand security incident reduction. These findings provide a concrete foundation\nfor future research and practical applications in optimizing fog computing\narchitectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
