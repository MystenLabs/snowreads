Despite the\nadvancements in human face identification, the lack of datasets and benchmarks\nin the animal domain has impeded progress. In this paper, we introduce the\nPetFace dataset, a comprehensive resource for animal face identification\nencompassing 257,484 unique individuals across 13 animal families and 319 breed\ncategories, including both experimental and pet animals. This large-scale\ncollection of individuals facilitates the investigation of unseen animal face\nverification, an area that has not been sufficiently explored in existing\ndatasets due to the limited number of individuals. Moreover, PetFace also has\nfine-grained annotations such as sex, breed, color, and pattern. We provide\nmultiple benchmarks including re-identification for seen individuals and\nverification for unseen individuals. The models trained on our dataset\noutperform those trained on prior datasets, even for detailed breed variations\nand unseen animal families. Our result also indicates that there is some room\nto improve the performance of integrated identification on multiple animal\nfamilies. We hope the PetFace dataset will facilitate animal face\nidentification and encourage the development of non-invasive animal automatic\nidentification methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
