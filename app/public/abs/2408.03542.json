For this reason, we want to maximise\nthe production of Iberian pigs with the appropriate weight. Hence the need to\nknow the area covered by the crowns of the acorn trees, to determine the\ncovered wooded area (CWA, from the Spanish Superficie Arbolada Cubierta SAC)\nand thereby estimate the number of Iberian pigs that can be released per\nhectare, as indicated by the royal decree 4/2014. In this work, we propose the\nautomatic estimation of the CWA, through aerial digital images (orthophotos) of\nthe pastureland of Extremadura, and with this, to offer the possibility of\ndetermining the number of Iberian pigs to be released in a specific plot of\nland. Among the main issues for automatic detection are, first, the correct\nidentification of acorn trees, secondly, correctly discriminating the shades of\nthe acorn trees and, finally, detect the arbuscles (young acorn trees not yet\nproductive, or shrubs that are not oaks). These difficulties represent a real\nchallenge, both for the automatic segmentation process and for manual\nsegmentation. In this work, the proposed method for automatic segmentation is\nbased on the clustering algorithm proposed by Gustafson-Kessel (GK) but the\nmodified version of Babuska (GK-B) and on the use of real orthophotos. The\nobtained results are promising both in their comparison with the real images\nand when compared with the images segmented by hand. The whole set of\northophotos used in this work correspond to an approximate area of 142\nhectares, and the results are of great interest to producers of certified\n\"acorn\" pork.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
