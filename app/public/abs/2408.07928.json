Building on prior work\nin the zero temperature setting [Basu-Gang-Zhan'21], we address the time\ncorrelation problem with flat initial conditions in the positive temperature\nregime. Our study focuses on the inverse-gamma polymer, where we establish an\nupper bound for the correlation between two free energies whose endpoints are\nfar apart in time. In contrast to the previous work [Basu-Gang-Zhan'21], our\nwork not only extends the result to positive temperatures but also eliminates\nthe reliance on integrable probability inputs related to the Airy process. This\nadvancement allows us to address local scales, where the short time remains\nfixed while the large time grows arbitrarily, a scenario beyond the reach of\nthe Airy scaling limit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BNd6e7gGPDEr1iuj4F6zX2DHHXKRFK-2s8Rcu7WFO04","pdfSize":"244377"}
