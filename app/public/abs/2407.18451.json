Consequently, a plethora of neural\nnetwork-driven prediction models have been introduced in the literature to\nencompass these intricacies to accurately predict the agent behavior.\nNevertheless, many of these approaches falter when confronted with scenarios\nbeyond their training datasets, and lack interpretability, raising concerns\nabout their suitability for real-world applications such as autonomous driving.\nMoreover, these models frequently demand additional training, substantial\ncomputational resources, or specific input features necessitating extensive\nimplementation endeavors. In response, we propose Gaussian Lane Keeping (GLK),\na robust prediction method for autonomous vehicles that can provide a solid\nbaseline for comparison when developing new algorithms and a sanity check for\nreal-world deployment. We provide several extensions to the GLK model, evaluate\nit on the CitySim dataset, and show that it outperforms the neural-network\nbased predictions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
