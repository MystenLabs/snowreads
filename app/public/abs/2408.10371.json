Departure\nof the assumed cluster center from the true halo center bias the resultant\nprofile measurements, an effect known as miscentering bias. Currently,\nmiscentering is typically modeled in stacked profiles of clusters with a two\nparameter model. We use an alternate approach in which the profiles of\nindividual clusters are used with the corresponding likelihood computed using a\nGaussian mixture model. We test the approach using halos and the corresponding\nsubhalo profiles from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulations. We obtain\nsignificantly improved estimates of the miscentering parameters for both 3D and\nprojected 2D profiles relevant for imaging surveys. We discuss applications to\nupcoming cosmological surveys.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OpkNafLfrYRfUpXKjHIHl49OBbxSxNToREqHQ0KMjck","pdfSize":"729033"}
