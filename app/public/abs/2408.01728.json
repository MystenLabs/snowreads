We discussed 19\nresearch papers collected from selected journals and databases highlighting\ntheir methodology, classification algorithm, and the used datasets that relate\nto emotion recognition and pose estimation. A benchmark has been made according\nto their accuracy as it was the most common performance measurement metric\nused. We concluded that the multimodal Approaches overall made the best\naccuracy and then we mentioned futuristic concerns that can improve the\ndevelopment of this research topic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"tACQanXNPuAjKOY6z_E9MD_4hw3OVSrU_fVFDcJ4gXQ","pdfSize":"1181735"}
