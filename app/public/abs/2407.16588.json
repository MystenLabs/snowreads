The\nmaximum $k$-defective clique problem, which asks for the largest $k$-defective\nclique from the given graph, is important in many applications, such as social\nand biological network analysis. In the paper, we propose a new branching\nalgorithm that takes advantage of the structural properties of the\n$k$-defective clique and uses the efficient maximum clique algorithm as a\nsubroutine. As a result, the algorithm has a better asymptotic running time\nthan the existing ones. We also investigate upper-bounding techniques and\npropose a new upper bound utilizing the \\textit{conflict relationship} between\nvertex pairs. Because conflict relationship is common in many graph problems,\nwe believe that this technique can be potentially generalized. Finally,\nexperiments show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on a\nwide range of open benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
