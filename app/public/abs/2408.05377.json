In 2023, Xia introduced a deterministic\nversion of Defant and Kravitz's stack-sorting map by defining the\n$\\phi_{\\sigma}$ and $\\phi_{\\overline{\\sigma}}$ pattern-avoidance stack-sorting\nmaps for sock sequences. Xia showed that the $\\phi_{aba}$ map is the only one\nthat eventually sorts all set partitions; in this paper, we prove deeper\nresults regarding $\\phi_{aba}$ and $\\phi_{\\overline{aba}}$ as a natural next\nstep. We newly define two algorithms with time complexity $O(n^3)$ that\ndetermine if any given sock sequence is in the image of $\\phi_{aba}$ or\n$\\phi_{\\overline{aba}}$ respectively. We also show that the maximum number of\npreimages that a sock sequence of length $n$ has grows at least exponentially\nunder both the $\\phi_{aba}$ and $\\phi_{\\overline{aba}}$ maps. Additionally, we\nprove results regarding fertility numbers (introduced by Defant) in the context\nof set partitions and multiple-pattern-avoiding stacks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fVCYCe5bZ_elrO-Fo-pDVAJyaMkEYvyK4dzDjz37Flw","pdfSize":"403238"}
