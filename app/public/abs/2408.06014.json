In this work, we propose a\nnovel method of utilising a no-reference sharpness metric Q introduced by Zhu\nand Milanfar for removing out-of-focus blur from images. We also introduce a\nnovel dataset of real-world out-of-focus images for assessing restoration\nmodels. Our fine-tuned method produces images with a 7.5 % increase in\nperceptual quality (LPIPS) as compared to a standard model trained only on MAE.\nFurthermore, we observe a 6.7 % increase in Q (reflecting sharper restorations)\nand 7.25 % increase in PSNR over most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"NC69O39RdxUrETsjMK4dJMh8Gh0ESBR4q4lPLBVU86g","pdfSize":"3404554"}
