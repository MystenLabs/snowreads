After an invite-only period, it opened to the\npublic worldwide on February 6th, 2024. In this paper, we provide a\nlongitudinal analysis of user activity in the two months around the opening,\nstudying changes in the general characteristics of the platform due to the\nrapid growth of the user base. We observe a broad distribution of activity\nsimilar to more established platforms, but a higher volume of original than\nreshared content, and very low toxicity. After opening to the public, Bluesky\nexperienced a large surge in new users and activity, especially posting English\nand Japanese content. In particular, several accounts entered the discussion\nwith suspicious behavior, like following many accounts and sharing content from\nlow-credibility news outlets. Some of these have already been classified as\nspam or suspended, suggesting effective moderation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
