The challenge\narises due to the intrinsic dynamic structure of spacetime as established by\nthe general theory of relativity. With the discovery of the physical nature of\ninformation, which underpins Landauer's principle, we believe that information\ntheory should play a role in understanding this problem. In this work, we\ncontribute to this endeavor by considering a relativistic communication task\nbetween two partners, Alice and Bob, in a general Lorentzian spacetime. We then\nassume that the receiver, Bob, reversibly operates a local heat engine powered\nby information, and seek to determine the maximum amount of work he can extract\nfrom this device. Since Bob cannot extract work for free, by applying both\nLandauer's principle and the second law of thermodynamics, we establish a bound\non the energy Bob must spend to acquire the information in the first place.\nThis bound is a function of the spacetime metric and the properties of the\ncommunication channel.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"108hJwR3elXS5WiV74hmlOifNX_yNEKyCeG2OK_iVtc","pdfSize":"413937","objectId":"0xbaa4361c2e4c588751f403330a6b9f00e04a263132c3ac7069660c037d210f46","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
