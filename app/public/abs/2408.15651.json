We will examine three methods for pre-training (masked\nimage modeling, contrastive learning, and knowledge distillation), and assess\nthe performance on downstream action recognition tasks. As a result, online\npre-training with contrast learning showed the highest performance in\ndownstream tasks. Our findings suggest that learning from long-form videos can\nbe helpful for action recognition with short videos.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
