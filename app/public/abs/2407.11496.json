UGC is mostly acquired using consumer devices and undergoes multiple\nrounds of compression or transcoding before reaching the end user. Therefore,\ntraditional quality metrics that require the original content as a reference\ncannot be used. In this paper, we propose ReLaX-VQA, a novel No-Reference Video\nQuality Assessment (NR-VQA) model that aims to address the challenges of\nevaluating the diversity of video content and the assessment of its quality\nwithout reference videos. ReLaX-VQA uses fragments of residual frames and\noptical flow, along with different expressions of spatial features of the\nsampled frames, to enhance motion and spatial perception. Furthermore, the\nmodel enhances abstraction by employing layer-stacking techniques in deep\nneural network features (from Residual Networks and Vision Transformers).\nExtensive testing on four UGC datasets confirms that ReLaX-VQA outperforms\nexisting NR-VQA methods with an average SRCC value of 0.8658 and PLCC value of\n0.8872. We will open source the code and trained models to facilitate further\nresearch and applications of NR-VQA: https://github.com/xinyiW915/ReLaX-VQA.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4k2MivDReF3uvk5kJnkzdioiSSl3T5GPuPkS0qaKago","pdfSize":"14981732","objectId":"0xb31a249181715b8cc17c40b4cbc29151274348d92aa8c2e27ff95fd111905cdb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
