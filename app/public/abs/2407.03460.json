In this paper, we seek to understand how human players collaborate\nwith LLM-driven NPCs to accomplish in-game goals. We design a minigame within\nMinecraft where a player works with two GPT4-driven NPCs to complete a quest.\nWe perform a user study in which 28 Minecraft players play this minigame and\nshare their feedback. On analyzing the game logs and recordings, we find that\nseveral patterns of collaborative behavior emerge from the NPCs and the human\nplayers. We also report on the current limitations of language-only models that\ndo not have rich game-state or visual understanding. We believe that this\npreliminary study and analysis will inform future game developers on how to\nbetter exploit these rapidly improving generative AI models for collaborative\nroles in games.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
