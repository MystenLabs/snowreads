In this work, we develop the final-state rescattering mechanism to\nstudy the two-body non-leptonic decays of charmed baryons. The final-state\ninteraction is a physical picture of long-distance effects. Instead of using\nthe Cutkosky rule to calculate the hadronic triangle diagrams which can only\nprovide the imaginary part of decay amplitudes, we point out that the loop\nintegral is more appropriate, as both the real parts and the imaginary parts of\namplitudes can be calculated completely. In this way, it can be obtained for\nthe non-trivial strong phases which are essential to calculate CP violations.\nWith the physical picture of long-distance effects and the reasonable method of\ncalculations, it is amazingly achieved that all the nine existing experimental\ndata of branching fractions for the $\\Lambda_c^+$ decays into an octet light\nbaryon and a vector meson can be explained by only one parameter of the model.\nBesides, the decay asymmetries and CP violations are not sensitive to the model\nparameter, since the dependence on the parameter is mainly cancelled in the\nratios, so that the theoretical uncertainties on these observables are lowered\ndown.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
