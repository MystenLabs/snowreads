Particularly\nin the international trade, predicting trade amount is instrumental to industry\nand government in business decision making and determining economic policies.\nWhereas the gravity models well captures such interaction between objects, the\nmodel simplifies the interaction to extract essential relationships or needs\nhandcrafted features to drive the models. Recent studies indicate the\nconnection between graph neural networks (GNNs) and the gravity models in\ninternational trade. However, to our best knowledge, hardly any previous\nstudies in the this domain directly predicts trade amount by GNNs. We propose\nGGAE (Gravity-informed Graph Auto-encoder) and its surrogate model, which is\ninspired by the gravity model, showing trade amount prediction by the gravity\nmodel can be formulated as an edge weight prediction problem in GNNs and solved\nby GGAE and its surrogate model. Furthermore, we conducted experiments to\nindicate GGAE with GNNs can improve trade amount prediction compared to the\ntraditional gravity model by considering complex relationships.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
