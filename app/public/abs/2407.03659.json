Additionally,\nwe derive the law of the iterated logarithm for the center of mass\ncorresponding to a random sequence under a different strong approximation\ncondition. Applications to step-reinforced random walks are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
