However,\neffectively aligning LLMs with specific human groups and systematically\nassessing the fidelity of the alignment remains a challenge. This paper\npresents a robust framework for aligning LLMs with online communities via\ninstruction-tuning and comprehensively evaluating alignment across various\naspects of language, including authenticity, emotional tone, toxicity, and\nharm. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to online\ncommunities centered on dieting and body image. We administer an eating\ndisorder psychometric test to the aligned LLMs to reveal unhealthy beliefs and\nsuccessfully differentiate communities with varying levels of eating disorder\nrisk. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs in automated moderation and\nbroader applications in public health and social science research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
