In\ntypical ferromagnets, $\\vec{M}_{\\rm SR}$ is a good approximation to the total\norbital magnetization. We compute the current-induced $\\vec{M}_{\\rm SR}$ for a\nPt thin film and compare it to the current-induced orbital moment accumulation\ncalculated with the atom-centered approximation (ACA). We find significant\ndifferences: the size of $\\vec{M}_{\\rm SR}$ is, in general, larger than the ACA\norbital moment accumulation by an order of magnitude and includes substantial\nfinite-size effects. The differences between the two quantities caution against\ninterpreting optical measurements with models utilizing the ACA. Finally, we\ncompute the total $\\vec{M}_{\\rm SR}$ and ACA orbital moment accumulation as a\nfunction of layer thickness. For both quantities, the length scale at which the\ntotal surface accumulation saturates is on the order of the mean free path and\nlonger than the length scale of their spatial profiles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9fRQiIdbEv8QLYMydtgyZ9ghRi0h7v8urGM1TYUB1DM","pdfSize":"3257172"}
