Prompt and precise diagnosis, coupled with effective treatment, is\nimperative to reduce the fatality rates associated with this formidable\ndisease. This study introduces a cutting-edge deep learning framework for the\nclassification of lung cancer from CT scan imagery. The research encompasses a\nsuite of image pre-processing strategies, notably Canny edge detection, and\nwavelet transformations, which precede the extraction of salient features and\nsubsequent classification via a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The optimization\nprocess is further refined using the Dragonfly Algorithm (DA). The methodology\nput forth has attained an impressive training and testing accuracy of 99.82\\%,\nunderscoring its efficacy and reliability in the accurate diagnosis of lung\ncancer.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EAWOvnhEaJu_oR2DdfSj9HGCJdhmah7YtXrruIpu4lU","pdfSize":"3619864"}
