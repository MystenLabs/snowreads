Our approach leverages a\ncomprehensive characterization of blowing-up solutions of a subcritical\napproximation, along with various Morse relations involving their indices.\nNotably, this multiplicity result is achieved without relying on any symmetry\nor periodicity assumptions about the function $K$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
