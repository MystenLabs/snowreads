However,\nlow utilization for single GPUs defies the need to invest more money for\nexpensive ccelerators. While related work develops optimizations for improving\napplication performance, none studies how these optimizations impact hardware\nresource usage or the average GPU utilization. This paper takes a data-driven\nanalysis approach in addressing this gap by (1) characterizing how hardware\nresource usage affects device utilization, execution time, or both, (2)\npresenting a multi-objective metric to identify important application-device\ninteractions that can be optimized to improve device utilization and\napplication performance jointly, (3) studying hardware resource usage behaviors\nof several optimizations for a benchmark application, and finally (4)\nidentifying optimization opportunities for several scientific proxy\napplications based on their hardware resource usage behaviors. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the applicability of our methodology by applying the identified\noptimizations to a proxy application, which improves the execution time, device\nutilization and power consumption by up to 29.6%, 5.3% and 26.5% respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
