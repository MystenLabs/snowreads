Yet, the theoretical principles explaining how the\nphysical architecture of the nervous system shapes its function remain elusive.\nHere, we combine concepts from quantum statistical mechanics and graph\nC*-algebras to introduce a theoretical framework where functional states of a\nstructural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the underlying\ndirected network. These equilibrium states, defined from the\nKubo-Martin-Schwinger states formalism (KMS states), quantify the relative\ncontribution of each neuron to the information flow within the connectome.\nUsing the prototypical connectome of the nematode {\\em Caenorhabditis elegans},\nwe provide a comprehensive description of these KMS states, explore their\nfunctional implications, and establish the predicted functional network based\non the nervous system's anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, we present a model\nfor identifying the potential functional states of a detailed structural\nconnectome and for conceptualizing the structure-function relationship.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BhSorge7iekUTonqH2Mc635Tysq9xoPxWczEKzCP1lE","pdfSize":"5083030"}
