At\nits core, it requires analytically constructing an ellipse-polytope\nintersection. The main novelty of this paper is an algorithm that computes this\nintersection in $\\mathcal{O}(m \\log m)$ time, where $m$ is the number of linear\ninequality constraints representing the polytope. We show that an\nimplementation based on this algorithm enhances numerical stability, speeds up\nrunning time, and is easy to parallelize for launching multiple Markov chains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mWLAyqoMpZ5UW3-6XJ0NkpnhUPNEfJAgT-94iRT3Ses","pdfSize":"634652"}
