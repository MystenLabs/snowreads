The development of the charged vector hair\nnecessarily removes the inner Cauchy horizon and results in an anisotropic\nblack hole ending at a spacelike singularity. The far interior evolution is\ncharacterized by the chaotic alternations among different Kasner epochs. We\nshow that those late interior time dynamics of bounces and epochs can be\ncaptured analytically. In particular, we obtain three distinct types of\ntransformation laws for the alternation of Kasner epochs analytically,\nincluding the Kasner inversion, Kasner transition, and Kasner reflection. Our\nanalytical approach is corroborated by numerical solutions to the full\nequations of motion. Moreover, we provide a clear explanation of the\nalternation of Kasner epochs found numerically in the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
