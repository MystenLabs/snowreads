An efficient MEP strategy can therefore increase the size of the\nnetwork region where bipartite entanglement based quantum information\nprocessing tasks can be implemented. Here, we analyse MEP in a general model of\na quantum network and obtain design criteria for efficient MEP strategies.\nFurther, by simulating two different MEP strategies, based on these criteria,\non different underlying network topologies we explore how the topology\ndetermines the effectiveness of a fixed MEP strategy. Finally, we show that a\ncareful choice of MEP strategy can make the entanglement connection strength\nbetween source-destination network nodes effectively independent of its\ntopology. Our results can therefore provide a useful guide for the design of\nquantum networks and entanglement distribution protocols.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
