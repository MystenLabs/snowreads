While\ncombinator-based languages or libraries provide a convenient interface for\nprogramming parallel hardware, fusing combinators to more complex operations is\nessential to achieve the desired performance. Our approach is not only suitable\nfor languages with the usual map, fold, scan, indexing and scatter operations,\nbut also gather operations, which access arrays in arbitrary order, and\ntherefore goes beyond the traditional producer-consumer fusion. It can be\nparametrised with appropriate cost functions, and is fast enough to be suitable\nfor just-in-time compilation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
