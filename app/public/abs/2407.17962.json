The\ncoalescence of nucleons is a well-known mechanism that attempts to explain the\nproduction mechanism of these light clusters. This work investigates the\nformation mechanism of these nucleon clusters with a combination of coalescence\nand femtoscopy of nucleons and nuclei. It is achieved by appending a\ncoalescence and correlation afterburner (\\texttt{CRAB}) to the \\texttt{SMASH}\ntransport model. To have a proper view of the anisotropy of light nuclei\nclusters, a mean-field approach to \\texttt{SMASH} is applied. The anisotropic\ncoefficients of various light nuclei clusters are calculated and compared to\nexperimental measurements. To incorporate hydrodynamics into the picture, the\nanisotropic measurements are completed in a hybrid\n\\texttt{SMASH}+\\texttt{vHLLE} mode. In both approaches, the femtoscopy of\nnucleons and light nuclei is performed, reported with CRAB, and compared to the\nlatest experimental measurements. An insight into cluster formation time is\ndrawn by extracting the emission source size with the Lednick\\'y-Lyuboshits\n(LL) model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
