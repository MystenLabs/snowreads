In\nthe conventional online model of irrevocable decisions, there is an Omega(n)\nlower bound on the competitive ratio, even for randomized algorithms [Bachmann\net al. 2013]. In a line of work that allows for revocable acceptances, [Faigle\nand Nawijn 1995] gave a greedy 1-competitive (i.e. optimal) algorithm in the\nreal-time model, where intervals arrive in order of non-decreasing starting\ntimes. The natural extension of their algorithm in the adversarial (any-order)\nmodel is 2k-competitive [Borodin and Karavasilis 2023], when there are at most\nk different interval lengths, and that is optimal for all deterministic, and\nmemoryless randomized algorithms. We study this problem in the random-order\nmodel, where the adversary chooses the instance, but the online sequence is a\nuniformly random permutation of the items. We consider the same algorithm that\nis optimal in the cases of the real-time and any-order models, and give an\nupper bound of 2.5 on the competitive ratio under random-order arrivals.\n  We also show how to utilize random-order arrivals to extract a random bit\nwith a worst case bias of 2/3, when there are at least two distinct item types.\nWe use this bit to derandomize the barely random algorithm of [Fung et al.\n2014] and get a deterministic 3-competitive algorithm for single-length\ninterval selection with arbitrary weights.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
