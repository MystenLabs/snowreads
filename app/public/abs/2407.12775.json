We focus on foreign-born persons\nfrom countries that are heavily Hispanic and from countries in the Middle East\nand North Africa (MENA). We find substantial heterogeneity of long-term\nearnings differentials within country of birth, some of which will be difficult\nto detect when the reporting format changes from the current two-question\nversion to the new single-question version because they depend on\nself-identifications that place the individual in two distinct categories\nwithin the single-question format, specifically, Hispanic and White or Black,\nand MENA and White or Black. We also study the USA-born children of these same\nimmigrants. Long-term earnings differences for the 2nd generation also vary as\na function of self-identified ethnicity and race in ways that changing to the\nsingle-question format could affect.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
