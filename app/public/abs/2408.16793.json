Obtaining mass measurements for these planets is\nchallenging due to stellar activity and noisy spectra. Therefore, we aim to\nprovide independent theoretical constraints on the masses of these young\nplanets based on their radii, incident fluxes, and ages, benchmarking to the\nplanets of age $<$1 Gyr detected by Kepler, K2 and TESS. Through a combination\nof interior structure models, considerations of photoevaporative mass loss, and\nempirical mass-metallicity trends, we present the range of possible masses for\n24 planets of age $\\sim$10-900 Myr and radii $\\sim$6-16 R$_\\oplus$. We\ngenerally find that our mass estimates are in agreement with the measured\nmasses and upper limits where applicable. There exist some outliers including\nsuper-puffs Kepler-51 b, c and V1298 Tau d, b, e, for which we outline their\nlikely formation conditions. Our analyses demonstrate that most of the youngest\nplanets ($\\lesssim$ 100 Myr) tend to be puffed-up, Neptune-mass planets, while\nthe true hot Jupiters are typically found around stars aged at least a few\nhundred Myr, suggesting the dominant origin of hot Jupiters to be late-stage\nhigh eccentricity migration.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
