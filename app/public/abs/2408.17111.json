Another missing piece of the Standard Model is dark\nmatter, which can also be superheavy provided that the particle lifetime is\nanomalously long, i.e. greater than $\\simeq 10^{22}~$yr. Relying on two\nvariants of the seesaw framework, and assuming slight mixing in the\nright-handed neutrino sector, we show that the resulting Majorana mass\neigenstates with mass $M_X$ can be dark matter candidates provided that the\nmass mixing parameter $\\delta M$ satisfies approximately $\\delta M\\lesssim\n2\\times 10^{-17}/[M_X/(10^9~\\mathrm{GeV})]^{0.5}$~GeV for $M_X\\gtrsim\n10^9$~GeV. Some implications in the context of inflationary cosmologies are\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
