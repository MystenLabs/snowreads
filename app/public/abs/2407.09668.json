Exploiting such corrections, we get approximate expressions for the\nexchange $E_{x}\\left[ n_{\\sigma e} \\right] $ and the correlation $E_{c}\\left[\nn_{\\sigma e}\\right] $ functional energies which could be interpreted in terms\nof magnetic and electric dipole potential energies associated with the charge\ndensity $n_{\\sigma e}\\left( r\\right) $ described by inverse-square potential\nbehaviors. Based on these arguments, we expect that such obtained\nExchange-Correlation functional energy could be considered in the Local Density\nApproximation functional as an extension to frame such interelectronic effects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
