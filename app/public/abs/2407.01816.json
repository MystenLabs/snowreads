Let $\\widetilde{\\zeta}^{-\\rho}$ be the extinction time of\nthis subcritical branching killed Brownian motion, $\\widetilde{M}_t^{-\\rho}$\nthe maximal position of all the particles alive at time $t$ and\n$\\widetilde{M}^{-\\rho}:=\\max_{t\\ge 0}\\widetilde{M}_t^{-\\rho}$ the all time\nmaximal position. Let $\\mathbb{P}_x$ be the law of this subcritical branching\nkilled Brownian motion when the initial particle is located at $x\\in\n(0,\\infty)$. Under the assumption $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty k (\\log k) p_k <\\infty$,\nwe establish the decay rates of $\\mathbb{P}_x(\\widetilde{\\zeta}^{-\\rho}>t)$ and\n$\\mathbb{P}_x(\\widetilde{M}^{-\\rho}>y)$ as $t$ and $y$ tend to $\\infty$\nrespectively. We also establish the decay rate of\n$\\mathbb{P}_x(\\widetilde{M}_t^{-\\rho}>z(t,\\rho))$ as $t\\to\\infty$, where\n$z(t,\\rho)=\\sqrt{t}z-\\rho t$ for $\\rho\\leq 0$ and $z(t,\\rho)=z$ for $\\rho>0$.\nAs a consequence, we obtain a Yaglom-type limit theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
