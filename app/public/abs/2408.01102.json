Large language models (LLMs) can ease this process by\ngenerating adaptive content for lesson plans, which would otherwise require\nteachers to create from scratch or search existing resources. In this work, we\nfirst conduct a formative study with six novice teachers to understand their\nneeds for support of preparing lesson plans with LLMs. Then, we develop\nLessonPlanner that assists users to interactively construct lesson plans with\nadaptive LLM-generated content based on Gagne's nine events. Our\nwithin-subjects study (N=12) shows that compared to the baseline ChatGPT\ninterface, LessonPlanner can significantly improve the quality of outcome\nlesson plans and ease users' workload in the preparation process. Our expert\ninterviews (N=6) further demonstrate LessonPlanner's usefulness in suggesting\neffective teaching strategies and meaningful educational resources. We discuss\nconcerns on and design considerations for supporting teaching activities with\nLLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OFRDZliMANDODjbaj2JaflFu-VO0nBmfl8dVMCDTmCg","pdfSize":"4622561"}
