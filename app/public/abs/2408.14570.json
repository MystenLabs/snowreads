As widely documented in other deformation models, one finds\nthat the effective mass of the nucleus changes with the deformation parameter.\nHowever, contrary to the approach used in literature, a position-dependant mass\npotentially makes using WKB tunneling probabilities unreliable for estimating\nnuclear lifetimes. We instead use a new approach, a combination of the\nTransmission Matrix and WKB methods, to estimate tunneling probabilities.\nBecause of the simplistic nature of the model, the calculated lifetimes are not\naccurate, however, the relative trends in the lifetimes of isotopes of\nindividual nuclei are found to be consistent. Using this, we develop an\nempirical scaling to obtain the actual half-lives, and find the primary scaling\nparameter to have remarkably consistent values for all nuclei considered. The\nnew tunneling method proposed here, which produces very different probabilities\nas compared to the usual WKB approach, is another key result of this work, and\ncan be utilized for arbitrary potentials and mass variations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gXoIebLYzfJkslRZFZiHdn3RjZZamSMnPOvfFFb5bls","pdfSize":"491243"}
