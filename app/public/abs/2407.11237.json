However, a comprehensive description of non-equilibrium\nphenomena still presents a significant challenge. In this work, we report the\nobservation of distinct stages during the relaxation of the decaying turbulence\nin trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. Our findings show a direct particle\ncascade from low to high momenta, a consequence of the energy injection in the\nsystem, exhibiting a characteristic universal scaling. This stage is followed\nby an inverse particle cascade responsible for repopulating the previously\ndepleted condensate. Both cascades can be explained through self-similar\nsolutions provided by wave turbulence theory. These findings provide important\ninsights into the relaxation stages of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
