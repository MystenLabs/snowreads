With\nagents' initial opinions uniformly distributed on the unit interval, we provide\na straightforward proof that establishes the critical value is up to one-half.\nThis implies that the probability of consensus approaches one as the number of\nagents tends to infinity for confidence thresholds larger than or equal to\none-half.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
