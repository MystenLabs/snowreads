Utilizing recent measurements from BESIII, Belle and\nBelle~II experiments, we conduct a comprehensive global analysis to estimate\nthe contribution of topological diagrams in these processes. Our study reveals\nthat topological diagrams alone cannot fully account for the experimental data.\nBy incorporating new effects that are not included in traditional topological\ndiagrams and exploring the possible source of the new effect, our analysis\nreveals the potential for significant CP violation in $\\Lambda_c^+\\to n \\pi^+$\nand $\\Xi_c^+\\to \\Xi^0 K^+$. This suggests a promising opportunity to observe CP\nviolation for the first time in charmed baryon decays.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
