However, given their generalization\ncapability, it is difficult to ensure that these chatbots stay within the\nboundaries of the specialized domains, potentially resulting in inaccurate\ninformation and irrelevant responses. This paper introduces an unsupervised\napproach for automatically inducing domain-specific dialog flows that can be\nused to constrain LLM-based chatbots. We introduce two variants of dialog flow\nbased on the availability of in-domain conversation instances. Through human\nand automatic evaluation over various dialog domains, we demonstrate that our\nhigh-quality data-guided dialog flows achieve better domain coverage, thereby\novercoming the need for extensive manual crafting of such flows.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
