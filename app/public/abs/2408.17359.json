Surprisingly,\nmuch less effort has been devoted to adequately describing the first step of a\nphotochemical or photophysical process: photoexcitation. Here, we propose a\nformalism to include the effect of a laser pulse in trajectory-based\nnonadiabatic dynamics at the level of the initial conditions, with no\nadditional cost. The promoted density approach (PDA) decouples the excitation\nfrom the nonadiabatic dynamics by defining a new set of initial conditions,\nwhich include an excitation time. PDA with surface hopping leads to\nnonadiabatic dynamics simulations in excellent agreement with quantum dynamics\nusing an explicit laser pulse and highlights the strong impact of a laser pulse\non the resulting photodynamics and the limits of the (sudden) vertical\nexcitation. Combining PDA with trajectory-based nonadiabatic methods is\npossible for any arbitrary-sized molecules using a code provided in this work.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nnQ8b937is3eZj5kXoSB90UflVT09ysYPQeU0aG6ghs","pdfSize":"7029211"}
