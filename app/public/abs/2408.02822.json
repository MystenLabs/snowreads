That is, the Park-Pham theorem\nasserts that $p_c(\\mathcal{F})\\leq Kq(\\mathcal{F})\\log\\ell(\\mathcal{F})$. Since\nthe critical probability $p_c(\\mathcal{F})$ always satisfies\n$p_c(\\mathcal{F})<1$, one may ask when the upper bound posed by Kahn and Kalai\ngives us more information than this--that is, when is it true that\n$Kq(\\mathcal{F})\\log\\ell(\\mathcal{F}) < 1$? There are many situations where\nthis occurs, as well as many situations where this is not the case. In this\nshort note, we provide a number of necessary conditions for this to happen\ntogether with some easy-to-compute conditions that are sufficient to ensure it.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iaPK2xzb99Tl0-mjmNHjQ9zGH6mfaOj79sIthR1lPGs","pdfSize":"154152"}
