Traditional kernel-based methods, despite their theoretical\nsoundness and numerical efficiency, frequently struggle with selecting optimal\nbase kernels and parameter tuning, especially with gradient-based methods prone\nto local optima. KSOS mitigates these issues by leveraging a global\noptimization framework with kernel-based surrogate functions, thereby achieving\nmore reliable and precise learning of dynamical systems. Through comprehensive\nnumerical experiments on the Logistic Map, Henon Map, and Lorentz System, KSOS\nis shown to consistently outperform gradient descent in minimizing the\nrelative-$\\rho$ metric and improving kernel accuracy. These results highlight\nKSOS's effectiveness in predicting the behavior of chaotic dynamical systems,\ndemonstrating its capability to adapt kernels to underlying dynamics and\nenhance the robustness and predictive power of kernel-based approaches, making\nit a valuable asset for time series analysis in various scientific fields.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9nw4t-yg9XcIc7uzi6pv3x7plXJtgNRjhdTLMRC1tyw","pdfSize":"1420126"}
