In the recent past, sum\nuncertainty relation was formulated by Maccone and Pati [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113,\n260401 (2014)] which is claimed to be stronger than the existing\nHeisenberg-Robertson product uncertainty relation for the set of two\nincompatible observables. We deduce a different sum uncertainty relation that\nis weaker than the previous but necessary and sufficient to define MUS for sum\nuncertainty relations. We claim that the MUS for the sum uncertainty relation\nis always the MUS for the traditional product uncertainty relation. This means\nthat the definition of squeezed states remains completely unaffected by the\nstronger sum uncertainty relation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
