While\nmechanistic models might describe the interactions of interest of a system,\nthey are often difficult to study. On the other hand, abstract models might\ncapture key features but remain disconnected from experimental manipulation.\nGeometric methods have been useful in connecting both approaches, although they\nhave only been established for specific type of systems. Phenomena of\nbiological relevance, such as limit cycles, are still difficult to study using\nconventional methods. In this paper, I explore an alternative description of\nplanar dynamical systems and I present an algorithm to compute numerically the\ngeometric structure of planar systems with a limit cycle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
