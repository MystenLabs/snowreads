We introduce a new corpus created by annotating Wikipedia talk pages\nwith face acts and we use this to train a face act tagger. We then employ our\nframework to study how face and politeness interact with gender and power in\ndiscussions between Wikipedia editors. Among other findings, we observe that\nfemale Wikipedians are not only more polite, which is consistent with prior\nstudies, but that this difference corresponds with significantly more language\ndirected at humbling aspects of their own face. Interestingly, the distinction\nnearly vanishes once limiting to editors with administrative power.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
