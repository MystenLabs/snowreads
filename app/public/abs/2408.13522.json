Most\nexisting spatial auditory attention decoding (Sp-AAD) methods employ an\nisolated window architecture, focusing solely on global invariant features\nwithout considering relationships between different decision windows, which can\nlead to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nstreaming decoding architecture, termed StreamAAD. In StreamAAD, decision\nwindows are input to the network as a sequential stream and decoded in order,\nallowing for the modeling of inter-window relationships. Additionally, we\nemploy a model ensemble strategy, achieving significant better performance than\nthe baseline, ranking First in the challenge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
