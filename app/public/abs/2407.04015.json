However the hybridization of these technologies\nrequires functional quantum transducers for converting superconducting qubits\ninto \"flying\" qubits able to propagate through the network (and vice-versa). In\nthis paper, quantum transduction is theoretically investigated for a key\nfunctionality of the Quantum Internet, namely, multipartite entanglement\ndistribution. Different communication models for quantum transduction are\nprovided, in order to make the entanglement distribution possible. The proposed\nmodels departs from the large heterogeneity of hardware solutions available in\nliterature, abstracting from the particulars of the specific solutions with a\ncommunication engineering perspective. Then, a performance analysis of the\nproposed models is conducted through key communication metrics, such as quantum\ncapacity and entanglement generation probability. The analysis reveals that --\nalthough the considered communication metrics depend on transduction hardware\nparameters for all the proposed models -- the particulars of the considered\ntransduction paradigm play a relevant role in the overall entanglement\ndistribution performance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
