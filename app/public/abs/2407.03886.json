In recent years, deep learning-based IQA methods have shown\npromising performance. However, the lack of large amounts of labeled data in\nthe IQA field has hindered further advancements in these methods. This paper\nintroduces DSMix, a novel data augmentation technique specifically designed for\nIQA tasks, aiming to overcome this limitation. DSMix leverages the\ndistortion-induced sensitivity map (DSM) of an image as prior knowledge. It\napplies cut and mix operations to diverse categories of synthetic distorted\nimages, assigning confidence scores to class labels based on the aforementioned\nprior knowledge. In the pre-training phase using DSMix-augmented data,\nknowledge distillation is employed to enhance the model's ability to extract\nsemantic features. Experimental results on both synthetic and authentic IQA\ndatasets demonstrate the significant predictive and generalization performance\nachieved by DSMix, without requiring fine-tuning of the full model.
