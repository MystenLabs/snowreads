However, past works assume\nthat each arm knows their preference ranking over the players (one-sided\nlearning), and each player aim to learn the preference over arms through\nsuccessive interactions. Moreover, several (impractical) assumptions on the\nproblem are usually made for theoretical tractability such as broadcast\nplayer-arm match Liu et al. (2020; 2021); Kong & Li (2023) or serial\ndictatorship Sankararaman et al. (2021); Basu et al. (2021); Ghosh et al.\n(2022). In this paper, we study a decentralized two-sided matching market,\nwhere we do not assume that the preference ranking over players are known to\nthe arms apriori. Furthermore, we do not have any structural assumptions on the\nproblem. We propose a multi-phase explore-then-commit type algorithm namely\nepoch-based CA-ETC (collision avoidance explore then commit) (\\texttt{CA-ETC}\nin short) for this problem that does not require any communication across\nagents (players and arms) and hence decentralized. We show that for the initial\nepoch length of $T_{\\circ}$ and subsequent epoch-lengths of $2^{l/\\gamma}\nT_{\\circ}$ (for the $l-$th epoch with $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$ as an input parameter\nto the algorithm), \\texttt{CA-ETC} yields a player optimal expected regret of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(T_{\\circ} (\\frac{K \\log T}{T_{\\circ} \\Delta^2})^{1/\\gamma} +\nT_{\\circ} (\\frac{T}{T_{\\circ}})^\\gamma\\right)$ for the $i$-th player, where $T$\nis the learning horizon, $K$ is the number of arms and $\\Delta$ is an\nappropriately defined problem gap. Furthermore, we propose a blackboard\ncommunication based baseline achieving logarithmic regret in $T$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
