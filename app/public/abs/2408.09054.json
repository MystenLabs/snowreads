The analysis demonstrates how discrete urban clusters have developed\ninto integrated regional entities, delineating the pivotal distance thresholds\nthat regulate these urban transitions. The study reveals the interconnections\nbetween disparate urban clusters, shaped by their functional differentiation\nand historical development. Furthermore, the study identifies a dichotomy of\nurban agglomeration forces and a persistent spatial disconnection between\nAustralia's wider urban landscape. This highlights the interplay between urban\ndensification and peripheral growth. It suggests the need for new thinking on\npotential integrated governance structures that bridge urban development with\nbroader social and economic policies across regional and national scales.\nAdditionally, the study emphasises the growing importance of national\ncoordination in Australian urban development planning to ensure regional\nconsistency, equity, and productivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Applied Physics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9gWmYV_1b2Z1cBgGeKDSJ2G4O_cN9tNV0msuzKGeuUI","pdfSize":"18079574"}
