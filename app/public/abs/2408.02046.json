In particular,\nwe focus on the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ case with isotropic couplings, which is\ncharacterized by an exact $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ one-form symmetry. Guided by symmetry\nconsiderations and an analytical study in the single chain limit, on the\ninfinitely long cylinders, we find the model is gapped with an extremely short\ncorrelation length. Combined with the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ one-form symmetry, this\nsuggests the model is topologically ordered. To pin down the nature of this\nphase, we further study the model on both finite and infinitely long strips,\nwhere we consistently find a $c=1$ conformal field theory (CFT) description,\nsuggesting the existence of chiral edge modes described by a free boson CFT.\nFurther evidence is found by studying the dimer correlators on infinitely long\nstrips. We find the dimer correlation functions show a power-law decay with the\nexponent close to 2 on the boundary of the strip, while decay much faster in\nthe bulk. Combined with the topological entanglement entropy extracted from\ncylinder geometry, we identify the spin liquid is chiral and supports a\n$\\mathrm{U}(1)_{-8}$ chiral topological order. A unified perspective for all\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ type Kitaev models is also discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
