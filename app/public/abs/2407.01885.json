Despite their impressive performance, the substantial size and\ncomputational demands of LLMs pose considerable challenges for practical\ndeployment, particularly in environments with limited resources. The endeavor\nto compress language models while maintaining their accuracy has become a focal\npoint of research. Among the various methods, knowledge distillation has\nemerged as an effective technique to enhance inference speed without greatly\ncompromising performance. This paper presents a thorough survey from three\naspects: method, evaluation, and application, exploring knowledge distillation\ntechniques tailored specifically for LLMs. Specifically, we divide the methods\ninto white-box KD and black-box KD to better illustrate their differences.\nFurthermore, we also explored the evaluation tasks and distillation effects\nbetween different distillation methods, and proposed directions for future\nresearch. Through in-depth understanding of the latest advancements and\npractical applications, this survey provides valuable resources for\nresearchers, paving the way for sustained progress in this field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
