Its\ntransition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature\nscale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion\nthat electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of\nintermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires\nthat an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered\ntogether. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which experience quantum\nfluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular\norbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band' natural\ntendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we\nlink this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore,\nthe competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost.\nThe corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity.\nBroader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms\nare discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
