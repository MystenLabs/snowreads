However, the existence of PDW in\nmicroscopic models has been rare. In this work, we obtain, by Ginzburg-Landau\narguments and self-consistent mean field theory, novel $2a_0\\times2a_0$ PDW on\nthe kagome lattice arising from attractive on-bond pairing interactions and the\ndistinct Bloch wave functions near the p-type van Hove singularity. The PDW\nstate carrying three independent wave-vectors, the so-called 3Q PDW, is\nnodeless and falls into two topological classes characterized by the Chern\nnumber $C = 0$ or $C = \\pm2$. The chiral ($C=\\pm2$) PDW state presents a rare\ncase of interaction driven topological quantum state without the requirement of\nspin-orbit coupling. Finally, we analyze the stabilities and properties of\nthese PDWs intertwining with charge orders, and discuss the relevance of our\nminimal model to recent experimental observations in kagome superconductors.\nOur theory not only elucidates the driving force of the chiral PDW, but also\npredicts strongly anisotropic superconducting gap structure in the momentum\nspace and quantized transverse thermal conductivity that can be tested in\nfuture experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
