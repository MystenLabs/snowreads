The emerging multi-level\ncompiler infrastructure MLIR ( Multi-level Intermediate Representation ) allows\nto specify optimizations at higher level. In this paper, we utilize MLIR\nframework to introduce a DSP Dialect and perform domain-specific optimizations\nat dialect -level ( high-level ) and show the usefulness of these optimizations\non sample DSP apps. In particular, we develop a compiler for DSP and a DSL\n(Domain Specific Language) to ease the development of apps. We show the\nperformance improvement in execution time for these sample apps by upto 10x\nwhich would have been difficult if the IR were at C/ affine level.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
