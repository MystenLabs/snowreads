After some necessary\npreliminaries on homology and persistence diagrams, we introduce five different\nkernels that are then used to compare their performances of classification on\nvarious datasets. We also provide the Python codes for the reproducibility of\nresults.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"DFNXacNyEYqiRqGqxWqOqSNSP7dhXrosQ43yaKt3k14","pdfSize":"1100280"}
