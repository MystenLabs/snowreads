However, most stars in the Milky Way are disk stars. Disk stars\nhave almost lost their spatial distribution and kinematic features at birth,\nretaining solely chemical signatures. Identifying such substructures using\nabundances of iron or light elements is difficult due to their high degeneracy.\nHeavy elements, especially neutron capture elements have limited sources so\nhave lower degeneracy, but spectral line fitting of these elements is tough,\nrequiring mid to high resolution spectra, which are currently limited in sample\nsize. This work utilizes the overall effect of changing in abundances to\nintroduce the information of heavy elements, especially neutron capture\nelements to weaken the degeneracy of [Fe/H]. The analysis suggests the presence\nof at least 12 clusters, proves that the Galactic Disk form hierarchically. We\nexcluded giants to prevent the possibly impact of mixing effects and that of\ntoo large differences in surface gravity, so the conclusions were all drawn\nfrom the solar neighborhood.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
