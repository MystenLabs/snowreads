Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory\n(SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in\nthese setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are\nsymmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially\ngapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by\nnow well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge\ntheories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an\nobstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not\nsuffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize\n1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases.The SymTFT\napproach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to\nnon-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as\nwell. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples\nrealizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at\nthe level of symmetric deformations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
