Analyzing large-scale, typically unstructured, multi-modal, time\nseries data obtained from video, radar, and LiDAR is computationally demanding,\nparticularly when meta-information or annotations are missing. We compare\nOptical Flow (OF) and Deep Learning (DL) to feed computationally efficient\nevent detection via space-filling curves on video data from a forward-facing,\nin-vehicle camera. Our first approach leverages unexpected disturbances in the\nOF field from vehicle surroundings; the second approach is a DL model trained\non human visual attention to predict a driver's gaze to spot potential event\nlocations. We feed these results to a space-filling curve to reduce\ndimensionality and achieve computationally efficient event retrieval. We\nsystematically evaluate our concept by obtaining characteristic patterns for\nboth approaches from a large-scale virtual dataset (SMIRK) and applied our\nfindings to the Zenseact Open Dataset (ZOD), a large multi-modal, real-world\ndataset, collected over two years in 14 different European countries. Our\nresults yield that the OF approach excels in specificity and reduces false\npositives, while the DL approach demonstrates superior sensitivity. Both\napproaches offer comparable processing speed, making them suitable for\nreal-time applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
