For the first three topics, we primarily review research\nin the past five years, updating and expanding on the previous survey by\nShiebler et al.. The fourth topic, which delves into higher category theory,\nparticularly topos theory, is surveyed for the first time in this paper. In\ncertain machine learning methods, the compositionality of functors plays a\nvital role, prompting the development of specific categorical frameworks.\nHowever, when considering how the global properties of a network reflect in\nlocal structures and how geometric properties are expressed with logic, the\ntopos structure becomes particularly significant and profound.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
