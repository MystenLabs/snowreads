In this paper, we find the\nanalytical solution of a three-layer network with a matrix exponential\nactivation function, i.e., $$ f(X)=W_3\\exp(W_2\\exp(W_1X)), X\\in\n\\mathbb{C}^{d\\times d} $$ have analytical solutions for the equations $$\n  Y_1=f(X_1),Y_2=f(X_2) $$ for $X_1,X_2,Y_1,Y_2$ with only invertible\nassumptions. Our proof shows the power of depth and the use of a non-linear\nactivation function, since one layer network can only solve one\nequation,i.e.,$Y=WX$.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
