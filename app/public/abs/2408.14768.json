While an ultrabright source can overcome\nsignificant losses in satellite-based QKD (SQKD) and increase the sifted key\nrate, it also induces the multi-photon effect, raising the system's error rate.\nTo accurately estimate system performance, we first present an analytical model\nfor calculating the measurement probabilities of HBEPP distribution through an\nasymmetric loss channel. Based on this model, we propose the use of a\npassive-intensity HBEPP source for SQKD systems, assuming a\npolarization-independent channel and threshold detectors for measurement. We\nconfirm that fixing the mean photon number at $\\bar{\\mu}=0.1$ achieves a\nperformance of $99.7\\%$ compared to the ideal one-way communication\nentanglement-based SQKD protocol, which is effectively optimizing the HBEPP\nsource brightness in accordance with system losses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
