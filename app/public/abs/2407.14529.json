CPS integrates physical and software\ncomponents capable of sensing, monitoring, and controlling physical assets and\nprocesses. However, developing distributed and scalable CPSs that efficiently\nhandle large volumes of data while ensuring high performance and reliability\nremains a challenging task. Moreover, existing commercial solutions are often\ncostly and not suitable for certain applications, limiting developers and\nresearchers in experimenting and deploying CPSs on a larger scale. The\ndevelopment of this project aims to contribute to the design and implementation\nof a solution to the CPS challenges. To achieve this goal, the Edge4CPS system\nwas developed. Edge4CPS system is an open source, distributed,\nmulti-architecture solution that leverages Kubernetes for managing distributed\nedge computing clusters. It facilitates the deployment of applications across\nmultiple computing nodes. It also offers services such as data pipeline, which\nincludes data processing, classification, and visualization, as well as a\nmiddleware for messaging protocol translation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"UMB7lOaNyP_iyqaNHNKJxACu7R3GKJmfRHHBxSG3b1o","pdfSize":"3763740"}
