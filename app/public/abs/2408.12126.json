However, existing input shapers generally suffer\nfrom the ineffective control performance due to the neglect of observation\nerrors. To address this critical issue, this paper proposes an Extended Kalman\nFilter-incorporated Residual Neural Network-based input Shaping (ERS) model for\nvibration control. Its main ideas are two-fold: a) adopting an extended Kalman\nfilter to address a vertical flexible beam's model errors; and b) adopting a\nresidual neural network to cascade with the extended Kalman filter for\neliminating the remaining observation errors. Detailed experiments on a real\ndataset collected from a vertical flexible beam demonstrate that the proposed\nERS model has achieved significant vibration control performance over several\nstate-of-the-art models.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
