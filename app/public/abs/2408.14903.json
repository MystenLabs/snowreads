The self-tuning mechanism makes them `non-Markovian', which means\nthat their validity cannot be ensured by standard Markov chains theory. Several\ndifferent techniques have been suggested to analyse their theoretical\nproperties, many of which are technically involved. The technical nature of the\ntheory may make the methods unnecessarily unappealing. We discuss one technique\n-- based on a martingale decomposition -- with uniformly ergodic Markov\ntransitions. We provide an accessible and self-contained treatment in this\nsetting, and give detailed proofs of the results discussed in the paper, which\nonly require basic understanding of martingale theory and general state space\nMarkov chain concepts. We illustrate how our conditions can accomodate\ndifferent types of adaptation schemes, and can give useful insight to the\nrequirements which ensure their validity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
