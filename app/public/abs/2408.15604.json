The adopted EUP naturally admits a minimal\nmeasurable momentum (equivalently a maximal measurable length), as an infrared\ncutoff in the theory. We derive the modified Friedmann equations in this setup\nand explore some predictions of these equations for the late time universe via\ndistance measures. We show that in this framework it is possible to realize the\nlate time cosmic speed-up and transition to the phantom phase of the equation\nof state parameter of the effective cosmic fluid without recourse to any dark\nenergy component or modified gravity. Inspection of various distance measures\nin this framework shows that an EUP with a negative deformation parameter\nsuffices for the interpretation of the late time asymptotically de Sitter\nuniverse with standard non-relativistic matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
