We developed an exact mathematical\nmodel based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) to solve the problem, using\nfewer variables than previously existing models. Furthermore, to ensure the\nstability of the cases within bins, the model employs a novel formulation to\nrepresent the support constraints. We then compared and analyzed the solution\nperformance of the classical solver Gurobi and D-Wave's constrained quadratic\nmodel (CQM) solver on the MIP model, both with and without support constraints.\nResults from the computational studies offer valuable insights into how the\nhybrid classical-quantum solver compares against widely used purely classical\nsolvers on computationally hard problems, such as the problem of interest. This\ncomparison examines aspects such as the optimality gap and volume utilization\nacross different computational time limits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
