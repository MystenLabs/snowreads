It first introduces the concepts of stability,\nstabilizability, and detectability for stochastic linear systems. Then, the\nlong-term behavior of the associated Riccati equations is analyzed under\nstabilizability and detectability conditions.Subsequently, a periodic\nmean-field stochastic LQ problem is formulated and solved. Finally, a linear\ntransformation of the periodic extension of its optimal pair is shown to be the\nturnpike limit of the initial optimal control problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
