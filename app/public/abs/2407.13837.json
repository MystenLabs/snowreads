This phenomenon cannot be\nrevealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to\ndiscriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation\nextremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced\nability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty\nin the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of\ntrajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable\nLiouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced\nby varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation\nmatrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that\naveraging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite\nlengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests\nthat partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of\nindividual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct\nmeasurement-induced phases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
