Such models generally provide optimality in compact\nsize or empirical accuracy. Recent works focus on improving efficiency due to\nthe natural scalability issue. The application of such models to practical\nproblems is quite limited. As an emerging problem in circuit design,\nApproximate Logic Synthesis (ALS) aims to reduce circuit complexity by\nsacrificing correctness. Recently, multiple heuristic machine learning methods\nhave been applied in ALS, which learns approximated circuits from samples of\ninput-output pairs.\n  In this paper, we propose a new ALS methodology realizing the approximation\nvia learning optimal decision trees in empirical accuracy. Compared to previous\nheuristic ALS methods, the guarantee of optimality achieves a more controllable\ntrade-off between circuit complexity and accuracy. Experimental results show\nclear improvements in our methodology in the quality of approximated designs\n(circuit complexity and accuracy) compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
