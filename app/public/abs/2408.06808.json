We report measurements for the merged-beams rate coefficient of ArH$^+$\nand compare it to published experimental and theoretical results. In addition,\nby measuring the kinetic energy released to the DR fragments, we have\ndetermined the internal state of the DR products after dissociation. At low\ncollision energies, we find that the atomic products are in their respective\nground states, which are only accessible via non-adiabatic couplings to neutral\nRydberg states. Published theoretical results for ArH$^+$ have not included\nthis DR pathway. From our measurements, we have also derived a kinetic\ntemperature rate coefficient for use in astrochemical models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
