However,\nindividual behaviors, in particular the self-protection and migration, which\nhave a strong influence on epidemic propagation, were always neglected in\nprevious studies. In this paper, we mainly propose two models from the\nindividual and population perspectives. In the first individual model, we\nintroduce the individual protection degree that effectively suppresses the\nepidemic level as a stochastic variable to the SIRS model. In the alternative\npopulation model, an open Markov queueing network is constructed to investigate\nthe individual number of each epidemic state, and we present an evolving\npopulation network via the migration of people. Besides, stochastic methods are\napplied to analyze both models. In various simulations, the infected\nprobability, the number of individuals in each state and its limited\ndistribution are demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
