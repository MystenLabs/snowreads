At low temperatures, $\\lambda_L (T)$ is exponentially\nattenuated and, if fitted with the power law, $\\lambda(T) \\sim T^n$, gives\nexponents $n>4$, indistinguishable from the isotropic single $s-$wave gap\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) asymptotic. The superfluid density fits\nperfectly in the entire temperature range to the BCS theory. The\nsuperconducting transition temperature, $T_c = 2.40 \\pm 0.05\\:\\text{K}$, does\nnot change after 2.5 MeV electron irradiation, indicating the validity of the\nAnderson theorem for isotropic $s-$wave superconductors. Campbell penetration\ndepth before and after electron irradiation shows no hysteresis between the\nzero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) protocols, consistent with the\nparabolic pinning potential. Interestingly, the critical current density\nestimated from the original Campbell theory decreases after irradiation,\nimplying that a more sophisticated theory involving collective effects is\nneeded to describe vortex pinning in this system. In general, our thermodynamic\nmeasurements strongly suggest that the bulk response of the $\\text{AuSn}_4$\ncrystals is fully consistent with the isotropic $s-$wave weak-coupling BCS\nsuperconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
