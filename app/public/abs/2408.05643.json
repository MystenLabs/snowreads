In\nthis note we construct natural $q$-difference equations from the elliptic\nstable envelope of $X$. In examples, these equations coincide with the quantum\ndifference equations, which give a natural $q$-deformation of the Dubrovin\nconnection of $X$. Solutions of the quantum difference equations provide\ngenerating functions counting curves in $X$. In this way, our construction\nconnects curve counting and equivariant elliptic cohomology.\n  This is an overview paper based on the author's talk at the workshop The 16th\nMSJ-SI: Elliptic Integrable Systems, Representation Theory and Hypergeometric\nFunctions, Tokyo 2023.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gCpS3C8L7ceh2VUZt13qT-q7447iXriygbXdwa1oLGQ","pdfSize":"3014204"}
