This paper illustrates the use of\nattentive models for producing item recommendations in a mobile game scenario.\nThe methodology comprises a combination of supervised and unsupervised\napproaches to create user-level recommendations while introducing a novel\nscale-invariant approach to the prediction. The methodology is subsequently\napplied to a bundle recommendation in Candy Crush Saga. The strategy of\ndeployment, maintenance, and monitoring of ML models that are scaled up to\nserve millions of users is presented, along with the best practices and design\npatterns adopted to minimize technical debt typical of ML systems. The\nrecommendation approach is evaluated both offline and online, with a focus on\nunderstanding the increase in engagement, click- and take rates, novelty\neffects, recommendation diversity, and the impact of degenerate feedback loops.\nWe have demonstrated that the recommendation enhances user engagement by 30%\nconcerning click rate and by more than 40% concerning take rate. In addition,\nwe empirically quantify the diminishing effects of recommendation accuracy on\nuser engagement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
