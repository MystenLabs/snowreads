We prove that\nthe pressure $P:=\\frac{m}{m-1}\\rho^{m-1}$ in $L_{loc}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$\ntends to the pressure critical threshold $P_M:=\\frac{m}{m-1}(\\rho_M)^{m-1}$ at\nthe time decay rate $(1+t)^{-1}$. If the initial density $\\rho(x,0)$ is\ncompactly supported, we justify that the support $\\{x: \\rho(x,t)>0\\}$ of the\ndensity $\\rho$ expands exponentially in time. Furthermore, we show that there\nexists a time $T_0>0$ such that the pressure $P$ is Lipschitz continuous for\n$t>T_0$, which is the optimal (sharp) regularity of the pressure, and the free\nsurface $\\partial \\{(x,t): \\rho(x,t)>0\\}\\cap \\{t>T_0\\}$ is locally Lipschitz\ncontinuous. In addition, under the same initial assumptions of compact support,\nwe verify that the free boundary $\\partial \\{(x,t): \\rho(x,t)>0\\}\\cap\n\\{t>T_0\\}$ is a local $C^{1,\\alpha}$ surface.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vO-FZvCBPuXjGtZ2CmIbOwniTY8kLLV5iw261-MRurA","pdfSize":"594636"}
