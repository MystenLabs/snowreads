This research targets the accurate mapping of\nfractional woody cover (FWC) at the species level in a South African savannah,\nusing EnMAP hyperspectral data. Field annotations were combined with very\nhigh-resolution multispectral drone data to produce land cover maps that\nincluded three woody species. The high-resolution labelled maps were then used\nto generate FWC samples for each woody species class at the 30-m spatial\nresolution of EnMAP. Four machine learning regression algorithms were tested\nfor FWC mapping on dry season EnMAP imagery. The contribution of multitemporal\ninformation was also assessed by incorporating as additional regression\nfeatures, spectro-temporal metrics from Sentinel-2 data of both the dry and wet\nseasons. The results demonstrated the suitability of our approach for\naccurately mapping FWC at the species level. The highest accuracy rates\nachieved from the combined EnMAP and Sentinel-2 experiments highlighted their\nsynergistic potential for species-level vegetation mapping.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fm-sF4gs-7AE2UCj8orqKq4BxtJyNJDrKu5K7AzOgDI","pdfSize":"2519742"}
