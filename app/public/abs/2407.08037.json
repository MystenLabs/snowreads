A number of algorithms have been proposed in recent\nyears to solve such problems; a common feature of all these methods is that\nthey implicitly require precise knowledge of the temporal variability of the\nsolutions in order to exactly track the optimizers. In this paper, we seek to\nlift these stringent assumptions. Our main result is a fundamental\ncharacterization, showing that an algorithm can track an optimal trajectory if\nand only if it contains a model of the temporal variability of the problem. We\nrefer to this concept to as the internal model principle of time-varying\noptimization. By recasting the optimization objective as a nonlinear regulation\nproblem and using tools from center manifold theory, we provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions both for an optimization algorithm to achieve exact\nasymptotic tracking and for such an algorithm to exist. We illustrate the\napplicability of the approach numerically on both synthetic problems as well as\npractical problems in transportation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
