By performing a \"thin-front limit,\" we are able to\ndeduce a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a suitable effective Hamiltonian on the\nroad that governs the front location of the road-field model. Our main\nmotivation is to apply the theory of strong (flux-limited) viscosity solutions\nin order to determine a control formulation interpretation of the front\nlocation. In view of the ecological meaning of the road-field model, this is\nnatural as it casts the invasion problem as one of finding optimal paths that\nbalance the positive growth rate in the field with the fast diffusion on the\nroad.\n  Our main contribution is a nearly complete picture of the behavior on\ntwo-road conical domains. When the diffusivities on each road are the same, we\nshow that the propagation speed in each direction in the cone can be computed\nvia those associated with one-road half-space problem. When the diffusivities\ndiffer, we show that the speed along the faster road is unchanged, while the\nspeed along the slower road can be enhanced. Along the way we provide a new\nproof of known results on the one-road half-space problem via our approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
