Using a first-order approximation\nargument with logit and CES demand, I show that the welfare effect of a merger\non consumer surplus is proportional to the change in the Herfindahl-Hirschman\nindex, where the proportionality coefficient depends on price responsiveness\nparameter, market size, and the distribution of merging firms' shares. This\npaper elucidates how HHI measures inform the market power effects of mergers.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
