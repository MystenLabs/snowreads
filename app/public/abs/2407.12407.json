However, the opportunities and challenges 360{\\deg} video\nintroduces for video design ethnography is unclear. This study investigates\nthis gap through 16 workshops in which experienced designers engaged with\n360{\\deg} video. Our analysis shows that while 360{\\deg} video enhances\ndesigners' ability to explore and understand user contexts, it also complicates\nthe process of sharing insights. To address this challenge, we present two\nopportunities to support the use of 360{\\deg} video by designers - the creation\nof designerly 360{\\deg} video annotation tools, and 360{\\deg} ``screenshots'' -\nin order to enable designers to leverage the complete context of 360{\\deg}\nvideo for user research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
