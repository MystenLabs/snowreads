As one of Ethereum's core applications,\nsmart contracts utilize diverse contract codes to meet various functional needs\nand have gained widespread use. However, the non-tamperability of smart\ncontracts, coupled with vulnerabilities caused by natural flaws or human\nerrors, has brought unprecedented challenges to blockchain security. Therefore,\nin order to ensure the healthy development of blockchain technology and the\nstability of the blockchain community, it is particularly important to study\nthe vulnerability detection techniques for smart contracts. In this paper, we\npropose a Dual-view Aware Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Framework\nnamed DVDet. The framework initially converts the source code and bytecode of\nsmart contracts into weighted graphs and control flow sequences, capturing\npotential risk features from these two perspectives and integrating them for\nanalysis, ultimately achieving effective contract vulnerability detection.\nComprehensive experiments on the Ethereum dataset show that our method\noutperforms others in detecting vulnerabilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
