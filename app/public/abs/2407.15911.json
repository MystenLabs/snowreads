These transitions range in wavelength\n(wavenumber) from 2350 - 6417 Angstroms (42532 - 15579 cm-1) and originate in\n13 odd-parity and 24 even-parity upper levels. Thirty-five of the 37 levels,\naccounting for 213 of the 224 transitions, are studied for the first time.\nBranching fractions are determined for two levels studied previously for\ncomparison to earlier results. The levels studied for the first time are\nhigh-lying, ranging in energy from 35753 - 54989 cm-1. The branching fractions\nare determined from emission spectra from two different high-resolution\nspectrometers. These are combined with radiative lifetimes reported in an\nearlier study to produce a set of transition probabilities and log(gf) values\nwith accuracy ranging from 5 - 30%. Comparison is made to experimental and\ntheoretical transition probabilities from the literature where such data exist.\nThese new log(gf) values are used to derive an abundance from one previously\nunused Tm II line in the UV spectrum of the r-process-enhanced metal-poor star\nHD 222925, and this abundance is consistent with previous determinations based\non other Tm II lines.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
