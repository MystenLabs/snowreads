Text generation in LLMs is modeled as a stochastic process where\neach step depends on previously generated content and model parameters,\nsampling the next word from a vocabulary distribution. We represent this\ngeneration process using SDE to capture both deterministic trends and\nstochastic perturbations. The drift term describes the deterministic trends in\nthe generation process, while the diffusion term captures the stochastic\nvariations. We fit these functions using neural networks and validate the model\non real-world text corpora. Through numerical simulations and comprehensive\nanalyses, including drift and diffusion analysis, stochastic process property\nevaluation, and phase space exploration, we provide deep insights into the\ndynamics of text generation. This approach not only enhances the understanding\nof the inner workings of LLMs but also offers a novel mathematical perspective\non language generation, which is crucial for diagnosing, optimizing, and\ncontrolling the quality of generated text.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
