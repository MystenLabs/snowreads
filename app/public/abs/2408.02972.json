We are concerned with the distribution of the fractional parts of the\nsequence $(\\xi \\alpha^{n})$. Under various Diophantine conditions on $\\xi$ and\n$\\alpha$, we obtain lower bounds on the number $n$ with $1\\leq n\\leq N $ for\nwhich the fractional part of the sequence $(\\xi \\alpha^{n})_{n\\geq1}$ fall into\na prescribed region $I\\subset [0,1]$, extending several results in the\nliterature. As an application, we show that the Fourier decay rate of some\nself-similar measures is logarithmic, generalizing a result of Varj\\'{u} and\nYu.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
