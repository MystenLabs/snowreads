We show that the resulting weak composite\nmonad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear\nprevisions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on\nwhether we consider $\\mathbf V_{\\leq 1}$ or $\\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\\mathbf\nV$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\\mathcal\nP\\ell^{\\mathrm q}_{\\mathsf V} \\cong \\mathcal P\\ell_{\\mathsf V}$ over the monad\nof (sub)probability Radon measures $\\mathbf R_\\bullet$ on the category of\nstably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of\nthe Vietoris monad over $\\mathbf R_\\bullet$. The associated weak composite\nmonad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zyaW7mhKMVyHeZVbyNQ7naUk1wu0GqS0UdbdLn4Xat0","pdfSize":"1048673"}
