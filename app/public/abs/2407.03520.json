Despite these important steps forward, open\nquestions persist on the chemical and physical evolution of solids in their\njourney from the collapsing molecular cores to disks and planetary bodies. This\nchapter is a repository of such burning questions. It has the ambition to\nidentify the most promising avenues for future research based on current\nobservational and modeling opportunities.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"awSnQw4QKvfMcvBC2qtCgE3W7o9Si_fKU0Cqyonrdkc","pdfSize":"3365425"}
