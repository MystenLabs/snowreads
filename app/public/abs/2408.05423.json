This approach allows for the\ninclusion of binary stars with unreliable Gaia solutions, thereby eliminating\nassociated bias. Thus, the often-neglected 14 sources with Gaia two-parameter\nsolutions are included. The subsequent analysis of color-magnitude and\ncolor-color diagrams exploits artifacts in Gaia photometric data, caused by the\ndifferent field sizes used to measure fluxes in the $G$, $B_p$, and $R_p$\npassbands, to reveal binary stars with subarcsecond angular separation. The\nfindings are validated with prior high-resolution observations. Overall, $24\n\\pm 3$ cluster members with angular separation between 0.1 and 1 arcsec (13.5\nto 135 AU projected distance) and mass ratio $q>0.5$ are deemed binary,\nindicating a binarity fraction of $6 \\pm 1$\\%.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QjYo50hZkBrqsu3tvpUdJqm2MU2ZhukEyqcye5jlJtA","pdfSize":"649111"}
