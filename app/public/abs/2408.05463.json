The X6.4 flare shows three repetitive and successive\npulsations in HXR and microwave wavebands, and they have an extremely-large\nmodulation depth. The onset of flare QPPs is almost simultaneous with the start\nof magnetic cancellation between positive and negative fields. The wavelet\npower spectra suggest the presence of double periods, which are centered at\nabout 200s and 95s, respectively. The long-period QPP can also be detected in\nLy$\\alpha$ and UV wavebands at the flare area, and it could be observed in the\nadjacent sunspot. Our observations indicate that the flare QPPs are most likely\ntriggered by accelerated electrons that are associated with periodic magnetic\nreconnections. The long period at about 200s is probably modulated by the slow\nmagnetoacoustic wave originating from the neighboring sunspot, while the short\nperiod at about 95s could be regarded as its second harmonic mode.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
