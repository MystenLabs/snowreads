Observations conducted by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes\nhave detected very high energy gamma-rays originating from a point source known\nas HESS J1745-290, situated in close proximity to the GC. This source is\nconjectured to be associated with the supermassive black hole Sagittarius\nA$^*$. The GC region contains diverse structures, including molecular clouds\nand non-thermal filaments, which collectively contribute to the intricate\nmagnetic field configurations in this region. By utilizing a magnetic field\nmodel specific in the GC region, we explore the phenomenon of photon-ALP\noscillations in the gamma-ray spectrum of HESS J1745-290. Our analysis does not\nreveal any discernible signature of photon-ALP oscillations, yielding\nsignificant constraints that serve as a complement to gamma-ray observations of\nextragalactic sources across a broad parameter region. The uncertainties\narising from the outer Galactic magnetic field models have minor impacts on our\nresults, except for ALP masses around 10$^{-7}$ eV, as the dominant influence\noriginates from the intense magnetic field strength in the inner GC region.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
