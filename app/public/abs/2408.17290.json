Whereas the enhancement may be unbounded\nin infinite-dimensional settings even when the input power is constrained, a\nlong-standing conjecture asserts that the ratio between the\nentanglement-assisted and unassisted classical capacities is bounded in\nfinite-dimensional settings [Bennett et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3081 (2002)].\nIn this work, we prove this conjecture by showing that their ratio is upper\nbounded by $o(d^2)$, where $d$ is the input dimension of the channel. An\napplication to quantum communication with noisy encoders and decoders is given.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
