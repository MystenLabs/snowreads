For the\ncase when the plane is tessellated by squares, we can solve the problem\napproximately by finding the shortest path on a grid graph defined by placing a\nvertex at the center of each grid. In this note, we show that the obtained path\nadmits $(\\sqrt{2}+1)$-approximation. This improves the previous result of\n$2\\sqrt{2}$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
