Several versions of the method\nhave been proposed in the literature, and different convergence results have\nbeen proved. However, all existing results assume the objective function to be\nevaluated exactly at each iteration of the method. In this work, we extend the\nconvergence analysis of a discrete-time CBO method to the case where only a\nnoisy stochastic estimator of the objective function can be computed at a given\npoint. In particular we prove that under suitable assumptions on the oracle's\nnoise, the expected value of the mean squared distance of the particles from\nthe solution can be made arbitrarily small in a finite number of iterations.\nNumerical experiments showing the impact of noise are also given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
