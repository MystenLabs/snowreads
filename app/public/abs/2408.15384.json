With the\nincreasing data volumes in areas like machine learning, the demand for\nefficient parallel processing of large matrices has grown significantly.This\nstudy explores the performance of both serial and parallel matrix\nmultiplication on the Cirrus supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh. The\nresults demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of these methods, providing\ninsights for optimizing matrixmultiplication in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
