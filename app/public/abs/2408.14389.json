We show that the smallest singular value\n$\\sigma_n(A)$ satisfies\n  \\[\n  \\Pr \\left(\\sigma_n(A) \\leq \\varepsilon(\\sqrt{N+1} - \\sqrt{n})\\right) \\leq\n(C\\varepsilon)^{N-n+1} + e^{-cN},\n  \\]\n  for all $\\varepsilon > 0$, where $c,C$ depend only on $\\beta$ and the\n$2+\\beta$ moments. This extends earlier results of Rudelson and Vershynin, who\nshowed that such lower tail estimates held for rectangular matrices with i.i.d.\nmean-0 subgaussian entries. When the $2+\\beta$ moment assumption is replaced\nwith a uniform anti-concentration assumption, $\\sup_z \\Pr\\left(|X-z| < a\\right)\n< b$, we show that\n  \\[\n  \\Pr\\left(\\sigma_n(A) \\leq \\varepsilon(\\sqrt{N+1} - \\sqrt{n})\\right) \\leq\n(C\\varepsilon\\log(1/\\varepsilon))^{N-n+1} + e^{-cN},\n  \\]\n  where $c_2,C_3$ now depend only on $a$ and $b$. This extends more recent work\nof Livshyts, whose showed that such lower tail estimates held for rectrangular\nmatrices with i.i.d. rows. To prove these results we employ a number of new\ntechnical ingredients, including a new deviation inequality for the regularized\nHilbert-Schmidt norm and a recently proven small ball estimate for the distance\nbetween a random vector and a subspace spanned by an inhomogeneous rectangular\nmatrix.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
