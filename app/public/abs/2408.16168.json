Thus, multi-operator learning is capable of predicting a\nrange of operators within one model. In this work, we propose pretraining and\nfine-tuning strategies for solving PDEs using multi-operator learning. One key\naspect is that by increasing the number of families of operators used in\npretraining, a PDE foundation model can be fine-tuned to downstream tasks\ninvolving new PDEs with a limited number of samples, thus outperforming single\noperator neural networks. Specifically, a multi-operator learning model\npre-trained with data from diverse PDE families can predict unseen operators\nafter fine-tuning with only a limited number of operators from the new family,\nenabling them to serve as a data-free PDE solver. We also show that the\nproposed training and fine-tuning method is able to predict new operators in\nzero-shot prediction without samples. Additionally, we introduce a PDE-agnostic\nmeta-learning algorithm to improve the adaptability of the model to various\nPDEs by providing a better parameter initialization process. To address the\nneeds of applications with limited computing resources, we explore low-rank\nadaptation methods that reduce computational costs while enhancing solver\naccuracy. Lastly, by examining the scaling law with respect to the number of\noperator families, we establish and highlight its potential for broad\nadaptation in PDE-solving tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
