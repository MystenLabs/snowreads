However, existing methods have an unsatisfactory balance of\nspeed, accuracy, and complexity. This study introduces a novel polarization\ndemosaicking algorithm that interpolates within a three-stage basic\ndemosaicking framework to obtain DoFP images. Our method incorporates a DoFP\nlow-cost edge-aware technique (DLE) to guide the interpolation process.\nFurthermore, the inter-channel correlation is used to calibrate the initial\nestimate in the polarization difference domain. The proposed algorithm is\navailable in both a lightweight and a full version, tailored to different\napplication requirements. Experiments on simulated and real DoFP images\ndemonstrate that our two methods have the highest interpolation accuracy and\nspeed, respectively, and significantly enhance the visuals. Both versions\nefficiently process a 1024*1024 image on an AMD Ryzen 5600X CPU in 0.1402s and\n0.2693s, respectively. Additionally, since our methods only involve\ncomputational processes within a 5*5 window, the potential for parallel\nacceleration on GPUs or FPGAs is highly feasible.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
