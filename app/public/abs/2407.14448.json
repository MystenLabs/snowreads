Although, in the previous paper [arXiv:2402.14512], we considered\ndifferent types of the dilaton boundary conditions, but since the behavior of\n$\\beta$-function as a function of running coupling does not depend\nsignificantly on the boundary condition, we chose one. The corresponding\n$\\beta$-functions are negative and monotonically decreasing functions, and have\njumps on the 1-st order phase transitions for both light and heavy quarks. In\naddition, we compare our holographic results for $\\beta$-function as a function\nof running coupling with perturbation results that obtained within 2-loop\ncalculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"gYP3LnKoBRhdntYVJW_fvarEeLhkB4oWT1oogpdPH98","pdfSize":"2322169"}
