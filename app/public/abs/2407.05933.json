The paper also reviews and studies extreme value theory, time\nseries, volatility clustering, and risk measurement methods in detail.\nComparing the performance of extreme mixture models and methods on different\nsimulated distributions shows that the method based on kernel density\nestimation does not have an absolute superior or close to the best performance,\nespecially for the estimation of the extreme upper or lower tail of the\ndistribution. Preprocessing time series data using a generalized autoregressive\nconditional heteroskedasticity model (GARCH) and applying extreme value mixture\nmodels on extracted residuals from GARCH can improve the goodness of fit and\nthe estimation of the tail distribution.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
