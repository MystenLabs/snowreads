Post pump there is a quick\nreduction of the optical weight but a very slow recovery of the magnetic order\n- the difference is attributed to weak inter-layer exchange in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$\ndelaying the recovery of three dimensional magnetic order. We demonstrate that\nthe effect has a very different and more fundamental origin. Combining\nspatio-temporal mean field dynamics and Langevin dynamics on the photoexcited\nMott-Hubbard insulator we show that the timescale difference is not a\ndimensional effect but is intrinsic to charge dynamics versus order\nreconstruction in a correlated system. In two dimensions itself we obtain a\nshort, almost pump fluence independent, timescale for charge dynamics while\nrecovery time of magnetic order involves domain growth and increases rapidly\nwith fluence. Apart from resolving the iridate Mott problem our approach can be\nused to analyse phase competition and spatial ordering in superconductors and\ncharge ordered systems out of equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XyxkS46U2gzxtJUm4S9iQmYuunYy0GP4sQrDIr6p4sM","pdfSize":"3470271"}
