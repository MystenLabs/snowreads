Based on our analysis of various observables, that we study\nholographically, we propose an interpretation of the first class of solutions\nas dual to deconstructed 6d (1,0) CFTs dual to AdS$_7$, and of the second class\nas dual to surface defects in the same 6d theories. Among the observables that\nwe study are baryon vertices and giant graviton configurations in quiver-like\nconstructions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
