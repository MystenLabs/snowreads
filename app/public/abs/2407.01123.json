The system is a nonlocal\nregularization of a generalized Busenberg-Travis model, which describes\nsegregating population species with local averaging. The partial velocities are\nthe solutions of an elliptic regularization of Darcy's law, which can be\ninterpreted as a Brinkman's law. The following results are proved: the\nexistence of global weak solutions; localization limit; boundedness and\nuniqueness of weak solutions (in one space dimension); exponential decay of the\nsolutions. Moreover, the weak-strong uniqueness property for the limiting\nsystem is shown.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ERE2hoCKB_EQ-C5--Nh76qvkn_jRqXgf-4gpKWc9icI","pdfSize":"328335"}
