Traditional Faraday spectrum deconvolution methods such as RMCLEAN\nface challenges in resolving complex Faraday dispersion functions and handling\nlarge datasets. We develop a deep learning deconvolution model to enhance the\naccuracy and efficiency of extracting Faraday rotation measures from radio\nastronomical data, specifically targeting data from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster\nLegacy Survey (MGCLS). We use semi-supervised learning, where the model\nsimultaneously recreates the data and minimizes the difference between the\noutput and the true signal of synthetic data. Performance comparisons with\nRMCLEAN were conducted on simulated as well as real data for the galaxy cluster\nAbell 3376. Our semi-supervised model is able to recover the Faraday dispersion\nwith great accuracy, particularly for complex or high-RM signals, maintaining\nsensitivity across a broad RM range. The computational efficiency of this\nmethod is significantly improved over traditional methods. Applied to\nobservations of Abell 3376, we find detailed magnetic field structures in the\nradio relics, and several AGN. We also apply our model to MeerKAT data of Abell\n85, Abell 168, Abell 194, Abell 3186 and Abell 3667.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
