However, incompressibility\nassumptions of the isolated vortex ring model mostly limits its applicability\nto the lower Mach number regime. To overcome this limitation, a compressible\nvortex ring is generated using a pulse jet exiting a circular nozzle, and its\ninteraction with a shock wave is analysed. The shock vortex interaction and\nresulting sound wave generation is simulated by solving the compressible\naxisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. A characteristics-based filter is used to\nisolate acoustic and hydrodynamic disturbances in the flow-field. A\nreconfigured computational domain is used to negate the after-effects of the\nnozzle on the flow field. The strong interaction of compressible vortex rings\nat higher Mach numbers with different shock wave Mach numbers in the flow field\nis studied including resultant acoustic wave generation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
