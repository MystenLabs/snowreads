However, TLS-acquired point clouds often\ncontain virtual points from reflective surfaces, causing disruptions. This\nstudy presents a reflection noise elimination algorithm for TLS point clouds.\nOur innovative reflection plane detection algorithm, based on geometry-optical\nmodels and physical properties, identifies and categorizes reflection points\nper optical reflection theory. We've adapted the LSFH feature descriptor to\nretain reflection features, mitigating interference from symmetrical\narchitectural structures. By incorporating the Hausdorff feature distance, the\nalgorithm enhances resilience to ghosting and deformation, improving virtual\npoint detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the 3DRN benchmark dataset,\nfeaturing diverse urban environments with virtual TLS reflection noise, show\nour algorithm improves precision and recall rates for 3D points in reflective\nregions by 57.03\\% and 31.80\\%, respectively. Our method achieves a 9.17\\%\nbetter outlier detection rate and 5.65\\% higher accuracy than leading methods.\nAccess the 3DRN dataset at (https://github.com/Tsuiky/3DRN).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
