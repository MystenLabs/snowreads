It provides a local probe that\ngenerally complements scattering techniques in the study of magnetic systems\nand represents a valuable alternative for materials that display strong\nincoherent scattering or neutron absorption. Computational methods can\neffectively quantify the microscopic interactions underlying the experimentally\nobserved signal, thus substantially boosting the predictive power of this\ntechnique. Here, we present an efficient set of algorithms and workflows\ndevoted to the automation of this task. In particular, we adopt the so-called\nDFT+{\\mu} procedure, where the system is characterised in the density\nfunctional theory (DFT) framework with the muon modeled as a hydrogen impurity.\nWe devise an automated strategy to obtain candidate muon stopping sites, their\ndipolar interaction with the nuclei, and hyperfine interactions with the\nelectronic ground state. We validate the implementation on well-studied\ncompounds, showing the effectiveness of our protocol in terms of accuracy and\nsimplicity of use\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
