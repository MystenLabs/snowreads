The time complexity of\nthe algorithm is $O(m^2n^2 \\lambda^{2m})$ for the torus and\n$O(m^3n^2\\lambda^m)$ for the other graphs, where $\\lambda = 1+\\sqrt{2}$. The\nspace complexity is $O(mn\\lambda^m)$ for all of these graphs. We use this\nalgorithm to compute domination polynomials for graphs up to size $24\\times 24$\nand the total number of dominating sets for even larger graphs. This allows us\nto give precise estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of the number of\ndominating sets. We also extend several sequences in the Online Encyclopedia of\nInteger Sequences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cMjIMrwLTGyY2M5VNJ677_2emdgJp8sJehbglVrZU4U","pdfSize":"702982"}
