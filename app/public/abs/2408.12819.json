The\ncalculation is done on three Wilson Clover ensembles with a fixed lattice\nspacing a=0.105 fm and two pion masses. The lattice matrix elements are\ncomputed at proton momenta up to 2.46 GeV with the signal of high momentum\nmodes being improved by applying the momentum smearing technique. The\nstate-of-the-art renormalization, matching and extrapolation are then applied\nto obtain the final result of the light-cone PDF. A comparison between the\nresult of the dibaryon system and the sum of the proton and neutron PDFs is\nalso given.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
