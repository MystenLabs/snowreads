Current neural fields\noffer high-fidelity and resolution independence but require predefined meshes\nwith known discontinuities, restricting their utility. We observe that by\ntreating all mesh edges as potential discontinuities, we can represent the\nmagnitude of discontinuities with continuous variables and optimize. Based on\nthis observation, we introduce a novel discontinuous neural field model that\njointly approximate the target image and recovers discontinuities. Through\nsystematic evaluations, our neural field demonstrates superior performance in\ndenoising and super-resolution tasks compared to InstantNGP, achieving\nimprovements of over 5dB and 10dB, respectively. Our model also outperforms\nMumford-Shah-based methods in accurately capturing discontinuities, with\nChamfer distances 3.5x closer to the ground truth. Additionally, our approach\nshows remarkable capability in handling complex artistic drawings and natural\nimages.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zc1z7LD1lcNbFJL53I0fONiJuiIfKp-9jfkcbP-6muE","pdfSize":"39157694"}
