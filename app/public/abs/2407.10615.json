Both Sub-Grid Scale (SGS) models in Large Eddy Simulations\n(LES) and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) based modeling will require\nturbulence models for computational research of turbulent flows in the future.\nTurbulence model-based simulations suffer from a multitude of causes of\nforecast uncertainty. For example, the simplifications and assumptions employed\nto make these turbulence models computationally tractable and economical lead\nto predictive uncertainty. For safety-critical engineering design applications,\nwe need reliable estimates of this uncertainty. This article focuses on\nUncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)\nsimulations. We review recent advances in the estimate of many types of\nuncertainty components, including numerical, aleatoric, and epistemic. We go\ninto further depth on the possible use of Machine Learning (ML) methods to\nquantify these uncertainties. Above all, we elaborate further on significant\nlimitations in these techniques. These range from realizability constraints on\nthe Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) to the requirement for Monte Carlo\n(MC) approaches for mixed uncertainty. Based on this study, we pinpoint\nimportant problems that need to be addressed and offer focused solutions to\nmove beyond these obstacles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
