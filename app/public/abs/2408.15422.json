The interior solution describing hydrostatic\nequilibrium we are using throughout the manuscript corresponds to the Tolman IV\nexact analytic solution obtained long time ago. The three free parameters of\nthe solutions are determined imposing the matching conditions for objects of\nknown stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is\nshown that contrary to the Kohler Chao solution, the Tolman IV solution is\ncompatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions.\nexcept for the relativistic adiabatic index that diverges at the surface of the\nstars. The divergence of the index $\\Gamma$ may be resolved including a thin\ncrust assuming a polytropic equation-of-state, which is precisely the case seen\nin studies of neutron stars. To the best of our knowledge, we model here for\nthe first time the recently discovered massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 and the\nstrangely light HESS compact object via the Tolman IV solution. The present\nwork may be of interest to model builders as well as a useful reference for\nfuture research.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
