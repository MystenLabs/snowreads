Here, we propose a method using\nreservoir computing to generate chaos with a desired shape by providing a\nperiodic orbit as a template, called a skeleton. We exploit a bifurcation of\nthe reservoir to intentionally induce unsuccessful training of the skeleton,\nrevealing inherent chaos. The emergence of this untrained attractor, resulting\nfrom the interaction between the skeleton and the reservoir's intrinsic\ndynamics, offers a novel semi-supervised framework for designing chaos.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
