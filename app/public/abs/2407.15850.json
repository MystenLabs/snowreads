We use the power of off-the-shelf\nVisual-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), and develop\nvisual and text prompting strategies for this task. Our contributions are\nthree-fold: (i) We demonstrate that a VLM can successfully name and refer to\ncharacters if directly prompted with character information through visual\nindications without requiring any fine-tuning; (ii) A two-stage process is\ndeveloped to generate ADs, with the first stage asking the VLM to\ncomprehensively describe the video, followed by a second stage utilising a LLM\nto summarise dense textual information into one succinct AD sentence; (iii) A\nnew dataset for TV audio description is formulated. Our approach, named\nAutoAD-Zero, demonstrates outstanding performance (even competitive with some\nmodels fine-tuned on ground truth ADs) in AD generation for both movies and TV\nseries, achieving state-of-the-art CRITIC scores.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
