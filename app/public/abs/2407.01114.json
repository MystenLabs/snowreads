The quiver variety associated with the Jordan quiver is either\nisomorphic to the punctual Hilbert scheme in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ or to the\nCalogero-Moser space. We describe the irreducible components using quiver\nvarieties of McKay's quiver associated with the finite subgroup $\\Gamma$ and we\nhave given a general combinatorial model of the indexing set of these\nirreducible components in terms of certain elements of the root lattice of the\naffine Lie algebra associated with $\\Gamma$. Finally, we prove that for every\nprojective, symplectic resolution of a wreath product singularity, there exists\nan irreducible component of the fixed point locus of the punctual Hilbert\nscheme in the plane that is isomorphic to the resolution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
