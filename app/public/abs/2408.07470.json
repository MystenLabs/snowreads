When\ndesigned correctly, this shared experience can be enjoyable. However, in\ntypical scenarios, HMD users are isolated by their devices, and non-HMD\nobservers lack connection with the virtual world. To address this, our research\ninvestigates visually representing observers on both HMD and 2D screens to\nenhance shared experiences. The study, including five representation\nconditions, reveals that incorporating observer representation positively\nimpacts both HMD users and observers. For how to design and represent them, our\nwork shows that HMD users prefer methods displaying real-world visuals, while\nobservers exhibit diverse preferences regarding being represented with real or\nvirtual images. We provide design guidelines tailored to both displays,\noffering valuable insights to enhance co-located shared VR experiences for HMD\nusers and non-HMD observers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
