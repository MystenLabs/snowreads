To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel framework, the Hierarchical\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Model with Rethink (HiRAG), comprising\nDecomposer, Definer, Retriever, Filter, and Summarizer five key modules. We\nintroduce a new hierarchical retrieval strategy that incorporates both sparse\nretrieval at the document level and dense retrieval at the chunk level,\neffectively integrating their strengths. Additionally, we propose a\nsingle-candidate retrieval method to mitigate the limitations of\nmulti-candidate retrieval. We also construct two new corpora, Indexed\nWikicorpus and Profile Wikicorpus, to address the issues of outdated and\ninsufficient knowledge.\n  Our experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that HiRAG outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models across most metrics, and our Indexed Wikicorpus is\neffective.
