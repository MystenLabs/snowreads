In this study, we propose an online learning\nmethod of thermal model parameters of motors for an accurate estimation of\nmotor core temperature. Also, we propose a management method of motor core\ntemperature using the updated model and anomaly detection method of motors.\nFinally, we apply this method to the muscles of the musculoskeletal humanoid\nand verify the ability of continuous movements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
