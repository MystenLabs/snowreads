The proof of this fact combines ideas from\ndynamical systems, which appear naturally because these isolated states have\nstrongly chaotic dynamics, with techniques from spectral geometry and contact\ntopology, which can be effectively used to analyze the steady Euler equations\non carefully chosen Riemannian manifolds. Interestingly, much of this strategy\ncarries over to the Euler equations in Euclidean space, leading to the weaker\nresult that there exist analytic steady solutions on $\\mathbf{T}^3$ such that\nthe only analytic steady Euler flows in a $C^1$-neighborhood must belong to a\ncertain linear space of dimension six. For comparison, note that in any\n$C^k$-neighborhood of a shear flow there are infinitely many linearly\nindependent analytic shears.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
