While recent learning-based techniques have shown their\ncapability to create vector images of clear topology, filling these primitives\nwith gradients remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a\nsegmentation-guided vectorization framework to convert raster images into\nconcise vector graphics with radial gradient fills. With the guidance of an\nembedded gradient-aware segmentation subroutine, our approach progressively\nappends gradient-filled B\\'ezier paths to the output, where primitive\nparameters are initiated with our newly designed initialization technique and\nare optimized to minimize our novel loss function. We build our method on a\ndifferentiable renderer with traditional segmentation algorithms to develop it\nas a model-free tool for raster-to-vector conversion. It is tested on various\ninputs to demonstrate its feasibility, independent of datasets, to synthesize\nvector graphics with improved visual quality and layer-wise topology compared\nto prior work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
