The convergence of the\nassociated PSS iteration method is analyzed, and sufficient conditions on the\nparameters for convergence are established. Spectral analyses are performed to\nderive sharp bounds for the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrices.\nNumerical experiments based on examples arising from the PDE-constrained\noptimization problems are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed preconditioners compared with existing\nstate-of-the-art preconditioners.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
