This challenge is exacerbated by\nresource scarcity in communication infrastructures, necessitating innovative\nsolutions for effective service implementation. Exploring the potential of\nSemantic Communications (SemCom) to enhance point-to-point physical layer\nefficiency shows great promise in addressing this challenge. However, achieving\nefficient SemCom requires overcoming the significant hurdle of knowledge\nsharing between semantic decoders and encoders, particularly in the dynamic and\nnon-stationary environment with stringent end-to-end quality requirements. To\nbridge this gap in existing literature, this paper introduces the Knowledge\nBase Management And Orchestration (KB-MANO) framework. Rooted in the concepts\nof Computing-Network Convergence (CNC) and lifelong learning, KB-MANO is\ncrafted for the allocation of network and computing resources dedicated to\nupdating and redistributing KBs across the system. The primary objective is to\nminimize the impact of knowledge management activities on actual service\nprovisioning. A proof-of-concept is proposed to showcase the integration of\nKB-MANO with resource allocation in radio access networks. Finally, the paper\noffers insights into future research directions, emphasizing the transformative\npotential of semantic-oriented communication systems in the realm of 6G\ntechnology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
