This theoretical framework has been well-developed\nspecially because quantum phase transitions occur at equilibrium. However, its\ndynamical counterpart, known as dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs),\ntakes place out-of-equilibrium, where conventional thermodynamic tools are\ninapplicable. In this work, we make progress in this area by connecting\ndynamical criticality to the second law of thermodynamics through a geometric\nperspective on entropy production. Our findings, along with other recent\ndevelopments, suggest that dynamical criticality can lead the system to highly\ncomplex dynamics, indicating a possible pathway to thermalization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
