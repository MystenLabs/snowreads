Of particular concern are generated images that\nresemble photographs as they aspire to represent real world events. Synthetic\nphotographs may be used maliciously by a broad range of threat actors, from\nscammers to nation-state actors, to deceive, defraud, and mislead people.\nMitigating this threat usually involves answering a basic analytic question: Is\nthe photograph real or synthetic? To address this, we have examined the\ncapabilities of recent generative diffusion models and have focused on their\nflaws: visible artifacts in generated images which reveal their synthetic\norigin to the trained eye. We categorize these artifacts, provide examples,\ndiscuss the challenges in detecting them, suggest practical applications of our\nwork, and outline future research directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5m0KGYI1J9Oa8CaIMFEk11Q0LpT65s6pXrH0hJ14N4o","pdfSize":"31618792"}
