Our primary scientific\nobjective is a precise measurement of the optical depth $\\tau$ ($\\sigma(\\tau)\n\\sim 0.01$) to the reionization epoch of the Universe to cross-check systematic\neffects in the measurements made by previous experiments. GroundBIRD observes a\nwide sky area in the Northern Hemisphere ($\\sim 40\\%$ of the full sky) while\ncontinuously rotating the telescope at a high speed of up to 20 rotations per\nminute (rpm) to overcome the fluctuations of atmospheric radiation. We have\nadopted the NbTiN/Al hybrid microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) as\nfocal plane detectors. We observe two frequency bands centered at 145 GHz and\n220 GHz. The 145 GHz band picks up the peak frequency of the CMB spectrum. The\n220 GHz band helps accurate removal of the contamination of thermal emission\nfrom the Galactic interstellar dust. The MKID arrays (138 MKIDs for 145GHz and\n23 MKIDs for 220GHz) were designed and optimized so as to minimize the\ncontamination of the two-level-system noise and maximize the sensitivity. The\nMKID arrays were successfully installed in May 2023 after the performance\nverification tests were performed at a laboratory. GroundBIRD has been upgraded\nto use the full MKID arrays, and scientific observations are now underway. The\ntelescope is automated, so that all observations are performed remotely.\nInitial validations, including polarization response tests and observations of\nJupiter and the moon, have been completed successfully. We are now running\nscientific observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
