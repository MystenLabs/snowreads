However, little research has been performed to develop\nefficient modularity calculation algorithms for probabilistic networks.\nParticularly, it is challenging to efficiently calculate expected modularity\nwhen all possible worlds are considered. To address this problem, we propose\ntwo algorithms, namely $\\mathrm{PWP}^{\\mathrm{EMOD}}$ and\n$\\mathrm{APWP}^{\\mathrm{EMOD}}$, partitioning the possible worlds based on\ntheir modularities to significantly reduce the number of probability\ncalculations. We evaluate the accuracy and time efficiency of our algorithms\nthrough comprehensive experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
