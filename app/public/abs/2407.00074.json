Each\ngenerator is described by a limit equation for the Mackey-Glass equation. The\nright parts are represented by a relay function obtained when the exponent in\nthe denominator of the nonlinearity tends to infinity. Discrete traveling waves\nare sought in the system. These modes are such that all components are\nrepresented by the same periodic function with successive (multiple of the same\nvalue) shifts. Moreover, this periodic function has the smallest number of\nswitchings, that is, points at which the right-hand sides change the analytical\nform. It is shown that discrete traveling waves coexist in the system.\nMoreover, their number is equal to the factorial of the number of generators.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
