After providing a general framework for explicitly\nconstructing such realisations, we specialise to non-abelian generalisations of\nthe Ising model and consider two operations: gauging an arbitrary subsymmetry\nand performing Fourier transforms of the local weights encoding the dynamics of\nthe theory. These are carried out both in a traditional way and in terms of the\nthree-dimensional topological quantum field theory. Whenever the whole symmetry\nis gauged, combining both operations recovers the non-abelian Kramers-Wannier\nduals \\`a la Freed and Teleman of the generalised Ising models. Moreover, we\ndiscuss the interplay between renormalisation group fixed points of gapped\nsymmetric phases and these generalised Kramers-Wannier dualities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
