An assumption (both\nexplicitly and implicitly) underpinning the Related Website Sets proposal is\nthat users can accurately determine if two sites are related via the same\nentity. In this work, we probe this assumption via measurements and a user\nstudy of 30 participants, to assess the ability of Web users to determine if\ntwo sites are (according to the Related Website Sets feature) related to each\nother. We find that this is largely not the case. Our findings indicate that 42\n(36.8%) of the user determinations in our study are incorrect in\nprivacy-harming ways, where users think that sites are not related, but would\nbe treated as related (and so due less privacy protections) by the Related\nWebsite Sets feature. Additionally, 22 (73.3%) of participants made at least\none incorrect evaluation during the study. We also characterise the Related\nWebsite Sets list, its composition over time, and its governance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
