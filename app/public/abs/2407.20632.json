We use Schrieffer-Wolff transformation and rotating frame to\nderive the effective Hamiltonian of EDSR. We treat the couplings of the orbital\nmotion with the environment with Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL)\nmaster equation. We found that the cubic SOI makes the Rabi frequency\nnon-linear with the applied microwave amplitude. At the same time, the fidelity\nof the spin manipulations becomes worse since the residual spin-orbital\ncouplings induces spin relaxation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zcsTWqk_KdI7iz5tEjzkR0ZDMBfSzXEaT-3WUZBS46A","pdfSize":"230437"}
