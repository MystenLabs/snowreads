We compute an infinite family of four-point\ncorrelation functions of operators in short multiplets of 4D N=4 super\nYang-Mills theory in the supergravity regime, by studying the quadratic\nfluctuations around non-trivial supergravity backgrounds. The supergravity\nbackgrounds are supersymmetric smooth geometries in the family derived by Lin,\nLunin and Maldacena. The light probes comprise an infinite sequence of\nKaluza-Klein harmonics of the dilaton/axion. For generic parameter values, the\nsupergravity backgrounds are dual to heavy CFT states. However we focus on the\nlimit in which the dual CFT states become light single-particle states. The\nresulting all-light four-point correlators are related by superconformal Ward\nidentities to previously known four-point correlators of half-BPS chiral\nprimary operators. By verifying that the Ward identities are satisfied, we\nconfirm the validity of the supergravity method.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
