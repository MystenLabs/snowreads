This paper presents GOALPlace, a new learning-based general approach\nto improving placement congestion by controlling cell density. Our method\nefficiently learns from an EDA tool's post-route optimized results and uses an\nempirical Bayes technique to adapt this goal/target to a specific placer's\nsolutions, effectively beginning with the end in mind. It enhances correlation\nwith the long-running heuristics of the tool's router and timing-opt engine --\nwhile solving placement globally without expensive incremental congestion\nestimation and mitigation methods. A statistical analysis with a new\nhierarchical netlist clustering establishes the importance of density and the\npotential for an adequate cell density target across placements. Our\nexperiments show that our method, integrated as a demonstration inside an\nacademic GPU-accelerated global placer, consistently produces macro and\nstandard cell placements of superior or comparable quality to commercial tools.\nOur empirical Bayes methodology also allows a substantial quality improvement\nover state-of-the-art academic mixed-size placers, achieving up to 10x fewer\ndesign rule check (DRC) violations, a 5% decrease in wirelength, and a 30% and\n60% reduction in worst and total negative slack (WNS/TNS).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
