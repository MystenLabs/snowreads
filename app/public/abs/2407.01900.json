As an\nexample, we show that the regular soliton solutions of the (good) Boussinesq\nequation as the 3-reduction can have $at ~most$ one resonant soliton in\naddition to two sets of solitons propagating in opposite directions. We also\ngive a systematic construction of these soliton solutions for the\n$\\ell$-reductions using the vertex operators. In particular, we show that the\n$non-crossing$ permutation gives the regularity condition for the soliton\nsolutions.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
