Existing market designs fail to\ninternalize and systematically assess the risk of extreme and rare events. With\nthe increasing deployment of renewable generation, electric power systems\nbecome increasingly dependent on weather changes. Efficiently maintaining the\nreliability of renewable-dominant power systems during extreme weather events\nrequires co-optimizing system resources, while differentiating between\nlarge/rare and small/frequent deviations from forecast conditions. To address\nthis research and practice gap, we propose efficiently managing the\nuncertainties associated with extreme weather events through the integration of\nlarge deviation theory into chance constraints (LDT-CC). We integrate extreme\nevent statistics into market-clearing, via including LDT-CC to model and price\nreserve to cope with extreme events, and use weighted chance constraints (WCC)\nto reduce solution conservatism. We prove that the proposed market design is\ncapable of producing a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on an\nillustrative system and a modified 8-zone ISO New England system demonstrate\nthe usefulness of the proposed pricing mechanism.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
