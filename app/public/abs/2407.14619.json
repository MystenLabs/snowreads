In this paper, we study the curvature exponent of\nsub-Finsler Heisenberg groups equipped with the Lebesgue measure. We prove that\n$N_{\\mathrm{curv}} \\geq 5$, and the equality holds if and only if the\ncorresponding sub-Finsler Heisenberg group is actually sub-Riemannian.\nFurthermore, we show that for every $N\\geq 5$, there is a sub-Finsler structure\non the Heisenberg group such that $N_{\\mathrm{curv}}=N$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
