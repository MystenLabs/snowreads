It explores how optical flow and its applications can be used to\ndetect moving objects when a camera undergoes translational motion,\nhighlighting the challenges encountered and the strategies used to overcome\nthem. Furthermore, the paper discusses not only the technical skills acquired\nby the student but also interpersonal skills as related to teamwork and\ndiversity. In this paper, we detail the learning process, including the\nacquisition of technical and problem-solving skills, as well as out-of-the-box\nthinking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
