This study aims to predict athletes' performance through five key\naspects: first, a mul-ti-classification model based on logistic regression was\nestablished, yielding probabilities of winning and losing the first serve at\n0.6734 and 0.3266, respectively, and validated with match 1701. Second, an\nunsupervised \"momentum\" evaluation model using AHP analytic hierarchy process\nshowed a strong correlation between \"momentum\" score and winning rate. Third, a\ntrend analysis model identified psychological factors as significantly\nimpacting re-sults. Fourth, the model's generalization was tested with\nadditional competition data, in-cluding women's tennis matches. Finally, data\nanalysis suggested that coaches should focus on improving mental toughness and\nserve-receive skills, as these significantly affect mo-mentum.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
