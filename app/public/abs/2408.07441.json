One of\nthe most promising ways to overcome it is via the streaming instability (SI).\nUnfortunately, the mechanism responsible for the onset of this instability\nremains mysterious. It has recently been shown that the SI is a Resonant Drag\nInstability (RDI) involving inertial waves. We build on this insight and\nclarify the physical picture of how the SI develops, while bolstering this\npicture with transparent mathematics. Like all RDIs, the SI is built on a\nfeedback loop: in the `forward action', an inertial wave concentrates dust into\nclumps; in the `backward reaction', those drifting dust clumps excite an\ninertial wave. Each process breaks into two mechanisms, a fast one and a slow\none. At resonance, each forward mechanism can couple with a backward mechanism\nto close a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the fast-fast loop is stable, so the\nSI uses the fast-slow and slow-fast loops. Despite this last layer of\ncomplexity, we hope that our explanation will help understand how the SI works,\nin which conditions it can grow, how it manifests itself, and how it saturates.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
