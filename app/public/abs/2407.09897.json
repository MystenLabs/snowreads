Analyzing dialogues and memory over\nmultiple sessions revealed significant issues such as repetition,\ninconsistency, and hallucination, exacerbated by the propagation of erroneous\ninformation. To combat these challenges, we propose a novel Screening,\nDiagnosis, and Regeneration (SDR) framework that detects and corrects utterance\nerrors through a comprehensive process involving immediate issue\nidentification, evidence gathering from past dialogues, and LLM analysis for\nutterance revision. By incorporating our SDR framework to Generative Agents\n(Park et al., 2023), we enhance the diversity, consistency, and factualness of\nthe generated dialogues. This work presents a pioneering approach to enhancing\ndialogue quality in multi-agent simulations, establishing a new standard for\nfuture research in the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
