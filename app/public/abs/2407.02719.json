Recent advancements have\nadapted pre-trained language models for this task. However, the scarcity of\ndomain-specific data and the deviation of concepts from their canonical names\noften hinder these models' effectiveness. To tackle this issue, we employ\nMetaMapLite, an existing rule-based concept mapping system, to generate\nadditional pseudo-annotated data from PubMed and PMC. The annotated data are\nused to augment the limited training data. Through extensive experiments, this\nstudy demonstrates the utility of a manually crafted concept mapping tool for\ntraining a better concept extraction model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
