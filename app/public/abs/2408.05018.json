The effect of CoS parameter $b$ has been\noutlined in comparison with Bardeen black hole lens. The impact parameter\nincreases as we increase the CoS parameter consequently more photons approach\ntowards lens. We also obtain magnification of relativistic images and determine\nrelativistic Einstein rings by using the parameters of two astrophysical black\nhole lenses $SgrA^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. We constrain CoS parameter of black hole\nusing EHT observations for these black holes. We also consider the time delay\nof signals in the presence of CoS parameter. It is significantly measurable for\nsupermassive black hole $M87^{*}$ than $SgrA^{*}$. This analysis would\nconstrain the Bardeen black hole in CoS as one of the candidates of primordial\ngravitational lens.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
