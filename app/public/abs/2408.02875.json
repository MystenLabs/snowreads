The source showed two flux levels\n(high and low), whose energy spectra can be described by the thermal\ncomptonization of disk photons. The spectral parameters obtained by the joint\nfitting of SXT/LAXPC and NICER/LAXPC were consistent. The power density spectra\nfrom LAXPC and NICER revealed a broad, prominent feature at approximately 2 Hz.\nThe energy dependence of the fractional R.M.S. and time lag of this feature\ncannot be explained by only variations of coronal spectral parameters. Instead,\na model where the coronal heating rate varies first and induces a change in the\ndisk temperature and inner radius can explain the variation. Our results\nunderline the importance of simultaneous observations by AstroSat and NICER and\nhighlight the need for more sophisticated models to explain the\nspectral-temporal behavior of black hole systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
