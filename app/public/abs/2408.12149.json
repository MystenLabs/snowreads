When multiple FHS deployed in the same geographical area hop into the\nsame frequency spot or location, it can result in multiple access interference\n(MAI), leading to performance degradation of the co-habiting FHMA systems.\nOrthogonal FHS (O-FHS) could be used to avoid such collisions even while\nmaintaining the pseudo-random hopping property. We propose a new Collision-Free\nBalanced Frequency Hopping Sequence (CFB-FHS) set based on $GF(p)$. The\nproposed algorithm generates a significantly longer O-FHS and ensures full-band\nhopping and uniform usage of all the available frequency spots, even while\npreserving the pseudo-random nature of the sequences. The Hamming correlation\nand these related properties of the proposed sequence set are analyzed and\ncompared with the existing sequence sets. The length of this CFB-FHS can be\nchosen based on the application requirements, and once selected, the length\nremains fixed irrespective of the family size of the sequence set.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"th7iskrZw-W6GLo8as9IQryqWnpm5DXviYkY6ryigkw","pdfSize":"739766"}
