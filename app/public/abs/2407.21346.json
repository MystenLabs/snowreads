For surfaces with point cloud representation, traditional\nmethod is difficult to apply due to the difficulty of mesh generating. Neural\nnetwork is easy to implement even for complicate geometry. Moreover, instead of\nsolving the original dynamic formulation, we consider the Hamiltonian flow\napproach, i.e. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system. Based on this approach, we can\nexploit mathematical structure of the optimal transport to construct the neural\nnetwork and the loss function can be simplified. Extensive numerical\nexperiments are conducted for surfaces with different geometry. We also test\nthe method for point cloud with noise, which shows stability of this method.\nThis method is also easy to generalize to diverse range of problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
