It is an active field that\nhas been revolutionized in the last few decades and whose implementations are\nremarkable in multiple applications that could affect daily life. Consequently,\nthe Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum (IberLEF) of 2024 held a competitive\nchallenge to leverage the SER results with a Spanish corpus. This paper\npresents the approach followed with the goal of participating in this\ncompetition. The main architecture consists of different pre-trained speech and\ntext models to extract features from both modalities, utilizing an attention\npooling mechanism. The proposed system has achieved the first position in the\nchallenge with an 86.69% in Macro F1-Score.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M8uW7HRStbSC3fEnAe4BQ6Wah-hZXSN-NzKWrExUodE","pdfSize":"1168680"}
