Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) methods have shown remarkable\nsuccess in modeling and understanding 3D scenes. Similarly, various 4D\nrepresentations have demonstrated the ability to capture the dynamics of the 4D\nworld. However, there is a dearth of research focusing on segmentation within\n4D representations. In this paper, we propose Segment Any 4D Gaussians (SA4D),\none of the first frameworks to segment anything in the 4D digital world based\non 4D Gaussians. In SA4D, an efficient temporal identity feature field is\nintroduced to handle Gaussian drifting, with the potential to learn precise\nidentity features from noisy and sparse input. Additionally, a 4D segmentation\nrefinement process is proposed to remove artifacts. Our SA4D achieves precise,\nhigh-quality segmentation within seconds in 4D Gaussians and shows the ability\nto remove, recolor, compose, and render high-quality anything masks.
