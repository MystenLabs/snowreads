For evaluation of electrical conductivity, we\nemploy two complementary methods; the Kubo-Greenwood formula and numerical\nanalytic continuation of the current-current correlation function. We apply the\ndeveloped method to Ag-Pd alloys and find that the results obtained by the\nWannier-CPA reasonably reproduce previous studies by the well-established CPA\nimplementation based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green's function method\n(KKR-CPA).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
