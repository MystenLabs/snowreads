Among them, our study resolves three obstacles: (1)\nMachine-learning force fields including long-range interactions able to capture\nthe finesse of the underlying atomic interactions, (2) Data-driven\ncharacterization of the local ordering in a complex structural landscape\nassociated with several crystal polymorphs and (3) Comparing results from a\nlarge range of temperatures using both brute-force and rare-event sampling.\nAltogether, our simulation strategy has allowed us to study zinc oxide\ncrystallization from nano-droplet melt. Remarkably, our results show that\ndifferent nucleation pathways compete depending on the investigated degree of\nsupercooling.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
