These loads introduce unwanted\nharmonics, leading to potential issues such as overheating and improper\nfunctioning of circuit breakers. In pursuing a more sustainable grid, the\nadoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and photovoltaic (PV) systems in\nresidential networks has increased. Understanding and examining the effects of\nhigh-order harmonic frequencies beyond $1.5$ kHz is crucial to understanding\ntheir impact on the operation and planning of electrical distribution systems\nunder varying nonlinear loading conditions. This study investigates a diverse\nset of critical power electronic loads within a household modeled using\nPSCAD/EMTdc, analyzing their unique harmonic spectra. This information is\nutilized to run the time-series harmonic analysis program in OpenDSS on a\nmodified IEEE 34 bus test system model. The impact of high-order harmonics is\nquantified using metrics that evaluate total harmonic distortion (THD),\ntransformer harmonic-driven eddy current loss component, and propagation of\nharmonics from the source to the substation transformer.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
