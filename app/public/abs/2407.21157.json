However, when the channels of the legitimate user and eavesdropper\nare highly correlated, FDA is limited by the frequency constraint and cannot\nprovide satisfactory security performance. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmovable FDA (MFDA) antenna technology where the positions of antennas can be\ndynamically adjusted in a given finite region. Specifically, we aim to maximize\nthe secrecy capacity by jointly optimizing the antenna beamforming vector,\nantenna frequency vector and antenna position vector. To solve this non-convex\noptimization problem with coupled variables, we develop a two-stage alternating\noptimization (AO) algorithm based on block successive upper-bound minimization\n(BSUM) method. Moreover, to evaluate the security performance provided by MFDA,\nwe introduce two benchmark schemes, i.e., phased array (PA) and FDA. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that MFDA can significantly enhance security performance\ncompared to PA and FDA. In particular, when the frequency constraint is strict,\nMFDA can further increase the secrecy capacity by adjusting the positions of\nantennas instead of the frequencies.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DGfmPpEFKReSCVt9CcSRln-AJueDQybvsgzk1rawITk","pdfSize":"521507"}
