In particular, a general rational smooth Fano threefold has\nbirational complexity zero. We argue that the three conditions: rationality,\ngenerality, and smoothness are indeed necessary for the theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
