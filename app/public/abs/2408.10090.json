However, FL\nalgorithms for constrained machine learning problems are still limited,\nparticularly when the projection step is costly. To this end, we propose a\nFederated Frank-Wolfe Algorithm (FedFW). FedFW features data privacy, low\nper-iteration cost, and communication of sparse signals. In the deterministic\nsetting, FedFW achieves an $\\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution within\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations for smooth and convex objectives, and\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-3})$ iterations for smooth but non-convex objectives.\nFurthermore, we present a stochastic variant of FedFW and show that it finds a\nsolution within $O(\\varepsilon^{-3})$ iterations in the convex setting. We\ndemonstrate the empirical performance of FedFW on several machine learning\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
