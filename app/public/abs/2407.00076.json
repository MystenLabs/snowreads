We give necessary\nconditions for an irreducible highest weight representation to be\nfinite-dimensional. We conjecture that these conditions are also sufficient and\nprove the conjecture for a class of representations with linear highest\nweights. The arguments are based on a new type of odd reflections for the\nYangian associated with ${\\frak{osp}}_{2|2}$. In the Appendix, we construct an\nisomorphism between the Yangians associated with the Lie superalgebras\n${\\frak{osp}}_{2|2}$ and ${\\frak{gl}}_{1|2}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
