Using atomistic simulations with classical thermostat and quantum\nthermal bath, we show that this kind of signal is consistent with energy\nrelease from long-term recombination events of complex defects that can be\nformed by any kind of nuclear recoil radiation events. The recombination events\nare shown to have a very similar exponential dependence of energy as that\nobserved in experiments. By detailed analysis of recombination events, we show\nthat crossing a low energy barrier ($\\lesssim$ 0.1 eV) can trigger larger\nenergy releases in an avalanche-like effect. This explains why large energy\nrelease events can occur even down to cryogenic temperatures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
