For a variety of situations, the\nlarger number of quiet/distant signals dominates the overall information over\nthe fewer loud/close sources, independent of how many model parameters are\nconsidered. We consider implications for a range of astrophysical scenarios,\nincluding calibration uncertainty and standard siren cosmology. However, the\nlarge number of additional events obtained by lowering the detection threshold\ncan rapidly increase costs. We introduce a simple analysis that balances the\ncosts of analyzing increasingly large numbers of low information events against\nretaining a higher threshold and running a survey for longer. With the caveat\nthat precise cost estimates are difficult to determine, current economics favor\nanalyzing low signal-to-noise ratio events. However, the higher detection rates\nexpected for next-generation detectors may argue for a higher signal-to-noise\nratio threshold for optimal scientific return.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
