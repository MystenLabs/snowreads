Conventional methods,\nwhich heavily depend on ground-based observations and radar data, are limited\nby issues such as decreased accuracy over greater distances and a high rate of\nfalse positives. To address these challenges, this study utilizes the Seamless\nHybrid Scan Reflectivity (SHSR) dataset from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor\n(MRMS) system, which integrates data from multiple radar sources to enhance\naccuracy. A novel hybrid model, the Kalman-Convolutional BiLSTM with Multi-Head\nAttention, is introduced to improve dynamic state estimation and capture both\nspatial and temporal dependencies within the data. This model demonstrates\nsuperior performance in precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy compared to\nmethods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and LightGBM. The results highlight\nthe considerable potential of advanced machine learning techniques to improve\ntornado prediction and reduce false alarm rates. Future research will focus on\nexpanding datasets, exploring innovative model architectures, and incorporating\nlarge language models (LLMs) to provide deeper insights. This research\nintroduces a novel model for tornado prediction, offering a robust framework\nfor enhancing forecasting accuracy and public safety.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
