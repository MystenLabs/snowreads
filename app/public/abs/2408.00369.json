In particular, we\ndetermine the exact cardinality of maximal complete $1$-systems of loops on\npunctured projective planes. To prove these results, we show that the\ncardinality of maximal systems of arcs pairwise-intersecting at most once on a\nnon-orientable surface is $2|\\chi|(|\\chi|+1)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
