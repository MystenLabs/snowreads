However, existing approaches\nand benchmarks primarily focus on the open vocabulary problem within the\ncontext of object classes, which is insufficient to provide a holistic\nevaluation to what extent a model understands the 3D scene. In this paper, we\nintroduce a more challenging task called Generalized Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene\nUnderstanding (GOV-3D) to explore the open vocabulary problem beyond object\nclasses. It encompasses an open and diverse set of generalized knowledge,\nexpressed as linguistic queries of fine-grained and object-specific attributes.\nTo this end, we contribute a new benchmark named OpenScan, which consists of 3D\nobject attributes across eight representative linguistic aspects, including\naffordance, property, material, and more. We further evaluate state-of-the-art\nOV-3D methods on our OpenScan benchmark, and discover that these methods\nstruggle to comprehend the abstract vocabularies of the GOV-3D task, a\nchallenge that cannot be addressed by simply scaling up object classes during\ntraining. We highlight the limitations of existing methodologies and explore a\npromising direction to overcome the identified shortcomings.
