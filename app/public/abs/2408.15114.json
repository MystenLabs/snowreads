Within the realm of 3D shape representation,\nNeural Signed Distance Functions (SDF) have demonstrated remarkable potential\nin faithfully encoding intricate shape geometry. However, learning SDFs from\nsparse 3D point clouds in the absence of ground truth supervision remains a\nvery challenging task. While recent methods rely on smoothness priors to\nregularize the learning, our method introduces a regularization term that\nleverages adversarial samples around the shape to improve the learned SDFs.\nThrough extensive experiments and evaluations, we illustrate the efficacy of\nour proposed method, highlighting its capacity to improve SDF learning with\nrespect to baselines and the state-of-the-art using synthetic and real data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
