Beyond capturing the key mechanisms underlying spontaneous brain\ndynamics, these models hold an exciting potential for understanding the\nmechanisms underlying the dynamics evoked by targeted brain-stimulation\ntechniques. This paper delves into this emerging application, using concepts\nfrom dynamical systems theory to argue that the stimulus-evoked dynamics in\nsuch experiments may be shaped by new types of mechanisms distinct from those\nthat dominate spontaneous dynamics. We review and discuss: (i) the targeted\nexperimental techniques across spatial scales that can both perturb the brain\nto novel states and resolve its relaxation trajectory back to spontaneous\ndynamics; and (ii) how we can understand these dynamics in terms of mechanisms\nusing physiological, phenomenological, and data-driven models. A tight\nintegration of targeted stimulation experiments with generative quantitative\nmodeling provides an important opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms of brain\ndynamics that are difficult to detect in spontaneous settings.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"t6ESj3bQT1oSUM73600HsCGpehJQXBSXCbK4WurjNpQ","pdfSize":"1293695"}
