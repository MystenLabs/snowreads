It was found that at $0.86 \\leq\nx \\leq 1.00$, the non-centrosymmetric tetragonal symmetry is preserved, while\npartial disorder appears in alternating Pt and Si of the hyper-honeycomb\nnetwork. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ was drastically\nreduced from 3.9 K to 1.5 K as $x$ varies from 1.0 to 0.86. Additionally, a\nhexagonal phase with an AlB$_{2}$-type structure ($P6/mmm$, $D_{6h}^{1}$,\n\\#191) has been discovered at $0.50 \\leq x \\leq 0.71$ with a honeycomb network\nof statistically distributed Pt and Si atoms. The hexagonal phase exhibited SC\nat $T_{\\rm c} = 0.38$ K. This system provides an opportunity to investigate the\nrelationship between topological electronic states, SC, and disorders\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1175_dP25Se-gpn0wBRw_sd0ZkY50NPSxB_lRi0kWrg","pdfSize":"2611743"}
