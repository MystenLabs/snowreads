These estimates are obtained\nthrough the construction of a large spectroscopic training set with parameters\nand abundances adjusted to uniform scales, and trained with a Kernel Principal\nComponent Analysis. Owing to the seven narrow/medium-band filters employed by\nJ-PLUS, we obtain precisions in the abundance estimates that are as good or\nbetter than derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy for stars covering a\nwide range of the parameter space: 0.10-0.20 dex for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], and\n0.05 dex for [Mg/Fe] and [$\\alpha$/Fe]. Moreover, systematic errors due to the\ninfluence of molecular carbon bands on previous photometric-metallicity\nestimates (which only included two narrow/medium-band blue filters) have now\nbeen removed, resulting in photometric-metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H]\n$\\sim -4.0$, with typical uncertainties of 0.25 dex and 0.40 dex for dwarfs and\ngiants, respectively. This large photometric sample should prove useful for the\nexploration of the assembly and chemical-evolution history of our Galaxy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
