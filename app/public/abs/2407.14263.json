Focusing on a millimeter-scale graphite\ncylinder as a prototypical curved object, we perform longitudinal and Hall\nvoltage measurements while applying quantizing magnetic fields. These\nmeasurements are investigated as a function of field strength and angles. Most\nimportantly, we find that angle-dependent Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations are\nsuperimposed with angle-independent features. Reproducing the experimental\nobservations, we introduce a network model that accounts for the cylindrical\ngeometry effect by conceptualizing the cylinder as composed of strips of planar\ngraphite in an effectively inhomogeneous magnetic field. Our work highlights\nhow the interplay between geometric curvature and quantizing magnetic fields\ncan be leveraged to engineer tunable spatial current densities within\nsolid-state systems, and paves the way for understanding transport properties\nof curved and bent three-dimensional samples more generally.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
