Despite the promise of social media data for depression detection,\nthe opacity of employed deep learning models hinders interpretability and\nraises bias concerns. We address this challenge by introducing ProtoDep, a\nnovel, explainable framework for Twitter-based depression detection. ProtoDep\nleverages prototype learning and the generative power of Large Language Models\nto provide transparent explanations at three levels: (i) symptom-level\nexplanations for each tweet and user, (ii) case-based explanations comparing\nthe user to similar individuals, and (iii) transparent decision-making through\nclassification weights. Evaluated on five benchmark datasets, ProtoDep achieves\nnear state-of-the-art performance while learning meaningful prototypes. This\nmulti-faceted approach offers significant potential to enhance the reliability\nand transparency of depression detection on social media, ultimately aiding\nmental health professionals in delivering more informed care.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MhLh-MqB1inua9vHDseESe531Mset58lvFmXPddcJKw","pdfSize":"8646402"}
