To address this challenge, we propose PromptCCD, a simple yet\neffective framework that utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as a prompting\nmethod for CCD. At the core of PromptCCD lies the Gaussian Mixture Prompting\n(GMP) module, which acts as a dynamic pool that updates over time to facilitate\nrepresentation learning and prevent forgetting during category discovery.\nMoreover, GMP enables on-the-fly estimation of category numbers, allowing\nPromptCCD to discover categories in unlabeled data without prior knowledge of\nthe category numbers. We extend the standard evaluation metric for Generalized\nCategory Discovery (GCD) to CCD and benchmark state-of-the-art methods on\ndiverse public datasets. PromptCCD significantly outperforms existing methods,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness.
