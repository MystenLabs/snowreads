For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say $A$\n\\textit{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one\nvertex of $A$ in $G$. A vertex partition $\\pi = \\{V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k\\}$ of\n$G$ is called a \\emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates\n$V_j$ for all $1\\leq i<j\\leq k$. A vertex partition $\\pi = \\{V_1, V_2, \\ldots,\nV_k\\}$ of $G$ is called a \\emph{tournament transitive partition} of size $k$ if\n$V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\\leq i<j\\leq k$ and $V_j$ does not dominate\n$V_i$ for $i<j$. The maximum integer $k$ for which the above partition exists\nis called \\emph{tournament transitivity} of $G$, and it is denoted by $TTr(G)$.\nThe \\textsc{Maximum Tournament Transitivity Problem} is to find a tournament\ntransitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. In this\narticle, we study this variation of transitive partition from a structure and\nalgorithmic point of view. We show that the decision version of this problem is\nNP-complete for chordal graphs (connected), perfect elimination bipartite\ngraphs (disconnected) and doubly chordal graphs (disconnected). On the positive\nside, we prove that this problem can be solved in polynomial time for trees.\nFurthermore, we characterize \\textup{Type-I BCG} with equal transitivity and\ntournament transitivity and find some sufficient conditions under which the\nabove two parameters are equal for a \\textup{Type-II BCG}. Finally, we show\nthat for \\textup{Type-III BCG}, these two parameters are never equal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
