However, no inquiry has yet been made on the impact\nof prompt selection on labelling accuracy. In this study, we show that\nperformance greatly varies between prompts, and we apply the method of\nautomatic prompt optimization to systematically craft high quality prompts. We\nalso provide the community with a simple, browser-based implementation of the\nmethod at https://prompt-ultra.github.io/ .\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
