However, the\ncomplex and uncertain dynamical environment around them contributes to a rapid\ndispersion of uncertainty and the emergence of non-Gaussian distributions.\nTherefore, to ensure safe operations, a precise understanding of uncertainty\npropagation becomes imperative. In this work, the dynamical environment is\nanalyzed around two asteroids, Apophis, which will perform a close flyby to\nEarth in 2029, and Eros, which has been already explored by past missions. The\nperformance of different uncertainty propagation methods (Linear Covariance\nPropagation, Unscented Transformation, and Polynomial Chaos Expansion) are\ncompared in various scenarios of close-proximity operations around the two\nasteroids. Findings are discussed in terms of propagation accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency depending on the dynamical environment. By exploring\nthese methodologies, this work contributes to the broader goal of ensuring the\nsafety and effectiveness of spacecraft operations during close-proximity\nexploration of small celestial bodies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
