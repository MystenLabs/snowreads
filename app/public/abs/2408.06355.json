We begin by examining real-life situations,\ntermed as scenarios, that involve ethical dilemmas. Users engage with these\nscenarios, making decisions on how to act and providing justifications for\ntheir choices. We adopt a dispositional approach to represent these scenarios\nand the interaction with the users. Dispositions are properties that are\ninstantiated by any kind of entity and that may manifest if properly triggered.\nIn particular, the dispositional properties we are interested in are the\nethical and behavioural ones. The approach will be described by means of\nexamples. The ultimate goal is to implement the results of this work into a\nsoftware exoskeleton solution aimed at augmenting human capabilities by\npreserving their soft-ethical preferences in interactions with autonomous\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u9iXhHqnNqPK1B6SZ0_sb8lj1MLtJwzBdPARxRiWyMM","pdfSize":"877559"}
