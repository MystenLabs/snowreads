Methods: This retrospective study (2020-2023) included 385\nanonymized 3D TOF-MRI images from 364 patients (mean age 59 years, 60% female)\nat multiple centers plus 113 subjects from the ADAM challenge. Images featured\nuntreated or possible UICAs and differential diagnoses. Four distinct training\ndatasets were created, and the nnU-Net framework was used for model\ndevelopment. Performance was assessed on a separate test set using sensitivity\nand False Positive (FP)/case rate for detection, and DICE score and NSD\n(Normalized Surface Distance) with a 0.5mm threshold for segmentation.\nStatistical analysis included chi-square, Mann-Whitney-U, and Kruskal-Wallis\ntests, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results: Models achieved overall\nsensitivity between 82% and 85% and a FP/case rate of 0.20 to 0.31, with no\nsignificant differences (p = 0.90 and p = 0.16). The primary model showed 85%\nsensitivity and 0.23 FP/case rate, outperforming the ADAM-challenge winner\n(61%) and a nnU-Net trained on ADAM data (51%) in sensitivity (p < 0.05). It\nachieved a mean DICE score of 0.73 and an NSD of 0.84 for correctly detected\nUICA. Conclusions: Our open-source, nnU-Net-based AI model (available at\n10.5281/zenodo.13386859) demonstrates high sensitivity, low false positive\nrates, and consistent segmentation accuracy for UICA detection and segmentation\nin 3D TOF-MRI, suggesting its potential to improve clinical diagnosis and for\nmonitoring of UICA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
