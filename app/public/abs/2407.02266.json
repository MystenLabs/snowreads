We prove that eigenvalues to first order in the\ndispersion parameter are given by shifted symmetric functions. The proof is\nbased on the boson-fermion correspondence and an analysis of quartic\nexpressions in fermions. As an application, we obtain a new closed evaluation\nof certain double Hodge integrals on the moduli spaces of curves. Finally, we\nprovide an explicit formula for the eigenvectors to first order in the\ndispersion parameter. In particular, we show that its Schur expansion is\nsupported on partitions for which the Hamming distance is minimal.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
