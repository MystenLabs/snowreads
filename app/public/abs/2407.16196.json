Two of these, the Ziman and the\nPoiseuille, are hydrodynamic regimes in which collision among phonons are\nmostly Normal. It has been difficult to observe them, save for a few insulators\nwith high levels of isotopic and chemical purity. Our thermal transport\nmeasurements, covering four decades of temperatures between 0.1 K and 900 K,\nreveal that sapphire displays all four regimes, despite its isotopic impurity.\nIn the Ziman regime, the thermal conductivity exponentially increases attaining\nan amplitude as large as 35,000 W/Km. We show that the peak thermal\nconductivity of ultra-pure, simple insulators, including diamond, silicon and\nsolid helium, is set by a universal scaling depending on isotropic purity. The\nthermal conductivity of sapphire is an order of magnitude higher than what is\nexpected by this scaling. We argue that this may be caused by the proximity of\noptical and acoustic phonon modes, as a consequence of the large number of\natoms in the primitive cell.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
