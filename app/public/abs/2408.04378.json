The goal of this shared task is to generate\nChinese metaphors using machine learning techniques and effectively identifying\nbasic components of metaphorical sentences. It is divided into two subtasks: 1)\nMetaphor Generation, which involves creating a metaphor from a provided tuple\nconsisting of TENOR, GROUND, and VEHICLE. The goal here is to synthesize a\nmetaphor that connects the subject (i.e. TENOR) with the object (i.e. VEHICLE),\nguided by the concept of the GROUND. 2) Metaphor Components Identification,\nwhich extracts the most fitting TENORs, GROUNDs, and VEHICLEs from a\nmetaphorical sentence. This component requires the identification of the most\nfitting metaphor elements that correspond to the specified grounds. In addition\nto overall results, we report on the setup and insights from the metaphor\ngeneration shared task, which attracted a total of 4 participating teams across\nboth subtasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
