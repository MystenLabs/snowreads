This work builds upon and extends previous\ninvestigations. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to sensitivity\nanalysis in MOLP, designed to be computationally feasible for decision-makers\nstudying the behavior of efficient solutions under perturbations of objective\nfunction coefficients in a two-dimensional variable space. This approach\nclassifies all MOLP problems in $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by defining an\nequivalence relation that partitions the space of linear maps$-$comprising all\nsequences of linear forms on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ of length $K \\geq 2-$into a finite\nnumber of equivalence classes. Each equivalence class is associated with a\nunique subset of the boundary of $S$. For any MOLP with $K$ objective functions\nbelonging to the same equivalence class, its set of efficient solutions\ncorresponds to the associated subset of the boundary of $S$. This approach is\ndetailed and illustrated with a numerical example.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Nro5MEh0Rf7FjzvMLGqgsdMEabLjiowKM-2jzos7iko","pdfSize":"788301"}
