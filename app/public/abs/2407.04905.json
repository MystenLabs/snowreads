It is applied to enhance wireless communication systems as a\ncustomizable signal reflector. However, RIS can also be adversely employed to\ndisrupt the existing communication systems by introducing new types of\nvulnerability to the physical layer. We consider the \\emph{RIS-In-The-Middle\n(RITM) attack}, in which an adversary uses RIS to jeopardize the direct channel\nbetween two transceivers by providing an alternative one with higher signal\nquality. This adversary can eavesdrop on all exchanged data by the legitimate\nusers, but also perform a false data injection to the receiver. This work\ndevises anti-attack techniques based on a non-reciprocal channel produced by a\ndefensive RIS (D-RIS). The proposed precoding and combining methods and the\nchannel estimation procedure for a non-reciprocal link are effective against\npotential adversaries while keeping the existing advantages of the RIS. We\nanalyse the robustness of the system against attacks in terms of achievable\nsecrecy rate and probability of detecting fake data. We believe that this\ndefensive role of RIS can be a basis for new protocols and algorithms in the\narea.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
