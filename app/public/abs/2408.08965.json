After considering\nthe channel couplings among the $\\bar{D}K$, $\\bar{D}^*K$, $\\bar{D}K^*$ and\n$\\bar{D}^*K^*$ and the width of the $K^*$ meson, the masses and widths of the\n$S$-wave pole $T_{cs0+}(2900)$ and two $P$-wave poles $T_{cs1-}(2900)$ and\n$T^{\\prime}_{cs1-}(2900)$ coincide with those of the $X_0(2900)$ and\n$X_1(2900)$ remarkably, which provides strong support for identifying\n$X_0(2900)$ and $X_1(2900)$ as $\\bar{D}^{(*)}K^{(*)}$ dimeson states.\nFurthermore, we extensively calculate all $S$-wave and $P$-wave\n$\\bar{D}^{(*)}K^{(*)}$ systems up to $J=3$ and predict four new isoscalar\ncharmed-strange dimeson-type tetraquark states: an $S$-wave state\n$T_{cs1+}(2900)$ with quantum number $J^P=1^+$, three $P$-wave states\n$T_{cs1-}(2760)$ with $J^P=1^-$, $T_{cs0-}(2760)$ with $J^P=0^-$ and\n$T_{cs2-}(2900)$ with $J^P=2^-$. These near-threshold poles can be searched for\nat LHCb, Belle II and BESIII.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
