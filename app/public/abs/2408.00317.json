We study this result under an asymmetric\ntwo-candidate setup, where supporters of both candidates may have different\nparticipation costs.\n  When the decision to abstain is fully rational i.e., when the vote pivotality\nis the probability of a tie, the only equilibrium outcome is a trivial\nequilibrium where all voters except those with zero voting cost, abstain. We\npropose and analyze a more practical, boundedly rational model where voters\noverestimate their pivotality, and show that under this model, non-trivial\nequilibria emerge where the winning probability of both candidates is bounded\naway from one.\n  We show that when the pivotality estimate strongly depends on the margin of\nvictory, victory is not assured to any candidate in any non-trivial\nequilibrium, regardless of population size and in contrast to Condorcet's\nassertion. Whereas, under a weak dependence on margin, Condorcet's Jury theorem\nis restored.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
