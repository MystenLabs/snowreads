This\nDressian is the support of a polyhedral complex $\\mathcal{Dr}(M)$ whose open\ncells correspond 1-1 with matroid subdivisions of the matroid polytope of $M$.\nWe present upper bounds on the number of cells and the dimension of\n$\\mathcal{Dr}(M)$. For matroids $M$ of rank $r\\geq 3$ on $n$ elements we show\nthat $$ \\ln\\#\\mathcal{Dr}(M)\\leq {\\binom{n}{r}}\nO\\left(\\frac{\\ln(n)^2}{n}\\right)\\text{ as\n}n\\rightarrow\\infty,\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad\\dim \\mathcal{Dr}(M)\\leq\n{\\binom{n}{r}}\\frac{3}{n-r+3},$$ as well as some more detailed bounds that\nincorporate structural properties of such $M$. For uniform matroids $M=U(r,n)$,\nthese upper bounds are comparable to lower bounds derived from valuations that\nare constructed from sparse paving matroids.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
