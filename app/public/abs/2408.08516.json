These complexities pose significant challenges to\ntraditional decision-making frameworks. Addressing this, we propose a\nhierarchical reinforcement learning framework integrated with multilevel graph\nrepresentations, which effectively comprehends and models the spatiotemporal\ninteractions among vehicles navigating through uncertain traffic conditions\nwith varying decision-making systems. Rooted in multilevel graph representation\ntheory, our approach encapsulates spatiotemporal relationships inherent in\nnon-Euclidean spaces. A weighted graph represents spatiotemporal features\nbetween nodes, addressing the degree imbalance inherent in dynamic graphs. We\nintegrate asynchronous parallel hierarchical reinforcement learning with a\nmultilevel graph representation and a multi-head attention mechanism, which\nenables connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to exhibit capabilities akin to\nhuman cognition, facilitating consistent decision-making across various\ncritical dimensions. The proposed decision-making strategy is validated in\nchallenging environments characterized by high density, randomness, and\ndynamism on highway roads. We assess the performance of our framework through\nablation studies, comparative analyses, and spatiotemporal trajectory\nevaluations. This study presents a quantitative analysis of decision-making\nmechanisms mirroring human cognitive functions in the realm of heterogeneous\nmixed autonomy, promoting the development of multi-dimensional decision-making\nstrategies and a sophisticated distribution of attentional resources.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
