We generate $10^6$\nsimulated light curves to reproduce the radio variability characteristics of\nPKS~J0805$-$0111, and show that the global probability, considering the\n\\textit{look-elsewhere effect}, indicates that the observed periodicity can be\nattributed to the red noise tail of the power spectral density, with a $p_0$\nvalue of $7.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ (i.e. 3.78$\\sigma$). PKS J0805$-$0111 displays\nall six characteristics observed in PKS 2131$-$021. Taking into account the\nwell-defined OVRO sample size, the false positive probability $\\sim 0.22$, but\nthe rare behavior makes this a strong SMBHB candidate. The discovery of a\nsecond SMBHB candidate exhibiting these rare characteristics reveals that\nPKS~2131$-$021 is not a unique, isolated case. With these two strong cases we\nare clearly seeing only the tip of the iceberg. We estimate that the number of\nSMBHB candidates amongst blazars $\\sim$ 1 in 100.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9XL4TNjX9cCqq2nrQC-76Eiav-JYIGRAetCq6ifrc8Y","pdfSize":"8442914"}
