Starting with such an action, and relying only on\ngeometric arguments, we show that all finite generating sets resulting from\ntaking large enough balls (as in the \\v{S}varc-Milnor lemma) in the respective\ninjective space yield word metrics where pseudo-Anosov maps are exponentially\ngeneric. We also show that growth tightness holds true for the Cayley graphs\ncorresponding to these finite generating sets, providing a positive answer to a\nquestion by Arzhantseva, Cashen and Tao, who asked if any of the mapping class\ngroup's Cayley graphs is growth tight. To achieve the above results, we\nconsider the space of all geometric actions of a mapping class group, and for\nany injective metric space in this collection, we construct a sequence of word\nmetrics that converges to it and show that all large enough terms of the\nconverging sequence inherit many desirable properties from the limiting\ninjective space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
