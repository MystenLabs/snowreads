This method allows\na lightweight, unimodal student spiking neural network (SNN) to extract rich\nknowledge from an event-frame multimodal teacher network. The core strength of\nthis approach is its ability to utilize the ample, coarser temporal cues found\nin conventional frames for effective emotion recognition. Consequently, our\nmethod adeptly interprets both temporal and spatial information from the\nconventional frame domain, eliminating the need for specialized sensing\ndevices, e.g., event-based camera. The effectiveness of our approach is\nthoroughly demonstrated using both existing and our compiled single-eye emotion\nrecognition datasets, achieving unparalleled performance in accuracy and\nefficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
