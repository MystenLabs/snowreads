Typically, it is an easy exercise to prove\nconnectivity of a flip graph. In stark contrast, the connectivity of the flip\ngraph of plane spanning paths on point sets in general position has been an\nopen problem for more than 16 years.\n  In order to provide new insights, we investigate certain induced subgraphs.\nFirstly, we provide tight bounds on the diameter and the radius of the flip\ngraph of spanning paths on points in convex position with one fixed endpoint.\nSecondly, we show that so-called suffix-independent paths induce a connected\nsubgraph. Consequently, to answer the open problem affirmatively, it suffices\nto show that each path can be flipped to some suffix-independent path. Lastly,\nwe investigate paths where one endpoint is fixed and provide tools to flip to\nsuffix-independent paths. We show that these tools are strong enough to show\nconnectivity of the flip graph of plane spanning paths on point sets with at\nmost two convex layers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
