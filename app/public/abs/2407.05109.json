The statistics of the peaks determines the\nabundance of PBHs, and is related to the amplitude of the primordial curvature\nspectrum. We study single field inflationary models with local features of the\ninflaton potential which induce a growth of curvature perturbations on\nsuper-horizon scales, which can increase the spectrum, and consequently the\npredicted PBHs abundance. We compute the effects of the different parameters of\nthe features on the PBHs abundance, giving some example of models compatible\nwith observational constraints. The mechanism is general, and can induce the\nPBH production in diffent mass ranges by appropriately tuning the parameters,\nand we give a specific example producing PBHs with abundance compatible with\nasteroid mass constraints.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aGWGwGc0iSzpRpEPYq09WuBJz2_nmF7QKEVyyFkbUz0","pdfSize":"640940"}
