A fraction $f \\sim 50\\%$ of Ag leads to a factor of $20$\nincrease in the residual resistivity, and a $40$ fold enhancement in the\ncoefficient of linear $T$ resistivity, with respect to Au. Since Au and Ag both\nhave weak electron-phonon coupling we surmise that the huge enhancements arise\nfrom a moderately large electron-phonon coupling that may emerge at the Ag-Au\ninterface. We construct nanocluster configurations for varying $f$ in two\ndimensions, define a Holstein model on it with weak coupling on the `interior'\nsites and a strong coupling on the interfacial sites, and solve the model\nthrough exact diagonalisation based Langevin dynamics. Computing the\nresistivity, we observe a large $T=0$ increase with $f$ and also a linear $T$\nenhancement factor of $\\sim 30$. While the enhancement factors are parameter\nchoice dependent, our key qualitative result is that the interface physics is\ninhomogeneous, with widely varying distortions, and different segments of the\ninterface dictate the residual resistivity and the thermal scattering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ldxCl0ZDXPZykELCKXIOJMT-oRSjVLN2bz18vvTtmxE","pdfSize":"816477"}
