Among them, the study of incidence problems over\nfinite fields have received a considerable amount of attention in recent years.\n  In this paper, by characterizing the singular values and singular vectors of\nthe corresponding incidence matrix through group algebras, we prove a bound on\nthe number of incidences between points and varieties of a certain form over\nfinite fields. Our result leads to a new incidence bound for points and flats\nin finite geometries, which improves previous results for certain parameter\nregimes. As another application of our point-variety incidence bound, we prove\na result on pinned distance problems by Phuong et al. and Cilleruelo et al.\nunder a weaker condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
