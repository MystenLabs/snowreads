Our main\nresult is that the matricial dimension of a numerical semigroup is at most its\nmultiplicity (the least generator), greatly improving upon the previous upper\nbound (the conductor). For many numerical semigroups, including all symmetric\nnumerical semigroups, our upper bound is tight.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
