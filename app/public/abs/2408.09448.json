In this paper, we use a result of Brownawell and Masser to\nprove effective results related to the Diophantine equations concerning linear\nrecurrence sequences and $S$-units. In particular, we provide a finiteness\nresult for the solutions of the Diophantine equation $U_{n_1} + \\cdots +\nU_{n_r} \\in \\mathcal{O}_S^*$ in nonnegative integers $n_1, \\ldots, n_r$.\nFurthermore, we study the finiteness result of the Diophantine equation\n$U_{n_1}^{(1)}+ U_{n_2}^{(2)}+\\cdots+U_{n_k}^{(k)} = 0$ in $(n_1, \\ldots,\nn_k)\\in \\N^k$, where $U_n^{(1)}, \\ldots, U_n^{(k)}$ are simple linear\nrecurrence sequences in the function field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
