Although Mellin space is usually the most\nefficient setting for imposing these contraints, four-point functions in two\ndimensions have thus far been an exception due to their more intricate\ndependence on the conformal cross-ratios. In this paper, we introduce a simple\nfix which exploits the relation between a parity-odd conformal block in two\ndimensions and a parity-even conformal block in four dimensions. We then apply\nthe resulting toolkit to a study of the paradigmatic holographic theory in two\ndimensions which is the D1-D5 CFT. For correlators involving Kaluza-Klein modes\nof the tensor multiplet, this analysis reproduces results which were previously\nobtained using hidden conformal symmetry. With four Kaluza-Klein modes of the\ngraviton multiplet, it yields new results including a compact formula for the\ncorrelators of all pairwise identical operators,\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yJzKe3hn4Iu1yALnsFopv2K6mFfhShlXWB1RU1XL6gs","pdfSize":"867731"}
