In this framework, since the convergence of the Robin eigenvalues\nto the Dirichlet ones is known, we address the question of quantifying the rate\nof such convergence. More precisely, in this work we identify the proper\ngeometric quantity representing (asymptotically) the first term in the\nexpansion of the eigenvalue variation: it is a novel notion of torsional\nrigidity. Then, by performing a suitable asymptotic analysis of both such\nquantity and its minimizer, we prove the first-order expansion of any Robin\neigenvalue, in the Dirichlet limit. Moreover, the convergence rate of the\ncorresponding eigenfunctions is obtained as well. We remark that all our\nspectral estimates are explicit and sharp, and cover both the cases of\nconvergence to simple and multiple Dirichlet eigenvalues.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
