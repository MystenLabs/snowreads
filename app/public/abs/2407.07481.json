From the apparent magnitude of the horizontal branch in Tri\nIV, the heliocentric distance of Tri IV is estimated to be $932^{+49}_{-43}$\nkpc, indicating that Tri IV is located at the distance of $75^{+48}_{-40}$ kpc\nfrom the M33 center. This means that Tri IV is the probable satellite of M33,\nbecause its distance from M33 is within the virial radius of M33. We also\nestimate its surface brightness of $\\mu_{\\it V} = 29.72^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$, and half-light radius of $r_h = 1749^{+523}_{-425}$ pc,\nsuggesting that Tri IV is an ultra-diffuse galaxy or dynamically heated galaxy.\nThe surface brightness of Tri IV is too low to be detected in the previous\nsurvey, so this detection suggests that much fainter satellites may be present\nin the outskirts of M33.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
