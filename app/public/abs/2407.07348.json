The\nintroduction of the parameter $\\rho$ may be particularly useful for those\nseeking to refine bounds, or align results from different sources, in the\nanalysis of stochastic processes and concentration inequalities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
