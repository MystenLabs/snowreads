While polaritons are at the source\nof most of the observed physics, the mirrors forming the cavity may also\nthemselves be responsible for a number of phenomena, independently of the\nstrong light-matter coupling regime. Here we use a toy model of a chain of\ndipolar emitters coupled to a cuboidal cavity. We unveil several effects\noriginating solely from the boundary conditions imposed by the cavity mirrors,\nthat are dominant when the distances of the emitters to the cavity walls are of\nthe order of the interdipole separation. In particular, we show that mirrors in\nthe direction transverse to the chain may act as effective defects, leading to\nthe emergence of Tamm edge states. Considering a topological chain, we\ndemonstrate that such transverse mirrors may also protect edge states against\nthe effects of the strong light-matter coupling. Finally, we find that mirrors\nparallel to the chain, by the image charges they involve, induce topological\nphase transitions even in the case of highly off-resonant photons.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
