The boundary of the\nisland is given by the quantum extremal surface, whose position is determined\nso that the entanglement entropy is extremized. In many cases of stationary\nblack holes and a few cases of evaporating black holes, it was already\nconfirmed that the quantum extremal surface is located outside the horizon for\nstationary black holes and is inside the horizon for evaporating black holes.\nIn this paper, we calculate islands in general black holes and show that the\nisland extends to the outside of the horizon for stationary black holes but is\nhidden inside the horizon for evaporating black holes independent of details of\nthe black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
