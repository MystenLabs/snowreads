Here we show that a parity-violating galaxy\nfour-point correlation function may be induced by lensing by a chiral\ngravitational-wave background. We estimate the amplitude of a signal that would\nbe detectable with a current galaxy survey, taking into account constraints to\nthe primordial gravitational-wave-background amplitude. We find that this\nmechanism is unlikely to produce a signal large enough to be seen with a galaxy\nsurvey but note that it may come within reach with future 21cm observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
