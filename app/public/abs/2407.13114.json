The rate at which a\nnumber approaches normality is quantified by the classical notion of\ndiscrepancy, which indicates how far the scaling of the number by powers of $b$\nis from being equidistributed modulo 1. This rate is known as the discrepancy\nof a normal number. The Champernowne constant $c_{10} =\n0.12345678910111213141516\\ldots$ is the most well-known example of a normal\nnumber. In 1986, Schiffer provided the discrepancy of numbers in a family that\nincludes the Champernowne constant. His proof relies on exponential sums. Here,\nwe present a discrete and elementary proof specifically for the discrepancy of\nthe Champernowne constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
