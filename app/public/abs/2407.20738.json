Outer Product Gradient (OPG) is an popular approach.\nHowever, because of focusing the mean regression function, OPG may ignore some\ndirections of central subspace (CS) when the distribution of errors is\nsymmetric about zero. The mode of a distribution can provide an important\nsummary of data. A Local Modal OPG (LMOPG) and its algorithm through mode\nregression are proposed to estimate the basis of CS with skew errors\ndistribution. The estimator shows the consistent and asymptotic normal\ndistribution under some mild conditions. Monte Carlo simulation is used to\nevaluate the performance and demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the\nproposed method.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
