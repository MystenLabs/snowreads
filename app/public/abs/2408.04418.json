By\nsuitably engineering the S-A interaction Hamiltonian, a dark factorized\ncompound state is found that achieves effective noise cancellation and\nsignificantly preserves quantum coherence in the target system S. We illustrate\nour methodology for a system $S$ consisting of two-mode Bosons trapped in a\ndouble-well potential and affected by decoherence through a\nGorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation. By a suitable\ncoupling of the system $S$ with an ancillary two-mode system of the same kind\nof S via a density-density interaction, we enhance the resilience of the system\nNOON state, a quantum-mechanical many-body entangled state crucial for quantum\ncomputing. We further explore potential experimental implementations of the\nproposed noise cancellation technique, focusing on configurations involving\ndipole-dipole interactions in optical lattices. Finally, we propose a numerical\noptimization protocol that learns the system A and its interaction with S to\nmaximize the survival probability of specific quantum states which can be\npotentially used in more generic quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YQMcX9XQyrLlp-oGpqFCIylT0f7C0s_VGjzXFCcEzb4","pdfSize":"1717527"}
