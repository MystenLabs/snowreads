With the current star formation rate\n(SFR), ($65\\pm4)$% of the observed stellar mass is reproduced in the\ncosmological time of 13.8 billion years. The neutral gas reserves in the Local\nVolume with a radius of 11 Mpc will facilitate the current SFR on a scale of\napproximately another 5 billion years.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
