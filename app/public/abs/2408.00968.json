While many security proposals have been made in practice and previous\nliterature, they typically suffer from deployability barriers and/or inadequate\nsecurity properties. The absence of a broadly adopted security solution between\nresolvers and nameservers motivates a new scheme that mitigates these issues in\nprevious proposals. We present DNSSEC+, which addresses security and\ndeployability downsides of DNSSEC, while retaining its benefits. DNSSEC+ takes\nadvantage of the existent DNSSEC trust model and authorizes the nameservers\nwithin a zone for short intervals to serve the zone data securely, facilitating\nreal-time security properties for DNS responses, without requiring long-term\nprivate keys to be duplicated (thus put at risk) on authoritative nameservers.\nRegarding name resolution latency, DNSSEC+ offers a performance comparable to\nless secure schemes. We define nine security, privacy, and deployability\nproperties for name resolution, and show how DNSSEC+ fulfills these properties.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
