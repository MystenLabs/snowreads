Inspired by the organizational principles underlying\nhippocampal-neocortical systems, we present a navigation-based approach to\nmanifold learning using memory and context. The key insight is to navigate on\nthe manifold and memorize the positions of each route as inductive/design bias\nof direct-fit-to-nature. We name it navigation-based because our approach can\nbe interpreted as navigating in the latent space of sensorimotor learning via\nmemory (local maps) and context (global indexing). The indexing to the library\nof local maps within global coordinates is collected by an associative memory\nserving as the librarian, which mimics the coupling between the hippocampus and\nthe neocortex. In addition to breaking from the notorious bias-variance dilemma\nand the curse of dimensionality, we discuss the biological implementation of\nour navigation-based learning by episodic and semantic memories in neural\nsystems. The energy efficiency of navigation-based learning makes it suitable\nfor hardware implementation on non-von Neumann architectures, such as the\nemerging in-memory computing paradigm, including spiking neural networks and\nmemristor neural networks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"oFIX9ghKaEJ0Jf5W2IyWGRrIMWZ05KXg6Rmvd8LWQdI","pdfSize":"885722"}
