Despite extensive static studies, the nature of these\nexotic electronic orders remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the\nnon-equilibrium electronic structure of CsV3Sb5 via time- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy. Our results reveal that upon laser excitation, the\nvan Hove singularities immediately shift towards the Fermi level and\nsubsequently oscillate in sync with a 1.3 THz coherent phonon mode. By\nanalyzing the coherent intensity oscillations in the energy-momentum (E-k) map,\nwe find that this coherent phonon is strongly coupled with electronic bands\nfrom both Sb and V orbitals. While typically observable only in the CDW state,\nremarkably, we find that the 1.3-THz coherent phonon mode can be persistently\nexcited at temperatures above T_CDW, suggesting the potential existence of\nfluctuated CDW in CsV3Sb5. These findings enhance our understanding of the\nunconventional CDW control of kagome superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4x3oMMaT3S71KEN1GCqElRWzLyoWU-tTH2IkDXHUZ6Q","pdfSize":"3393794","objectId":"0x7081a8476d4f17eaa1066002f7f8aebc1c218dbcc2532ad11025d096d934617f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
