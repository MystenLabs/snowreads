Due\nto their unusual properties, Rydberg atoms are promising building blocks for\ntwo-qubit gates and atom-light quantum interfaces, exploiting the Rydberg\nblockade interaction which prevents two atoms at close distance from being\nsimultaneously excited to Rydberg states. Recently, this effect was used to\nengineer quantum processors based on arrays of interacting Rydberg atoms\nilluminated by Raman lasers. Motivated by these experiments, we extend the\nJaynes-Cummings model to study the interaction between two Rydberg atoms\ninteracting by the Rydberg blockade and a quantized radiation field. We find a\nrich variety of Rabi oscillations and entanglement between the atoms and the\nradiation field as a function of initial conditions and interaction time, which\nmay be used to obtain atom-light quantum interfaces as components for future\nlong-distance quantum communication.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
