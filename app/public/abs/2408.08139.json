We start by parameterization and using orthonormal tetrads\nto get the effective potential. Methodologically we use the hyperboloidal\nframework together with discretizing the non-selfadjoint operator through\nChebyshev-Gauss-Labatto grid to attain the QNMs. We explore the parametric\ninstability of QNMs caused by quantum correction, cosmological constant and\nProca mass, and these three factors show very different influences on the QNMs'\nmigration flow. On the other hand, we discuss the instability of QNMs with\narbitrary-shape perturbation and the effectiveness of numerical results through\npseudospectrum. We use high frequency approximation to attain the expression of\nthe time domain Green function and clarify the origin of two different stages\nin time evolution. Through numerical methods we confirm that no power-law late\ntime tail is expected, and the possible impact on time evolution caused by\nquantum correction is discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
