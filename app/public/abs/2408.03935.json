This remarkable phenomenon can be explained in terms of\na novel thermodynamic variable called the \"contact\" that is conjugate to the\nbinding momentum of the molecule. The production rate of the molecule can be\nexpressed in terms of the contact density at the kinetic freezeout of the\nhadron gas. It approaches a nonzero limit as the binding energy goes to 0.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
