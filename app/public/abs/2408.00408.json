The resistivity exhibited a hump\nanomaly at 120 K, suggesting a phase transition. The NQR spectra split below\n110 K, whereas the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation exhibited no anomalies.\nThese results can be explained by the incommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW)\ntransition. This finding suggests the importance of quasi-one-dimensional\ncharacteristics and CDW instability in these systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fuTYm6-6GBib7vSrM_CSHwhIjSqcm5Qz6Dwxp5VR24M","pdfSize":"651005"}
