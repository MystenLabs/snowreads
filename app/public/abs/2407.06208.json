The present model illustrates\nab initio that the initial phase of each of the two condensates doesn't remain\nrandom at the Boltzmann equilibrium, but is distributed around integer multiple\nvalues of $2\\pi$ from the interference and thermalization of forward and\nbackward propagating matter waves. The thermalization inside the atomic vapors\ncan be understood as an intrinsic measurement process that defines a\ntemperature for the two condensates and projects the quantum states to an\naverage wave field with zero (relative) phases. Following this approach, focus\nis put on the original thought experiment of Anderson on whether a Josephson\ncurrent between two initially separated Bose-Einstein condensates occurs in a\ndeterministic way or not, depending on the initial phase distribution.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
