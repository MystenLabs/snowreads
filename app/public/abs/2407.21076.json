In a previous letter, in the context of a uni-parametric model\nwith asymptotic flat exterior metric, we fixed the radius of the transition\nsurface through the identification of its area with the area gap of Loop\nQuantum Gravity. This revealed a dependence of the polymerisation parameter on\nthe black hole mass, where the former increases as the latter decreases, and it\nalso enabled the extension of the model to Planck-scale black holes. We have\nidentified the existence of limiting states with masses $m \\geq \\sqrt{2}/4$ and\nzero surface gravity, showing that Hawking evaporation asymptotically leads to\nremnant black holes of Planck size. In the present paper we consider solutions\nwith $m < \\sqrt{2}/4$, observing again the presence of a minimal radius, but\nwithout formation of horizons. Diversely from the previous mass range, only\ncharged solutions are allowed in this case.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
