Their 4 to 5\nmagnitude photometric outbursts last for decades and are attributed to a factor\nof up to 10,000 increase in the stellar accretion rate. The nature of the\naccretion disk-to-star interface in FU Ori objects has remained a mystery for\ndecades. To date, attempts to directly observe a shock or boundary layer have\nbeen thwarted by the apparent lack of emission in excess of the accretion disk\nphotosphere down to $\\lambda = 2300$ \\AA. We present a new NUV and the first\nhigh-sensitivity FUV spectrum of FU Ori. The FUV continuum is detected for the\nfirst time and, at $\\lambda = 1400$ \\AA, is more than $10^4$ times brighter\nthan predicted by a viscous accretion disk. We interpret the excess as arising\nfrom a shock at the boundary between the disk and the stellar surface. We model\nthe shock emission as a blackbody and find that the temperature of the shocked\nmaterial is $T_\\mathrm{FUV} \\approx 16,000 \\pm 2000$ K. The shock temperature\ncorresponds to an accretion flow along the surface of the disk that reaches a\nvelocity of 40 km s$^{-1}$ at the boundary, consistent with predictions from\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UhUN_yy-AklioZkZ601cbfHyUltsJRSBsvJbAMGmzDQ","pdfSize":"1876616"}
