We give\na new concrete proof of the error bound $O(X^{2/3})$ that appears in the works\nof Good and Hejhal. Furthermore, we prove a new bound $O(X^{1/2}\\log{X})$ for\nthe mean square of the error. For particular arithmetic groups, we provide\ninterpretations in terms of correlation sums of the number of ideals of norm at\nmost $X$ in associated number fields, generalizing previous examples due to\nHejhal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
