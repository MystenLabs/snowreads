Traditional MTD approaches often rely on\nassumptions about the attackers knowledge and behavior. However, real-world\nscenarios are inherently more complex, with adaptive attackers and limited\nprior knowledge of their payoffs and intentions. This paper introduces a novel\napproach to MTD using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that does not rely\non predefined attacker payoffs. Our framework integrates the attackers\nreal-time responses into the defenders MDP using a dynamic Bayesian Network. By\nemploying a factored MDP model, we provide a comprehensive and realistic system\nrepresentation. We also incorporate incremental updates to an attack response\npredictor as new data emerges. This ensures an adaptive and robust defense\nmechanism. Additionally, we consider the costs of switching configurations in\nMTD, integrating them into the reward structure to balance execution and\ndefense costs. We first highlight the challenges of the problem through a\ntheoretical negative result on regret. However, empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate the frameworks effectiveness in scenarios marked by high\nuncertainty and dynamically changing attack landscapes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
