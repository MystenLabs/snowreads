When the\ncharacteristics of the object are unknown, knowing how to plan the speed at and\nwidth to which the fingers are narrowed is difficult. In this paper, we propose\na method to realize the three functions of simultaneous finger contact, impact\nreduction, and contact force control, which enable effective grasping of an\nunknown object. We accomplish this by using a control framework called multiple\nimpedance control, which was proposed in a previous study. The advantage of\nthis control is that multiple functions can be realized without switching\ncontrol laws. The previous study achieved two functions, impact reduction and\ncontact force control, with a two layers of impedance control which was applied\nindependently to individual fingers. In this paper, a new idea of virtual\ndynamics that treats multiple fingers comprehensively is introduced, which\nenables the function of simultaneous contact without compromising the other two\nfunctions. This research provides a method to achieve delicate grasping by\nusing proximity sensors.
