Typical interactions concern negotiation and\nagreement on resource exchanges. Modeling and formalizing these agreements pose\nsignificant challenges, particularly in capturing the dynamic behaviour of\nagents, while ensuring that resources are correctly handled. Here, we propose\nexchange environments as a formal setting where agents specify and obey\nexchange policies, which are declarative statements about what resources they\noffer and what they require in return. Furthermore, we introduce a decidable\nextension of the computational fragment of linear logic as a fundamental tool\nfor representing exchange environments and studying their dynamics in terms of\nprovability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
