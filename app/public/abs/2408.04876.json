Despite recent strides in witnessing\nentanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying\nentanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a\nformidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract\nvarious four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant\ninelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra. These correlations constitute the\nprimary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix (RDM).\nWe further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling\nwith fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for\nentanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as\nexamples, we show how this this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify\nmultipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its\nadvantage over quantum Fisher information (QFI).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PGgbejwGRzg5JFiVLZWHyrgboCh5SdDBzu1Bofh9YZ8","pdfSize":"26453661"}
