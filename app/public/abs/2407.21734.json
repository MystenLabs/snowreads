In robot-assisted rehabilitation, one of the key challenges\nis modelling human behaviour due to the complexity of human cognition and\nphysiological systems. Traditional single-model approaches often fail to\ncapture the dynamics of human-machine interactions. Our research employs a\nmultiple model strategy, using simple sub-models to approximate complex human\nresponses during rehabilitation tasks, tailored to varying levels of patient\nincapacity. The proposed system's versatility is demonstrated in real\nexperiments and simulated environments. Feasibility and potential were\nevaluated with 13 healthy young subjects, yielding promising results that\naffirm the anticipated benefits of the approach. This study not only introduces\na new paradigm for robot-assisted ankle rehabilitation but also opens the way\nfor future research in adaptive, patient-centred therapeutic interventions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
