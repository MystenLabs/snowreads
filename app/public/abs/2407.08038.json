{"id":"2407.08038","title":"Neutrino Program at Fermilab -- Enhancing proton beam power and\n  accelerator infrastructure","authors":"Ganguly Sudeshna (1) ((1) Fermilab)","authorsParsed":[["Sudeshna","Ganguly","","Fermilab"]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2024 20:36:41 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-12","timestamp":1720643801000,"abstract":"  The upcoming long baseline neutrino experiments aim to enhance proton beam\npower to multi-MW scale and utilize large-scale detectors to address the\nchallenge of limited event statistics. The DUNE experiment at LBNF will test\nthe three neutrino flavor paradigm and directly search for CP violation by\nstudying oscillation signatures in the high intensity $\\nu_{\\mu}$\n(anti-$\\nu_{\\mu}$) beam to $\\nu_{e}$ (anti-$\\nu_{e}$) measured over a long\nbaseline. Higher beam power and improved accelerator up-time will enhance\nneutrino flux for the neutrino program by increasing the number of protons on\ntarget. LBNF/DUNE, as well as PIP-II upgrade and Accelerator Complex Evolution\n(ACE) plan, play a vital role in this effort. The scientific potential of ACE\nplan extends beyond neutrino physics, encompassing endeavors such as the Muon\nCollider, Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV), Dark Sectors, and exploration\nof neutrinos beyond DUNE.\\par In the era of higher-power accelerator operation\n, research in target materials and beam instrumentation is crucial for\noptimizing design modifications. This abstract discusses Fermilab ACE, the\nscience opportunities it provides, and how Fermilab is pushing the limits of\nproton beam power and accelerator infrastructure. By tackling neutrino beam\nchallenges and exploring research and development ideas, we are advancing our\nunderstanding of fundamental particles and their interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
