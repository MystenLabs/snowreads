The approach assumes a\nlinear correlation model between the input variables which is used to decompose\nthe contribution of an input variable into a correlated and an uncorrelated\npart. This method provides sampling matrices following the original joint\nprobability distribution which are used directly to compute the model output\nwithout any assumptions or approximations of the model response function.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
