As an emerging nonlinear platform,\nspintronic devices have the potential to achieve stronger frequency conversion.\nHere, we demonstrated a microwave frequency conversion method in a hybrid\nquantum system, integrating nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond with magnetic\nthin film CoFeB. We achieve a conversion bandwidth ranging from 0.1 to 12GHz,\npresenting an up to $\\mathrm{25^{th}}$ order frequency conversion and further\ndisplay the application of this method for frequency detection and qubits\ncoherent control. Distinct from traditional frequency conversion techniques\nbased on nonlinear electric response, our approach employs nonlinear magnetic\nresponse in spintronic devices. The nonlinearity, originating from the symmetry\nbreaking such as domain walls in magnetic films, presents that our method can\nbe adapted to hybrid systems of other spintronic devices and spin qubits,\nexpanding the application scope of spintronic devices and providing a promising\non-chip platform for coupling quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
