It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.\nFor prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions, we determine\nthe optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction\nsequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts\nto employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors\nare Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as\nwell as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We\ninvestigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC)\nsampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform\nbetter than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact\nevaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best\nMERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the number of\nTrotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains\ndue to VMC for two-dimensional systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
