In that case we are able to show that the value\nof the game is achieved and corresponds exactly to the unique solution of the\nBI equations. Those have also been applied for improving a well-known\nverification theorem in stochastic control theory. In so doing, we have\nimplemented new techniques of stochastic calculus via regularizations,\ndeveloping specific chain rules.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
