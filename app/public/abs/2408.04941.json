To guide its activities, important information must be quickly\nextracted from such free-text resources. Quantities, such as the number of\npeople affected, amount of aid distributed, or the extent of infrastructure\ndamage, are central to emergency response and anticipatory action. In this\nwork, we contribute an annotated dataset for the humanitarian domain for the\nextraction of such quantitative information, along side its important context,\nincluding units it refers to, any modifiers, and the relevant event. Further,\nwe develop a custom Natural Language Processing pipeline to extract the\nquantities alongside their units, and evaluate it in comparison to baseline and\nrecent literature. The proposed model achieves a consistent improvement in the\nperformance, especially in the documents pertaining to the Dominican Republic\nand select African countries. We make the dataset and code available to the\nresearch community to continue the improvement of NLP tools for the\nhumanitarian domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VibxHSwlyw-hYCGM5C9zf6jvUHEmrdRY9wP7uOzZ-EE","pdfSize":"686878"}
