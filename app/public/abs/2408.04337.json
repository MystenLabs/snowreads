In our study, we investigate a new, promising method to\nmanufacture hierarchically porous structures in a straightforward, and tuneable\nway. It consists of combining the novel technology of capillary suspensions,\nformed by mixing solid particles and two immiscible liquids, one less than 5\nvol%, with freeze casting. We have successfully achieved alumina and\n$\\beta$-TCP materials with both <2 $\\mu$m and 20-50 $\\mu$m as the smallest and\nlargest pore size, respectively. The microstructure exhibits fully open pores\nand high levels of porosity (> 60%). The capillary suspensions' rheological\nbehaviour indicates that silica nano-suspensions as a secondary fluid creates a\nstronger internal particle network than sucrose for the alumina system.\nConversely, the opposite was observed with the $\\beta$-TCP system. These\ndifferences were attributed to the change in affinity between the secondary\nfluids and the solid loading. In our study, both systems have served to deepen\nthe knowledge about the new area of capillary suspensions and prove their use\nin hierarchical porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
