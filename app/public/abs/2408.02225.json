In a graph $G$, the number of cops required to\ncapture a robber in the Cops and Attacking Robbers game is denoted by\n$\\attCop(G)$. We characterise the triangle-free graphs $G$ with $\\attCop(G)\n\\leq 2$ via a natural generalisation of the cop-win characterisation by\nNowakowski and Winkler \\cite{nowakowski1983vertex}. We also prove that all\nbipartite planar graphs $G$ have $\\attCop(G) \\leq 4$ and show this is tight by\nconstructing a bipartite planar graph $G$ with $\\attCop(G) = 4$. Finally we\nconstruct $17$ non-isomorphic graphs $H$ of order $58$ with $\\attCop(H) = 6$\nand $\\cop(H)=3$. This provides the first example of a graph $H$ with\n$\\attCop(H) - \\cop(H) \\geq 3$ extending work by Bonato, Finbow, Gordinowicz,\nHaidar, Kinnersley, Mitsche, Pra\\l{}at, and Stacho \\cite{bonato2014robber}. We\nconclude with a list of conjectures and open problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PQu1gtbTdTYO7-bZt-UYYPClYYUaEi7uXn_a6JR9Z1g","pdfSize":"309072"}
