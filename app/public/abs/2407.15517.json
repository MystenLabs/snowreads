We prove well-posedness and higher regularity of the Stokes problem\nin a certain class of weighted Sobolev spaces.\n  The novelty of this work is the occurrence of two different scalings in the\nboundary condition, which is not treated so far for the Stokes system in\nunbounded wedge-type domains. These difficulties are overcome by first\nconstructing a variational solution in a second order weighted Sobolev space\nand subsequently proving higher regularity up to the tip of the wedge by\nemploying an iterative scheme. We believe that this method can be used for\nother problems with variational structure and multiple scales.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
