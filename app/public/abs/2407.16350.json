Using\ntime-dependent mean-field theory formulated with Anderson pseudospins, we study\nthe electronic configurations and the energy deposited in the system by optical\npulses. The pulses are included by Peierls substitution and we study short\nrectangular pulses as well as idealized $\\delta$ pulses. Already a few and even\na single pulse generates highly non-trivial distributions of electron\nexpectation values which we simulate numerically and explain analytically based\non the linearization of the equations of motion. These results suggest so far\nunexplored experimental possibilities for the optical control of\nsuperconducting states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mf1oPsKJE5gj_4wXaZNU_GGlsie5eoYBDiK-8mTeqbw","pdfSize":"2772459"}
