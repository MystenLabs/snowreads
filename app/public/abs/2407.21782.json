This work presents an\ninexpensive spectrometer that, when coupled with easy-to-design resonators,\nenables ESR over a broad frequency range, including at frequencies outside the\nstandard bands. It can operate at either a single frequency or at two\nfrequencies simultaneously. The spectrometer is built from off-the-shelf parts\nand controlled by a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and new capabilities\ncan be easily added by reconfiguring the FPGA and adding or swapping\ncomponents. We demonstrate the capabilities of the spectrometer using the\nmolecular nanomagnet Cr$_7$Mn.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
