In previous\nstudies, researchers propose enhancing pedestrian trajectory predictions by\nusing manually crafted labels to categorize pedestrian behaviors and\nintentions. However, these approaches often only capture a limited range of\npedestrian behaviors and introduce human bias into the predictions. To\nalleviate the dependency on manually crafted labels, we utilize a transformer\nencoder coupled with hierarchical density-based clustering to automatically\nidentify diverse behavior patterns, and use these clusters in data-driven\nreachability analysis. By using a transformer-based approach, we seek to\nenhance the representation of pedestrian trajectories and uncover\ncharacteristics or features that are subsequently used to group trajectories\ninto different \"behavior\" clusters. We show that these behavior clusters can be\nused with data-driven reachability analysis, yielding an end-to-end data-driven\napproach to predicting the future motion of pedestrians. We train and evaluate\nour approach on a real pedestrian dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in\nforecasting pedestrian movements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
