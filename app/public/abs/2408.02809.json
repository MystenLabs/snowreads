The principal results obtained in the\npaper are indicative of the existence of weakly optimal stationary plans where\nthe optimal return need not be Borel measurable. More specifically, the main\ntheorem establishes the condition for the weakly optimal stationary plan when\nthe optimal return is bounded. Blackwell also gives an example that\ndemonstrates that no optimal plan exists showing that the results obtained in\nhis earlier work on discounted dynamic programming, cannot be generally\nextended to the positive case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
