They exhibit\nunique properties and have applications to diverse fields. Periodic space-time\ndual quantum circuits are of special interest, due to their iterative structure\ndefined by the Floquet operator. A very similar iterative structure naturally\nappears in Quantum Signal processing (QSP), which has emerged as a framework\nthat embodies all the known quantum algorithms. However, it is yet unclear\nwhether there is deeper relation between these two apparently different\nconcepts. In this work, we establish a relation between a circuit defining a\nFloquet operator in a single period and its space-time dual defining QSP\nsequences for the Lie algebra sl$(2,\\mathbb{C})$, which is the complexification\nof su$(2)$. First, we show that our complexified QSP sequences can be\ninterpreted in terms of action of the Lorentz group on density matrices and\nthat they can be interpreted as hybrid circuits involving unitaries and\nmeasurements. We also show that unitary representations of our QSP sequences\nexist, although they are infinite-dimensional and are defined for bosonic\noperators in the Heisenberg picture. Finally, we also show the relation between\nour complexified QSP and the nonlinear Fourier transform for\nsl$(2,\\mathbb{C})$, which is a generalization of the previous results on\nsu$(2)$ QSP.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
