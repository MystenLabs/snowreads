In this paper, we characterize complete metrics with\nfinite total Q-curvature as normal metrics for all dimensional cases. Secondly,\nwe introduce another volume entropy to provide geometric information regarding\ncomplete non-normal metrics with finite total Q-curvature. In particular, we\nshow that if the scalar curvature is bounded from below, the volume growth of\nsuch complete metrics is controlled.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
