However, the\nprevailing class-imbalance problem in MoS, caused by the substantial variations\nin organ size, exacerbates the learning difficulty of the SSL network. To\nalleviate this issue, we present a two-phase semi-supervised network (BSR-Net)\nwith balanced subclass regularization for MoS. Concretely, in Phase I, we\nintroduce a class-balanced subclass generation strategy based on balanced\nclustering to effectively generate multiple balanced subclasses from original\nbiased ones according to their pixel proportions. Then, in Phase II, we design\nan auxiliary subclass segmentation (SCS) task within the multi-task framework\nof the main MoS task. The SCS task contributes a balanced subclass\nregularization to the main MoS task and transfers unbiased knowledge to the MoS\nnetwork, thus alleviating the influence of the class-imbalance problem.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets, i.e., the\nMICCAI FLARE 2022 dataset and the WORD dataset, verify the superior performance\nof our method compared with other methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
