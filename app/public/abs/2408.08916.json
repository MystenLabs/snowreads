It has been extended in several\ndirections, including the possibility to express supports, leading to the\ndevelopment of the Bipolar Argumentation Framework (BAF), and recursive attacks\nand supports, resulting in the Recursive BAF (Rec-BAF). Different\ninterpretations of supports have been proposed, whereas for Rec-BAF (where the\ntarget of attacks and supports may also be attacks and supports) even different\nsemantics for attacks have been defined. However, the semantics of these\nframeworks have either not been defined in the presence of support cycles, or\nare often quite intricate in terms of the involved definitions. We encompass\nthis limitation and present classical semantics for general BAF and Rec-BAF and\nshow that the semantics for specific BAF and Rec-BAF frameworks can be defined\nby very simple and intuitive modifications of that defined for the case of AF.\nThis is achieved by providing a modular definition of the sets of defeated and\nacceptable elements for each AF-based framework. We also characterize, in an\nelegant and uniform way, the semantics of general BAF and Rec-BAF in terms of\nlogic programming and partial stable model semantics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bG0V2ODA5_zB1VBcvxpqRRjjmzKbRSZl2kepIkpX_hs","pdfSize":"588190"}
