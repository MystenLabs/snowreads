Vertex characteristics include both the\nlocation and the type of the vertex, with the latter defined by the number of\nlines forming it and the corresponding angles. This problem is crucial for\ncomputer vision tasks, such as distinguishing between fore- and background\nobjects in 3D scenes. We compute the second-order topological derivative of a\nMumford-Shah type functional with respect to inclusion shapes representing\nvarious vertex types. This derivative assigns a likelihood to each pixel that a\nparticular vertex type appears there. Numerical tests demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
