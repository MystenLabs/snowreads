But as the circuit size increases the\nvariational landscapes become flattened, causing the so-called Barren plateau\nphenomena. This will lead to an increased difficulty in the optimization phase,\ndue to the reduction of the cost function parameters gradient. One of the\npossible solutions is to employ shallower circuits or adaptive ans\\\"atze.\n  We introduce a systematic procedure for ansatz building based on approximate\nQuantum Mutual Information (QMI) with improvement on each layer based on the\nprevious Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (QIDA) approach. Our approach\ngenerates a layered-structured ansatz, where each layer's qubit pairs are\nselected based on their QMI values, resulting in more efficient state\npreparation and optimization routines. We benchmarked our approach on various\nconfigurations of the Heisenberg model Hamiltonian, demonstrating significant\nimprovements in the accuracy of the ground state energy calculations compared\nto traditional heuristic ansatz methods. Our results show that the Multi-QIDA\nmethod reduces the computational complexity while maintaining high precision,\nmaking it a promising tool for quantum simulations in lattice spin models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"eRuCXGBgLOJPrl8nEGKeJGckaGlR1ql8On5vRnIPUfk","pdfSize":"1806736"}
