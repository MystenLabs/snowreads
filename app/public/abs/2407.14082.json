As an\napplication, the new criterion is applied to several examples, including\nsequences whose polynomials depend on disjoint sets of variables, some\nsequences that are equivariant for the action of a linear group, blow-ups of\ndivisors, and certain sequences of polynomials in positive characteristics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
