By synthesizing samples through\nthe interpolation of features and labels, Mixup effectively addresses the issue\nof data scarcity. However, it has rarely been explored in graph learning tasks\ndue to the irregularity and connectivity of graph data. Specifically, in node\nclassification tasks, Mixup presents a challenge in creating connections for\nsynthetic data. In this paper, we propose Geometric Mixup (GeoMix), a simple\nand interpretable Mixup approach leveraging in-place graph editing. It\neffectively utilizes geometry information to interpolate features and labels\nwith those from the nearby neighborhood, generating synthetic nodes and\nestablishing connections for them. We conduct theoretical analysis to elucidate\nthe rationale behind employing geometry information for node Mixup, emphasizing\nthe significance of locality enhancement-a critical aspect of our method's\ndesign. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lightweight Geometric Mixup\nachieves state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of standard datasets with\nlimited labeled data. Furthermore, it significantly improves the generalization\ncapability of underlying GNNs across various challenging out-of-distribution\ngeneralization tasks.
