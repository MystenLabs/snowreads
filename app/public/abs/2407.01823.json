However, it is known that the\ncomplexity of conventional optimization algorithms in the literature often\nexponentially increases with the number of transmit antennas and communication\nusers in the wireless system. Therefore, in the large scale regime, the\nastronomically large complexity of these optimization algorithms prohibits\ntheir use and prevents assessing large scale wireless systems performance under\noptimized conditions. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes instead\nthe use of an unsupervised meta-learning based approach to directly perform\nnon-convex optimization at significantly reduced complexity. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed meta-learning based solution, the sum-rate (SR)\nmaximization problem for the following three emerging 6G technologies is\ncontemplated: hierarchical rate-splitting multiple access (H-RSMA), integrated\nsensing and communication (ISAC), and beyond-diagonal reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces (BD-RIS). Through numerical results, it is demonstrated\nthat the proposed meta-learning based optimization framework is able to\nsuccessfully optimize the performance and also reveal unknown aspects of the\noperation in the large scale regime for the considered three 6G technologies.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
