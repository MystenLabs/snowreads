However, accurately\ncapturing the invertibility constraint required in PNL models remains\nchallenging in existing studies. To address this problem, we introduce CAF-PoNo\n(Causal discovery via Normalizing Flows for Post-Nonlinear models), harnessing\nthe power of the normalizing flows architecture to enforce the crucial\ninvertibility constraint in PNL models. Through normalizing flows, our method\nprecisely reconstructs the hidden noise, which plays a vital role in\ncause-effect identification through statistical independence testing.\nFurthermore, the proposed approach exhibits remarkable extensibility, as it can\nbe seamlessly expanded to facilitate multivariate causal discovery via causal\norder identification, empowering us to efficiently unravel complex causal\nrelationships. Extensive experimental evaluations on both simulated and real\ndatasets consistently demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art approaches in both bivariate and multivariate causal discovery\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
