Despite the variety of\nexisting approaches, such as mortality laws and factor-based models, they often\nlack compatibility or fail to meet specific research needs. To address these\nshortcomings, this study introduces a novel approach centered on modeling the\ndynamics of individual vitality and defining mortality as the depletion of\nvitality level to zero. More specifically, we develop a four-component\nframework to analyze the initial value, trend, diffusion, and sudden changes in\nvitality level over an individual's lifetime. We demonstrate the framework's\nestimation and analytical capabilities in various settings and discuss its\npractical implications in actuarial problems and other research areas. The\nbroad applicability and interpretability of our vitality-based modeling\napproach offer an enhanced paradigm for mortality modeling.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
