In light of the possibilities that LLMs could assume\nsignificant workplace responsibilities, it becomes imminently necessary to\nexplore LLMs' capacities as professional assistants. This study focuses on the\naspect of career interests by applying the Occupation Network's Interest\nProfiler short form to LLMs as if they were human participants and investigates\ntheir hypothetical career interests and competence, examining how these vary\nwith language changes and model advancements. We analyzed the answers using a\ngeneral linear mixed model approach and found distinct career interest\ninclinations among LLMs, particularly towards the social and artistic domains.\nInterestingly, these preferences did not align with the occupations where LLMs\nexhibited higher competence. This novel approach of using psychometric\ninstruments and sophisticated statistical tools on LLMs unveils fresh\nperspectives on their integration into professional environments, highlighting\nhuman-like tendencies and promoting a reevaluation of LLMs' self-perception and\ncompetency alignment in the workforce.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
