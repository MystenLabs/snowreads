The focus is on using the\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to address issues in\nhigh-dimensional continuous action spaces. The paper details the model of a\nAckermann robot and the structure and application of the DDPG algorithm.\nExperiments were conducted in a simulation environment to verify the\nfeasibility of the improved algorithm. The results demonstrate that the DDPG\nalgorithm outperforms traditional Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double Deep\nQ-Network (DDQN) algorithms in path planning tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
