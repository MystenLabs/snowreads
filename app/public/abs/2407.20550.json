Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can detect\nSPSF and is often used to determine the bulk band structure of quantum\nmaterials. Here, we show that while one part of the momentum-space SPSF gives\nband structure, it also contains the knowledge of winding and Chern numbers of\nvarious topological materials. For this, we derive SPSF in three different\nmodels of topological systems, such as the Kitaev model of topological\nsuperconductors, the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and the Qi-Wu-Zhang\nmodel and explain how to extract the winding or Chern numbers in different\ntopological phases from the SPSF. Such information from SPSF seems\nexperimentally accessible due to the recent advancement of ARPES and scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy techniques.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
