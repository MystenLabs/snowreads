This study uses galaxies from the final\nMaNGA data release to detect double-peaked narrow emission-line spaxels (DPSs)\nby examining the double Gaussian profiles of the H$ \\alpha $-[N\n\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2}] doublets across all MaNGA spaxels. A\ntotal of 5,420 DPSs associated with 304 double-peaked narrow emission-line\ngalaxies (DPGs) are identified, each DPG containing a minimum of 5 DPSs and\nbeing free from overlap with other galaxies. We find that DPSs can be\ncategorized into three groups according to their central distance $r/R_e$ and\nthe velocity difference $\\Delta v$ between their two components: the inner\nlow-$\\Delta v$, inner high-$\\Delta v$ and outer DPSs. By incorporating the\nphysical characteristics of the DPGs into their DPSs, we demonstrate for the\nfirst time the existence of statistical correlations between barred DPGs and\ninner low-$\\Delta v$ DPSs, AGN-hosting DPGs and inner high-$\\Delta v$ DPSs, as\nwell as tidal DPGs and outer DPSs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
