Using the Favored Local Structure (FLS) lattice model as a\ntestbed, the diversity measure is found to effectively filter extrinsic noise\nand to provide a useful differentiation between crystal and amorphous\nstructures. We identify an interesting class of structures intermediate between\ncrystals and glasses that are characterised by a complex combination of\nshort-range ordering and long-range disorder. We demonstrate how the diversity\ncan be used as an order parameter to organise various scenarios by structure\nchange in response to increasing diversity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
