ACME relies\non computational argumentation and aims to help migrants identify the highest\nlevel of protection they can apply for. This would contribute to a more\nsustainable migration by reducing the load on territorial commissions, Courts,\nand humanitarian organizations supporting asylum applicants. We describe the\ncontext, system architectures, technologies, and the case study used to run the\ndemonstration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xn9aYBuc7NLgWssK-nUm_FS_KFC7qP0DfdNlxRrP5K4","pdfSize":"307998"}
