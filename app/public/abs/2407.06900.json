However, agreement with the gauge theory data for\nthe defect line index at finite $N$ required the inclusion of ad hoc extra\ncontributions with unclear origin. We discuss the large $N$ leading order\ncontribution of the giant graviton expansion of the defect line index by a\ndirect analysis of semiclassical string partition function in a twisted\nbackground. We discuss supersymmetric boundary conditions in the presence of\nthe D3 brane and evaluate the quadratic fluctuations effective action by\nintroducing a suitable projection of fluctuation modes. We show that the extra\ncontributions to the single giant graviton correction found in arXiv:2403.11543\ncorrespond to a supersymmetric Casimir energy contribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
