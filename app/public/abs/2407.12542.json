It is shown that the gradient models which\nuse the approximate Jacobian matrices are probabilistically first-order\naccurate, and the high probability complexity bound of the algorithm is also\ngiven.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
