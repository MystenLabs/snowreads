RAG architecture offers a lower\nhallucination rate than LLM-only applications. However, the accuracy of the\nretrieval mechanism is known to be a bottleneck in the efficiency of these\napplications. A particular case of subpar retrieval performance is observed in\nsituations where multiple documents from several different but related topics\nare in the corpus. We have devised a new vectorization method that takes into\naccount the topic information of the document. The paper introduces this new\nmethod for text vectorization and evaluates it in the context of RAG.\nFurthermore, we discuss the challenge of evaluating RAG systems, which pertains\nto the case at hand.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
