However, the lack of\ntourism knowledge limits the performance of LLMs in tourist attraction\npresentations and travel planning. To address this challenge, we constructed a\nsupervised fine-tuning dataset for the culture and tourism domain, named\nCultour. This dataset consists of three parts: tourism knowledge base QA data,\ntravelogues data, and tourism diversity QA data. Additionally, we propose\nTourLLM, a Qwen-based model supervised fine-tuned with Cultour, to improve the\nquality of the information provided about attractions and travel planning. To\nevaluate the performance of TourLLM, we employed both automatic and human\nevaluation, and we proposed a human evaluation criterion named CRA\n(Consistency, Readability, Availability). The experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the responses generated by the TourLLM. Our proposed\nCultour is accessible at https://github.com/mrweiqk/Cultour.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
