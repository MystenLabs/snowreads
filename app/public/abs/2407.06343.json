To\nsimultaneously improve spatial and temporal resolutions and maintain the high\nSNR advantage of OSSI, we present novel pipelines for fast acquisition and\nhigh-resolution fMRI reconstruction and physics parameter quantification. We\npropose a patch-tensor low-rank model, a physics-based manifold model, and a\nvoxel-wise attention network. With novel models for acquisition and\nreconstruction, we demonstrate that we can improve SNR and resolution\nsimultaneously without compromising scan time. All the proposed models\noutperform other comparison approaches with higher resolution and more\nfunctional information.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
