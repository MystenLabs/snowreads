Applying a magnetic field introduces a new\nmagnetic length scale $\\ell$ and breaks discrete scale invariance. Moreover, a\nmagnetic field is a singular perturbation as it turns complex energies into\nreal energies. Nonetheless, the Coulomb potential must be regularized with a\nlength $R$ at short distances for supercritical impurities. We investigate the\nstructure of the induced density of a filled Landau impurity band in the\nsupercritical regime. The coupling between Landau level states by the impurity\npotential is nontrivial and can lead to several anomalous effects. First, we\nfind that the peak in the induced density can be located away from the center\nof the impurity, depending on the characteristics of the Landau impurity bands.\nSecond, the impurity charge is screened, despite the Landau impurity band being\nfilled. Third, anticrossing impurity states lead to additional impurity\ncyclotron resonances.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
