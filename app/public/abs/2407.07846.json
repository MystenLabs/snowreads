The method consists in finding rotations that can be merged\ninto a single rotation gate. This approach has already been considered before\nand is used as a pre-processing procedure in many optimization algorithms,\nnotably for optimizing the number of Hadamard gates or the number of $T$ gates\nin Clifford$+T$ circuits. Our algorithm has a better complexity than similar\nmethods and is particularly efficient for circuits with a low number of\ninternal Hadamard gates. Furthermore, we show that this approach is optimal for\nparametrized circuits composed of Clifford gates and parametrized rotations\nwith non-repeated parameters. For the same type of parametrized quantum\ncircuits, we also prove that a previous procedure optimizing the number of\nHadamard gates and internal Hadamard gates is optimal. This procedure is\nnotably used in our low-complexity algorithm for optimally reducing the number\nof parametrized rotations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GrF8rPYVcGJu1PFhscuMnUzAVwhiknnr0bBFfAkZ0dU","pdfSize":"573168"}
