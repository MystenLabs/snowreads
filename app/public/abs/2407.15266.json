This paper\npresents STrack, a novel hardware-offloaded reliable transport protocol aimed\nat improving the performance of AI /ML workloads by rethinking key aspects of\nthe transport layer. STrack optimizes congestion control and load balancing in\ntandem: it incorporates an adaptive load balancing algorithm leveraging ECN,\nwhile adopts RTT as multi-bit congestion indicators for precise congestion\nwindow adjustment. Additionally, STrack facilitates out-of-order delivery,\nselective retransmission, and swift loss recovery in hardware for multipath\nenvironment. The extensive simulation comparing STrack and RoCEv2 demonstrates\nthat STrack outperforms RoCEv2 by up to 6X with synthetic workloads and by\n27.4% with collective workloads, even with the optimized RoCEv2 system setup.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XSg2VxKDFrKKbpgB0M5ws2UZ8EXxvMTXadL2efsIGRg","pdfSize":"1327509"}
