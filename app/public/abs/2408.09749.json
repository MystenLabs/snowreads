This model is constructed by integrating concepts from classical\nirreversible thermodynamics with the energetic variational approach. By making\nspecific assumptions about the kinematics of the temperature, we derive a\nnon-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation. Through both asymptotic analysis and\nnumerical simulations, we demonstrate that in the sharp interface limit, the\nnon-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation converges to a two-phase Stefan-like\nproblem, under a certain scaling of the melting/freezing energy. In this\nregime, the motion of the liquid-solid interface and the temperature interface\ncoincide and are governed by the mean curvature, at least for a short time. The\nresult provides a justification for the classical Stefan problem within a\ncertain physical regime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
