The imposed limit\ntends to enhance code readability and maintainability. While early works on CDD\nfocused mostly on Java, its applicability extends beyond specific programming\nlanguages. In this study, we explored the use of CDD in two new dimensions:\nfocusing on Flutter programming and targeting novice developers unfamiliar with\nboth Flutter and CDD. Our goal was to understand to what extent CDD helps\nnovice developers learn a new programming technology. We conducted an in-person\nFlutter training camp with 24 participants. After receiving CDD training, six\nremaining students were tasked with developing a software management\napplication guided by CDD practices. Our findings indicate that CDD helped\nparticipants keep code complexity low, measured using Intrinsic Complexity\nPoints (ICP), a CDD metric. Notably, stricter ICP limits led to a 20\\%\nreduction in code size, improving code quality and readability. This report\ncould be valuable for professors and instructors seeking effective\nmethodologies for teaching design practices that reduce code and cognitive\ncomplexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
