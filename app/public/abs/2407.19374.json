In particular, their work strengthened a previous result\nof El-Guindy and Ono which expresses a cusp form as a $p$-adic limit of weakly\nholomorphic modular forms. Subsequently, Hanson and Jameson extended Ahlgren\nand Samart's result to all one-dimensional cusp form spaces of trivial\ncharacter and having a normalized form that has complex multiplication. Here we\nprove analogous $p$-adic limits for several one-dimensional cusp form spaces of\ntrivial character but whose normalized form does not have complex\nmultiplication.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
