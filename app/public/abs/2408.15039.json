Boltzmann's theory and the Chapman-Enskog method predict the\nvalue of the viscosity at low concentrations, $\\eta_0$. Here, the hypothesis\n$\\eta=\\phi\\, \\eta_0$ is proposed, where $\\phi$ is a thermodynamic function\nrepresenting the effects of interactions as concentration increases. The method\nproposed to verify this hypothesis involves coupling the system with a solvent\nrepresented by a Langevin thermostat, characterized by a damping time $t_d$.\nMolecular dynamics simulations show that different values of noise intensity\nmodify $\\eta$ and $\\eta_0$, but do not affect $\\phi$. This result supports the\nassumption that $\\phi$ is a thermodynamic function, since the thermodynamic\nstate remains unaltered by the presence of damping and noise. Simulations were\nconducted for particles that interact via a pseudo-hard sphere or a\nLennard-Jones potential.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
