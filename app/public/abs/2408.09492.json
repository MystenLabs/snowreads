At low\nZeeman field, the projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) simulations demonstrate\nMott transitions between the higher-order topological insulator induced by the\nin-plane Zeeman field and the antiferromagnetic insulator induced by the\nHubbard interaction. The interacting higher-order topological state on a\nfinite-sized honeycomb lattice is characterized by the local density of states\nderived from the real-space spectral function. In the higher-order topological\nphase, the mirror-inversion symmetry protected corner states exist on the\ndiamond-shaped honeycomb lattice. By comparing the spatial distribution of\ncorner states between the Kane-Mele and Kane-Mele-Hubbard models, we show that\nthe effect of the Hubbard interaction is to contribute some extra in-plane\nZeeman field. At the mean-field level, we calculate the full phase diagram of\nthe Kane-Mele-Hubbard model under the influence of the in-plane Zeeman field.\nThe mean-field phase diagram shows that a high in-plane Zeeman field drives the\nsystem into a spin-polarized (topologically trivial) phase. In particular, the\nupper limit of the Zeeman field that can induce corner states in the Kane-Mele\nmodel is found to be $h_c = 1.0(3)$. In the parameter region of PQMC\nsimulations, the mean-field solutions are in fair agreement with the PQMC\nresults.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
