Existing models\npredominantly utilize convolutional filters, which capture only local\ndependencies. Furthermore, they often incur high training costs and exhibit\nsubstantial computational complexity. To address these limitations, in this\npaper we propose Hyperspectral Compression Transformer (HyCoT) that is a\ntransformer-based autoencoder for pixelwise HSI compression. Additionally, we\nintroduce an efficient training strategy to accelerate the training process.\nExperimental results on the HySpecNet-11k dataset demonstrate that HyCoT\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art across various compression ratios by over 1 dB\nwith significantly reduced computational requirements.
