Multivariate analysis techniques are used to define event\ncategories that improve the sensitivity to new resonances beyond the Standard\nModel. A model-independent search for a generic spin-0 particle and a\nmodel-dependent search for an additional low-mass Higgs boson are performed in\nthe diphoton invariant mass spectrum. No significant excess is observed in\neither search. Mass-dependent upper limits at the $95\\%$ confidence level are\nset in the model-independent scenario on the fiducial cross-section times\nbranching ratio into two photons in the range of 8 fb to 53 fb. Similarly, in\nthe model-dependent scenario upper limits are set on the total cross-section\ntimes branching ratio into two photons as a function of the Higgs boson mass in\nthe range of 19 fb to 102 fb.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-oZZDFc02Ox6fp4eoaIA66KTNW3uqG-cw53eQsSMVE0","pdfSize":"1867422"}
