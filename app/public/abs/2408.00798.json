Golden-Retriever incorporates a reflection-based question\naugmentation step before document retrieval, which involves identifying jargon,\nclarifying its meaning based on context, and augmenting the question\naccordingly. Specifically, our method extracts and lists all jargon and\nabbreviations in the input question, determines the context against a\npre-defined list, and queries a jargon dictionary for extended definitions and\ndescriptions. This comprehensive augmentation ensures the RAG framework\nretrieves the most relevant documents by providing clear context and resolving\nambiguities, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Evaluations using\nthree open-source LLMs on a domain-specific question-answer dataset demonstrate\nGolden-Retriever's superior performance, providing a robust solution for\nefficiently integrating and querying industrial knowledge bases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
