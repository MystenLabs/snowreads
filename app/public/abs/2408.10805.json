Learning-based approaches have been largely studied to\naddress this challenge, both in single and multi-view setups. These solutions\nhowever fail to generalize to real-world cases due to the lack of (multi-view)\n'in-the-wild' images paired with 3D poses for training. For this reason, we\npropose combining 2D pose estimation, for which large and rich training\ndatasets exist, and 2D-to-3D pose lifting, using a transformer-based network\nthat can be trained from synthetic 2D-3D pose pairs. Our experiments\ndemonstrate decreases up to 45% in MPJPE errors compared to the 3D pose\nobtained by triangulating the 2D poses.
