In this paper, we explore whether we can anyway reach the\nambitious 6G performance goals by evolving the multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) technology from being massive to gigantic. We describe how many antennas\nare needed and can realistically be deployed, and what the peak user rate and\ndegrees-of-freedom (DOF) can become. We further suggest a new deployment\nstrategy that enables the utilization of radiative near-field effects in these\nbands for precise beamfocusing, localization, and sensing from a single base\nstation site. We also identify five open research challenges that must be\novercome to efficiently use gigantic MIMO dimensions in 6G from hardware, cost,\nand algorithmic perspectives.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
