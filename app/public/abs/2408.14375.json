In this paper we prove that the canonical metric on the\ntwo-dimensional projective plane is determined modulo isometries by its volume\nspectrum. We also prove that the surface Zoll metrics on the three-dimensional\nsphere are characterized by the equality of the spherical area widths. These\nwidths generalize to the surface case the Lusternik-Schnirelmann lengths of\nclosed geodesics. We prove a new sharp area systolic inequality for metrics on\nthe three-dimensional projective space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
