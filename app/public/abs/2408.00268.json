The Five-hundred-meter\nAperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the most sensitive single-dish radio\ntelescope, has the potential to provide the precise cosmological measurements\nthrough neutral hydrogen 21-cm intensity mapping sky survey. This paper\nprimarily explores the potential of technological upgrades for FAST in\ncosmology. The most crucial upgrade begins with equipping FAST with a wide-band\nreceiver ($0 < z < 2.5$). This upgrade can enable FAST to achieve higher\nprecision in cosmological parameter estimation than the Square Kilometre Array\nPhase-1 Mid frequency. On this basis, expanding to a FAST array (FASTA)\nconsisting of six identical FAST would offer significant improvements in\nprecision compared to FAST. Additionally, compared with the current results\nfrom the data combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic\noscillations (optical galaxy surveys), and type Ia supernovae, FASTA can\nprovide comparable constraints. Specifically, for the dark-energy\nequation-of-state parameters, FASTA can achieve $\\sigma(w_0) = 0.09$ and\n$\\sigma(w_a) = 0.33$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
