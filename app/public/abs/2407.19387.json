Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg\nand Shan (LMRS) have proposed a related characterization of chaos for the\nground states of BPS black holes with finite area horizons. On a separate\nfront, the \"fuzzball program\" has uncovered large families of horizon-free\ngeometries that account for the entropy of holographic BPS systems, but only in\nsituations with sufficient supersymmetry to exclude finite area horizons. The\nhighly structured, non-random nature of these solutions seems in tension with\nstrong chaos. We verify this intuition by performing analytic and numerical\ncalculations of the LMRS diagnostic in the corresponding boundary quantum\nsystem. In particular we examine the 1/2 and 1/4-BPS sectors of $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nSYM, and the two charge sector of the D1-D5 CFT. We find evidence that these\nsystems are only weakly chaotic, with a Thouless time determining the onset of\nchaos that grows as a power of $N$. In contrast, finite horizon area BPS black\nholes should be strongly chaotic, with a Thouless time of order one. In this\ncase, finite energy chaotic states become BPS as $N$ is decreased through the\nrecently discovered \"fortuity\" mechanism. Hence they can plausibly retain their\nstrongly chaotic character.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
