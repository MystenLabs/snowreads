This paper explores statistical models for recommender\nsystems, focusing on crossed random effects models and factor analysis. We\nextend the crossed random effects model to include random slopes, enabling the\ncapture of varying covariate effects among users and items. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the use of factor analysis in recommender systems, particularly for\nsettings with incomplete data. The paper also discusses scalable solutions\nusing the Expectation Maximization (EM) and variational EM algorithms for\nparameter estimation, highlighting the application of these models to predict\nuser-item interactions effectively.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
