For this, we take a static\nsphere that is initially filled with the isotropic fluid and then add a new\ngravitational source producing anisotropy in the system. The field equations\nnow correspond to the total matter configuration. We transform the radial\nmetric component to split these equations into two sets characterizing their\nparent sources. The unknowns comprising in the first set are determined by\nconsidering the Buchdahl isotropic solution. On the other hand, we employ\ndifferent constraints related to the additional gravitational source and make\nthe second system solvable. Further, the constant triplet in Buchdahl solution\nis calculated by means of matching criteria between the interior and exterior\ngeometries at the spherical boundary. The mass and radius of a compact star LMC\nX-4 are used to analyze the physical relevancy of the developed models. We\nconclude that our resulting models II and III are in well-agreement with\nacceptability conditions for the considered values of the parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
