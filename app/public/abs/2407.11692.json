To transfer model-based verification results to\nthe real world, we require that the measurements of the target system lie in\nthe set of reachable outputs of the corresponding model, a property we refer to\nas reachset conformance. This paper is on automatically identifying those\nreachset-conformant models. While state-of-the-art reachset-conformant\nidentification methods focus on linear state-space models, we generalize these\nmethods to nonlinear state-space models and linear and nonlinear input-output\nmodels. Furthermore, our identification framework adapts to different levels of\nprior knowledge on the system dynamics. In particular, we identify the set of\nmodel uncertainties for white-box models, the parameters and the set of model\nuncertainties for gray-box models, and entire reachset-conformant black-box\nmodels from data. For the black-box identification, we propose a new genetic\nprogramming variant, which we call conformant genetic programming. The\nrobustness and efficacy of our framework are demonstrated in extensive\nnumerical experiments using simulated and real-world data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
