Comet C/2021 A1 was observed with the IRAM 30-m\nradio telescope in November-December 2021 before perihelion when it was closest\nto the Earth. We observed C/2022 E3 in January-February 2023 with the Odin 1-m\nspace telescope and IRAM 30-m, shortly after its perihelion, and when it was\nclosest to the Earth. Snapshots were obtained during 12-16 November 2021 period\nfor comet C/2021 A1. Spectral surveys were undertaken over the 8-13 December\n2021 period for comet C/2021 A1 (8, 16, and 61 GHz bandwidth in the 3 mm, 2 mm,\nand 1 mm window) and over the 3-7 February 2023 period for comet C/2022 E3 (25\nand 61 GHz at 2 and 1mm). We report detections of 14 molecular species (HCN,\nHNC, CH3CN, HNCO, NH2CHO, CH3OH, H2CO, HCOOH, CH3CHO, H2S, CS, OCS, C2H5OH and\naGg-(CH2OH)2 ) in both comets plus HC3N and CH2OHCHO marginally detected in\nC/2021 A1 and CO and H2O (with Odin detected in C/2022 E3. The spatial\ndistribution of several species is investigated. Significant upper limits on\nthe abundances of other molecules and isotopic ratios are also presented. The\nactivity of comet C/2021 A1 did not vary significantly between 13 November and\n13 December 2021. Short-term variability in the outgassing of comet C/2022 E3\non the order of +-20% is present and possibly linked to its 8h rotation period.\nBoth comets exhibit rather low abundances relative to water for volatiles\nspecies such as CO (< 2%) and H2S (0.15%). Methanol is also rather depleted in\ncomet C/2021 A1 (0.9%). Following their revised photo-destruction rates, HNCO\nand HCOOH abundances in comets have been reevaluated. Both molecules are\nrelatively enriched in these two comets (0.2% relative to water). We cannot\nexclude that these species could be produced by the dissociation of ammonium\nsalts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
