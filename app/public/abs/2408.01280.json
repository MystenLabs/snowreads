They have been\nused to assess membrane viscosities but yield higher values compared to other\nmethods. Here, we show that the rotor's relaxation time is influenced by a\ncombination of membrane viscosity and interleaflet friction. We present a\ntheory for the relaxation time and obtain a correction factor that accounts for\nthe discrepancy. If the membrane's viscosity is known, molecular rotors may\nenable the extraction of the elusive interleaflet friction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"K5rxAGMfT4lHbNfCEChzmYO2xf1g8m93hf7JZ2EEAOU","pdfSize":"6545633","txDigest":"FBxoZmPn1MSEiWsCMvGStr9Lk1kbvmbVhkQtQTWoggfz","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
