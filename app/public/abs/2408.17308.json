The loss of lexical diversity through MT poses an issue in the\nautomatic translation of literature, where it matters not only what is written,\nbut also how it is written. Current methods for increasing lexical diversity in\nMT are rigid. Yet, as we demonstrate, the degree of lexical diversity can vary\nconsiderably across different novels. Thus, rather than aiming for the rigid\nincrease of lexical diversity, we reframe the task as recovering what is lost\nin the machine translation process. We propose a novel approach that consists\nof reranking translation candidates with a classifier that distinguishes\nbetween original and translated text. We evaluate our approach on 31\nEnglish-to-Dutch book translations, and find that, for certain books, our\napproach retrieves lexical diversity scores that are close to human\ntranslation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WNnA_0AA-hIY5hENqmUQTOcXDgzjb1rE7hGAno4V3L4","pdfSize":"553104"}
