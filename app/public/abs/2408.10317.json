Here we quantify nonlocality of bipartite\nquantum channels and identify its component resisting the effects of dephasing\nnoise. Despite its classical nature, we demonstrate that the latter plays a\nrelevant role in performing quantum protocols, such as state transformations\nand quantum coding for noisy communication. In the converse direction, we show\nthat simulating certain stochastic processes with quantum channels undergoing\ndecoherence has a communication advantage with respect to their classical\nsimulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
