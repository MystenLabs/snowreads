Previous methods based on time series analysis or deep learning\noften fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company\nrelationships such as competition and collaboration. Regarding the issues, we\npropose a novel approach using GrahphRAG augmented time series model. With\nGraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these\nvital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic\nunderstanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in\nstartup success predictions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the\nfirst application work of GraphRAG.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
