In this work we shed light on the atomic-scale\nmechanisms leading to phase transformations in Si under pressure. To do so, we\nsynergically exploit different state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, we\nuse the advanced GAP interatomic potential both in NPT molecular dynamics\nsimulations and in solid-state nudged elastic band calculations, validating our\npredictions with ab initio DFT calculations.\n  We provide a link between evidence reported in experimental nanoindentation\nliterature and simulation results. Particular attention is dedicated to the\ninvestigation of atomistic transition paths allowing for the transformation\nbetween BC8/R8 phases to the hd one under pure annealing. In this case we show\na direct simulation of the local nucleation of the hexagonal phase in a BC8/R8\nmatrix and its corresponding atomic-scale mechanism extracted by the use of\nSS-NEB. We extend our study investigating the effect of pressure on the\nnucleation barrier, providing an argument for explaining the heterogeneous\nnucleation of the hd phase observed in experiments reported in the literature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
