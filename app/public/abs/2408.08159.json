In this study, we present\ntheoretical evidence that these enhanced kinetic energy flows are driven by\nfirehose-unstable fluctuations and compressive heating within collisionless\nplasma environments. Using a fluid formalism that incorporates pressure\nanisotropy, we estimate that the downstream flow of a collisionless plasma\nshock can be accelerated by a factor of 2 to 4 following the compression and\nsaturation of firehose instability. By analyzing quasi-parallel magnetosheath\njets observed in situ by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we find\nthat approximately 11\\% of plasma measurements within these jets exhibit\nfirehose-unstable fluctuations. Our findings offer an explanation for the\ndistinctive generation of fast downstream flows in both low ($\\beta<1$) and\nhigh ($\\beta>1$) beta plasmas, and provide new evidence that kinetic processes\nare crucial for accurately describing the formation and evolution of\nmagnetosheath jets.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C5MUcs9iqXn3jc_7EHtT7t6rRwUexS7m_ChHyta6vDQ","pdfSize":"2141286"}
