The\nlatency is the time span from audio input to the output of the corresponding\nspeaker label. As part of the evaluation, various model combinations within the\nDIART framework, a diarization system based on the online clustering algorithm\nUIS-RNN-SML, and the end-to-end online diarization system FS-EEND are compared.\nThe lowest latency is achieved for the DIART-pipeline with the embedding model\npyannote/embedding and the segmentation model pyannote/segmentation. The\nFS-EEND system shows a similarly good latency. In general there is currently no\npublished research that compares several online diarization systems in terms of\ntheir latency. This makes this work even more relevant.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"bOitYsmPS3E3MmEi2XN1_XsQkhEI8OMZ-zCKKOEvHzc","pdfSize":"213690"}
