It relies on sector\ndecomposition in order to determine the coefficients of the individual orders\nin $\\epsilon=(4-D)/2$, where $D$ is the space-time dimension. For that purpose,\nit implements an interface to the public library pySecDec. The current version\nworks for massive and massless integrals up to three-loop level with vanishing\nexternal momenta, but the underlying method is extendable to more general\ncases.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Cbp8856GuhKRKp54DL6zThmXi39JwDoZ_XN25GHLeDU","pdfSize":"865278","objectId":"0x14378256c81dbe1b05e4cd4444545e85cf0230a073429f69a4a00e5d60bc9b2c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
