We prove the equivalence of the ${\\rm\nCD}(K, m)$-condition for $K\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $m\\in [n, \\infty]$ and some\nentropy differential inequalities along the geodesics on the Wasserstein space\nover a Riemannian manifold. The rigidity models of the entropy differential\ninequalities are the $K$-Einstein manifolds and the $(K, m)$-Einstein manifolds\nwith Hessian solitons. Moreover, we prove the monotonicity and rigidity theorem\nof the $W$-entropy along the geodesics on the Wasserstein space over Riemannian\nmanifolds with CD$(0, m)$-condition. Finally, we compare our work with the\nsynthetic geometry developed by Lott-Villani and Sturm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
