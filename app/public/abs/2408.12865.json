For instance, we\nshow that the distribution of right-to-left maxima on up-down permutations of\neven length is given by $(\\sec (t))^{q}$. We also derive the joint distribution\nof the maxima (resp., minima) statistics. To accomplish this, we generalize a\nresult of Kitaev and Remmel by deriving joint distributions involving\nnon-maxima (resp., non-minima) statistics. Consequently, we refine classic\nenumeration results of Andr\\'e by introducing new $q$-analogues and\n$(p,q)$-analogues for the number of alternating permutations.\n  Additionally, we verify Callan's conjecture (2012) that the number of up-down\npermutations of even length fixed by reverse and complement equals the Springer\nnumbers, thereby offering another combinatorial interpretation of these\nnumbers. Furthermore, we propose two $q$-analogues and a $(p,q)$-analogue of\nthe Springer numbers. Lastly, we enumerate alternating permutations that avoid\ncertain flat partially ordered patterns (POPs), where the only minimum or\nmaximum elements are labeled by the largest or smallest numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SDw7xBrH3_IlQxEGY2EdnIRCmHDAVOF5JL7iyJtZtsA","pdfSize":"267471"}
