However, which features of Krylov\ncomplexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to\nmore standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order\ncorrelators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that\nin quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak\nduring time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau.\nIn this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark\nof quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order\nparameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively\nidentifies chaotic-integrable transitions in the mass-deformed\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at both infinite and finite temperature, aligning with\nresults from spectral statistics and OTOCs. Our findings offer a new diagnostic\ntool for quantum chaos that is operator-independent, potentially leading to\nmore `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of general properties in\nquantum chaotic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
