In extended-range percolation nodes can be\ntrusted or untrusted. Untrusted facilitator nodes are untrusted nodes that can\nstill allow communication between trusted nodes if they lie on a path of\ndistance at most R between two trusted nodes. In extended-range percolation the\nextended-range giant component (ERGC) includes trusted nodes connected by paths\nof trusted and untrusted facilitator nodes. Here, based on a message passing\nalgorithm, we develop a general theory of extended-range percolation, valid for\narbitrary values of R as long as the networks are locally tree-like. This\ngeneral framework allows us to investigate the properties of extended-range\npercolation on interdependent multiplex networks. While the extended-range\nnature makes multiplex networks more robust, interdependency makes them more\nfragile. From the interplay between these two effects a rich phase diagram\nmerges including discontinuous phase transitions and reentrant phases. The\ntheoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with extensive Monte-Carlo\nsimulations. The proposed exactly solvable model constitutes a fundamental\nreference for the study of models defined through properties of extended-range\npaths.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
