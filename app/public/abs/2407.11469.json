To investigate their dynamics, we perform\nsimulations of the forced-dissipated kinetic equation describing the evolution\nof the energy spectrum of weakly nonlinear internal gravity waves. During the\nearly evolution, the three well-known non-local interactions, the Elastic\nScattering, the Induced-Diffusion, and the Parametric Sub-Harmonic Instability,\ntogether with the Super-Harmonic Instability play a prominent role. In\ncontrast, local interactions are responsible for anisotropic energy cascade on\nlonger time scales. We reveal emergence of a condensate at small horizontal\nwavevectors that can be interpreted as a pure wave-wave interaction-mediated\nlayering process. We also observe the dynamical formation of an energy spectrum\ncompatible with the Garrett-Munk prediction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
