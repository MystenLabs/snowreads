We tackle these\nchallenges by leveraging the score function $\\nabla \\log p(X)$ of observed\nvariables for causal discovery and propose the following contributions. First,\nwe generalize the existing results of identifiability with the score to\nadditive noise models with minimal requirements on the causal mechanisms.\nSecond, we establish conditions for inferring causal relations from the score\neven in the presence of hidden variables; this result is two-faced: we\ndemonstrate the score's potential as an alternative to conditional independence\ntests to infer the equivalence class of causal graphs with hidden variables,\nand we provide the necessary conditions for identifying direct causes in latent\nvariable models. Building on these insights, we propose a flexible algorithm\nfor causal discovery across linear, nonlinear, and latent variable models,\nwhich we empirically validate.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
