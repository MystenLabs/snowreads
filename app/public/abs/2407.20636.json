These inequalities are generalizations of the Riemannian\nPenrose inequality for minimal surfaces, and lead to the concept of extremality\nfor a given surface whose condition is given in terms of the gravitational mass\nand the electromagnetic charges. This means that the extremality is a\ncharacteristic property not only of black hole horizons or minimal surfaces but\nalso of surfaces in weak gravity region. We also derive areal inequalities and\nextremality conditions for surfaces in asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter\nspacetimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
