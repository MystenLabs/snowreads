In order to apply it we just need to know that the ambient group is\nof type $\\mathrm{FP}_m$ or of type $\\mathrm{F}_2$ and that the word problem is\nsolvable for this group. Then finite data is sufficient proof of membership in\n$\\Sigma^m$, not just for the given character but also for a neighborhood of it.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
