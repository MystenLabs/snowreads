When many nonequilibrium currents interact with each other, a\nnaive application of the TUR to an individual current can result in an apparent\nviolation of the TUR bound. Here, we explore how such an apparent violation can\nbe used to put a lower bound on the strength of correlations as well as the\nnumber of interacting currents in collective dynamics. Our proposed protocol\nallows for the inference of hidden correlations in experiment, for example when\na team of molecular motors pulls on the same cargo but only one or a subset of\nthem is fluorescently tagged. By solving analytically and numerically several\nmodels of many-body nonequilibrium dynamics, we ascertain under which\nconditions this strategy can be applied and the inferred bound on correlations\nbecomes tight.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
