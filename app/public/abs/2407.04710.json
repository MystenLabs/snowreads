This\ntool finds high-level human concepts in an image and generates the Weight of\nEvidence (WoE) for each hypothesis in the decision-making process. We apply and\nevaluate this tool in the skin cancer domain by building a web-based\napplication that allows users to upload a dermatoscopic image, select a\nhypothesis and analyse their decisions by evaluating the provided evidence.\nFurther, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Evaluative AI on different\nconcept-based explanation approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
