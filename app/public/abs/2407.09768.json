Posterior sampling from the conditional score function enable the\nprecious data consistency certified by the measurement-based likelihood term.\nHowever, most prevailing approaches confined to the deterministic deterioration\nprocess of the measurement model, regardless of capricious unpredictable\ndisturbance in real-world sceneries. To address this obstacle, we show that the\nmeasurement-based likelihood can be renovated with restoration-based likelihood\nvia the opposite probabilistic graphic direction, licencing the patronage of\nvarious off-the-shelf restoration models and extending the strictly\ndeterministic deterioration process to adaptable clustered processes with the\nsupposed prototype, in what we call restorer guidance. Particularly, assembled\nwith versatile prototypes optionally, we can resolve inverse problems with\nbunch of choices for assorted sample quality and realize the proficient\ndeterioration control with assured realistic. We show that our work can be\nformally analogous to the transition from classifier guidance to\nclassifier-free guidance in the field of inverse problem solver. Experiments on\nmultifarious inverse problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,\nincluding image dehazing, rain streak removal, and motion deblurring.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
