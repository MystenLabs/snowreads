Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise\nexponentially damps non-local correlations relative to local correlations. This\nenables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by only keeping\ntrack of the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables\nsampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasi-polynomial time, so\nlong as the distribution anti-concentrates. A number of practical implications\nare discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise\nmitigation strategies: any quantum circuit for which error mitigation is\nefficient must be classically simulable.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EQTu9N6hvhEv4w9CqMfX_BSoUVwYGCSKO7eQ5X9f-sw","pdfSize":"2103560"}
