Good Koopman modeling\nperformance significantly depends on an appropriate nonlinear mapping from the\noriginal state-space to a lifted state space. In this work, we propose an\ninput-augmented Koopman modeling and model predictive control approach. Both\nthe states and the known inputs are lifted using two deep neural networks\n(DNNs), and a Koopman model with nonlinearity in inputs is trained within the\nhigher-dimensional state-space. A Koopman-based model predictive control\nproblem is formulated. To bypass non-convex optimization induced by the\nnonlinearity in the Koopman model, we further present an iterative\nimplementation algorithm, which approximates the optimal control input via\nsolving a convex optimization problem iteratively. The proposed method is\napplied to a chemical process and a biological water treatment process via\nsimulations. The efficacy and advantages of the proposed modeling and control\napproach are demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
