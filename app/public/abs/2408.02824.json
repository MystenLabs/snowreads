However,\nits inherent dependencies on the square loss function make it susceptible to\nnoise and outliers. Furthermore, the calculation of RVFL's unknown parameters\nnecessitates matrix inversion of the entire training sample, which constrains\nits scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the Wave-RVFL, an RVFL\nmodel incorporating the wave loss function. We formulate and solve the proposed\noptimization problem of the Wave-RVFL using the adaptive moment estimation\n(Adam) algorithm in a way that successfully eliminates the requirement for\nmatrix inversion and significantly enhances scalability. The Wave-RVFL exhibits\nrobustness against noise and outliers by preventing over-penalization of\ndeviations, thereby maintaining a balanced approach to managing noise and\noutliers. The proposed Wave-RVFL model is evaluated on multiple UCI datasets,\nboth with and without the addition of noise and outliers, across various\ndomains and sizes. Empirical results affirm the superior performance and\nrobustness of the Wave-RVFL compared to baseline models, establishing it as a\nhighly effective and scalable classification solution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
