This\npaper leverages this ability to analyze AC-DC converter behaviors, focusing on\nthe ripple current in DC-link capacitors. Capacitors degrade faster under high\nripple currents, complicating life monitoring and necessitating preemptive\nreplacements. Using minimal invasive measurements from a full bridge rectifier\nand PFC-boost converter, we developed LLM-based models to predict ripple\ncontent in DC-link currents under noisy conditions. In this regard, based on\nsimulations and experimental data from a full-bridge rectifier and a 1.5kW PFC,\nwe have demonstrated the LLMs ability for near accurate prediction of capacitor\nripple current estimation. This study highlights the LLMs potential in modeling\nnonlinear power electronic circuit behaviors and determining data requirements\nfor precise circuit parameter predictions to predict component degradation\nand/or performance without any additional sensors. The final paper will have\nexpanded results, capacitor ESR estimation based on fine tuned LLM output.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
