A Corpus Investigation of\n  Occupation Gender Typicality","authors":"Da Ju and Karen Ulrich and Adina Williams","authorsParsed":[["Ju","Da",""],["Ulrich","Karen",""],["Williams","Adina",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2024 04:19:23 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-07","timestamp":1722917963000,"abstract":"  People tend to use language to mention surprising properties of events: for\nexample, when a banana is blue, we are more likely to mention color than when\nit is yellow. This fact is taken to suggest that yellowness is somehow a\ntypical feature of bananas, and blueness is exceptional. Similar to how a\nyellow color is typical of bananas, there may also be genders that are typical\nof occupations. In this work, we explore this question using information\ntheoretic techniques coupled with corpus statistic analysis. In two distinct\nlarge corpora, we do not find strong evidence that occupations and gender\ndisplay the same patterns of mentioning as do bananas and color. Instead, we\nfind that gender mentioning is correlated with femaleness of occupation in\nparticular, suggesting perhaps that woman-dominated occupations are seen as\nsomehow ``more gendered'' than male-dominated ones, and thereby they encourage\nmore gender mentioning overall.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
