This comprehensive review\nlooks at key trust issues in LLMs, such as unintended harms, lack of\ntransparency, vulnerability to attacks, alignment with human values, and\nenvironmental impact. Many obstacles can undermine user trust, including\nsocietal biases, opaque decision-making, potential for misuse, and the\nchallenges of rapidly evolving technology. Addressing these trust gaps is\ncritical as LLMs become more common in sensitive areas like finance,\nhealthcare, education, and policy. To tackle these issues, we suggest combining\nethical oversight, industry accountability, regulation, and public involvement.\nAI development norms should be reshaped, incentives aligned, and ethics\nintegrated throughout the machine learning process, which requires close\ncollaboration across technology, ethics, law, policy, and other fields. Our\nreview contributes a robust framework to assess trust in LLMs and analyzes the\ncomplex trust dynamics in depth. We provide contextualized guidelines and\nstandards for responsibly developing and deploying these powerful AI systems.\nThis review identifies key limitations and challenges in creating trustworthy\nAI. By addressing these issues, we aim to build a transparent, accountable AI\necosystem that benefits society while minimizing risks. Our findings provide\nvaluable guidance for researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders striving\nto establish trust in LLMs and ensure they are used responsibly across various\napplications for the good of society.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
