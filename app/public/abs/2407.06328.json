Unlike\nconventional population game formulations, we consider a scenario where agents\nmust estimate the payoffs through local measurements and communication with\ntheir neighbors. By employing task allocation games -- dynamic extensions of\nconventional population games -- we examine how errors in payoff estimation by\nindividual agents affect the convergence of the strategy revision process. Our\nmain contribution is an analysis of how estimation errors impact the\nconvergence of the agents' strategy profile to equilibrium. Based on the\nanalytical results, we propose a design for a time-varying strategy revision\nrate to guarantee convergence. Simulation studies illustrate how the proposed\nmethod for updating the revision rate facilitates convergence to equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
