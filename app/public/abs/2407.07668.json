One of the main challenges\nin this scenario is the so-called catastrophic forgetting (CF) for which the\nlearning model tends to focus on the most recent tasks while experiencing\npredictive degradation on older ones. In the online setting, the most effective\nsolutions employ a fixed-size memory buffer to store old samples used for\nreplay when training on new tasks. Many approaches have been presented to\ntackle this problem. However, it is not clear how predictive uncertainty\ninformation for memory management can be leveraged in the most effective manner\nand conflicting strategies are proposed to populate the memory. Are the\neasiest-to-forget or the easiest-to-remember samples more effective in\ncombating CF? Starting from the intuition that predictive uncertainty provides\nan idea of the samples' location in the decision space, this work presents an\nin-depth analysis of different uncertainty estimates and strategies for\npopulating the memory. The investigation provides a better understanding of the\ncharacteristics data points should have for alleviating CF. Then, we propose an\nalternative method for estimating predictive uncertainty via the generalised\nvariance induced by the negative log-likelihood. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthe use of predictive uncertainty measures helps in reducing CF in different\nsettings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
