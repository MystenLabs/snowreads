The materials hosting multiple-$Q$ states\nhave been so far observed in a variety of lattice structures and chemical\ncompositions, which indicates rich stabilization mechanisms inducing the\nmultiple-$Q$ states. We review recent developments in the research of the\nstabilization mechanisms of such multiple-$Q$ states with an emphasis on the\nmicroscopic spin interactions in momentum space. We show that an effective\nmomentum-resolved spin model is a canonical model for not only understanding\nthe microscopic origin of various multiple-$Q$ states but also exploring\nfurther exotic multiple-$Q$ states with topological properties. We introduce\nseveral key ingredients to realize the magnetic skyrmion crystal with the\nskyrmion numbers of one and two, hedgehog crystal, meron-antimeron crystal,\nbubble crystal, and other multiple-$Q$ states. We also review that the\neffective spin model can be used to reproduce the magnetic phase diagram in\nexperiments efficiently.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qch53ZjcN9CJj0ylbk3JB9tul9nozo2lFVCKKwol_9Y","pdfSize":"14098037"}
