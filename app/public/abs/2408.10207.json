These models have gained popularity in domains such as image processing,\nspeech synthesis, and natural language processing due to their ability to\nproduce high-quality samples. As Diffusion Models are being adopted in various\ndomains, existing literature reviews that often focus on specific areas like\ncomputer vision or medical imaging may not serve a broader audience across\nmultiple fields. Therefore, this review presents a comprehensive overview of\nDiffusion Models, covering their theoretical foundations and algorithmic\ninnovations. We highlight their applications in diverse areas such as media\nquality, authenticity, synthesis, image transformation, healthcare, and more.\nBy consolidating current knowledge and identifying emerging trends, this review\naims to facilitate a deeper understanding and broader adoption of Diffusion\nModels and provide guidelines for future researchers and practitioners across\ndiverse disciplines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
