Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong\ncorrelations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through\nrenormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and\nemergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued\nhybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum\nphase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization\neffect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against\nloss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the\nvalence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can\nbe tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to\nelectronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
