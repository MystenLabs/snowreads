It allows one to compute the Weyl matrix of a large graph by adding\nnew edges and solving elementary systems of linear algebraic equations at each\nstep. Synthesis of the Weyl matrix is useful to further study the inverse\nproblems of the square lattice. Moreover, our approach can be extended to other\ntypes of periodic lattices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
