Due to misinformation spreading\nincreasingly fast, attention has been directed towards automatically verifying\nthe correctness of claims. In the domain of NLP, this is usually done by\ntraining supervised machine learning models to verify claims by utilizing\nevidence from trustworthy corpora. We present efficient methods for verifying\nclaims on a dataset where the evidence is in the form of structured knowledge\ngraphs. We use the FactKG dataset, which is constructed from the DBpedia\nknowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia. By simplifying the evidence retrieval\nprocess, from fine-tuned language models to simple logical retrievals, we are\nable to construct models that both require less computational resources and\nachieve better test-set accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
