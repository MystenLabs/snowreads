Although explored\nprimarily with image datasets by researchers, this study focuses on\ninvestigating DFCIL for skeleton-based gesture classification due to its\nsignificant real-world implications, particularly considering the growing\nprevalence of VR/AR headsets where gestures serve as the primary means of\ncontrol and interaction. In this work, we made an intriguing observation:\nskeleton models trained with base classes(even very limited) demonstrate strong\ngeneralization capabilities to unseen classes without requiring additional\ntraining. Building on this insight, we developed Synthetic Feature Replay (SFR)\nthat can sample synthetic features from class prototypes to replay for old\nclasses and augment for new classes (under a few-shot setting). Our proposed\nmethod showcases significant advancements over the state-of-the-art, achieving\nup to 15% enhancements in mean accuracy across all steps and largely mitigating\nthe accuracy imbalance between base classes and new classes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
