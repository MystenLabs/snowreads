We consider Bayesian expected-payoff maximizers who receive\nnon-strategic recommendations by other consumers. The paper provides conditions\nunder which different consumer types accept these recommendations. Moreover, we\nassess the overall value of a recommendation system and the determinants of\nthat value. Our analysis highlights the importance of disentangling objective\ninformation from subjective preferences when designing value-maximizing\nrecommendation systems.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
