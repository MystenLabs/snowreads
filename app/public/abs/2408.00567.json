Also, a finite rank perturbation property holds: when $X$ is perturbed\nby another deterministic matrix $C_N$ with bounded rank, then the perturbation\ninduces outlying eigenvalues whose limit depends only on outlying eigenvalues\nof $C_N$ and $\\rho$. This extends the result of Tao on i.i.d. random matrices\nand O'rourke and Renfrew on elliptic matrices to a family of highly sparse and\ninhomogeneous random matrices, including all Gaussian band matrices on regular\ngraphs with degree at least $(\\log N)^3$. A quantitative convergence rate is\nalso derived. We also consider a class of finite rank deformations of products\nof at least two independent elliptic random matrices, and show it behaves just\nas product i.i.d. matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6UqzV7snbaCmEU3MAVGeH6J_bZytZ2WoFVl7nvXcJPs","pdfSize":"357534"}
