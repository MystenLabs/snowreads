ETSI and 3GPP have started feasibility and\nperformance investigations of such a technology. This work proposes an\nanalytical model to analyze RIS performance. It relies on a simple street model\nwhere obstacles and mobile units are all aligned. RIS is positioned onto a\nbuilding parallel to the road. The coverage probability in presence of\nobstacles and concurrent communications is then computed as a performance\ncriteria.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
