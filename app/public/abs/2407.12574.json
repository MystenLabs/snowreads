These materials consist of\nalternating highly doped and intrinsic regions on the scale of several\nnanometers. This structure enables the creation of potential wells and\nbarriers, implementing a mechanism for filtering carrier energy. Our study\ndemonstrates that by carefully designing the nanostructure, we can\nsignificantly enhance its thermoelectric power factor compared to the original\npristine material. Importantly, these enhancements stem not only from the\nenergy filtering effect that boosts the Seebeck coefficient but also from the\nutilization of high-energy carriers within the wells and intrinsic barrier\nregions to maintain relatively high electronic conductivity. These findings can\noffer guidance for the design and optimization of new-generation thermoelectric\nmaterials through improvements in the power factor.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
