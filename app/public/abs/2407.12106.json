The existence of these values results in Jordan blocks of size\ngreater than one, which we call nontrivial. We show a relationship between the\neigenspaces of the non-backtracking matrix and the eigenspaces of a smaller\nmatrix, completely classifying their differences among graphs with at most one\ncycle. Finally, we provide several constructions of infinite graph families\nthat have nontrivial Jordan blocks for both this smaller matrix and the\nnon-backtracking matrix.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
