We consider here two types of aperiodic drives: random and\nquasi-periodic. We observe a short-lived pseudo-thermal regime with algebraic\nsuppression of heating for the random drive where WTD has an infinite tail, as\nobserved for Poisson and binomial kick sequences. On the other hand,\nquasi-periodic drive characterised by a WTD with a sharp cut-off, observed for\nThue-Morse sequence of kick, leads to prethermal region where heating is\nexponentially suppressed. The kinetic energy growth is analyzed using an\naverage surprise associated with WTD quantifying the randomness of drive. In\nall of the aperiodic drives we obtain the chaotic heating regime for late time,\nhowever, the diffusion constant gets renormalized by the average surprise of\nWTD in comparison to the periodic case.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
