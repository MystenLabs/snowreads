The\nactuators and sensors are indicator functions of small subdomains, representing\nlocalized actuation and localized measurements. It is shown that, for a class\nof explicitly given sets of actuators and sensors, we can guarantee the\nstabilizing property of the constructed input. Results of numerical simulations\nare presented validating the theoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
