As a result of this process a parameter dubbed $\\ln a$\nemerges that separate between infrared and typical external momenta. The\nresulting partial-wave amplitudes are next unitarized by employing the Inverse\nAmplitude Method and the algebraic-$N/D$ method. Then, the graviball resonance,\nwith a similar pole position, is confirmed in the $S$-wave partial-wave\namplitude for all unitarization methods, also with respect to the unitarization\nof only the leading-order amplitude. Based on the requirement for a\nwell-behaved unitarized effective-field theory of gravity, we can exclude\nvalues $\\ln a\\lesssim 0.5$, and obtain hints that larger ones $\\ln a\\gtrsim\n1.7$ are disfavored too. Briefly, we discuss the $D$-wave scattering that is\nweaker than the $S-$wave scattering, repulsive and non-resonant for $\\ln\na\\approx 1$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"96bcOGi2ybX5WkF6QhMHHsIRN5wqYX8sn1Cx9WRQr68","pdfSize":"610648"}
