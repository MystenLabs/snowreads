Reasoning methods can be divided into two\ncategories: rule-based methods and KG-embedding based methods. The former\npossesses precise reasoning capabilities but finds it challenging to reason\nefficiently over large-scale knowledge graphs. While gaining the ability to\nreason over large-scale knowledge graphs, the latter sacrifices reasoning\naccuracy. This paper aims to design a reasoning framework called Neural\nProbabilistic Logic Learning(NPLL) that achieves accurate reasoning on\nknowledge graphs. Our approach introduces a scoring module that effectively\nenhances the expressive power of embedding networks, striking a balance between\nmodel simplicity and reasoning capabilities. We improve the interpretability of\nthe model by incorporating a Markov Logic Network based on variational\ninference. We empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets,\nand the experimental results validate that our method substantially enhances\nthe accuracy and quality of the reasoning results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
