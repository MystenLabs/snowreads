This,\nin turn, has led to significantly improved key rates of DI protocols, in both\nthe asymptotic limit as well as in the finite-size regime. In this paper, we\ndiscuss two approaches towards applying these variational methods for\nPetz-R\\'enyi divergences instead. We then show how this can be used to further\nimprove the finite-size key rate of DI protocols, utilizing a fully-R\\'enyi\nentropy accumulation theorem developed in a partner work. Petz-R\\'enyi\ndivergences can also be applied to study DI advantage distillation, in which\ntwo-way communication is used to improve the noise tolerance of quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) protocols. We implement these techniques to derive increased\nnoise tolerances for DIQKD protocols, which surpass all previous known bounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
