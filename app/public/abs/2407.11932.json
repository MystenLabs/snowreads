More precisely, suppose that we observe a graph $A$ on\n$n$ vertices with average edge density $p$ generated from Gaussian or spherical\nlatent locations $z_1, \\dots, z_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ associated with the $n$\nvertices. It is of interest to estimate the inner products $\\langle z_i, z_j\n\\rangle$ which represent the geometry of the latent points. We prove that it is\nimpossible to recover the inner products if $d \\gtrsim n h(p)$ where $h(p)$ is\nthe binary entropy function. This matches the condition required for positive\nresults on inner product recovery in the literature. The proof follows the\nwell-established rate-distortion theory with the main technical ingredient\nbeing a lower bound on the rate-distortion function of the Wishart distribution\nwhich is interesting in its own right.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Mathematics/Information Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
