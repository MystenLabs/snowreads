The\ndynamics of each agent follows a linear stochastic differential equation driven\nby individual noise, and all agents are coupled together via the control\naverage term. Using the mean-field game approach and the backward separation\nprinciple with a state decomposition technique, the decentralized optimal\ncontrol can be obtained in the open-loop form through a forward-backward\nstochastic differential equation with the conditional expectation. The optimal\nfiltering equation is also provided. By the decoupling method, the\ndecentralized optimal control can also be further presented as the feedback of\nstate filtering via the Riccati equation. The explicit solution of the control\naverage limit is given, and the consistency condition system is discussed.\nMoreover, the related $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium property is verified. To\nillustrate the good performance of theoretical results, an example in finance\nis studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
