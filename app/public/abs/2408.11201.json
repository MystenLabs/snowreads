When studying spectral gaps, it is common to bound\nthese quantities using tools from statistical mechanics or via quantum\ninformation-based inequalities. By focusing on the second moment of\none-dimensional unitary circuits where nearest neighboring gates act on sets of\nqudits (with open and closed boundary conditions), we show that one can exactly\ncompute the associated spectral gaps. Indeed, having access to their functional\nform allows us to prove several important results, such as the fact that the\nspectral gap for closed boundary condition is exactly the square of the gap for\nopen boundaries, as well as improve on previously known bounds for approximate\ndesign convergence. Finally, we verify our theoretical results by numerically\ncomputing the spectral gap for systems of up to 70 qubits, as well as comparing\nthem to gaps of random orthogonal and symplectic circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
