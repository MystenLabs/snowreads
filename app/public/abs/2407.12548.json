In this work we consider a Wright-Fisher model for a\nrandomly mating population, where selection and mutation act at an unlinked\nlocus. The selection acting has a general form, and the locus may have two or\nmore alleles. We determine an exact representation of the time dependent\ntransition probability of such a model in terms of a path integral. Path\nintegrals were introduced in physics and mathematics, and have found numerous\napplications in different fields, where a probability distribution, or closely\nrelated object, is represented as a 'sum' of contributions over all paths or\ntrajectories between two points. Path integrals provide alternative\ncalculational routes to problems, and may be a source of new intuition and\nsuggest new approximations. For the case of two alleles, we relate the exact\nWright-Fisher path-integral result to the path-integral form of the transition\ndensity under the diffusion approximation. We determine properties of the\nWright-Fisher transition probability for multiple alleles. We show how, in the\nabsence of mutation, the Wright-Fisher transition probability incorporates\nphenomena such as fixation and loss.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qvvoNmcI4sZ2kdTF_ehoZ3w5O6U3zvyCZAAhfMtc5tI","pdfSize":"200739"}
