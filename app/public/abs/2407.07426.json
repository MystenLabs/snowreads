The\nmethod utilizes the fast-convergent intermediate state representation to\nconstruct many-electron wave functions and is readily applicable to atoms,\nmolecules and clusters. The ADC(2,2) scheme describes the initial and final\nstates of the normal Auger decay consistently up to the second order of\nperturbation theory. In addition, excitations with two electrons in the\ncontinuum provide access to three-electron decay modes. The method yields decay\nwidths and the Auger electron spectra in excellent agreement with the\nexperiment, demonstrating the high accuracy of partial widths. The average\nrelative error of double Auger decay branching ratios compared to available\nexperimental data is about 30\\%, which should be evaluated as an excellent\nresult considering the universality of the method, the complexity of the double\ndecay process and the neglection of nuclear motion in the present study.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
