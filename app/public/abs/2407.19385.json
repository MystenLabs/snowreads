Existing research studies have mostly focused on imaging data, such\nas structural and functional MRI, for SZ diagnosis. There has been less focus\non the integration of genomic features despite their potential in identifying\nheritable SZ traits. In this study, we introduce a Multi-modal Imaging Genomics\nTransformer (MIGTrans), that attentively integrates genomics with structural\nand functional imaging data to capture SZ-related neuroanatomical and\nconnectome abnormalities. MIGTrans demonstrated improved SZ classification\nperformance with an accuracy of 86.05% (+/- 0.02), offering clear\ninterpretations and identifying significant genomic locations and brain\nmorphological/connectivity patterns associated with SZ.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
