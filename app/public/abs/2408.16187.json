The datasets are intended to address the scarcity of proper\ndatasets for streaming regression learning tasks. We conduct extensive analyses\nand experiments on these datasets, covering preprocessing techniques,\nregression tasks, prediction intervals, concept drift detection, and anomaly\ndetection. Our experiments demonstrate the datasets' utility and highlight the\nchallenges and opportunities for future research in energy price forecasting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
