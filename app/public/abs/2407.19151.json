These methods preserve\nmomentum and energy exactly when the simulation particles have equal weights.\nHowever, when the interacting particles are of varying weight, these physical\nconservation laws are only preserved on average. Here, we 1) extend these\nmethods to weighted particles such that the scattering physics is correct on\naverage, and 2) describe a new method for adjusting the particle velocities\npost scatter to restore exact conservation of momentum and energy. The efficacy\nof the model is illustrated with various test problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
