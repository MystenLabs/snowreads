Thus, the evaluation of other biometric\nmodalities such as fingerprint, iris, and others must be explored and evaluated\nto enhance biometric systems. This work proposes an end-to-end framework to\nproduce iris morphs at the image level, creating morphs from Periocular iris\nimages. This framework considers different stages such as pair subject\nselection, segmentation, morph creation, and a new iris recognition system. In\norder to create realistic morphed images, two approaches for subject selection\nare explored: random selection and similar radius size selection. A\nvulnerability analysis and a Single Morphing Attack Detection algorithm were\nalso explored. The results show that this approach obtained very realistic\nimages that can confuse conventional iris recognition systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
