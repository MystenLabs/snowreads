These channels are dubbed as quantum ergodic\nchannels. We have constructed Lindblad-type master equations for such channels\nfor arbitrary dimensions. We also characterise the aspect of non-Markovianity\nfor such a general class of channels. Interestingly, if the fixed point is\nconsidered a passive state, it turns out to be an ergotropy-decreasing channel\nat a given instant. The formalism of ergotropy is widely used in quantum\nbatteries, where it quantifies how effectively a quantum battery can be used as\nan energy source under unitary evolution only. Our investigation explores how\nthe usefulness of a quantum battery, or the ergotropy of a system, varies under\nergodic dynamics. We observed that, while ergotropy always decreases in a\nMarkovian process, it fluctuates under non-Markovian ergodic dynamics. This\nergotropy backflow in the non-Markovian process makes it a potential candidate\nfor measuring non-Markovianity. Consequently, this study enhances our\nunderstanding of quantum battery evolution in open dynamics and paves the way\nfor more efficient quantum technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
