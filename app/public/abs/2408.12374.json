Here, we\npropose a doping-free homojunction solar cell utilizing two-dimensional Janus\nsemiconductors to achieve high PCE. Thanks to the intrinsic dipole of Janus\nstructure, doping-free Janus homojunction has naturally not only a type-II band\nalignment to promote the photoexciton dissociation, but also a smaller\neffective bandgap to enhance light absorption. More importantly, the intrinsic\nelectric field across the Janus structure will drive photoinduced electron and\nhole transfer from the interface to the opposite transport layers respectively,\nsignificantly enhancing the efficiency of carrier separation and transport. We\nillustrate the concept in titanium-based Janus monolayer homojunction, where\nthe theoretically observed PCE reaches 23.22% of TiSSe homojunction. Our work\nopens a novel avenue to design low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
