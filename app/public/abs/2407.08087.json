While ISAC enables new applications, IM is attractive for its\ninherent energy and spectral efficiencies. In this article we propose massive\nIM as an enabler of ISAC, by considering transmit signals with information\nconveyed through the indexation of the resources utilized in their\ntransmission, and pilot symbols exploited for sensing. In order to overcome the\ncomplexity hurdle arising from the large sizes of IM codebooks, we propose a\nnovel message passing (MP) decoder designed under the Gaussian belief\npropagation (GaBP) framework exploiting a novel unit vector decomposition (UVD)\nof IM signals with purpose-derived novel probability distributions. The\nproposed method enjoys a low decoding complexity that is independent of\ncombinatorial factors, while still approaching the performance of unfeasible\nstate-of-the-art (SotA) search-based methods. The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach is demonstrated via complexity analysis and numerical results for\npiloted generalized quadrature spatial modulation (GQSM) systems of large sizes\n(up to 96 antennas).\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
