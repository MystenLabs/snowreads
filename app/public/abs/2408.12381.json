However, the ongoing\ndeforestation and degradation affect millions of hectares each year,\nnecessitating government or private initiatives to ensure effective forest\nmonitoring. In April 2019, a project based on Citizen Science and Machine\nLearning models called ForestEyes (FE) was launched with the aim of providing\nsupplementary data to assist experts from government and non-profit\norganizations in their deforestation monitoring efforts. Recent research has\nshown that labeling FE project volunteers/citizen scientists helps tailor\nmachine learning models. In this sense, we adopt the FE project to create\ndifferent sampling strategies based on the wisdom of crowds to select the most\nsuitable samples from the training set to learn an SVM technique and obtain\nbetter classification results in deforestation detection tasks. In our\nexperiments, we can show that our strategy based on user entropy-increasing\nachieved the best classification results in the deforestation detection task\nwhen compared with the random sampling strategies, as well as, reducing the\nconvergence time of the SVM technique.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
