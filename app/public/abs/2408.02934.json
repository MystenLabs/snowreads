To address this challenge, one\npromising solution exploits the beamspace channel sparsity to reconstruct\nfull-dimensional channels from incomplete measurements. This paper presents a\nmodel-based deep learning method to reconstruct sparse, as well as\napproximately sparse, vectors fast and accurately. To implement this method, we\npropose a trimmed-ridge regression that transforms the sparse-reconstruction\nproblem into a least-squares problem regularized by a nonconvex penalty term,\nand then derive an iterative solution. We then unfold the iterations into a\ndeep network that can be implemented in online applications to realize\nreal-time computations. To this end, an unfolded trimmed-ridge regression model\nis constructed using a structural configuration to reduce computational\ncomplexity and a model ensemble strategy to improve accuracy. Compared with\nother state-of-the-art deep learning models, the proposed learning scheme\nachieves better accuracy and supports higher downlink sum rates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
