The interaction mediated by visual information is\nessentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a\nchallenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this\nLetter, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local\nvisual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a\ncoarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively\npairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism\nstochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically\nderive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening\neffect substantially raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish\nwhen the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is\ntaken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a\ndiscontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the\ndiscontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the\nessential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving\norganisms.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
