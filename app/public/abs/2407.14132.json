This subgrid scale term is tailor-made\nto capture the statistics of a small set of spatially-integrate quantities of\ninterest (QoIs), with only one unresolved scalar time series per QoI. In\ncontrast to other data-driven surrogates the dimension of the ``learning\nproblem\" is reduced from an evolving field to one scalar time series per QoI.\nWe use an a-posteriori, nudging approach to find the distribution of the scalar\nseries over time. This approach has the advantage of taking the interaction\nbetween the solver and the surrogate into account. A stochastic surrogate\nparametrization is obtained by random sampling from the found distribution for\nthe scalar time series. Compared to an a-priori trained convolutional neural\nnetwork, evaluating the new method is computationally much cheaper and gives\nsimilar long-term statistics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NwEQQL2KlUT4MAW9lyzAUzUTHsYz478JzyWDAH9nmm0","pdfSize":"5853969"}
