The unatomic regime is reached at the dimension\n$\\overline D$, which for three identical atoms is found to be $\\overline\nD=2.292$ - below this value, the trimer wave function at short distances\ndisplays a power-law behaviour. The fingerprint of this crossover is a sharp\nevolution of the contacts that characterizes the trimer momentum distribution\ntail.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
