Heine shows that given a symmetric monoidal\n$\\infty$-category $\\mathcal{V}$ and a weakly $\\mathcal{V}$-enriched monad $T$\nover an $\\infty$-category $\\mathcal{C}$, then there is an induced action of\n$\\mathcal{V}$ on $LMod_T(\\mathcal{C})$. Moreover, properties like tensoring or\nenrichment can be transferred from the action on $\\mathcal{C}$ to that on\n$LMod_T(\\mathcal{C})$. We see that the action of an internal operad $O \\in\nAlg(sSeq(\\mathcal{C}))$ can be interpreted as the action of a monad $T_O$, such\nthat $Alg_O(\\mathcal{C})\\cong LMod_{T_O}(\\mathcal{C})$. We can then prove that,\nunder a presentability assumption, if the category $\\mathcal{C}$ admits\ncotensors with respect to the action of $\\mathcal{V}$, then so does\n$Alg_O(\\mathcal{C})\\cong LMod_{T_O}(\\mathcal{C})$. This is used to show that\nthe coproduct-idempotent algebras are fixed by the induced tensoring action. We\napply this to the stable motivic homotopy category and prove that the tensor of\nany motivic sphere with rational motivic cohomology is equivalent to the\nlatter.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wuOddCyyZCUt8S3gmlR4IXDVS3WhU1Mfedkbg3vB-Ps","pdfSize":"697115","objectId":"0x9a1cc618388e2dea8aaf3c48ce7fa03fa0788965829e153cf63cc5db6769949c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
