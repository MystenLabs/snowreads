However, studies traditionally focus on a\nsingle aspect of trauma, often neglecting the transferability of findings\nacross different scenarios. We address this gap by training language models\nwith progressing complexity on trauma-related datasets, including\ngenocide-related court data, a Reddit dataset on post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD), counseling conversations, and Incel forum posts. Our results show that\nthe fine-tuned RoBERTa model excels in predicting traumatic events across\ndomains, slightly outperforming large language models like GPT-4. Additionally,\nSLALOM-feature scores and conceptual explanations effectively differentiate and\ncluster trauma-related language, highlighting different trauma aspects and\nidentifying sexual abuse and experiences related to death as a common traumatic\nevent across all datasets. This transferability is crucial as it allows for the\ndevelopment of tools to enhance trauma detection and intervention in diverse\npopulations and settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1GLpEJvLbjh-JrPoz13JEXvJCKrx5e7f3RFwcLeqid8","pdfSize":"1206836"}
