We study linear maps $T$ on $m\\times n$\nmatrices preserving parallel (resp. TEA) pairs, i.e., $T(A)$ and $T(B)$ are\nparallel (resp. TEA) whenever $A$ and $B$ are parallel (resp. TEA).\n  It is shown that when $m,n \\ge 2$ and $(m,n) \\ne (2,2)$, a nonzero linear map\n$T$ preserving TEA pairs if and only if it is a positive multiple of a linear\nisometry, namely, $T$ has the form\n  $$(1) \\quad A \\mapsto \\gamma UAV \\quad \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\quad (2) \\quad\nA \\mapsto \\gamma UA^{t} V \\quad (\\text{in this case}, m = n),$$ for a positive\nnumber $\\gamma$, and unitary (or real orthogonal) matrices $U$ and $V$ of\nappropriate sizes. Linear maps preserving parallel pairs are those carrying\nform (1), (2), or the form\n  $$ (3) \\ A \\mapsto f(A) Z$$\n  for a linear functional $f$ and a fixed matrix $Z$.\n  The case when $(m,n) = (2,2)$ is more complicated. There are linear maps of\n$2\\times 2$ matrices preserving parallel pairs or TEA pairs neither of the form\n(1), (2) nor (3) above. Complete characterization of such maps is given with\nsome intricate computation and techniques in matrix groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
