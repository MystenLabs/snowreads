Since the initial release of PyFR v0.1.0 in\n2013, a range of new capabilities have been added to the framework, with a view\nto enabling industrial adoption of the capability. This paper provides details\nof those enhancements as released in PyFR v2.0.3, explains efforts to grow an\nengaged developer and user community, and provides latest performance and\nscaling results on up to 1024 AMD Instinct MI250X accelerators of Frontier at\nORNL (each with two GCDs), and up to 2048 NVIDIA GH200 GPUs on Alps at CSCS.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2k_nPyYFdqfcoTlvzQaabagXI_F2XaQW76ZMm6rXlmo","pdfSize":"14298702"}
