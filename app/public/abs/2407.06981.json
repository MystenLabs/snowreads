Multi-plane light converter (MPLC) systems have\nemerged as a platform that promises completely general spatial transformations,\ni.e., a universal unitary. However until now, MPLC systems have demonstrated\ntransformations that are far from general, e.g., converting from a Gaussian to\nLaguerre-Gauss mode. Here, we demonstrate the promise of an MLPC, the ability\nto impose an arbitrary unitary transformation that can be reconfigured\ndynamically. Specifically, we consider transformations on superpositions of\nparallel free-space beams arranged in an array, which is a common information\nencoding in photonics. We experimentally test the full gamut of unitary\ntransformations for a system of two parallel beams and make a map of their\nfidelity. We obtain an average transformation fidelity of $0.85 \\pm 0.03$. This\nhigh-fidelity suggests MPLCs are a useful tool implementing the unitary\ntransformations that comprise quantum and classical information processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hjFiA9_fvbff6mtyx3pcbx2yr0Z8jzSQLAFwtXN1NIc","pdfSize":"1675657"}
