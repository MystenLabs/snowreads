Within each equivariance class $m\n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ this admits a lowest energy nontrivial steady state $Q^m$,\nwhich extends to a two dimensional family of steady states by scaling and\nrotation. If $|m| \\geq 3$ then these ground states are known to be stable in\nthe energy space $\\dot H^1$, whereas instability and even finite time blow-up\nalong the ground state family may occur if $|m| = 1$. In this article we\nconsider the most delicate case $|m| = 2$. Our main result asserts that small\n$\\dot H^1$ perturbations of the ground state $Q^2$ yield global in time\nsolutions, which satisfy global dispersive bounds. Unlike the higher\nequivariance classes, here we expect solutions to move arbitrarily far along\nthe soliton family; however, we are able to provide a time dependent bound on\nthe growth of the scale modulation parameter. We also show that within the\nequivariant class the ground state is stable in a slightly stronger topology $X\n\\subset \\dot H^1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
