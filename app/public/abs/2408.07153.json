By\nincorporating stabilization terms, we establish the well-posedness of the\nproposed methods, thus avoiding the need to construct a discrete\nMiranda-Talenti estimate. We derive the optimal error estimate in the discrete\n$H^2$ norm for both numerical formulations. Furthermore, a semismooth Newton's\nmethod is employed to linearize the discrete problems. Several numerical\nexperiments using the lowest-order VEMs are provided to demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed methods and to validate our theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
