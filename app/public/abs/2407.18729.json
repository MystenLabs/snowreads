The nonlinear polarization may be instantaneous or retarded,\nand we assume it to be confined inside the core of the waveguide. We prove\nexistence of infinitely many spatially localized, real-valued and time-periodic\nsolutions (breathers) propagating inside the waveguide by applying a\nvariational minimization method to the resulting scalar quasilinear\nelliptic-hyperbolic equation for the profile of the breathers. The temporal\nperiod of the breathers has to be carefully chosen depending on the linear\nproperties of the waveguide. As an example, our results apply if a two-layered\nlinear axisymmetric waveguide is enhanced by a third core region with low\nrefractive index where also the nonlinearity is located. In this case we can\nalso connect our existence result with a bifurcation result. We illustrate our\nresults with numerical simulations. Our solutions are polychromatic functions\nin general, but for some special models of retarded nonlinear material laws,\nalso monochromatic solutions can exist. In this case the numerical simulations\nraise an interesting open question: are the breather solutions with minimal\nenergy monochromatic or polychromatic?\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
