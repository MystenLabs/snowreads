We show that a considerable fraction of the BBH in AGN\ndisks will be strongly lensed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH).\nThus, the non-observation of lensed GW signals can be used to constrain the\nfraction of BBH binaries residing in AGN disks. The non-detection of lensing\nwith current ${\\cal O}(100)$ detections will be sufficient to start placing\nconstraints on the fraction of BBHs living within accretion disks near the\nSMBH. In the next-generation detectors era, with ${\\cal O}(10^5)$ BBH\nobservations and no lensed events, we will be able to rule out most migration\ntraps as dominant birthplaces of BBH mergers; moreover, we will be able to\nconstrain the minimum size of the accretion disk. On the other hand, should\nAGNs constitute a major formation channel, lensed events from AGNs will become\nprominent in the future.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
