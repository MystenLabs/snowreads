The benefits of this approach\nare however limited by the lack of a good evaluation of its robustness. In\norder to mitigate this limitation, we derive in this work an analytical\nsolution for the arrival direction as well as the corresponding analytical\nreconstruction uncertainty. Because it is fast and robust, this reconstruction\nmethod can be used as a proxy for more complex estimators, or implemented\nonline for low-level triggering.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4jRuicX86B4UizWcDj_A6AFNEOjVCrSKWO9PM1QzYgc","pdfSize":"539355"}
