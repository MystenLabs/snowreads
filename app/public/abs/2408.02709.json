It\ncategorizes and copares various architectures combining machine learning and\nrule-based reasoning to provide insights into their structural foundations and\nhealthcare applications. Addressing two main questions, how to categorize these\nsystems againts established design patterns and how to extract insights through\ncomparative analysis, the study uses design patterns from software engineering\nto understand and optimize healthcare AI systems. Boxology helps identify\ncommonalities and create reusable solutions, enhancing these systems'\nscalability, reliability, and performance. Five primary architectures are\nexamined: REML, MLRB, RBML, RMLT, and PERML. Each has unique strengths and\nweaknesses, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in clinical tasks.\nREML excels in high-accuracy prediction for datasets with limited data; MLRB in\nhandling large datasets and complex data integration; RBML in explainability\nand trustworthiness; RMLT in managing high-dimensional data; and PERML, though\nlimited in analysis, shows promise in urgent care scenarios. The study\nintroduces four new patterns, creates five abstract categorization patterns,\nand refines those five further to specific systems. These contributions enhance\nBoxlogy's taxonomical organization and offer novel approaches to integrating\nexpert knowledge with machine learning. Boxology's structured, modular apporach\noffers significant advantages in developing and analyzing hybrid AI systems,\nrevealing commonalities, and promoting reusable solutions. In conclusion, this\nstudy underscores hybrid AI systems' crucial role in advancing healthcare and\nBoxology's potential to drive further innovation in AI integration, ultimately\nimproving clinical decision support and patient outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qSEJutmFFieqEp-hhaXEPIZebSHyESuojLnSGpYIFjw","pdfSize":"1745153"}
