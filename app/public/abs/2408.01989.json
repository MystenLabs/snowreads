This often poses\na challenge for job seekers in efficiently identifying relevant job\nadvertisements that align with their unique skill sets amidst a vast sea of\nlistings. Thus, we propose well-coordinated visualizations to provide job\nseekers with three levels of details of job information: a skill-job overview\nvisualizes skill sets, employment posts as well as relationships between them\nwith a hierarchical visualization design; a post exploration view leverages an\naugmented radar-chart glyph to represent job posts and further facilitates\nusers' swift comprehension of the pertinent skills necessitated by respective\npositions; a post detail view lists the specifics of selected job posts for\nprofound analysis and comparison. By using a real-world recruitment\nadvertisement dataset collected from 51Job, one of the largest job websites in\nChina, we conducted two case studies and user interviews to evaluate JobViz.\nThe results demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
