Extending the\nframework established by arXiv:2101.09936, we analyze a power-utility\nmaximization problem where an investor encounters proportional transaction\ncosts and trades only when a Poisson process triggers trading opportunities. We\nshow that the optimal trading strategy is described by a no-trade region. We\nintroduce a novel asymptotic framework applicable when both transaction costs\nand search frictions are small. Using this framework, we derive explicit\nasymptotics for the no-trade region and the value function along a specific\nparametric curve. This approach unifies existing asymptotic results for models\ndealing exclusively with either transaction costs or search frictions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
