Each population, when isolated, would become\nextinct. Dispersal-induced growth (DIG) occurs when the populations are able to\npersist and grow exponentially when dispersal among the populations is present.\nWe provide a mathematical analysis of this phenomenon, in the context of a\ndeterministic model with periodic variation of growth rates and migration. The\nmigration matrix can be reducible, so that the results apply in the case,\nimportant for applications, where there is migration in one direction in one\nseason and in the other direction in another season. We also consider\ndispersal-induced decay (DID), where each population, when isolated, grows\nexponentially, while populations die out when dispersal between populations is\npresent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
