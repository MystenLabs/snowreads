We perform an analytic one-loop calculation of the\namplitudes for a pair of Higgs bosons in association with three partons,\nretaining the exact dependence on the quark mass circulating in the loop. These\namplitudes constitute the real radiation corrections in the calculation of\nHiggs boson pair production at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling.\nThe results of an analytic generalised-unitarity computation are simplified via\nanalytic reconstruction in spinor variables. Compact ans\\\"atze for kinematic\npole residues are iteratively fitted via $p$-adic evaluations near said poles\nand subtracted until no pole remains. A new ansatz construction is introduced\nto minimally parametrise coefficients of amplitudes with multiple massive\nexternal legs. The simplified expressions are faster to evaluate than automatic\ncodes and can lead to more stable results near singular regions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UKoo0vXR7CrU1DP5tLq3zhfZ1xgRiAwXYH17ARAyH_k","pdfSize":"933637"}
