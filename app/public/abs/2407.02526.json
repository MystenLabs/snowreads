However, its importance within classical mechanics and the general\ntheory of dynamical systems is unquestionable. In this work we show that this\nsubject can be included in the schedule of an introductory classical mechanics\ncourse without the need to develop a robust theory of chaotic dynamics. To do\nthis, we take as examples conservative non-linear oscillators subject to\ntime-dependent periodic forces. By introducing the concept of stroboscopic maps\nwe show that it is possible to visualize the appearance of chaos in these\nsystems. We also address the example of the forced simple pendulum applying the\nsame treatment. Finally, we briefly comment on the more general theory of chaos\nin conservative Hamiltonian systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
