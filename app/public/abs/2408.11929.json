Typical applications present challenging sparse linear systems which\nare complex non-Hermitian and, due to the pollution effect, either very large\nor else still large but under-resolved in terms of the physics. These factors\nmake finding general purpose, efficient and scalable solvers difficult and no\none approach has become the clear method of choice. In this work we take\ninspiration from domain decomposition strategies known as sweeping methods,\nwhich have gained notable interest for their ability to yield nearly-linear\nasymptotic complexity and which can also be favourable for high-frequency\nproblems. While successful approaches exist, such as those based on\nhigher-order interface conditions, perfectly matched layers (PMLs), or complex\ntracking of wave fronts, they can often be quite involved or tedious to\nimplement. We investigate here the use of simple sweeping techniques applied in\ndifferent directions which can then be incorporated in parallel into a\nmultipreconditioned GMRES strategy. Preliminary numerical results on a\ntwo-dimensional benchmark problem will demonstrate the potential of this\napproach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GqmAOeHBhOxmg_tccxB2_rT_o5gI5maz9cxMJwYFLIg","pdfSize":"113191"}
