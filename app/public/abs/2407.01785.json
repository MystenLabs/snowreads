Comput. 2023 to reduce the\ncomputational cost of Runge-Kutta-TASE (RKTASE) methods when the involved\nlinear systems are solved by some $LU$ factorization. In this paper we propose\na modification of these methods to improve the efficiency by considering\ndifferent TASE operators for each stage of the Runge-Kutta. We prove that the\nresulting RKTASE methods are equivalent to $W$-methods (Steihaug and\nWolfbrandt, Mathematics of Computation,1979) and this allows us to obtain the\norder conditions of the proposed Modified Singly-RKTASE methods (MSRKTASE)\nthrough the theory developed for the $W$-methods. We construct new MSRKTASE\nmethods of order two and three and demonstrate their effectiveness through\nnumerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear stiff systems. The results\nshow that the MSRKTASE schemes significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy\ncompared to previous Singly-RKTASE schemes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
