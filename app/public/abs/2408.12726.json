Driven by the need to make a broader range of data visualization\ntypes accessible for novice users, we present a guided LLM-based pipeline\ndesigned to transform data, guided by high-level user questions (referred to as\nmacro-queries), into a diverse set of useful visualizations. This approach\nleverages various prompting techniques, fine-tuning inspired by Abela's Chart\nTaxonomy, and integrated SQL tool usage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1CLF_EHJ0WFsw9VQGK1vGsx5re9V95Kz_OXZl9XnN-Q","pdfSize":"3800048"}
