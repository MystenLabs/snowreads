For regular enough boundary\nvalues we get a rate of order $\\sqrt{1-s}$, while for less regular data the\nrate is of order $\\sqrt{(1-s)|\\log(1-s)|}$. We also obtain results when the\nright hand side depends on $s$, and our error estimates are true for all\n$s\\in(0,1)$. The proofs use variational arguments to deduce rates in the\nfractional Sobolev norm from energy estimates between the fractional and the\nstandard Dirichlet energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
