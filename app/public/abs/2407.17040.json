Numerous models have been proposed, striving to\nestimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural\nNetwork (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating\ndata distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model\nbased on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps\nto create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to\nfacilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing\nvalues. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN\n(MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning\napproach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information.\nTherefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation\nRecurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the\ncontinuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using\ntwo real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns,\nand conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
