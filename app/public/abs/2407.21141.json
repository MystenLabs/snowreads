However, traditional centralized approaches for\nmachine learning in VANETs raise concerns about data privacy and security.\nFederated Learning (FL) offers a solution that enables collaborative model\ntraining without sharing raw data. This paper proposes FL-DECO-BC as a novel\nprivacy-preserving, provably secure, and provenance-preserving federated\nlearning framework specifically designed for VANETs. FL-DECO-BC leverages\ndecentralized oracles on blockchain to securely access external data sources\nwhile ensuring data privacy through advanced techniques. The framework\nguarantees provable security through cryptographic primitives and formal\nverification methods. Furthermore, FL-DECO-BC incorporates a\nprovenance-preserving design to track data origin and history, fostering trust\nand accountability. This combination of features empowers VANETs with secure\nand privacy-conscious machine-learning capabilities, paving the way for\nadvanced traffic management and safety applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
