The strong $^2 \\rm{D}_{3/2}\n\\rightarrow {}^1[1/2]_{1/2}$ transition at 412 nm represents an attractive\nalternative for the standard 935 nm repumper used in cooling and trapping\nexperiments, while the transition to the $^3[3/2]_{3/2}$ state at 411 nm clears\nout the $^2 $F$_{7/2}$ state, for which typically 638 nm or 760 nm are used.\nThese two alternative transitions simplify the experimental setup by removing\nthe need for infrared optics to cool and manipulate Yb$^+$ and may be of\nparticular interest when considering integrated photonics solutions. We also\npresent data for the transitions $^2 $D$_{3/2} \\rightarrow {}^3[1/2]_{3/2}$ at\n399 nm, and $^2 $D$_{3/2} \\rightarrow {}^1[5/2]_{5/2}$ at 410 nm including\ndecay branching ratios of the excited states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
