The fluid's behavior is described by the Navier-Stokes\nequations, while the motion of the rigid body is governed by ordinary\ndifferential equations representing the conservation of linear and angular\nmomentum. We prescribe a time-independent fluid velocity along the boundary of\n$\\Omega$ and a time-independent fluid density at the inflow boundary of\n$\\Omega$. Additionally, we assume a no-slip boundary condition at the interface\nbetween the fluid and the rigid body. We prove existence of a weak solution to\nthe given problem within a time interval where the rigid body does not touch\nthe boundary $\\partial\\Omega$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
