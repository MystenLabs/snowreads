The three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate how\nsuch transition radiation generates when electrons escape into vacuum either\nfrom the low-density target itself, or after passing through a thin foil\nlocated at the target end. Advantage of the RST regime for generation of THz\npulses is clearly demonstrated as compared to laser irradiation of such a\nstandard target as a foil with preplasma on its front side. Simulation\nperformed has shown that for the optimized laser-target matching a 2-J\nfemtosecond laser pulse is able to produce quasi-unipolar Thz pulses with\nenergy exceeding 100 mJ.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
