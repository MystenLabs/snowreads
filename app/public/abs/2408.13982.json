In a local presentation of the metric\nconformal to a product, we reduce the soliton equation to a degenerate\nMonge-Amp\\`{e}re equation for the conformal factor coupled with ODEs. We obtain\nexplicit complete expanding solitons as well as abstract existence results for\nshrinking and steady solitons with boundary. These families of Ricci solitons\nspecialize to classical examples of Einstein and soliton metrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
