We self-consistently simulate complete outburst cycles of normal and\nsuperoutbursts in cataclysmic variable systems in two dimensions. We study the\neffect of different $\\alpha$ viscosity parameters, mass transfer rates, and\nbinary mass ratios on the disk luminosities, outburst occurrence rates, and\nsuperhumps. We simulate non-isothermal, viscous accretion disks in cataclysmic\nvariable systems using a modified version of the FARGO code with an updated\nequation of state and a cooling function designed to reproduce s-curve\nbehavior. Our simulations can model complete outburst cycles using the thermal\ntidal instability model. We find higher superhump amplitudes and stronger\ngravitational torques than previous studies, resulting in better agreement with\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
