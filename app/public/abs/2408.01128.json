We further study the constraints\nfrom the corresponding $\\Upsilon$ production process and finish by discussing\nthe possible effects at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) through\nincorporation of a $K$ factor for the exclusive heavy vector-meson coefficient\nfunction at NLO.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
