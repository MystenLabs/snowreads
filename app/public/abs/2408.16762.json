These issues are particularly acute when\nautomatic UV-unwrapping techniques are used. For this reason, instead of\ngenerating textures in automatically generated UV-planes like most\nstate-of-the-art methods, we propose to represent textures as coloured\npoint-clouds whose colours are generated by a denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel constrained to operate on the surface of 3D objects. Our sampling and\nresolution agnostic generative model heavily relies on heat diffusion over the\nsurface of the meshes for spatial communication between points. To enable\nprocessing of arbitrarily sampled point-cloud textures and ensure long-distance\ntexture consistency we introduce a fast re-sampling of the mesh spectral\nproperties used during the heat diffusion and introduce a novel\nheat-diffusion-based self-attention mechanism.
