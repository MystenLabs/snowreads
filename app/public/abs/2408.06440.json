It has been suggested that in the presence of\ngravity, any local effective field theory description must break down at the\n\"species scale\". We first observe that unitarity and analyticity of the\namplitude indeed imply a species-type bound $G\\Lambda^{d-2}N\\leq O(1)$, where\n$N$ counts parametrically light species and $\\Lambda$ is an energy scale above\nwhich new unknown ingredients must modify the graviton amplitude. To clarify\nwhat happens at this scale, we contrast the partial wave decomposition of\ncalculated amplitudes with that of some ultraviolet scenarios: string theory\nand strongly interacting Planck-scale physics. Observing that the latter\nexhibit a markedly stronger high-spin content, we define nonperturbatively the\nhigh-spin onset scale $\\Lambda_{\\rm o}$, which coincides with the string scale\nand higher-dimensional Planck scale in respective examples. We argue that,\ngenerally, no local field description can exist at distances shorter than\n$1/\\Lambda_{\\rm o}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
