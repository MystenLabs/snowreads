In this paper, we extend the\ncomputation the cohomology to excess four graph complexes. Along the way, we\ngive more details on generators, the computation process, and the definition of\nthe graph complex.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
