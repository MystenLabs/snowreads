Multiple studies so far\nfound that about 40-60% of such attempts fail. Our experience from the last\nyears suggests that the proportion of failed builds rises continually even\nfurther. Objective: First, we would like to empirically confirm our hypothesis\nthat with increasing Java versions, the percentage of build-failing projects\ntends to grow. Next, nine supplementary research questions are proposed,\nrelated mainly to the proportions of failing projects, universal version\ncompatibility, failures under specific JDK versions, success rates of build\ntools, wrappers, and failure reasons. Method: We will sample 2,500 random\npure-Java projects having a build configuration file and fulfilling basic\nquality criteria from GitHub. We will try to automatically build every project\nin containers with Java versions 6 to 23 installed. Success or failure will be\ndetermined by exit codes, and standard output and error streams will be saved.\nA majority of the analysis will be performed automatically using reproducible\nscripts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
