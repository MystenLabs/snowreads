Additionally, we establish a recursive relationship for binary cyclic codes\nthat connects their weight distribution to the number of solutions of\nassociated systems of polynomial equations. This relationship allows for the\ncomputation of weight distributions from known solutions of systems of diagonal\nequations and vice versa, offering a new insight into the structure and\nproperties of binary cyclic codes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
