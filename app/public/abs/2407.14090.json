We first explore how first-order DPTs in large\ndeviations can be found even for a single Brownian particle without any force\nupon raising the dimension to higher than four. The DPTs accompany temporal\nphase separations in their dynamical paths, which we numerically confirm by\nfitting to scaling functions. We next investigate how second-order DPTs can\nappear in one-dimensional free Brownian motion by choosing the observable,\nwhich essentially captures the localization transition of the trajectories. We\ndiscuss and confirm that the DPTs predicted for high dimensions can also be\nfound when considering many Brownian particles at lower dimensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZirZ01ksHm3Am1UD_-GzjSzx6uifgRHvMmdzR3fllV8","pdfSize":"1632507"}
