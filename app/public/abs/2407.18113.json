More\nprecisely, we adapt a technique introduced by Lueker in the context of the\naverage longest common subsequence of two random strings to improve the known\nupper bound on the average edit distance. We improve all the known upper bounds\nfor small alphabets. We also provide a new implementation of Lueker technique\nto improve the lower bound on the average length of the longest common\nsubsequence of two random strings for all small alphabets of size other than\n$2$ and $4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
