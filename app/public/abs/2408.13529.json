However, their potential\nhas not been fully exploited, particularly in designing and manufacturing\nsmall-sized FJMs with high stiffness variation. Although existing research has\nfocused on factors like fiber materials and geometry to maximize stiffness\nvariation, the results often do not apply to FJMs for MIS due to size\nconstraints. Meanwhile, other factors such as fiber number and packing density,\nless significant to large FJMs but critical to small-sized FJMs, have received\ninsufficient investigation regarding their impact on the stiffness variation\nfor FTL deployment. In this paper, we design and fabricate FJMs with a diameter\nof 4mm. Through theoretical and experimental analysis, we find that fiber\nnumber and packing density significantly affect both absolute stiffness and\nstiffness variation. Our experiments confirm the feasibility of using FJMs in a\nmedical FTL robot design. The optimal configuration is a 4mm FJM with 0.4mm\nfibers at a 56% packing density, achieving up to 3400% stiffness variation.
