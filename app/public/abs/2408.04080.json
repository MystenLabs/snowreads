The resulting linear\nsystems are dense and block-lower triangular and hence can be solved by block\nforward elimination. For the fast evaluation of the history part, the matrix is\nsubdivided into a family of sub-matrices according to the temporal separation.\nSeparated blocks are approximated by Chebyshev interpolation of the heat kernel\nin time. For the spatial variable, we propose an adaptive cross approximation\n(ACA) framework to obtain a data-sparse approximation of the entire matrix. We\nanalyse how the ACA tolerance must be adjusted to the temporal separation and\npresent numerical results for a benchmark problem to confirm the theoretical\nestimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
