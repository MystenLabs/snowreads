Starting\nwith the rational Sullivan minimal model of the 4-sphere $S^4$, capturing the\ndynamics of M-theory via Hypothesis H, this progresses to the dimensional\nreduction of M-theory on torus $T^k$, $k \\ge 1$, with its dynamics described\nvia the iterated cyclic loop space $\\mathcal{L}_c^k S^4$ of the 4-sphere. From\nthis, we also extracted data corresponding to the maximal torus/Cartan\nsubalgebra and the Weyl group of the exceptional Lie group/algebra of type\n$E_k$.\n  In this paper, we discover much richer symmetry by extending the data of the\nCartan subalgebra to a maximal parabolic subalgebra $\\mathfrak{p}_k^{k(k)}$ of\nthe split real form $\\mathfrak{e}_{k(k)}$ of the exceptional Lie algebra of\ntype $E_k$ by exhibiting an action, in rational homotopy category, of\n$\\mathfrak{p}_k^{k(k)}$ on the slightly more symmetric than $\\mathcal{L}_c^k\nS^4$ toroidification $\\mathcal{T}^k S^4$. This action universally represents\nsymmetries of the equations of motion of supergravity in the reduction of\nM-theory to $11-k$ dimensions.\n  Along the way, we identify the minimal model of the toroidification\n$\\mathcal{T}^k S^4$, generalizing the results of Vigu\\'{e}-Poirrier, Sullivan,\nand Burghelea, and establish an algebraic toroidification/totalization\nadjunction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4BhKofo2WM78wT5j4nZl-ZoF9S5xDe2aWQqbxR9VSpo","pdfSize":"438649"}
