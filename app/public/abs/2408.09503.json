These tasks\nrequire the models to generalize on distributions different from those from\ntraining data -- which is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.\nDespite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach OOD generalization\nremains an open and underexplored question. We examine OOD generalization in\nsettings where instances are generated according to hidden rules, including\nin-context learning with symbolic reasoning. Models are required to infer the\nhidden rules behind input prompts without any fine-tuning.\n  We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic\nexample and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs,\nfocusing on a type of components known as induction heads. We found that OOD\ngeneralization and composition are tied together -- models can learn rules by\ncomposing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization.\nFurthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts\nas a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we\nrefer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
