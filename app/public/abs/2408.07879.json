To address this\nissue, we propose an extended supporting hyperplane approximation approach for\nefficiently solving a class of distributionally robust portfolio problems for a\ngeneral class of additively separable utility functions and polyhedral\nambiguity distribution set, applied to a large-scale set of assets. Our\ntechnique is validated using a large-scale portfolio of the S&P 500 index\nconstituents, demonstrating robust out-of-sample trading performance. More\nimportantly, our empirical studies show that this approach significantly\nreduces computational time compared to traditional concave Expected Log-Growth\n(ELG) optimization, with running times decreasing from several thousand seconds\nto just a few. This method provides a scalable and practical solution to\nlarge-scale robust portfolio optimization, addressing both theoretical and\npractical challenges.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
