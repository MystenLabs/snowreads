We elaborate the analysis for the\nexistence and evolution of necklace patterns with integer, half-integer, and\nfractional reduced orbital angular momenta by means of PINN. The patterns\nexhibit phenomena similar to rotation of rigid bodies and centrifugal force.\nEven though the necklaces slowly expand (or shrink), they preserve their\nstructure in the course of the quasi-stable propagation over several\ndiffraction lengths, which is completely different from the ordinary fast\ndiffraction-dominated dynamics. By comparing different ingredients, including\nthe training time, loss value and $\\mathbb{L}_{2}$ error, PINN accurately\npredicts specific nonlinear dynamical properties of the evolving necklace\npatterns. Furthermore, we perform the data-driven discovery of parameters for\nboth clean and perturbed training data, adding $1\\%$ random noise in the latter\ncase. The results reveal that PINN not only effectively emulates the solution\nof partial differential equations, but also offers applications for predicting\nthe nonlinear dynamics of physically relevant types of patterns.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
