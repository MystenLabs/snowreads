Our work introduces a novel machine\nlearning-based solution that leverages the attention mechanism to predict\nfuture states of multi-agent systems by learning node representations. The\ngraph structure is then inferred from the strength of the attention values.\nThis approach is applied to both linear consensus dynamics and the non-linear\ndynamics of Kuramoto oscillators, resulting in implicit learning the graph by\nlearning good agent representations. Our results demonstrate that the presented\ndata-driven graph attention machine learning model can identify the network\ntopology in multi-agent systems, even when the underlying dynamic model is not\nknown, as evidenced by the F1 scores achieved in the link prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
