More importantly, our device based on a Hermitian\nparity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric system enables the generation and\nmanipulation of asymmetric quantum coherence of the output photons. For the\ninterference of two weak coherent-state inputs, our QBS can produce\nanti-bunched photons from one output port and bunched photons from the other,\nshowcasing high parity asymmetry and strong coherence control capabilities.\nBeyond the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, perfect photon blockade with vanishing\n$g^{(2)}(0)$ is achievable in two-photon interference. These striking effects\nof the QBS fundamentally arise from the parity-symmetry-breaking interaction\nand the quantum interference between the photon scattering channels. Our\nresults could inspire novel applications and the development of innovative\nphotonic devices for the manipulation of weak quantum light.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
