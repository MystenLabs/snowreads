A mathematical model that reproduces\nthe empirical observations is introduced, enabling us to go beyond the\nexperimental cases considered. The model confirms the existence of alternative\norderings as the number of objects increases. Furthermore, a simpler and more\nmathematically transparent version of our model enables us to establish the\nconditions under which the cluster structure is stable and when it will\ncollapse. We argue that our simple experimental setup combined with the\naccompanying models may be useful to describe general features seen in systems\ncomposed of mutually repulsive particles in the presence of modulating\nconfining fields.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Tki_s0Ub99gb9sayhuUKxTVexcnhqWSZ8oDcIzzSErY","pdfSize":"3508423"}
