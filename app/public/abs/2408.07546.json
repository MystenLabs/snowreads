Each element of the matroid's ground set is assigned a\nweight that depends linearly on a real parameter from a given interval. The\ngoal is to compute, for each possible parameter value, a set of $\\ell$-most\nvital elements with corresponding objective value the deletion of which causes\na maximum increase of the weight of a minimal basis. We show that such a set,\nwhich of course depends on the parameter, can only change polynomially often if\nthe parameter varies. We develop several exact algorithms to solve the problem\nthat have polynomial running times if an independence test can be performed in\npolynomial time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
