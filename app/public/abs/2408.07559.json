A Laplacian-based model is proposed to\ngovern the evolution of opinions. The objective of the paper is to analyze the\nproposed opinion model on the opinion evolution of the agents. Further, we also\ndetermine the conditions required to apply the proposed Laplacian-based opinion\nmodel. Finally, some numerical results are shown to validate these results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
