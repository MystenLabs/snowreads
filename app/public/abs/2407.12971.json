The speed\nis given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the\nspacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich. Following a\nclassical approach by Huisken-Yau, we show that the flow starting from suitably\nround initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant\n(spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the\nST-CMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition\nof center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
