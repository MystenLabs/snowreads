Different constructions are proposed, by patching\nneighborhoods of curves in projective surfaces, and blowing down exceptional\ncurves. These constructions generalize examples recently given by S. Lvovski.\nOne of our non algebraic argument is based on an extension theorem of S.\nIvashkovich.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
