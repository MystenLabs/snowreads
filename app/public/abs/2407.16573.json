[J. Differential Equations\n260, 3860 (2016)] and thus enables extrapolations of the heat transfer to geo-\nand astrophysical flows. The model distinguishes between four subregimes of the\nultimate regime and well describes the measured heat transfer in various\nlarge-Ra experiments. In this new representation, which properly accounts for\nthe Prandtl number dependence, the onset to the ultimate regime is seen in all\navailable large-Ra data sets, though at different Rayleigh numbers, as to be\nexpected for a non-normal-nonlinear instability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
