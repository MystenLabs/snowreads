Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
