This article proposes a neural matrix factorization\nrecommendation system model based on the multimodal large language model called\nBoNMF. This model combines BoBERTa's powerful capabilities in natural language\nprocessing, ViT in computer in vision, and neural matrix decomposition\ntechnology. By capturing the potential characteristics of users and items, and\nafter interacting with a low-dimensional matrix composed of user and item IDs,\nthe neural network outputs the results. recommend. Cold start and ablation\nexperimental results show that the BoNMF model exhibits excellent performance\non large public data sets and significantly improves the accuracy of\nrecommendations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
