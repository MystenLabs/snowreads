We observe real-time\nquantum jumps of the nuclear spin state, a proof of their individual nature. By\ndriving the forbidden transitions of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system,\nwe also achieve single-spin solid-effect dynamical nuclear polarization.\nRelying exclusively on microwave driving and microwave photon counting, the\nmethods reported here are in principle applicable to a large number of\nelectron-nuclear spin systems, in a wide variety of samples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xm3MU_hTw6sMCZflRVOfhmbE_DtGnEPw_Anef29ku5o","pdfSize":"12739761"}
