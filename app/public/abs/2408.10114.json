Building upon the work of (Helton et al., New York J. Math. 2017),\nwe propose results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based\non the noncommutative Nullstellens\\\"atze (Watts, Helton and Klep, Annales Henri\nPoincar\\'e 2023), we build computational tools that check the non-existence of\nperfect $C^*$ and algebraic strategies of synchronous games using Gr\\\"obner\nbasis methods and semidefinite programming. We prove the equivalence between\nthe hereditary and $C^*$ models questioned in (Helton et al., New York J. Math.\n2017). We also extend the quantum-version NP-hardness reduction\n$\\texttt{3-Coloring}^* \\leq_p \\texttt{3-SAT}^*$ due to (Ji, arXiv 2013) by\nexhibiting another instance of such reduction $\\texttt{Clique}^* \\leq_p\n\\texttt{3-SAT}^*$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
