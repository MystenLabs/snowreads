Our results show that ultra-flat\narmchair and zigzag edges can be achieved in graphene by aligning the loading\ndirection with specific lattice orientations. Deviations from these\norientations create kinks between the atomically smooth armchair and zigzag\nsegments, with increased irregularities when dynamic effects are considered.\nFracture mechanics analysis highlights the kinetic and dynamic factors\ncontributing to crack deflection and edge roughening. In three-atom-thick 2D\nsilica crystals, the relationship between edge morphologies and cleavage\nconditions is modified by their bilayer structure and sublattice asymmetry. In\n2D silica glasses, this correlation is further disrupted by topological\ndisorder. These insights are crucial for minimizing edge roughness in 2D\nmaterials, which is essential for their performance in mechanical and\nelectronic applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bkOsYzZ42b2n4nBTgVveetWL5UoKnRZ1GHbXjYCXSY4","pdfSize":"9338427","objectId":"0x53702a2065815401a742ecf22a47b3000733217bcf71829230829099ac1ba05d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
