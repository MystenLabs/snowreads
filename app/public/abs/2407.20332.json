It therewith mediates the\ndevelopment of complex multi-scale and multi-physics simulation environments\nwith a wide variety of independent components. The coupling between various\nphysical models and scales is dynamic, and realized through (Strang) operators\nsplitting using adaptive time steps. We demonstrate the functionality and\nperformance of this algorithm using astrophysical models of a stellar cluster,\nfirst coupling gravitational dynamics and stellar evolution, then coupling\ninternal gravitational dynamics with dynamics within a galactic background\npotential, and finally combining these models while also introducing dwarf\ngalaxy-like perturbers. These tests show numerical convergence for decreasing\ncoupling timescales, demonstrate how {\\sc Venice} can improve the performance\nof a simulation by shortening coupling timescales when appropriate, and provide\na case study of how {\\sc Venice} can be used to gradually build up and tune a\ncomplex multi-physics model. Although the examples couple complete numerical\nmodels, {\\sc Venice} can also be used to efficiently solve systems of stiff\ndifferential equations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
