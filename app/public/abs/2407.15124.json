This can be enhanced by creating a patent\nknowledge base (ChemPatKB) to aid in prior art searches and to provide a\nplatform for domain experts to explore new innovations in chemical compound\nsynthesis and use-cases. An essential foundational component of this KB is the\nextraction of important reaction snippets from long patents documents which\nfacilitates multiple downstream tasks such as reaction co-reference resolution\nand chemical entity role identification. In this work, we explore the problem\nof extracting reactions spans from chemical patents in order to create a\nreactions resource database. We formulate this task as a paragraph-level\nsequence tagging problem, where the system is required to return a sequence of\nparagraphs that contain a description of a reaction. We propose several\napproaches and modifications of the baseline models and study how different\nmethods generalize across different domains of chemical patents.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
