However, current inspection approaches continue to encounter\ndifficulties in generalization and intelligence, which restricts their further\napplicability. In this paper, we introduce Power-LLaVA, the first large\nlanguage and vision assistant designed to offer professional and reliable\ninspection services for power transmission line by engaging in dialogues with\nhumans. Moreover, we also construct a large-scale and high-quality dataset\nspecialized for the inspection task. By employing a two-stage training strategy\non the constructed dataset, Power-LLaVA demonstrates exceptional performance at\na comparatively low training cost. Extensive experiments further prove the\ngreat capabilities of Power-LLaVA within the realm of power transmission line\ninspection. Code shall be released.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
