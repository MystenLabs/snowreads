One way to understand\nthe behavior of the swarm is through collective behavior reconstruction using\nprior demonstrations. Existing approaches often require access to the swarm\ncontroller which may not be available. We reconstruct collective behaviors in\ndistinct swarm scenarios involving shared environments without using swarm\ncontroller information. We achieve this by transforming prior demonstrations\ninto features that describe multi-agent interactions before behavior\nreconstruction with multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning\n(MA-GAIL). We show that our approach outperforms existing algorithms in spatial\norganization, and can be used to observe and reconstruct a swarm's behavior for\nfurther analysis and testing, which might be impractical or undesirable on the\noriginal robot swarm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
