After reviewing the metric affine geometry and\nthe present geometric formulation of dislocation and disclination written in\nterms of torsion and full curvature (together with vanishing non-metricity), we\ngive a new theory of them in a novel way in terms of torsion and non-metricity\n(together with vanishing full curvature), the so-called general teleparallel\ngeometry. All calculations are performed by using the exterior algebra. We\nobtain continuity equations explicitly for dislocation density and disclination\ndensity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
