In case $n$ is odd, the\nrenormalized volume is an absolute conformal invariant, while if $n$ is even,\nthere is a conformally invariant energy term given by the integral of a local\nRiemannian invariant. In particular, the volume gives a global conformal\ninvariant of a knot embedding in the three-sphere. We extend the construction\nof energies for even $n$ to general codimension by considering formal solutions\nto the singular Yamabe problem; except that, for each fixed $n$, there are\nfinitely many $k > n + 2$, which we identify, for which the smoothness of the\nformal solution is obstructed and we obtain instead a pointwise conformal\ninvariant. We compute the new quantities in several cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
