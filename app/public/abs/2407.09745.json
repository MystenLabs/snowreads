Generally, the driving\nmechanisms of the physical, chemical or biological processes of the matters or\nthe living organisms on Earth at about $1 \\, meV$ energy scale are assumed to\nstem from the fundamental microscopic Coulomb interaction and its various\nreduced ones as well as the relativistic corrections. Examples are such as the\nelectron-phonon interaction, the Heisenberg exchange spin interaction, the\nsuperexchange interaction, the van der Waals interaction, the spin-orbit\ninteraction, the Breit interaction, {\\it etc}. In this article, by using a path\nintegral approach on a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, we show\nthat there is another fundamental microscopic interaction at this energy scale,\nthe microscopic Amp\\`ere current-current interaction. It has time-dependent\ndynamical feature and can be the driving interaction of the physical or\nchemical properties of the matters or the biological activity of the living\norganisms on Earth at about $1\\, meV$ energy scale. A new Amp\\`ere-type\nexchange spin interaction is also found with a magnitude about $10^{-4}$ of the\nwell-known Coulomb interaction relevant Heisenberg exchange spin interaction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LBXp9jcMxpwYH7CLQOUiwcAKUwLvI_Mtj-EdHQg_cUg","pdfSize":"217815"}
