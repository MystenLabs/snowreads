What bounds or\nconstraints limit behavioral performance? Previously, we found that the\ngradient-climbing speed of a chemotaxing Escherichia coli is near a bound set\nby the limited information they acquire from their chemical environments. Here\nwe ask what limits their sensory accuracy. Past theoretical analyses have shown\nthat the stochasticity of single molecule arrivals sets a fundamental limit on\nthe precision of chemical sensing. Although it has been argued that bacteria\napproach this limit, direct evidence is lacking. Here, using information theory\nand quantitative experiments, we find that E. coli's chemosensing is not\nlimited by the physics of particle counting. First, we derive the physical\nlimit on the behaviorally-relevant information that any sensor can get about a\nchanging chemical concentration, assuming that every molecule arriving at the\nsensor is recorded. Then, we derive and measure how much information E. coli's\nsignaling pathway encodes during chemotaxis. We find that E. coli encode two\norders of magnitude less information than an ideal sensor limited only by shot\nnoise in particle arrivals. These results strongly suggest that constraints\nother than particle arrival noise limit E. coli's sensory fidelity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
