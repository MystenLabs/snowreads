(2017). BOP2-TE utilizes a\nDirichlet-multinomial model to jointly model the distribution of toxicity and\nefficacy endpoints, making go/no-go decisions based on the posterior\nprobability of toxicity and futility. In comparison to the original BOP2 and\nother existing designs, BOP2-TE offers the advantage of providing rigorous type\nI error control in cases where the treatment is toxic and futile, effective but\ntoxic, or safe but futile, while optimizing power when the treatment is\neffective and safe. As a result, BOP2-TE enhances trial safety and efficacy. We\nalso explore the incorporation of BOP2-TE into multiple-dose randomized trials\nfor dose optimization, and consider a seamless design that integrates phase I\ndose finding with phase II randomized dose optimization. BOP2-TE is\nuser-friendly, as its decision boundary can be determined prior to the trial's\nonset. Simulations demonstrate that BOP2-TE possesses desirable operating\ncharacteristics. We have developed a user-friendly web application as part of\nthe BOP2 app, which is freely available at www.trialdesign.org.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
