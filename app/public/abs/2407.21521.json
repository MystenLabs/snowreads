AI avatars, being disclosed as being an AI, or\nembodying specific genders, could be used in user-AI interactions. Leveraging\ninsights from AI and avatar research, we explore how AI disclosure and gender\naffect user motivation. We conducted a game-based experiment involving over\n72,500 participants who solved search problems alone or with an AI companion.\nDifferent groups experienced varying AI appearances and disclosures. We\nmeasured play intensity. Results revealed that the presence of another avatar\nled to less intense play compared to solo play. Disclosure of the avatar as AI\nheightened effort intensity compared to non-disclosed AI companions.\nAdditionally, a masculine AI appearance reduced effort intensity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
