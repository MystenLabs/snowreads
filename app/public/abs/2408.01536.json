While neural PDE solvers can be more efficient than\nestablished numerical solvers, they often require large amounts of training\ndata that is costly to obtain. Active Learning (AL) could help surrogate models\nreach the same accuracy with smaller training sets by querying classical\nsolvers with more informative initial conditions and PDE parameters. While AL\nis more common in other domains, it has yet to be studied extensively for\nneural PDE solvers. To bridge this gap, we introduce AL4PDE, a modular and\nextensible active learning benchmark. It provides multiple parametric PDEs and\nstate-of-the-art surrogate models for the solver-in-the-loop setting, enabling\nthe evaluation of existing and the development of new AL methods for PDE\nsolving. We use the benchmark to evaluate batch active learning algorithms such\nas uncertainty- and feature-based methods. We show that AL reduces the average\nerror by up to 71% compared to random sampling and significantly reduces\nworst-case errors. Moreover, AL generates similar datasets across repeated\nruns, with consistent distributions over the PDE parameters and initial\nconditions. The acquired datasets are reusable, providing benefits for\nsurrogate models not involved in the data generation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
