The\neffects of new physics can be investigated in a largely theory-agnostic way by\nfollowing the principled-parameterized approach. In this approach, a classical\nblack-hole metric is upgraded by following a set of principles, such as\nregularity, i.e., the absence of curvature singularities. We expect these\nprinciples to hold in many theories beyond General Relativity. In the present\npaper, we implement this approach for time-dependent spacetimes describing\ngravitational collapse. We find that the Vaidya spacetime becomes regular\nthrough the same modification of the spacetime metric as stationary black-hole\nspacetimes [1-3]. We investigate null geodesics and find indications that the\nmodification is even sufficient to render null geodesics future complete.\nFinally, we find that the modification of the spacetime structure results in\nviolations of the null energy condition in a finite region inside the apparent\nhorizon of the black hole that forms. Null geodesics are attracted to the\nboundary of this region, such that the new-physics effects are shielded from\nasymptotic observers. An exception occurs, if the classical spacetime has a\nnaked singularity. Then, the upgraded spacetime is singularity-free and null\ngeodesics from the regular core can escape towards asymptotic observers.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
