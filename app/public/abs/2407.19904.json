However, it is still challenging for\nresearchers and practitioners to analyze their behaviour and systematically\nchoose one over a vast set of possible metaheuristics for the particular\nproblem at hand. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework based on\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDP) for analyzing local search metaheuristics. This\nframework not only helps in providing convergence results for individual\nalgorithms, but also provides an explicit characterization of the\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff and a theory-grounded guidance for\npractitioners for choosing an appropriate metaheuristic for the problem at\nhand. We present this framework in detail and show how to apply it in the case\nof hill climbing and the simulated annealing algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nw_bfauLsTqwzMuOZ4U4flW474WKd71wAhyj6WhrOmk","pdfSize":"191931"}
