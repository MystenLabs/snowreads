In this\npaper, corrected score methods are derived under classical additive measurement\nerror to draw inference about marginal exposure effects using only measured\nvariables. Three estimators are proposed based on g-formula, inverse\nprobability weighting, and doubly-robust estimation techniques. The estimators\nare shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, and the doubly-robust\nestimator is shown to exhibit its namesake property. The methods, which are\nimplemented in the R package mismex, perform well in finite samples under both\nconfounding and measurement error as demonstrated by simulation studies. The\nproposed doubly-robust estimator is applied to study the effects of two\nbiomarkers on HIV-1 infection using data from the HVTN 505 preventative vaccine\ntrial.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GtPPM33Y3tuuQTUfJ4AQMIBIVUwfhV9RsoJe7F3cbOY","pdfSize":"776136","objectId":"0x21caffff4f8ee3e4099945855caa652b996737cf4fca4ed2f498b3f8f987a750","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
