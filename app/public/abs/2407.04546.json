The motivation of this\nconstruction is twofold: first, it implies the existence of an entire bounded\nsolution of a semilinear equation without critical points which is not\none-dimensional. Second, this gives an example of a bounded stationary solution\nfor the 2D Euler equations without stagnation points which is not a shear flow,\ncompleting previous results of Hamel and Nadirashvili. The proof uses a\nminimization technique together with a truncation argument, and a limit\nprocedure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0e068zHFRzvSkmKhQ-gArjjKiEd9MYyMCUwTjB6YoH0","pdfSize":"241596"}
