It is believed string\ncondensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological\nholography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D\ntopological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of\nnon-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D\nsymmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how\ntopological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string\ncondensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable\nalgebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through\nthe topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D\n$G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless\nSPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and\nstudy their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical\nstructures of string condensations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
