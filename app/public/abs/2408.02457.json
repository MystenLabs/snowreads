The existence of weak solutions is shown by means of the\nmethod of the characteristics and a weak $L_1$-compactness argument. For the\nexistence result, we also show our gratitude to Banach fixed point theorem and\na refined version of the Arzel\\'{a}-Ascoli theorem. In addition, the continuous\ndependence of solutions upon the initial data is shown with the help of the\nDiPerna-Lions theory, Gronwall's inequality and moment estimates. Moreover, the\nuniqueness of solution follows from the continuous dependence. The results\npresented in this article extend the contributions made in earlier literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
