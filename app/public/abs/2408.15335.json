This\nsolves the $K_4$-case of a general conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu.\nOur proof technique also yields a new short proof of the respective\n$K_4^-$-case, which was first established by Fujiwara and Papasoglu.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
