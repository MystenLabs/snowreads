It is also shown that the\nsymmetric NIEP and real NIEP form semi-algebraic sets and can therefore be\nsolved just by a finite union and intersection of polynomial inequalities. An\noverview of ideas are given in how tools from real algebraic geometry may be\napplied to the NIEP and related sub-problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g6wSD7cIG-HEQOrKJZYfkdqawK_giDqkA2o06nxAK4c","pdfSize":"126583"}
