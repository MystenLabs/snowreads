This\nadditional ``self-infection'' is used to model situations where there is an\nunknown source of infection or an external disease reservoir, such as an animal\ncarrier population. In contrast to the classical logistic SIS epidemic model,\nthe version with self-infection has a non-degenerate stationary distribution,\nand we show that it exhibits the cutoff phenomenon, which is a sharp transition\nin time from one to zero of the total variation distance to stationarity. While\nthis result is interesting in its own right, an additional contribution of our\nwork is that the proof illustrates a recently formalised methodology of\nBarbour, Brightwell and Luczak, which can be used to show cutoff via a\ncombination of concentration of measure inequalities and coupling techniques.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
