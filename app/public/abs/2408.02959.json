The internal structure of networks\ncan be explored using unsupervised machine learning methods known as community\ndetection algorithms. The process of community detection is inherently subject\nto uncertainty as algorithms utilize heuristic approaches and randomised\nprocedures to explore vast solution spaces, resulting in non-deterministic\noutcomes and variability in detected communities across multiple runs.\nMoreover, many algorithms are not designed to identify outliers and may fail to\ntake into account that a network is an unordered mathematical entity. The main\naim of our work is to address these issues through a consensus-based approach\nby introducing a new framework called Consensus Community Detection (CCD). Our\nmethod can be applied to different community detection algorithms, allowing the\nquantification of uncertainty for the whole network as well as for each node,\nand providing three strategies for dealing with outliers: incorporate,\nhighlight, or group. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on\nartificial benchmark networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-W3UYrpGFUmob2nM_imI2fxib5M-DzXKTZGJ4tQwyq4","pdfSize":"773514"}
