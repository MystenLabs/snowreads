Our approach relies on the utilization of nonlinear\nShkarofsky's formula of FPR (FPRS) collision operator in terms of Legendre\npolynomial expansions. The key innovation lies in the introduction of a new\nfunction named King (Eq.(54)) with the adoption of the Legendre polynomial\nexpansion for the angular direction and King function expansion for the\nvelocity axis direction. The Legendre polynomial expansion will converge\nexponentially and the King method, a moment convergence algorithm, could ensure\nthe conservation with high precision in discrete form. Additionally, a\npost-step projection to manifolds is employed to exactly enforce symmetries of\nthe collision operators. Through solving several typical problems across\nvarious nonequilibrium configurations, we demonstrate the superior performance\nand high accuracy of our algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
