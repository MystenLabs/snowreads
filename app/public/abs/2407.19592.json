While the geodesic-acoustic-mode oscillations in quasiaxisymmetric\nconfigurations are similar to tokamaks, they become almost nonexistent in\nquasi-helically symmetric configurations when the effective safety factor is\nsmall. Compared with concentric circular tokamaks, the Rosenbluth--Hinton\nresidual is also found to be multiplied by a geometric factor $\\mathcal{C}$\nthat arises from the flux-surface averaged classical polarization. Using the\nnear-axis-expansion framework, we derive an analytic expression for\n$\\mathcal{C}$, which varies significantly among different configurations. These\nanalytic results are compared with numerical simulation results from the global\ngyrokinetic particle-in-cell code GTC, and good agreement in the\nRosenbluth--Hinton residual level is achieved only when the quasisymmetry error\nis small enough. Since zonal flows can be important for regulating turbulent\ntransport, these results suggest possible relation between the transport level\nand the stellarator geometric parameters via nonlinear interactions with zonal\nflows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
