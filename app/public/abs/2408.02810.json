It\nis closely tied to entanglement, a key resource for quantum technologies and an\norder parameter for quantum many-body phenomena. We investigate the effect of\ndephasing noise on a multi-qubit teleportation protocol that experimentally\nvalidated quantum information scrambling. We find that while scrambling\nenhances information distribution, it is highly noise-sensitive, leading to\ndecreased teleportation fidelity and an increase in the classical mixing of the\nquantum state. Using negativity as a mixed-state entanglement measure, we\nidentify two fundamentally different entanglement-scaling regimes: efficient\nentanglement generation under weak dephasing noise, and entanglement\nsuppression under strong dephasing noise. We show that in the latter, the\nteleportation consumes more entanglement than the scrambling is able to create.\nComparison with a SWAP-gate-based teleportation protocol confirms that the\nentanglement suppression is a consequence of the scrambling mechanism. Our\nfindings suggest that the information dynamics during thermalization is\ncritically affected by dephasing noise, and confirm that in present-day noisy\nquantum devices, local information exchange is preferable over long-range\ninformation scrambling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
