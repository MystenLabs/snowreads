Moving away from traditional methods that often\nseek to condition neurodivergent children to socialize in prescribed ways, this\nproject strives to cultivate a space where children can engage with one another\nnaturally and creatively through art and storytelling, free from the pressure\nto adhere to standard social norms. Beyond merely \"story-choosing,\" the\nresearch highlights the potential of GIMs to facilitate \"story-creating,\"\nfostering peer social connections in a creative and structured collaborative\nlearning experience.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"I3pHdfz4wWyLTHYDL4zrmoYLkAuyBjWmJ0h_pxON2CM","pdfSize":"222410"}
