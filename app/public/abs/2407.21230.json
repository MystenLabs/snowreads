Our generalized\nelasticity approach retains the appropriate number of phase- and corresponding\nconjugate density- degrees-of-freedom required for a proper description of the\nGoldstone modes. For the dodecagonal and decagonal quasicrystal structures we\nobtain collective longitudinal and transversal excitations with an isotropic\nspeed of sound. Meanwhile, for the octagonal structure, the coupling between\nphononic and phasonic degrees of freedom leads in turn to hybridization of the\nlatter with the condensate sound mode, producing collective excitations with a\nlongitudinal and transversal component, and an anisotropic speed of sound.\nFinally, we discuss the fate of each excitation mode at the low and high\ndensity phase transitions limiting the quantum quasicrystal phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
