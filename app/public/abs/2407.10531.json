Restricting to linear\ncouplings between tracer and bath allows for analytical treatment. We discuss\nthe resulting stochastic Langevin equation for the tracer and its relaxation\nfunction, for which this equation is averaged under an initial tracer position.\nFor equilibrium, the tracer-bath force on average vanishes, a well known\nconsequence of Boltzmann statistics. If tracer and bath are subject to\ndifferent temperatures, the conditioned tracer-bath force is finite, and can be\nas large in magnitude as the force between tracer and trapping potential. For a\nbath particle with intrinsic memory, e.g., an active particle, even the noise\nfelt by the bath particle takes a finite average under conditioning of the\ntracer. If the noise of the bath particle is non-Gaussian, the relaxation\nfunction of the tracer can be non-monotonic as a function of time. We display\nhow these phenomena are reflected in the Langevin equation of the tracer.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
