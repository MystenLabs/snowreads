Rev. D 95, 084031 (2017). We clarify this\ninconsistency, which arises from employing a coordinate transformation covering\na distinct region of spacetime -- specifically one considered inaccessible due\nto its location beyond a singularity, making it unreachable from infinity.\nAdditionally, we provide a concrete example where the distinct horizons and\nspacetime regions are readily discernible.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
