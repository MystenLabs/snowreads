The kendallknight\npackage, following Knight (1966) and posterior literature, reduces the\ncomputational complexity resulting in drastic reductions in computation time,\ntransforming operations that would take minutes or hours into milliseconds or\nminutes, while maintaining precision and correctly handling edge cases and\nerrors. The package is particularly advantageous in econometric and statistical\ncontexts where rapid and accurate calculation of Kendall's correlation\ncoefficient is desirable. Benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance gains\nover the base R implementation, especially for large datasets.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WoBDDNJuzLM-avFbjED5RcOPmNBeNTW_MuzXrDkkITY","pdfSize":"202874"}
