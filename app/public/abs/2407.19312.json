We show the equation admits many time quasi-periodic\nsolutions by establishing an abstract infinite dimensional KAM theorem with\nmultiple normal frequencies. The proof is based on the classical KAM scheme,\nand the key is a decaying structure of Hessian matrices of Hamiltonian\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
