Thanks to data from the Monte Carlo version of the model\n(MOCAT-MC), which propagates singularly every object, it is possible to\nestimate such parameters, assumed as additional stochastic variables. Thus,\nthis paper proposed a new set of parameters so that the new Source-Sink model\nprediction better fits the computationally expensive and accurate MOCAT-MC\nsimulation. Estimation is performed by extracting stochastic quantities from\nthe space population, which has been analyzed to fit common probability density\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
