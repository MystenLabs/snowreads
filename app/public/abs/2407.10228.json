EFLD features a lightweight backbone and\na flexible detection head, each significantly enhancing operational efficiency\non resource-constrained devices. To improve the model's robustness, we propose\na cross-format training strategy. This strategy leverages a wide variety of\npublicly accessible datasets to enhance the model's generalizability and\nrobustness, without increasing inference costs. Our ablation study highlights\nthe significant impact of each component on reducing computational demands,\nmodel size, and improving accuracy. EFLD demonstrates superior performance\ncompared to competitors in the IEEE ICME 2024 Grand Challenges PAIR\nCompetition, a contest focused on low-power, efficient, and accurate\nfacial-landmark detection for embedded systems, showcasing its effectiveness in\nreal-world facial landmark detection tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cne2fldjV-ogwEb9CwBf6AS1nUbzAyC-F7-mhZlXh9Q","pdfSize":"414832","objectId":"0x95834eebd2bdcb85861ba08b4638b567fa1740f09b76bde4518885898ef51230","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
