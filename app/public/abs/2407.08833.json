We use both analytical calculations and numerical\nsimulations, and leveraging on the insights from the maximum entropy principle,\nwe explore how the geometry of the boundary influences the thermal\nequilibration process in such systems. Our simulations involve hard disks\nconfined within varying boundary shapes, using both event-driven and\ntime-driven simulations, ranging from conventional square boundaries to\ncircular boundaries, showing that the two converge to different ensembles. The\nformer converges to the Gibbs Ensemble, while the latter converges to the\nGeneralized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), with angular momentum as the extra conserved\nquantity. We introduce an order parameter to characterize the deviations from\nthe Gibbs ensemble, and show that the GGE is not time-reversal invariant, it\nviolates ergodicity and leads to a near-boundary condensation phenomenon.\nBecause of this, we argue that Monte Carlo methods should include angular\nmomentum in this situation. We conclude by discussing how these results lead to\npeculiar violations of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
