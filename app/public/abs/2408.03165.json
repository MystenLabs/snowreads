This finite beaming effect has been assumed to be negligible because\nof the particles' ultra-relativistic Lorentz factor $\\gamma_{i}\\gg1$ in\nlaser-driven QED cascades. We develop an energy- and angularly resolved\nparticle-tracking code, resolving both the energy spectra and the momentum\nprofile of the outgoing particles in each QED event, which improves\nsubstantially the agreement between the simulation and exact QED results. We\ninvestigate QED cascades driven by two counter-propagating circularly polarized\nlaser pulses, and show that the narrow beaming could be accumulated to\neffectively suppress the long-term growth of cascades, even though it can\nhardly affect the early formation of cascades. For QED cascades longer than\n$10$ laser cycles, the finite beaming effect could decrease the final pair\nyield, especially at ultrahigh intensities $\\xi>600$, by more than $10\\%$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
