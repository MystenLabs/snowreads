Two unique channel characteristics of\nXL-IRS are considered, namely, the near-field spherical wavefronts and\ndouble-sided visibility regions (VRs) at the BS and users, which render the\nchannel estimation for XL-IRS highly challenging. To address this issue, we\npropose in this paper an efficient three-step XL-IRS channel estimation method.\nSpecifically, in the first step, an anchor node is delicately deployed near the\nXL-IRS to estimate the cascaded BS-IRS-anchor channel. Then, an efficient VR\ndetection method is devised to estimate the VR information between the BS and\nXL-IRS. In this way, only the channels from the visible XL-IRS elements to the\nBS are estimated, thereby reducing the dimension of the cascaded BS-IRS-users\nchannels to be estimated. Third, by leveraging the common BS-IRS channel, the\ncascaded channels for all users are consecutively estimated accounting for the\nVRs of the IRS-user channels. Finally, numerical results are provided to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation scheme as\ncompared to various benchmark schemes.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
