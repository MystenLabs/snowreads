In general,\nsets with good uniform bounds for the Fourier transform are less structured,\nmore `random', and can often be analysed more easily. In many cases obtaining\ngood \\emph{uniform} bounds is not possible, even if `most' points admit good\npointwise bounds. Motivated by this, we propose a more nuanced approach where\none seeks to bound the $L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform instead of only\nthe maximum. We explore this idea by considering several examples and find that\na rich theory emerges. Further, we provide various applications of this new\napproach; including to sumset type problems, the finite fields distance\nconjecture, and the problem of counting $k$-simplices inside a given set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
