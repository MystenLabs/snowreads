{"id":"2407.06806","title":"A Fubini-type limit theorem for the integrated hyperuniform infinitely\n  divisible moving averages","authors":"Evgeny Spodarev","authorsParsed":[["Spodarev","Evgeny",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2024 12:28:23 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-10","timestamp":1720528103000,"abstract":"  This short note shows a limiting behavior of integrals of some centered\nantipersistent stationary infinitely divisible moving averages as the compact\nintegration domain in $d\\ge 1$ dimensions extends to the whole positive\nquadrant $\\mathbb{R}^d_+$. Namely, the weak limit of their finite dimensional\ndistributions is again a moving average with the same infinitely divisible\npurely jump integrator measure (i.e., possessing no Gaussian component), but\nwith an integrated kernel function. The results apply equally to time series\n($d=1$) as well as to random fields ($d>1$). Apart from the existence of the\nexpectation, no moment assumptions on the moving average are imposed allowing\nit to have an infinite variance as e.g. in the case of $\\alpha$-stable moving\naverages with $\\alpha\\in(1,2)$ . If the field is additionally square\nintegrable, its covariance integrates to zero (hyperuniformity).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
