Following the\nrecent line of research on algorithms endowed with additional predictive\nfeatures, we revisit this problem by allowing the decision maker to acquire\nadditional information on the actions to be selected. In particular, we study\nthe power of \\emph{best-action queries}, which reveal beforehand the identity\nof the best action at a given time step. In practice, predictive features may\nbe expensive, so we allow the decision maker to issue at most $k$ such queries.\nWe establish tight bounds on the performance any algorithm can achieve when\ngiven access to $k$ best-action queries for different types of feedback models.\nIn particular, we prove that in the full feedback model, $k$ queries are enough\nto achieve an optimal regret of $\\Theta\\left(\\min\\left\\{\\sqrt T, \\frac\nTk\\right\\}\\right)$. This finding highlights the significant multiplicative\nadvantage in the regret rate achievable with even a modest (sublinear) number\n$k \\in \\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ of queries. Additionally, we study the challenging\nsetting in which the only available feedback is obtained during the time steps\ncorresponding to the $k$ best-action queries. There, we provide a tight regret\nrate of $\\Theta\\left(\\min\\left\\{\\frac{T}{\\sqrt\nk},\\frac{T^2}{k^2}\\right\\}\\right)$, which improves over the standard\n$\\Theta\\left(\\frac{T}{\\sqrt k}\\right)$ regret rate for label efficient\nprediction for $k \\in \\Omega(T^{2/3})$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
