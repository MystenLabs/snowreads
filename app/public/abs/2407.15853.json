Behboodi introduced the notion of a classical prime ring module,\nwhich he showed is, in general, nonequivalent to a (Dauns) prime ring module.\nIn this paper, we extended the idea of classical primeness to near-ring module.\nHowever, unlike in the ring case, we were able to define and distinguish\nbetween various types of classical prime modules. We investigate four of them\nhere. We also prove some properties about the annihilator. Finally we\ncharacterize the classical $m$-systems of $R$-ideals of near-ring modules.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
