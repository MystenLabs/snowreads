Despite substantial progress in LLM technology, a\nsignificant gap exists in hardware development, particularly concerning\nscalability, efficiency, affordability, and multimodal capabilities. This\ndisparity presents both challenges and opportunities, underscoring the need for\nhardware that is not only powerful but also versatile and capable of managing\nthe sophisticated demands of modern computation. Our proposed device addresses\nthese needs by emphasizing scalability, multimodal data processing, enhanced\nuser interaction, and privacy considerations, offering a comprehensive platform\nfor LLM integration in various applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eXIAeeJWu4IhXSVQ3fsNkDwvqLG4IRStLA3kj3DcX8Q","pdfSize":"946663"}
