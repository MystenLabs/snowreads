Being related to the\nPenrose tiling, they differ from the latter by a significantly higher packing\ndensity of vertices, which, in turn, depends on the relative frequency of\nappearance of the H, B and S tiles. Since boats (also known as \"ivy leaves\")\nhave the lowest packing density, reducing their number in the tiling leads to\nan increase in its packing density. The paper proposes an inflation rule for a\nchiral tiling, which in principle contains no boats and therefore has the\nhighest possible density among HBS tilings. The relationship between the tiling\nand the real structures of crystal approximants of decagonal quasicrystals is\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
