At the same time, the\ndegenerate solutions of the nonlinear wave solutions on the Jacobi function\nbackground for the gKP equation are constructed by taking the modulus of the\nJacobi function to be 0 and 1. The findings indicate that there can be various\ntypes of nonlinear wave solutions with different ranges of spectral parameters,\nincluding soliton and breather waves. These results will be useful for\nelucidating and predicting nonlinear phenomena in related physical fields, such\nas physical ocean and Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
