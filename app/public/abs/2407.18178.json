The internet is a promising\nsource of large-scale demonstrations for training our robot agents. In\nparticular, for the case of piano-playing, Youtube is full of videos of\nprofessional pianists playing a wide myriad of songs. In our work, we leverage\nthese demonstrations to learn a generalist piano-playing agent capable of\nplaying any arbitrary song. Our framework is divided into three parts: a data\npreparation phase to extract the informative features from the Youtube videos,\na policy learning phase to train song-specific expert policies from the\ndemonstrations and a policy distillation phase to distil the policies into a\nsingle generalist agent. We explore different policy designs to represent the\nagent and evaluate the influence of the amount of training data on the\ngeneralization capability of the agent to novel songs not available in the\ndataset. We show that we are able to learn a policy with up to 56\\% F1 score on\nunseen songs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E5aB6ryn6seu5SmQHTCfTSjTjqoow5GFX3Q5x7WLfd4","pdfSize":"5824780"}
