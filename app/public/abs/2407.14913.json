These algebras possess\na left symmetric product and are Lie-admissible. We describe completely\nsymmetric Leibniz algebras that are symplectic as both left and right Leibniz\nalgebras. Additionally, we show that symplectic left or right Leibniz algebras\ncan be constructed from a symplectic Lie algebra and a vector space through a\nmethod that combines the double extension process and the $T^*$-extension. This\napproach allows us to generate a broad class of examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eR88Zpb2QBc_kl-8Lo0JooZuXfRh5q3Qx5p0YyIXYPY","pdfSize":"242234"}
