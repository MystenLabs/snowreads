Moreover, we show that the converse holds for small\ncancellation groups. As an application, we show that the Morse boundary of a\nnon-hyperbolic, Morse local-to-global group that has contraction does not admit\na non-trivial stationary measure. In fact, we show that any stationary measure\non a geodesic boundary of such a groups needs to assign measure zero to the\nMorse boundary. Unlike previous results, we do not need any assumptions on the\nstationary measures considered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9PgD05LG7OZzmkYhNDfJTOuWMo24EJOwcOXI5-OG6bs","pdfSize":"678372","objectId":"0xe518f6729c0e79b929a54478b31a75a8ea56bf22a9bad31cb1aac8272582303b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
