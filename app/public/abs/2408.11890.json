Given their compactness and\nthe inferred stellar masses in the hypothesis that LRDs are starburst galaxies,\nthe implied stellar densities are immense. This Research Note uses an extensive\ncatalog of LRDs from the PRIMER and the COSMOS-Web surveys to investigate these\ndensities. We find a median (upper limit) on the effective radius of $80$ pc,\nwhich leads to median (lower limit) values of the core density of $\\sim 10^4 \\,\n\\rm M_\\odot \\, pc^{-3}$, and individual densities as high as $\\sim 10^8 \\, \\rm\nM_\\odot \\, pc^{-3}$, which is $\\sim 10$ times higher than the density necessary\nfor runaway collisions to take place. For $\\sim 35\\%$ of the LRDs investigated,\nthe lower limits are higher than the highest stellar densities observed in any\nsystem in any redshift range.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
