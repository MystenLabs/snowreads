It establishes that, for any , achieving the maximum purity number is both a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the separability of n-particle pure\nstates, and a necessary condition for the separability of n-particle mixed\nstates. Subsequently, the study delves into the concept of entanglement rate in\nn-particle pure states. The entanglement rate of an n-particle pure state, in\nwhich all entangled sub-states are maximally entangled, can be considered as a\nmeasure of entanglement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oB65gHH9GnCINWDEMxrZTP2WlOEIGDzoyGfIv-Bt4gI","pdfSize":"337007"}
