Our theoretical investigation in this study\ncenters on NFRHT in graphene-covered Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Our findings\nindicate variable heat flux enhancement or attenuation, contingent on chemical\npotential of graphene. Enhancement or attenuation mechanisms stem from the\ncoupling or decoupling of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in the graphene/WSM\nheterostructure. The graphene-covered WSM photon tunneling probabilities\nvariation is demonstrated in detail. This research enhances our comprehension\nof SPPs within the graphene/WSM heterostructure and suggests methods for\nactively controlling NFRHT.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ozCuLcyZTgMUOh0ZCHGr9C_k-gkbYvXvnxQKU1m8RWo","pdfSize":"736894"}
