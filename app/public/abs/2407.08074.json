One approach\nused to achieve these improvements is the application of multi-lattice\nstructures, where the macro-scale performance relies on the detailed design of\nmesostructural lattice elements. Many current approaches to designing such\nstructures use data-driven design to generate multi-lattice transition regions,\nmaking use of machine learning models that are informed solely by the geometry\nof the mesostructures. However, it remains unclear if the integration of\nmechanical properties into the dataset used to train such machine learning\nmodels would be beneficial beyond using geometric data alone. To address this\nissue, this work implements and evaluates a hybrid geometry/property\nVariational Autoencoder (VAE) for generating multi-lattice transition regions.\nIn our study, we found that hybrid VAEs demonstrate enhanced performance in\nmaintaining stiffness continuity through transition regions, indicating their\nsuitability for design tasks requiring smooth mechanical properties.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
