Our investigation\nreveals a paradoxical outcome: rather than fostering closer relationships and\nimproving social lives, the algorithms and structures that underlie social\nmedia platforms inadvertently contribute to a profound psychological impact on\nindividuals, influencing them in unforeseen ways. This phenomenon is\nparticularly pronounced among teenagers, who are disproportionately affected by\ncurated online personas, peer pressure to present a perfect digital image, and\nthe constant bombardment of notifications and updates that characterize their\nsocial media experience. As such, we issue a call to action for policymakers,\nplatform developers, and educators to prioritize the well-being of teenagers in\nthe digital age and work towards creating secure and safe social media\nplatforms that protect the young from harm, online harassment, and\nexploitation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
