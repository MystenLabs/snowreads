As such, machine tending is a task collaborative robots\ncan tackle that can also highly boost productivity. Nevertheless, existing\nrobotics systems deployed in that sector rely on a fixed single-arm setup,\nwhereas mobile robots can provide more flexibility and scalability. In this\nwork, we introduce a multi-agent multi-machine tending learning framework by\nmobile robots based on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) techniques\nwith the design of a suitable observation and reward. Moreover, an\nattention-based encoding mechanism is developed and integrated into Multi-agent\nProximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to boost its performance for\nmachine tending scenarios. Our model (AB-MAPPO) outperformed MAPPO in this new\nchallenging scenario in terms of task success, safety, and resources\nutilization. Furthermore, we provided an extensive ablation study to support\nour various design decisions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mhPGxz26_TTlwPL7pf2rCPip0_VSaPed8rGlbxv2k7k","pdfSize":"1741822"}
