Not only does this determine the\nultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the\nreversibility of the theory of entanglement manipulation under asymptotically\nnon-entangling operations, with the regularised relative entropy of\nentanglement governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two\nquantum states. To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is\na procedure that we call \"blurring\", which, informally, transforms a\npermutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby\ntype classes. In the fully classical case, blurring alone suffices to prove the\ngeneralised Stein's lemma. To solve the quantum problem, however, it does not\nseem to suffice. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a\nsecond quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic\nquantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from\ncontinuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the\nsecond-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel.\nA careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our\nquantum solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
