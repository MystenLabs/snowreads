In this work,\nwe demonstrate experimentally a fully autonomous strategy for exploiting vortex\nrings for energy-efficient propulsion. First, an underwater robot used an\nonboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) to sense the motion induced by the\npassage of a vortex ring generated by a thruster in a 13,000-liter water tank.\nIn response to the sensed acceleration, an impulsive maneuver entrained the\nrobot into the material boundary of the vortex ring. After entrainment, the\nrobot was propelled across the tank without expending additional energy or\ncontrol effort. By advecting with the vortex ring, the robot achieved a near\nfive-fold reduction in the energy required to traverse the tank. Using the\ncontrolled finite-time Lyapunov exponent field and corresponding Lagrangian\ncoherent structures, we analyze and explain the initial entrainment process and\nthe sensitivity to the starting time and position of the surfing maneuver.\nAdditionally, linear acceleration as sensed by the onboard IMU was found to\ncorrespond with the pressure gradient of the background flow, and rotational\nacceleration is suggested as a method for measuring the vorticity of the vortex\nring. This study serves as a proof-of-concept demonstration of the potential\nfor onboard inertial measurements to enable efficient interaction with\nbackground fluid flows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
