We introduce the notion of Segal's amplitudes\non surfaces with corners and prove the gluing property for such amplitudes. The\nsemi-group of half-annuli and its generator are studied and we develop the\nnecessary material for proving its spectral decomposition using scattering\ntheory in the companion paper \\cite{GRW2}. The Segal gluing properties and the\nspectral decomposition allows us to prove the conformal bootstrap formula for\ncorrelation functions of Liouville conformal field theory with a boundary. This\nhas several important applications to the study of conformal blocks\n(analyticity and convergence) in \\cite{remypreprint}, in the construction of a\nunitary representation of mapping class group in the space of conformal blocks,\nand the study of random moduli \\cite{ARSmoduliRPM} in Liouville quantum\ngravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
