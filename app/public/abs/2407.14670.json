The Stark energy can be written as \\textit{intraband} Berry\nphases, while Zener tunneling is given by \\textit{interband} Berry connections.\nWe suggest that the gaps induced by interband hybridization can be probed by\nTHz optical absorption and emission spectroscopy. This is especially relevant\nto modern moir\\'{e} materials wherein mini-bands are often spectrally\nentangled, leading to strong interband hybridization in the Wannier-Stark\nregime. Furthermore, owing to their large superlattice constants, both the\nlow-field and high-field regimes can be accessed in these materials using\npresently available technology. Importantly, even at moderate electric fields,\nwe find that stimulated emission can dominate absorption, raising the\npossibility of lasing at practically relevant parameter regimes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nFgZNO9Wl0TVSmSm7xEgzQp-irtHbqxBasrOaTjEen8","pdfSize":"8104186"}
