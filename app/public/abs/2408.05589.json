Nonetheless, their applicability is\ntypically constrained to low-temperature ranges, rendering them ineffective in\nmedium temperature environments. This study presents a methodology for the\nfabrication of an innovative PTC material operational at approximately\n353~{\\deg}C, with a thorough investigation of its Curie temperature and\nresistivity properties. The material formulation incorporates 4~wt\\% carbon\nblack (CB), 0.5~wt\\% NBT, and 5~wt\\% DOP into a BaTiO$_3$-based matrix. The\nempirical findings reveal that this material exhibits a notably high PTC\nstrength of 5.8 and a comparatively low resistivity of 590~$\\Omega\\cdot$cm at\nroom temperature. Furthermore, the material demonstrated excellent\nrepeatability in PTC strength after thirty cycles of heating and cooling near\nthe Curie temperature. Consequently, this PTC material is deemed highly\neffective for applications in cold environments, notably for the preheating and\ninitiation of aircraft engines and auxiliary power units (APUs).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
