However, the set of available\nmaterials intrinsically realizing these properties are scarce. Recently,\nsurface superconductivity has been reported in PtBi$_2$ in its trigonal phase\nand an inherent Weyl semimetal phase has been predicted. Here, based on\nscanning tunneling microscopy experiments, we reveal the signature of\ntopological Fermi arcs in the normal state patterns of the quasiparticle\ninterference. We show that the scattering between Fermi arcs dominates the\ninterference spectra, providing conclusive evidence for the relevance of Weyl\nfermiology for the surface electronic properties of trigonal PtBi$_2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
