However,\nexisting matrix unit designs are tightly coupled to the SIMT core, limiting the\nsize and energy efficiency of the operation due to capacity and bandwidth\nconstraints from the register file. Such a limitation in scalability makes it\ndifficult to simultaneously enhance compute throughput and improve energy\nefficiency in GPUs.\n  To address this challenge, we propose Virgo, a new GPU microarchitecture that\nintegrates dedicated matrix units at the SIMT core cluster level. By physically\ndisaggregating the matrix unit from the SIMT core, Virgo eliminates scalability\nconstraints imposed by the core microarchitecture. Consequently, Virgo\nincreases the granularity of operations at the hardware which not only improves\ndata reuse, but also reduces the number of instructions processed in the SIMT\ncore. This reduction in instruction processing decreases energy consumption\nwithin the core pipeline, thereby improving the system-level energy efficiency.\nOur evaluations, implemented in synthesizable RTL, demonstrate that Virgo\nachieves up to 66.3% reduction in active power and 77.2% reduction in active\nenergy consumption of the system-on-chip compared to the baseline core-coupled\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
