However, its utility is limited by the exponential\nincrease in computational complexity as the cluster size grows. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose an artificial intelligence-based method known as\n$\\Delta$-Learning. This approach constructs a predictive model by learning the\ndiscrepancies between lower-precision (small cluster sizes) and high-precision\n(large cluster sizes) implementations of the cluster Gutzwiller method,\nrequiring only a small number of training samples. Using this predictive model,\nwe can effectively forecast the outcomes of high-precision methods with high\naccuracy. Applied to various Bose-Hubbard models, the $\\Delta$-Learning method\neffectively predicts phase diagrams while significantly reducing the\ncomputational resources and time. Furthermore, we have compared the predictive\naccuracy of $\\Delta$-Learning with other direct learning methods and found that\n$\\Delta$-Learning exhibits superior performance in scenarios with limited\ntraining data. Therefore, when combined with the cluster Gutzwiller\napproximation, the $\\Delta$-Learning approach offers a computationally\nefficient and accurate method for studying phase transitions in large, complex\nbosonic systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
