We prove that\nthe ray $[\\chi]$ does not belong to the BNS set $\\Sigma(\\Gamma)$ if and only if\nit comes as a pullback along an algebraic fibration $f \\colon X \\to\n\\mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\\mathcal{C}$. We\nalso prove that if $\\pi_1(X)$ admits a solvable quotient which is not virtually\nnilpotent, there exists a finite \\'etale cover $X_1 \\to X$ and a fibration $f\n\\colon X_1 \\to \\mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve\n$\\mathcal{C}$. Both of these results were proved by Delzant in the case when\n$X$ is a compact K\\\"ahler manifold. We deduce that $\\Gamma$ is virtually\nsolvable if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, generalising the theorems of\nDelzant and Arapura-Nori. As a byproduct, we prove a version of Simpson's\nLefschetz Theorem for the integral leaves of logarithmic $1$-forms that do not\nextend to any partial compactification. We give two applications of our\nresults. First, we strengthen the recent theorem of Cadorel-Deng-Yamanoi on\nvirtual nilpotency of fundamental groups of quasi-projective $h$-special and\nweakly special manifolds. Second, we prove the sharpness of Suciu's tropical\nbound for the fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective varieties and\nanswer a question of Suciu on the topology of hyperplane arrangements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
