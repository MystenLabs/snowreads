In common with previous\ngeneralisations of the classical Gershgorin bound for the spectrum, our\ninclusion sets are based on a block decomposition. In contrast to previous\ngeneralisations that treat the matrix as a perturbation of a block-diagonal\nsubmatrix, our arguments treat the matrix as a perturbation of a\nblock-tridiagonal matrix, which can lead to sharp spectral bounds, as we show\nfor the example of large Toeplitz matrices. Our inclusion sets, which take the\nform of unions of pseudospectra of square or rectangular submatrices, build on\nour own recent work on inclusion sets for bi-infinite matrices [Chandler-Wilde,\nChonchaiya, Lindner, {\\em J. Spectr. Theory} {\\bf 14}, 719--804 (2024)].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
