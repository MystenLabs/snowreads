Breakthrough experiments show that at low relative humidities\nthere is an anomalous induction effect, where the kinetics at short times are\nslower than kinetics at long times. The induction effect gradually vanishes as\nrelative humidity is increased, corresponding to an increase in CO2 adsorption\nrate. A new theory is proposed based on the Lattice Kinetic Theory (LKT) which\nexplains these experimental results. LKT is able to accurately represent the\nmeasured data over the full range of humidities by postulating that the\npresence of adsorbed water shifts the equilibrium clusters from cooperatively\nbound chains to non-cooperatively bound CO2. A consequence of this transition\nis that CO2 exhibits type V adsorption in dry air, and type I adsorption in\nhumid air.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
