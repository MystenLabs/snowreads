However, its traditional\nimplementation is hindered by some limitations, including the requirement to\nsolve all scenario subproblems in each iteration, reliance on an explicit\nprobability distribution, and a convergence process that is highly sensitive to\nthe choice of certain penalty parameters. This paper introduces a\nsampling-based PHA which aims to overcome these limitations. Our approach\nemploys a dynamic selection process for the number of scenario subproblems\nsolved per iteration. It incorporates adaptive sequential sampling for\ndetermining sample sizes, a stochastic conjugate subgradient method for\ndirection finding, and a line-search technique to update the dual variables.\nExperimental results demonstrate that this novel algorithm not only addresses\nthe bottlenecks of the conventional PHA but also potentially surpasses its\nscalability, representing a substantial improvement in the field of stochastic\nprogramming.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
