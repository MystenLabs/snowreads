We quantize a massless\nscalar field in the spacetime of a rotating sphere, incorporating the\nframe-dragging frequency into the field modes. The excitation rate for an atom\nundergoing uniform circular motion and interacting with the scalar field is\ncalculated. Our results reveal that the time-dependent excitation rates of\natoms following different trajectories exhibit a common envelope, from which\nthe frame-dragging frequency can be effectively extracted. This discovery leads\nus to propose a novel detection scheme for measuring the frame-dragging\nfrequency caused by rotating celestial bodies, eliminating the need for\ntraditional starlight calibration methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
