Existing reference topologies\nfor optical networks may cover different network segments such as backbone,\nmetro core, metro aggregation, access and/or data center. While telco operators\nwork on the optimization of their own existing deployed optical networks, the\navailability of different topologies is useful for researchers and technology\ndevelopers to test their solutions in a variety of scenarios and validate the\nperformance in terms of energy efficiency or cost reduction. This paper\npresents an open-source tool, MoleNetwork, to generate graphs inspired by real\nnetwork topologies of telecommunication operators that can be used as\nbenchmarks for techno-economic studies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
