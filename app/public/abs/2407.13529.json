In particular, quantum state verification is\na fundamental building block for communication and computation applications,\ndetermining whether the involved parties can trust the resources at hand or\nwhether the application should be aborted. Self-testing methods have been used\nto tackle such verification tasks in a device-independent (DI) setting.\nHowever, these approaches commonly consider the limit of large (asymptotic),\nidentically and independently distributed (IID) samples, which weakens the DI\nclaim and poses serious challenges to their experimental implementation. Here\nwe overcome these challenges by adopting a theoretical protocol enabling the\ncertification of quantum states in the few-copies and non-IID regime and by\nleveraging a high-fidelity multipartite entangled photon source. This allows us\nto show the efficient and device-independent certification of a single copy of\na four-qubit GHZ state that can readily be used for the robust and reliable\nimplementation of quantum information tasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
