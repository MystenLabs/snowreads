It is based on the historical lesson that the use of larger\nalgebras containing all generators of the isometry of the continuous one helped\nin formulating a fuzzy covariant noncommutative space. Specifically a further\nenlargement of the isometry group leads us, in addition to the construction of\nthe covariant noncommutative space, also to the suggestion of the group that\nshould be gauged on such a space in order to construct a Fuzzy Gravity theory.\nAs a result, we obtain two Fuzzy Gravity models, one in de Sitter and one in\nanti-de Sitter space, depending on the extension of the isometry group, and we\ndiscuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking leading to fuzzy versions of the\nnoncommutative $SO(1,3)$ gravity. In addition we discuss for the first time how\nto introduce fermions in the fuzzy gravity and even more importantly how to\nunify the constructed noncommutative-fuzzy gravity with internal interactions\nbased on $SO(10)$ or $SU(5)$ as grand unified theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
