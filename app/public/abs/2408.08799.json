This inherent hierarchical structure plays a crucial\nrole in domains such as neuron morphology and river geomorphology, but\ntraditional graph representation methods often overlook these specific\ncharacteristics of tree structures. To address this, we introduce a new\nrepresentation learning framework tailored for geometric trees. It first\nfeatures a unique message passing neural network, which is both provably\ngeometrical structure-recoverable and rotation-translation invariant. To\naddress the data label scarcity issue, our approach also includes two\ninnovative training targets that reflect the hierarchical ordering and\ngeometric structure of these geometric trees. This enables fully\nself-supervised learning without explicit labels. We validate our method's\neffectiveness on eight real-world datasets, demonstrating its capability to\nrepresent geometric trees.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
