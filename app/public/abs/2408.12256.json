This paradigmatic example allows to construct a family\nof nonautonomous dynamical systems with an attracting integral manifold and a\nhyperbolic repelling trajectory located within the nonautonomous set enclosed\nby the integral manifold. Upon the variation of the parameter the integral\nmanifold collapses, the hyperbolic repelling solution disappears and a unique\nglobally attracting hyperbolic solution arises in what could be considered yet\nanother nonautonomous Hopf bifurcation pattern. Interestingly, the three\nphenomena do not happen at the same critical value of the parameter, yielding\nthus an example of a nonautonomous bifurcation in two steps. We provide a\nmathematical description of the dynamical objects at play and analyze the\nperiodically forced case via rigorously validated continuation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
