We have recently developed a\nnon-invasive method to engineer carbon-related SiCCs confined to ultra-thin\nnanolayers within a pristine crystalline environment, which is of utmost\nimportance for the photostability of SiCCs. Here, we demonstrate embedding\nthese C-doping-based SiCCs into the only 9 nm wide intrinsic region of a p-i-n\ndiode using the epitaxial self-assembly of color centers. We report\nelectrically-pumped light emission with an exponential increase in the\nintensity as a function of the driving current until saturation. We associate\nthis property with the shift of quasi-Fermi-level position upon electrical\ndriving, which simultaneously improves the spectral homogeneity of the\nengineered SiCCs. Our study demonstrates the electrical control and driving of\nnear-infrared emitters in high-quality silicon diodes, an essential milestone\nfor advancing classical and quantum optoelectronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E0Rior7ZijO93lvRYWfDCcGr1_V5GPdCSKpKTEX7Utc","pdfSize":"674205"}
