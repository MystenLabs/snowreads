This\nwork investigates the production of ultraheavy dark matter and WIMPs in the\npresence of primordial black holes. Firstly, we describe how Hawking\nevaporation can produce ultraheavy dark matter with masses above $10^{12}$ GeV\nin radiation and matter-domination eras. Later, we assess how primordial black\nholes that induce a non-standard cosmology impact the predicted relic density\nof a thermal relic and explore the interplay between them, considering the\nrestrictions arising from entropy injection due to the evaporation of\nprimordial black holes. Considering a concrete B-L model, where the dark matter\nis a Dirac particle, we obtain the correct relic density for various freeze-out\nscenarios and show that a dark matter particle can nicely reproduce the correct\nrelic density in agreement with current limits with masses above the $10$ TeV\nscale. Hence, this work strengthens the continuous search for heavy dark matter\nparticles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
