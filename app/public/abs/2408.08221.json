Let $t_1,\\ldots, t_s$ be nonnegative integers. What is\nthe maximum of $|\\mathcal G|$ subject to the condition that any two codewords\nshould have at least $t_i$ positions where both have letter $i$ ($1\\le i\\le\ns$). In the case $s=2$ it is a longstanding open question. Quite surprisingly,\nwe obtain an almost complete answer for $s\\ge 3$. The main tool is a\ncorrelation inequality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
