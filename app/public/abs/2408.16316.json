GRAND is\nenvisioned as a collection of large-scale ground arrays of self-triggered radio\nantennas that target the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by\nUHE particles. Three prototype arrays are in operation: GRAND@Nan\\c{c}ay in\nFrance, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. They test the\ndetection principle and technology of GRAND, in preparation for its next phase,\nconsisting of two arrays of 10'000 antennas each, in the Northern and Southern\nhemispheres, to be deployed from 2030 on. We present the concept of GRAND, its\nscience goals, the status of the prototypes, their first measurements, and the\ntechnical and scientific perspectives that these measurements open for the\nfield.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
