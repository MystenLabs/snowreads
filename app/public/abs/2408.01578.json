However, there exist weaknesses in such a methodology which may\nstill expose distinctive information, allowing to track the device generating\nthe Probe Requests. Such techniques, known as MAC de-randomization algorithms,\ngenerally exploit Information Elements (IEs) contained in the Probe Requests\nand use clustering methodologies to group together frames belonging to the same\ndevice. While effective on heterogeneous device types, such techniques are not\nable to differentiate among devices of identical type and running the same\nOperating System (OS). In this paper, we propose a MAC de-randomization\ntechnique able to overcome such a weakness. First, we propose a new dataset of\nProbe Requests captured from devices sharing the same characteristics.\nSecondly, we observe that the time-frequency pattern of Probe Request emission\nis unique among devices and can therefore be used as a discriminative feature.\nWe embed such a feature in a two-stage clustering methodology and show through\nexperiments its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art techniques based\nsolely on IEs fingerprinting. The original dataset used in this work is made\npublicly available for reproducible research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
