Phase-type distributions,\ncommonly used in modelling dynamic systems, represent the temporal evolution of\na set of variables based on their phase. On the other hand, positive systems,\nprevalent in a wide range of disciplines, are those where the involved\nvariables maintain non-negative values over time. Through some examples, we\ndemonstrate how phase-type distributions can be useful in describing and\nanalyzing positive systems, providing a perspective on their dynamic behavior.\nOur main objective is to establish clear connections between these seemingly\ndifferent concepts, highlighting their relevance and utility in various fields\nof study. The findings presented here contribute to a better understanding of\nthe interaction between phase-type distribution theory and positive system\ntheory, opening new opportunities for future research in this exciting\ninterdisciplinary field.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
