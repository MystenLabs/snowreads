We\nshow that the proposed method is more than 1000 times faster than the standard\nFerguson-Klass algorithm without a significant loss of precision. This method\ncan open an avenue for computationally efficient and scalable Bayesian\nnonparametric models which go beyond conjugacy assumptions, as demonstrated in\nthe examples section.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
