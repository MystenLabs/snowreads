To address this limitation, we\npropose a novel framework, Adaptive Prediction Ensemble (APE), which integrates\ndeep learning and rule-based prediction experts. A learned routing function,\ntrained concurrently with the deep learning model, dynamically selects the most\nreliable prediction based on the input scenario. Our experiments on large-scale\ndatasets, including Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse, demonstrate\nimprovement in zero-shot generalization across datasets. We show that our\nmethod outperforms individual prediction models and other variants,\nparticularly in long-horizon prediction and scenarios with a high proportion of\nOOD data. This work highlights the potential of hybrid approaches for robust\nand generalizable motion prediction in autonomous driving.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
