We provide a detailed\nconstruction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also\nknown as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to\ngive general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG\nand gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of\nthe volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory,\nclosely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered\ngravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it\nallows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity.\nFurthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is\nrecovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
