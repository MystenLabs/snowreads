Additionally,\nlow-quality texts with excessive noise or sparse key information are unlikely\nto align well with relevant queries. Recent studies mainly focus on improving\nthe sentence embedding model or retrieval process. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel text augmentation framework for dense retrieval. This framework\ntransforms raw documents into information-dense text formats, which supplement\nthe original texts to effectively address the aforementioned issues without\nmodifying embedding or retrieval methodologies. Two text representations are\ngenerated via large language models (LLMs) zero-shot prompting: question-answer\npairs and element-driven events. We term this approach QAEA-DR: unifying\nquestion-answer generation and event extraction in a text augmentation\nframework for dense retrieval. To further enhance the quality of generated\ntexts, a scoring-based evaluation and regeneration mechanism is introduced in\nLLM prompting. Our QAEA-DR model has a positive impact on dense retrieval,\nsupported by both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
