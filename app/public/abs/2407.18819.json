In particular, we will\nfocus on the so-called generalized Hamilton spaces, discussing how the main\ningredients of this geometrical framework, such as the Hamiltonian and the\nnonlinear and affine connections, can be derived from a given metric. Several\nproperties of this kind of spaces are demonstrated for autoparallel\nHamiltonians. Moreover, we study the spacetime and momentum isometries of the\nmetric. Finally, we discuss the possible applications of cotangent bundle\ngeometries in quantum gravity, such as the construction of deformed\nrelativistic kinematics and non-commutative spacetimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
