However, ensuring user engagement is challenging,\nparticularly when the volume of information and length of counseling sessions\nincrease. Agenda setting a clinical counseling technique where a patient and\nclinician collaboratively decide on session topics is an effective approach to\ntailoring discussions for individual patient needs and sustaining engagement.\nWe explore the effectiveness of agenda setting in a virtual counselor system\ndesigned to counsel women for breast cancer genetic testing. In a between\nsubjects study, we assessed three versions of the system with varying levels of\nuser control in the system's agenda setting approach. We found that\nparticipants' knowledge improved across all conditions. Although our results\nshowed that any type of agenda setting was perceived as useful, regardless of\nuser control, interviews revealed a preference for more collaboration and user\ninvolvement in the agenda setting process. Our study highlights the importance\nof using patient-centered approaches, such as tailored discussions, when using\nvirtual counselors in healthcare.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
