However, the characteristics of\nindependent deployment, decentralization, and frequent dynamic interactions\nalso introduce the risk of cascading failures, making it challenging to achieve\naccurate failure diagnosis and rapid system recovery. These issues severely\nimpact operation efficiency and user experience. Recognizing the crucial role\nof failure diagnosis in enhancing the stability and reliability of microservice\nsystems, researchers have conducted extensive studies and achieved a series of\nsignificant outcomes. This survey provides a comprehensive review and primary\nanalysis of 94 papers from 2003 to the present, including an overview of the\nfundamental concepts, a research framework, and problem statements. These\ninsights aim to help researchers understand the latest research progress in\nfailure diagnosis. Publicly available datasets, toolkits, and evaluation\nmetrics are also compiled to assist practitioners in selecting and validating\nvarious techniques, providing a foundation to advance the domain beyond current\npractices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
