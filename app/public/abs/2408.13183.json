Our\napproach can be used to quantify uncertainty in realizations of stochastic\nprocesses or validate stochastic simulation models by checking whether\nhistorical paths from the actual system fall within the constructed confidence\nband. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our methodology is widely\napplicable and directly addresses optimization bias within the constraints,\nproducing tight confidence bands with accurate coverage probabilities. It is\ntractable, being only slightly more complex than the state-of-the-art baseline\napproach, and easy to use, as it employs standard techniques. Additionally, our\napproach is also applicable to continuous-time processes after appropriately\ndiscretizing time. In our first case study, we show that our approach achieves\nthe desired coverage probabilities with an order-of-magnitude fewer sample\npaths than the state-of-the-art baseline approach. In our second case study, we\nillustrate how our approach can be used to validate stochastic simulation\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
