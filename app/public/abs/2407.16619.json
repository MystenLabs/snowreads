The constituent elements are typically\ntoo large to undergo thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the material\ninternal structure, and therefore its rheology, should not change over time.\nHere, we explore the rheology of Carbopol, a prototypical simple yield stress\nmaterial, and reveal that gradual, spontaneous relaxation of residual stresses,\ninduced when loading the sample into rheometer, results in a small yet\nsignificant reduction in the material dynamic yield stress. This relaxation\nprocess can lead to a non-monotonic creep deformation rate under constant\nstress, culminating in delayed fluidization of the material. These findings\nhighlight that yield stress is not merely a static material property but a\nfunction of the material internal stress state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
