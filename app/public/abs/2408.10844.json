However, we show here that commonly\nused object detectors predict large and small boxes equally often. In this\nwork, we investigate how to align automatically detected object boxes with\nhuman preference and study whether this improves human quality perception. We\nevaluate the performance of three commonly used object detectors through a user\nstudy (N = 123). We find that humans prefer object detections that are upscaled\nwith factors of 1.5 or 2, even if the corresponding AP is close to 0. Motivated\nby this result, we propose an asymmetric bounding box regression loss that\nencourages large over small predicted bounding boxes. Our evaluation study\nshows that object detectors fine-tuned with the asymmetric loss are better\naligned with human preference and are preferred over fixed scaling factors. A\nqualitative evaluation shows that human preference might be influenced by some\nobject characteristics, like object shape.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TLcKP8EuiEw4Qw4CvQlEOsMPMqng0gvzIZR0MlTHKp8","pdfSize":"2160725"}
