Key\nobjectives include implementation and analysis of a Dead-Zone VOC (DZVOC)\nthree-phase battery-inverter system with an additional voltage control loop,\nstudy of its stability and performance in an isolated micro-grid and\nexploration of their use alongside widely used grid following PV-inverter\nsystem. By modeling independent microgrids under various cases with scenarios:\nVOC inverters of varying capacities and VOC inverters in conjunction with PV\ninverters, this research addresses critical aspects of power-sharing,\ncompatibility, response times, and fault ride-through potential, as well as\nimproving the voltage droop profile of a general DZVOC control. The simulation\nis executed in MATLAB SIMULINK and validated with real-time simulation using\nthe Typhoon-HIL 404.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LqNb_ValOYd8RJYA5gNEfB9hkwhj3cKMmzP9DbzSVWE","pdfSize":"6474222"}
