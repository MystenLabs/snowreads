DTCs average 4.9 times brighter than other Starlink Mini spacecraft at\na common distance. We cannot currently separate the effects of the DTC antenna\nitself, the different attitude modes that may be required for DTC operations\nand to what extent brightness mitigation procedures were in place at the times\nof our observations. In a best case scenario, where DTC brightness mitigation\nis as successful as that for other Minis and the DTC antenna does not add\nsignificantly to brightness, we estimate that DTCs will be about 2.6 times as\nbright as the others based upon their lower altitudes. The DTCs spend a greater\nfraction of their time in the Earth's shadow than satellites at higher\naltitudes. That will offset some of their impact on astronomical observing.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
