The increasing number and proportion of\narticles on single-channel EEG underscore its growing potential. This paper\nprovides a comprehensive review of single-channel EEG, focusing on development\ntrends, devices, datasets, signal processing methods, recent applications, and\nfuture directions. Definitions of bipolar and unipolar configurations in\nsingle-channel EEG are clarified to guide future advancements. Applications\nmainly span sleep staging, emotion recognition, educational research, and\nclinical diagnosis. Ongoing advancements of single-channel EEG in AI-based EEG\ngeneration techniques suggest potential parity or superiority over multichannel\nEEG performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
