From certain\nactions on $S^{1}$ with invariant almost laminations, we reconstruct flows and\nmanifolds realizing these actions, including all orientable transitive\npseudo-Anosov flows in closed $3$-manifolds. Denoting the Poincar\\'e disk by\n$\\mathcal{D}$, our construction provides a geometry model for such flows $\\phi$\nand manifolds $M$ by identifying the universal coverings of $M$ with certain\nspaces induced from $\\mathcal{D} \\times \\mathcal{D}$ and identifying the action\nof $\\pi_1(M)$ on $S^{1}_{\\infty}(\\phi)$ with an action on $\\partial\n\\mathcal{D}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
