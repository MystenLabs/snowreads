In this paper, we consider a\ndownlink monostatic ISAC system wherein the base station serves multiple\ncommunications users and sensing targets at the same time in the presence of\nclutter. We aim at both guaranteeing fairness among the communications users\nwhile simultaneously balancing the performances of communications and sensing\nfunctionalities. Therefore, we optimize the transmit and receive beamformers to\nmaximize the weighted minimum signal-to-interference and clutter-plus-noise\nratios. The design problem is highly challenging due to the non-smooth and\nnon-convex objective function and strongly coupled variables. We propose two\nefficient methods to solve the problem. First, we rely on fractional\nprogramming and transform the original problem into convex sub-problems, which\ncan be solved with standard convex optimization tools. To further reduce the\ncomplexity and dependence on numerical tools, we develop a novel approach to\naddress the inherent non-smoothness of the formulated problem. Finally, the\nefficiencies of the proposed designs are demonstrated by numerical results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
