It has\nrecently been proposed that a barrier to the transfer of energy can develop at\nsmall scales, which can enable heating through ion-cyclotron resonance, under\nconditions applicable to regions of the solar wind. Such a scenario\nfundamentally diverges from the standard picture of turbulence, where the\nenergy cascade proceeds unimpeded until it is dissipated. Here, using data from\nNASA's Parker Solar Probe, we find that the shape of the magnetic energy\nspectrum around the ion gyroradius varies with solar wind parameters in a\nmanner consistent with the presence of such a barrier. This allows us to\nidentify critical values of some of the parameters necessary for the barrier to\nform; we show that the barrier appears fully developed for ion plasma beta of\nbelow $\\simeq0.5$ and becomes increasingly prominent with imbalance for\nnormalised cross helicity values greater than $\\simeq0.4$. As these conditions\nare frequently met in the solar wind, particularly close to the Sun, our\nresults suggest that the barrier is likely playing a significant role in\nturbulent dissipation in the solar wind and so is an important mechanism in\nexplaining its heating and acceleration.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
