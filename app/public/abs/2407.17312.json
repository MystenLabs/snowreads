Existing patch-based adversarial attacks for MDE are\nconfined to the vicinity of the patch, making it difficult to affect the entire\ntarget. To address this limitation, we propose a physics-based adversarial\nattack on monocular depth estimation, employing a framework called Attack with\nShape-Varying Patches (ASP), aiming to optimize patch content, shape, and\nposition to maximize effectiveness. We introduce various mask shapes, including\nquadrilateral, rectangular, and circular masks, to enhance the flexibility and\nefficiency of the attack. Furthermore, we propose a new loss function to extend\nthe influence of the patch beyond the overlapping regions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our attack method generates an average depth error of 18\nmeters on the target car with a patch area of 1/9, affecting over 98\\% of the\ntarget area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
