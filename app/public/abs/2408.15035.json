More precisely, we\ncontrol the relative entropy between the joint law of the particle system and\nthe tensorized law of the Landau equation. To obtain this, we establish as key\ntools the pointwise logarithmic gradient and Hessian estimates of the density\nfunction and also a new Law of Large Numbers result for the particle system.\nThe logarithmic estimates are derived via the Bernstein method and the\nparabolic maximum principle, while the Law of Large Numbers result comes from\ncrucial observations on the control of moments at the particle level.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
