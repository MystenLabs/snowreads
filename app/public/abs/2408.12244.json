This formalism allows us to account for\ndeviation from equilibrium distribution of both the radiation field and the\nmassive particles. In the present study two-level atoms with broadened upper\nlevel represent the massive particles. In the absence of velocity-changing\ncollisions, we demonstrate the analytic equivalence of the full non-LTE source\nfunction with the corresponding standard non-LTE partial frequency\nredistribution (PFR) model. We present an iterative method based on operator\nsplitting techniques to numerically solve the problem at hand. We benchmark it\nagainst the standard non-LTE transfer problem for a two-level atom with PFR. We\nillustrate the deviation of the velocity distribution function of excited atoms\nfrom the equilibrium distribution. We also discuss the dependence of the\nemission profile and the velocity distribution function on elastic collisions\nand velocity-changing collisions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
