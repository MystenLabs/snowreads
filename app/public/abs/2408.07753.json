By carefully constructing an\naction-augmented MDP that is equivalent to the original MDP, CODA creates a\nfully labeled transition dataset under training contexts without additional\napproximation error. We conduct a novel theoretical analysis to demonstrate\nCODA's capability to solve CGO problems in the offline data setup. Empirical\nresults also showcase the effectiveness of CODA, which outperforms other\nbaseline methods across various context-goal relationships of CGO problem. This\napproach offers a promising direction to solving CGO problems using offline\ndatasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
