This scheme aims to uphold the\nsufficiency rule in fairness by ensuring that optimal predictors maintain\nconsistency across diverse sub-groups. We employ a bilevel formulation to\naddress this challenge, wherein we explore sample reweighting strategies.\nUnlike conventional methods that hinge on model size, our formulation bases\ngeneralization complexity on the space of sample weights. We discretize the\nweights to improve training speed. Empirical validation of our method showcases\nits effectiveness and robustness, revealing a consistent improvement in the\nbalance between prediction performance and fairness metrics across various\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m6xFFvxY-t9FeilcL3zGt4G__CdLNBbTr4bnmKjbz_I","pdfSize":"818678"}
