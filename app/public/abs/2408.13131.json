Traditional methods, such as Marked\nTemporal Point Processes (MTPP), typically use autoregressive models to predict\nmultiple future events. However, these models frequently encounter issues such\nas converging to constant or repetitive outputs, which significantly limits\ntheir effectiveness and applicability. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose DeTPP (Detection-based Temporal Point Processes), a novel approach\ninspired by object detection methods from computer vision. DeTPP utilizes a\nnovel matching-based loss function that selectively focuses on reliably\npredictable events, enhancing both training robustness and inference diversity.\nOur method sets a new state-of-the-art in long-horizon event prediction,\nsignificantly outperforming existing MTPP and next-K approaches. The\nimplementation of DeTPP is publicly available on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
