After adding two\ntechnicalities, we call this complex Homsc(A, B).\n  We prove the following dichotomy: For a fixed finite abstract simplicial\ncomplex B, either Homsc(A, B) is always a disjoint union of contractible spaces\nor every finite CW-complex can be obtained up to a homotopy equivalence as\nHomsc(A, B) by choosing A in a right way.\n  We furthermore show that the first case is equivalent to the existence of a\nnontrivial social choice function and that in this case, the space itself is\nhomotopy equivalent to a discrete set.\n  Secondly, we give a generalization to finite relational structures and show\nthat this dichotomy coincides with a complexity theoretic dichotomy for\nconstraint satisfaction problems, namely in the first case, the problem is in P\nand in the second case NP-complete.
