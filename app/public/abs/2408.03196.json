We incorporated\ndifferent concentrations of BGNs (1%, 2%, and 3% w/v) in collagen hydrogel\n(with a concentration of 3.0 mg/mL). The microfluidic chip's dimensions were\noptimized through fluid flow and mass transfer simulations. Collagen type I\nextracted from rat tail tendons was used as the main material, and BGNs\nsynthesized by the sol-gel method were used to enhance the mechanical\nproperties of the hydrogel. The extracted collagen was characterized using FTIR\nand SDS-PAGE, and BGNs were analyzed using XRD, FTIR, DLS, and FE-SEM/EDX. The\nstructure of the collagen-BGNs hydrogels was examined using SEM, and their\nmechanical properties were determined using rheological analysis. The\ncytotoxicity of BGNs was assessed using the MTT assay, and the viability of\nfibroblast (L929) cells encapsulated in the collagen-BGNs hydrogel inside the\nmicrofluidic device was assessed using a live/dead assay. Based on all these\ntest results, the L929 cells showed high cell viability in vitro and promising\nmicroenvironment mimicry in a microfluidic device. Collagen3-BGNs3 (Collagen 3\nmg/mL + BGNs 3% (w/v)) was chosen as the most suitable sample for further\nresearch on a microfluidic platform.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
