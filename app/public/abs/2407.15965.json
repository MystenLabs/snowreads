Ullrich, Voigtlaender [10] relate non-linear\nsampling numbers for the square norm to quantities involving trigonometric best\n$m-$term approximation errors in the uniform norm. Here we establish new\nresults for sparse trigonometric approximation with respect to the\nhigh-dimensional setting, where the influence of the dimension $d$ has to be\ncontrolled. In particular, we focus on best $m-$term trigonometric\napproximation for (unweighted) Wiener classes in $L_q$ and give precise\nconstants. Our main results are approximation guarantees where the number of\nterms $m$ scales at most quadratic in the inverse accuracy $1/\\varepsilon$.\nProviding a refined version of the classical Nikol'skij inequality we are able\nto extrapolate the $L_q$-result to $L_\\infty$ while limiting the influence of\nthe dimension to a $\\sqrt{d}$-factor and an additonal $\\log$-term in the size\nof the (rectangular) spectrum. This has consequences for the tractable sampling\nrecovery via $\\ell_1$-minimization of functions belonging to certain Besov\nclasses with bounded mixed smoothness. This complements polynomial tractability\nresults recently given by Krieg [12].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
