However, the high coercive field required for polarization switching\nremains a prime obstacle to their practical applications. A notable reduction\nin coercive field has been achieved in ferroelectric Hf(Zr)$_{1+x}$O$_2$ films\nwith interstitial Hf(Zr) dopants [Science 381, 558 (2023)], suggesting a\nless-explored strategy for coercive field optimization. Supported by density\nfunctional theory calculations, we demonstrate the $Pca2_1$ phase, with a\nmoderate concentration of interstitial Hf dopants, serves as a minimal model to\nexplain the experimental observations, rather than the originally assumed\nrhombohedral phase. Large-scale deep potential molecular dynamics simulations\nsuggest that interstitial defects promote the polarization reversal by\nfacilitating $Pbcn$-like mobile 180$^\\circ$ domain walls. A simple pre-poling\ntreatment could reduce the switching field to less than 1 MV/cm and enable\nswitching on a subnanosecond timescale. High-throughput calculations reveal a\nnegative correlation between the switching barrier and dopant size and identify\na few promising interstitial dopants for coercive field reduction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
