Publicly\navailable textual documentation of their meetings provides insight into\nmembers' attitudes about the economy. We use GPT-4 to quantify dissent among\nmembers on the topic of inflation. We find that transcripts and minutes reflect\nthe diversity of member views about the macroeconomic outlook in a way that is\nlost or omitted from the public statements. In fact, diverging opinions that\nshed light upon the committee's \"true\" attitudes are almost entirely omitted\nfrom the final statements. Hence, we argue that forecasting FOMC sentiment\nbased solely on statements will not sufficiently reflect dissent among the\nhawks and doves.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fgnfIWISwVD6fGi6LaPi9G8yGhVvE8PRbTX5iSuvCYI","pdfSize":"2528176"}
