Here, we extend dark\nmatter models containing a Dark Sink to sub-MeV masses. We consider a Dark Sink\nmodel where the dark matter is charged under a light dark photon that has\nkinetic mixing with the Standard Model. For sub-MeV dark matter masses, plasmon\ndecays are the dominant mechanism for transferring energy to the dark sector.\nRelative to a standard freeze-in cosmology, reproducing the observed dark\nmatter density in a Dark Sink structure requires an increase in the dark matter\ncouplings to the Standard Model, and hence increased direct detection cross\nsections. These models provide benchmarks for current and upcoming direct\ndetection experiments. Accounting for plasmon effects, we derive the range of\npossible dark matter masses and cross sections for Dark Sink models in the\nsub-MeV regime. We make code available to reproduce our benchmarks; it may be\nof use for other freeze-in scenarios, including those where plasmon decays to\nthe dark matter are important.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
