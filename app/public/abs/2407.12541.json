The proposed algorithm use only addition,\nsubtraction, logical, and bit shift operations, avoiding the complexities and\nhardware costs associated with multiplication and division. It demonstrates\nconsistent performance across operand sizes ranging from 32-bit to 2048-bit,\naddressing scalability challenges in cryptographic applications. Implemented in\nVerilog HDL and tested on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 family FPGA, the algorithm shows a\npredictable linear scaling of cycle count with bit length difference (BLD),\ndescribed by the equation $y=2x+2$, where $y$ represents the cycle count and\n$x$ represents the BLD. The application of this algorithm in prime number\ncalculation up to 500,000 shows its practical utility and performance\nadvantages. Comprehensive evaluations reveal efficient resource utilization,\nrobust timing performance, and effective power management, making it suitable\nfor high-performance and resource-constrained platforms. The results indicate\nthat the proposed algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of modular\narithmetic operations, with potential implications for cryptographic protocols\nand secure computing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ix-q1NVO4QYt1-E_g5CvO2qECBQZUqsNEwTYaUFR0IE","pdfSize":"1996460"}
