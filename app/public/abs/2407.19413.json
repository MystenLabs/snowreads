We show that the critical Josephson current across the junction\noscillates as the altermagnetic field strength increases. The current-phase\nrelation can be forward- or backward-skewed due to significant second-order\nJosephson response. It decisively depends on the altermagnetic field strength.\nWe discover that the skewness can be manipulated by electric gating. We reveal\ntwo additional impacts of external fields on the Josephson current: (i) Fields\ncan induce 0-$\\pi$ transitions. (ii) Fields can substantially enhance the\ncritical current.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HcyQrPyKNgB05CyvD_HQ6djyhgWVE72vms4l0s61XME","pdfSize":"1876133"}
