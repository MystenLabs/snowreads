To address\nsuch increasing demand for networking to serve AI tasks, we investigate new\nscheduling strategies to improve communication efficiency and test them on a\nprogrammable testbed. We also show relevant challenges and research directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
