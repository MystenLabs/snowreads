Research question: With the growing interest in skin diseases and skin\naesthetics, the ability to predict facial wrinkles is becoming increasingly\nimportant. This study aims to evaluate whether a computational model,\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN), can be trained for automated facial\nwrinkle segmentation. 2. Findings: Our study presents an effective technique\nfor integrating data from multiple annotators and illustrates that transfer\nlearning can enhance performance, resulting in dependable segmentation of\nfacial wrinkles. 3. Meaning: This approach automates intricate and\ntime-consuming tasks of wrinkle analysis with a deep learning framework. It\ncould be used to facilitate skin treatments and diagnostics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
