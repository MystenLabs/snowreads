One characteristic and non-trivial feature\nof its electronic structure is a relatively large electron hopping $t$ between\nnearest neighbor Cu sites with a Cu-O-Cu angle of around 90 degrees. In this\nstudy, we have theoretically pinned down the origin of a large $|t|$ in the\ndouble-chain structure of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\\delta}$ using\nfirst-principles calculation and tight-binding-model analysis. We have found\nthat, in the nearest neighbor hopping $t$, $d$-$d$ and $d$-$p$-$p$-$d$\ncontributions roughly cancel each other out and the $d$-$p$-$d$ hopping path\nenhanced by the local distortion of the double chain is a key to get the large\n$|t|$. Double-well band dispersion arising from the relatively large $|t/t'|$\nallows the enhancement of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity by the\nincipient-band mechanism, where the one band bottom plays a role of the\nincipient valley. Our study provides the important knowledge to understand the\nunique superconductivity in Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\\delta}$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
