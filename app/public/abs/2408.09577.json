It is observed that\nfor the condensate to function as a reservoir, the physical system requires\ndamping. The nonlinearity of the dynamics improves the performance of the\nreservoir, while the reduction in the number of condensed particles degrades\nthe performance.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
