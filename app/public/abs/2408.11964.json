Now we compare the\noriginal success of CLASP with an implementation at a second institution. We\nfind that the original results hold at another institution despite some changes\nto the original curriculum and a somewhat different student population. We find\nthat students who take CLASP are 1) less likely to drop, 2) less likely to\nfail, and 3) do as well in later coursework when compared to students who took\nthe courses that CLASP replaced, even if that coursework is not similarly\nreformed. We find the above items to be independently true for historically\nmarginalized students and remarkably, also find that 4) marginalized students\nwho take CLASP are more likely to graduate from a STEM field. We use a course\ndeficit model perspective to examine these results, and discuss some of the\nfactors that may have contributed to this success. We argue that higher\neducation has the tools they need to significantly increase equity, and improve\nstudent success and retention.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
