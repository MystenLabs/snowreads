As a case study, we present a\ncomprehensive analysis of regulatory motifs in the connectome of the model\norganism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Leveraging the Efficient Subgraph\nCounting Algorithmic PackagE (ESCAPE) algorithm, we identify network motifs in\nthe multi-layer nervous system of C. elegans and link them to functional\ncircuits. We further investigate motif enrichment within signal pathways and\nbenchmark our findings with random networks of similar size and link density.\nOur findings provide valuable insights into the organization of the nerve net\nof this well documented organism and can be easily transferred to other species\nand disciplines alike.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
