It is\nwell-known that real data, including real matrix-variate data, often exhibit\nhigh levels of asymmetry. To address this issue, one common approach is to\nintroduce a tail or skewness parameter to a symmetric distribution. In this\nregard, we introduced here a new distribution called the matrix-variate skew t\ndistribution (MVST), which provides flexibility in terms of heavy tail and\nskewness. We then conduct a thorough investigation of various characterizations\nand probabilistic properties of the MVST distribution. We also explore\nextensions of this distribution to a finite mixture model. To estimate the\nparameters of the MVST distribution, we develop an efficient EM-type algorithm\nthat computes maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the model parameters. To\nvalidate the effectiveness and usefulness of the developed models and\nassociated methods, we perform empirical experiments using simulated data as\nwell as three real data examples. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the\ndeveloped approach in handling asymmetric matrix-variate data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jz1hnS2Y02gwNIN7pa6KI4MO-qiWGcIAInFMsPKde10","pdfSize":"215459"}
