They introduce and review fundamental theorems\nand principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle\nphysics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination.\nNumerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in\ndetail, including $H\\to b\\bar b$ identification in fixed-order perturbation\ntheory, generic one-versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power\ncounting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming\nthe central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment\nexpansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet\ndiscrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive,\ninfrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to\nincluding measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented\nhere are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being\na parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon\ndiscrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are\nsimultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
