However, such manipulation through contacts using the whole surface of\nthe body remains extremely challenging to achieve on robots. This can be\nlabelled as Whole-Body Contact-Rich Manipulation (WBCRM) problem. In addition\nto the high-dimensionality of the Contact-Rich Manipulation problem due to the\ncombinatorics of contact modes, admitting contact creation anywhere on the body\nsurface adds complexity, which hinders planning of manipulation within a\nreasonable time. We address this computational problem by formulating the\ncontact and motion planning of planar WBCRM as hierarchical continuous\noptimization problems. To enable this formulation, we propose a novel\ncontinuous explicit representation of the robot surface, that we believe to be\nfoundational for future research using continuous optimization for WBCRM. Our\nresults demonstrate a significant improvement of convergence, planning time and\nfeasibility - with, on the average, 99% less iterations and 96% reduction in\ntime to find a solution over considered scenarios, without recourse to\nprone-to-failure trajectory refinement steps.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
