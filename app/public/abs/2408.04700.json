Such DM induces\ntemporal variation in various fundamental constants, which in turn causes time\nmodulation of the nuclear transition energies. When a M\\\"ossbauer source and\nabsorber is separated by a large baseline, the DM induced shift between their\nenergy levels can be tested by the modulation of the photon absorption\nspectrum. The narrow M\\\"ossbauer transitions allow the setup to efficiently\nprobe DM in the high frequency range. We show that the reach of a M\\\"ossbauer\nexperiment with the existing synchrotron beams is at par with the bounds from\nvarious equivalence principle violation searches. An improvement of the\nsynchrotron setup would enable us to probe the hitherto uncharted territory of\nthe DM parameter space upto MHz frequency. The proposed method would extend the\nDM search beyond the EP limit by several orders of magnitude, and would provide\nthe best bound on DM interaction strength with various standard model fields in\nthe high ($>$kHz) frequency region.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
