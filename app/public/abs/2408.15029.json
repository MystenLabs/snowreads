The relativistic coupled-cluster approach is\nused in the calculations and a thorough uncertainty analysis is performed to\ngive accurate and reliable uncertainties to the obtained values. Furthermore,\nan in-depth investigation of the different electronic structure effects that\ndetermine the magnitude of the calculated enhancement factors is carried out,\nand two different schemes for computing $W_\\mathrm{d}$ are compared. The\nrecommended values for the enhancement factors are\n$(13.24\\pm0.03)\\times10^{24}\\frac{h\\,\\text{Hz}}{e\\,\\text{cm}}$,\n$(12.15\\pm0.08)\\times10^{24}\\frac{h\\,\\text{Hz}}{e\\,\\text{cm}}$ and\n$(2.13\\pm0.28)\\times10^{24}\\frac{h\\,\\text{Hz}}{e\\,\\text{cm}}$ for\n$W_\\mathrm{d}$, and $(-48.36\\pm0.18)\\;h\\,\\text{kHz}$,\n$(-45.51\\pm0.43)\\;h\\,\\text{kHz}$ and $(5.31\\pm1.80)\\;h\\,\\text{kHz}$ for\n$W_\\mathrm{s}$, for YbCu, YbAg and YbAu, respectively.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
