It's a\nway of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time.\nThe process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as\nvelocity, acceleration and jerk. The process deals with how the robot can\nfollow a desired motion path in a suitable environment. This trajectory\nplanning is extensively used in Automobile Industrial Robot, Manipulators, and\nMobile Robots. Trajectory planning is a fundamental component of motion control\nsystems. To perform tasks like pick and place operations, assembly, welding,\npainting, path following, and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces a\ncomparative analysis of trajectory planning algorithms and their key software\nelements working strategy in complex and dynamic environments. Adaptability and\nreal-time analysis are the most common problems in trajectory planning. The\npaper primarily focuses on getting a better understanding of these\nunpredictable environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
