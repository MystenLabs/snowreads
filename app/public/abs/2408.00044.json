Our goal is the study of mergers of\ncompact objects in the strong field regime where non-linear dynamics manifest\nand deviations from General Relativity could be found. We develop a new\nformulation of the Einstein equations in d+1 spacetime dimensions in the moving\npunctures approach, which leads to a well-posed set of equations for the\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EGB), as well as for the most general\nparity-invariant scalar-tensor theory of gravity up to four derivatives\n(4$\\partial$ST). Using this formulation, we have implemented the equations of\nthe 4$\\partial$ST theory in GRFolres, an open-source extension of our numerical\nrelativity code GRChombo. This has enabled us to evolve equal and unequal-mass\nBinary Black Hole mergers in this effective field theory of gravity, as well as\nto study the loss of hyperbolicity and its relation to the weak coupling\ncondition, among other topics of interest left for further study.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
