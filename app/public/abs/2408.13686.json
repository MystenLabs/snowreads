ADS are complex and difficult to test:\nthey receive input data from multiple sensors and make decisions using a\ncombination of multiple deep neural network models and code logic. The safety\nof ADS is of utmost importance as their misbehavior can result in costly\ncatastrophes, including the loss of human life. In this work, we propose SimsV,\nwhich performs system-level testing on multi-module ADS. SimsV targets\nperception failures of ADS and further assesses the impact of perception\nfailure on the system as a whole. SimsV leverages a high-fidelity simulator for\ntest input and oracle generation by continuously applying predefined mutation\noperators. In addition, SimsV leverages various metrics to guide the testing\nprocess. We implemented a prototype SimsV for testing a commercial-grade Level\n4 ADS (i.e., Apollo) using a popular open-source driving platform simulator.\nOur evaluation shows that SimsV is capable of finding weaknesses in the\nperception of Apollo. Furthermore, we show that by exploiting such weakness,\nSimsV finds severe problems in Apollo, including collisions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
