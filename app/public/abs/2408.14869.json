More precisely, we identify a diffusive\nspectral stability assumption, prove that it implies nonlinear stability and\nprovide a sharp asymptotic description of the dynamics resulting from both\nlocalized and critically nonlocalized perturbations. In particular, we show\nthat the long-time behavior is governed at leading order by a second-order\nWhitham modulation system and elucidate how the intertwining of diffusive and\ndispersive effects may enhance decay rates. The latter requires a non trivial\nextension of the large-time estimates for constant-coefficient\nhyperbolic-parabolic operators to some classes of systems with no particular\nstructure, including on one hand systems with a scalar-like - but not scalar -\nhyperbolic part and a cross-diffusion, and on the other hand anisotropic\nsystems with dispersion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
