{"id":"2408.05664","title":"Training an NLP Scholar at a Small Liberal Arts College: A Backwards\n  Designed Course Proposal","authors":"Grusha Prasad and Forrest Davis","authorsParsed":[["Prasad","Grusha",""],["Davis","Forrest",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2024 00:50:59 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-13","timestamp":1723337459000,"abstract":"  The rapid growth in natural language processing (NLP) over the last couple\nyears has generated student interest and excitement in learning more about the\nfield. In this paper, we present two types of students that NLP courses might\nwant to train. First, an \"NLP engineer\" who is able to flexibly design, build\nand apply new technologies in NLP for a wide range of tasks. Second, an \"NLP\nscholar\" who is able to pose, refine and answer questions in NLP and how it\nrelates to the society, while also learning to effectively communicate these\nanswers to a broader audience. While these two types of skills are not mutually\nexclusive -- NLP engineers should be able to think critically, and NLP scholars\nshould be able to build systems -- we think that courses can differ in the\nbalance of these skills. As educators at Small Liberal Arts Colleges, the\nstrengths of our students and our institution favors an approach that is better\nsuited to train NLP scholars. In this paper we articulate what kinds of skills\nan NLP scholar should have, and then adopt a backwards design to propose course\ncomponents that can aid the acquisition of these skills.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
