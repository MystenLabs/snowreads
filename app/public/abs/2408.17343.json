The watchmen may be required to see the whole polygon, or some\npre-determined quota of area within the polygon, and we want to minimize the\nmaximum length traveled by any watchman. While the single watchman version of\nthe problem has received much attention is rather well understood, it is not\nthe case for multiple watchmen version.\n  We provide the first tight approximability results for the anchored\n$k$-\\textsc{Watchman Routes} problem in a simple polygon, assuming $k$ is\nfixed, by a fully-polynomial time approximation scheme. The basis for the FPTAS\nis provided by an exact dynamic programming algorithm. If $k$ is a variable, we\ngive constant-factor approximations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BeD-Vhe7jQG-pHVaOYg89Jb-Yt0PDK69rVWuD1uVlBs","pdfSize":"623565"}
