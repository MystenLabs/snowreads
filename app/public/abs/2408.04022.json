Specifically, we study 2 + 1 orbital\nand 3 + 2 orbital (i.e. t2g + eg ) models on a Bethe lattice with a crystal\nfield that is set so that the higher lying orbitals are nearly empty at low\ntemperatures but get a non-negligible occupancy at elevated temperature. The\nhigh temperature regime is characterized by thermal activation of carriers\nleading to higher magnetic response (i.e., thermally induced low-spin to\nhigh-spin transition) and substantial influence on resistivity, where one can\ndistinguish two counteracting effects: increased scattering due to formation of\nhigh spin and increased scattering phase space on one hand, and additional\nparallel conduction channel on the other. The former effect is stronger and one\nmay identify cases where resistivity increases by a factor of three at high\ntemperatures even though the occupancy of the unoccupied band remains small (<\n10%). We discuss implications of our findings for transport properties of\ncorrelated materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
