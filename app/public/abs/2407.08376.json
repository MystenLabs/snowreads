In this problem, $m$ identical\nmachines and the optimal makespan are given. The load of a machine is the total\nsize of all the jobs assigned to it and the makespan is the maximum load of all\nthe machines. Jobs arrive online and the goal is to assign each job to a\nmachine while staying within a small factor (the competitive ratio) of the\noptimal makespan. We present an algorithm that maintains a competitive ratio of\n$139/93<1.495$ for sufficiently large values of $m$, improving the previous\nbound of $3/2$. The value 3/2 represents a natural bound for this problem: as\nlong as the online bins are of size at least $3/2$ of the offline bin, all\nitems that fit at least two times in an offline bin have two nice properties.\nThey fit three times in an online bin and a single such item can be packed\ntogether with an item of any size in an online bin. These properties are now\nboth lost, which means that putting even one job on a wrong machine can leave\nsome job unassigned at the end. It also makes it harder to determine good\nthresholds for the item types. This was one of the main technical issues in\ngetting below $3/2$. The analysis consists of an intricate mixture of size and\nweight arguments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
