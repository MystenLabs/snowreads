We perform this expansion to next-to-leading order in\n$1/c^2$ and relate our results to known descriptions of non-relativistic open\nstrings obtained by taking limits. Just as for closed strings the\nnon-relativistic expansion is well-defined if the open string winds a circle in\nthe target space. This direction must satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions. It\nis shown that the endpoints of the open string behave as Bargmann particles in\nthe non-relativistic regime. These open strings end on nrD$p$-branes with $p\\le\n24$. When these nrD$p$-branes do not fluctuate they correspond to\n$(p+1)$-dimensional Newton--Cartan submanifolds of the target space. When we\ninclude fluctuations and worldvolume gauge fields their dynamics is described\nby a non-relativistic version of the DBI action whose form we derive from\nsymmetry considerations. The worldvolume gauge field and scalar field of a\nnrD$24$-brane make up the field content of Galilean electrodynamics (GED), and\nthe effective theory on the nrD$24$-brane is precisely a non-linear version of\nGED. We generalise these results to actions for any nrD$p$-brane by demanding\nthat they have the same target space gauge symmetries that the non-relativistic\nopen and closed string actions have. Finally, we show that the nrD$p$-brane\naction is transverse T-duality covariant. Our results agree with the findings\nof Gomis, Yan and Yu in arXiv:2007.01886.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
