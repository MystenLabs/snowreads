As quantum systems grow in\nsize, new ways to characterize them are needed to show the quality of their\nqubits, gates, and how noise affects them. In this work, we explore the\ncapabilities of CS for reconstructing density state operators of sections of\nquantum devices to make a diagnostic of their qubits quality. We introduce\nzero-entropy classical shadow (ZECS), a methodology that focuses on\nreconstructing a positive semidefinite and unit trace density state operator\nusing the CS information. This procedure makes a reliable reconstruction of the\ndensity state operator removing partially the errors associated with a limited\nsampling and quantum device noise. It gives a threshold of the maximum coherent\ninformation that qubits on a quantum device have. We test ZECS on ibm_lagos and\nibm_brisbane using up to 10,000 shots. We show that with only 6,000 shots, we\ncan make a diagnostic of the properties of groups of 2, 3, and 4 qubits on the\n127-qubits ibm_brisbane device. We show two applications of ZECS: as a routing\ntechnique and as a detector for non-local noisy correlations. In the routing\ntechnique, an optimal set of 20 ibm_brisbane qubits is selected based on the\nZECS procedure and used for a quantum optimization application. This method\nimproves the solution quality by 10% and extends the quantum algorithm's\nlifetime by 33% when compared to the qubits chosen by the best transpilation\nprocedure in Qiskit. Additionally, with the detector of non-local correlations,\nwe identify regions of ibm\\_brisbane that are not directly connected but have a\nstrong correlation that maintains in time, suggesting some non-local crosstalk\nthat can come, for example, at the multiplexing readout stage.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mss6fiqXCQ3QGZpIas5kcwiP9lNzl3R5Ctayv1WCFME","pdfSize":"2743126"}
