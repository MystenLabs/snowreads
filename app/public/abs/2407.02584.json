In this paper,\nwe present the first post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the orbital dynamics of\na binary system containing objects whose tidal interactions have a dissipative\ncontribution. We derive the 1PN-accurate equations of motion in the\ncenter-of-mass frame and a generalized energy-balance law that is valid for\ndissipative tidal interactions. We show how mass and energy loss due to the\nabsorption of orbital energy change the orbital dynamics and derive the\nnext-to-leading order correction to the gravitational wave phase of a binary\nsystem in a quasi-circular orbit containing initially non-spinning components.\nWe then use this waveform model to constrain, for the first time, the\nindividual dissipative tidal deformabilities of each of the binary components\nthat generated the GW170817 event using real data. We find that the GW170817\ndata requires $\\Xi_{1} \\lesssim 1121$ and $\\Xi_{2} \\lesssim 1692$ at 90\\%\nconfidence, where $\\Xi_{1,2}$ are the individual tidal deformabilities of the\nprimary and secondary binary components that produced the GW170817 event.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
