It provides a flexible and extendable framework for compartment\nmodels and includes robust and unified estimators for parameter fitting and\nuncertainty quantification. The package incorporates several established models\nfrom the literature, such as the spherical mean technique and soma and neurite\ndensity imaging (SANDI), along with their extensions for analyzing combined\ndiffusion and T2 mapping data acquired at multiple echo times. For parameter\nestimation, it features methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling\nand Monte Carlo dropout with neural networks, which provide probabilistic\nestimates by approximating the posteriors of modelling parameters.\nMicrostructure.jl is applicable to both in vivo and ex vivo imaging data. We\nare currently testing and optimizing the package and are pleased to share its\nmajor functionalities, design, and documentation progress.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
