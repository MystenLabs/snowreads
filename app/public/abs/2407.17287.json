Vehicular services can be developed to support these adaptations.\nHowever, the increasing complexity of vehicular service development, even with\ncurrent standardizations and best practices and guidelines, are insufficient to\ntackle the high complexity of development, with expectations of up to 1 (U.S.)\nbillion lines of code for a fully (level 5) autonomous vehicle. Within this\nsurvey, the paradigm of Deterministic Software Defined Vehicles is explored\ntowards increasing the quality and easiness of the development of services for\nautomotive. Towards this, a proposed vision with four pillars is also provided:\nthe deterministic network configurator, the data layer configurator, and the\nhypervisor configurator and the vehicle abstraction layer, all coordinated by a\nsoftware orchestrator.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-IZE2mbK_ZCQGWIjLGiI51NZO69mgqTYmr5U04TNIRQ","pdfSize":"13920428"}
