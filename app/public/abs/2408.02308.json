Described by the effective\nHamiltonian, the mechanical energy is found to be directly converted into the\noutput photons through a three-wave-mixing mechanism. It is dramatically\ndistinct from the quantum simulation of a parametric DCE in such as\nsuperconducting circuits. Using a master-equation approach, we analyze the\nsystem dynamics in various regimes with respect to the ratio of the effective\ncoupling strength and the loss rate of the system. The dynamics under the\nstrong-coupling regime confirms various three-wave-mixing process for creating\nphotons by annihilation of the mechanical and atomic excitations. And that\nunder the weak-coupling regime demonstrates the continuous production of\nphotons by driving both mechanical oscillator and atom. By virtue of the\ntwo-level system, our method avoids the rigorous requirement for the\nhigh-frequency mechanical oscillator, that was demanded in standard DCE under\nthe double-photon resonance. It is found that the mechanical frequency can be\nabout two orders of magnitude smaller than the output photons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fv33TaYVGniJymReSYWsBOCSY5OOvGifE4c8AfglSp0","pdfSize":"580021"}
