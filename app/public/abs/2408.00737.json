Strong confinement promotes the out-of-plane spatial wave functions\nto a discrete, gapped orbital degree of freedom. Exchange-antisymmetric orbital\npair wave functions are predicted to give rise to low-energy q2D interactions\nwith $s$-wave symmetry. Using radiofrequency (rf) spectroscopy, we observe the\nsignature power-law scaling and the dimensional-crossover feature anticipated\nfor the emergent $s$-wave channel. Additionally, we demonstrate that two types\nof low-energy dimers, with either $s$-wave and $p$-wave symmetry, could be\nformed via rf spin-flip association from an orbital mixture. These findings\nillustrate how gapped orbital degrees of freedom can provide additional control\nover scattering symmetries in strongly confined ultracold gases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FofSkhCQHuvzKa4APaRKZDZ1SUY3ZpTEOVKuwmMkEsk","pdfSize":"1968864"}
