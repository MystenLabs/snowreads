The expectation value, viewed as the\ntransition amplitude for states in the defect theories forming representations\nof the affine Yangian of $\\mathfrak{gl}(1)$, satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation\nand is thus interpreted as an R-matrix. To achieve this, we identify the\nrepresentations associated with the line and surface defects by calculating the\noperator product expansions (OPEs) of local operators on the defects, as\nconditions that anomalous Feynman diagrams cancel each other. We then evaluate\nthe expectation value of the defect intersection using Feynman diagrams. When\nthe line and surface defects are specified, we demonstrate that the expectation\nvalue precisely matches the Miura operators and their products.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
