These measures differ\nfrom existing measures, which use volumes and are easy to calculate. Some\ntheoretical justification is given, followed by experiments illustrating that\nthey are reasonable measures of these distributional characteristics and\ncomputing confidence regions with the desired coverage.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
