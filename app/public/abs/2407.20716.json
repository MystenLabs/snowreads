These bright pulses exist in the\nnormal dispersion regime, yet they do not correspond to the usual scenario of\ndomain wall locking that induces complex shape multi-stability, weak stability\nas well as a reduced domain of existence. The new states are observed beyond\nthe mean-field limit and out of the bistable region. Their shape is uniquely\ndefined, with peak intensities beyond that of the upper steady state, and they\nare stable over a broad range of the injection field, highlighting their\npotential for optical frequency comb generation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
