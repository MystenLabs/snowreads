While all vertex-transitive graphs are necessarily\nvertex-girth-regular, the majority of vertex-girth-regular graphs are not\nvertex-transitive. Similarly, while many of the smallest $k$-regular graphs of\ngirth $g$, the so-called $(k,g)$-cages, are vertex-girth-regular, infinitely\nmany vertex-girth-regular graphs of degree $k$ and girth $g$ exist for many\npairs $k,g$. Due to these connections, the study of vertex-girth-regular graphs\npromises insights into the relations between the classes of extremal, highly\nsymmetric, and locally regular graphs of given degree and girth. This paper\nlays the foundation to such study by investigating the fundamental properties\nof $vgr(v,k,g,\\lambda)$-graphs, specifically the relations necessarily\nsatisfied by the parameters $v,k,g$ and $\\lambda$ to admit the existence of a\ncorresponding vertex-girth-regular graph, by presenting constructions of\ninfinite families of $vgr(v,k,g,\\lambda)$-graphs, and by establishing lower\nbounds on the number $v$ of vertices in a $vgr(v,k,g,\\lambda)$-graph. It also\nincludes computational results determining the orders of smallest cubic and\nquartic graphs of small girths.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
