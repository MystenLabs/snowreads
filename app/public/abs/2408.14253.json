Therefore, large-scale datasets\nare necessary to apply deep learning methods. Instance augmentation has emerged\nas an efficient method to increase dataset diversity. However, current methods\nrequire the time-consuming curation of 3D models or costly manual data\nannotation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Text3DAug, a novel\napproach leveraging generative models for instance augmentation. Text3DAug does\nnot depend on labeled data and is the first of its kind to generate instances\nand annotations from text. This allows for a fully automated pipeline,\neliminating the need for manual effort in practical applications. Additionally,\nText3DAug is sensor agnostic and can be applied regardless of the LiDAR sensor\nused. Comprehensive experimental analysis on LiDAR segmentation, detection and\nnovel class discovery demonstrates that Text3DAug is effective in supplementing\nexisting methods or as a standalone method, performing on par or better than\nestablished methods, however while overcoming their specific drawbacks. The\ncode is publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
