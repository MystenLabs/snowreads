For the single-period\nsecurities model, we give a novel definition of arbitrage sure. Focusing on the\nfinancial market with short sales prohibitions, we separately investigate the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for no-arbitrage asset pricing based on\nnonlinear expectation which composed with a family of probability. When each\nlinear expectation driven by the probability in the family of probability\nbecomes martingale measure, the necessary and sufficient conditions are same,\nand coincide with the existing results. Furthermore, we expand the main results\nof single-period securities model to the case of multi-period securities model.\nBy-product, we obtain the superhedging prices of contingent claim under model\nuncertainty.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
