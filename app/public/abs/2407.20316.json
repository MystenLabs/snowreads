We conjecture that in\nany infinite-distance limit in the moduli space of a $d$-dimensional quantum\ngravity theory, among the set of particle towers and fundamental branes with at\nmost $p_\\text{max}\\leq d-2$ spacetime dimensions, at least one has mass/tension\ndecreasing exponentially $T\\sim \\exp(-\\alpha\\Delta)$ with the moduli space\ndistance $\\Delta$ at a rate of at least $\\alpha\\geq 1/\\sqrt{d-p_\\text{max}-1}$.\nSince $p_\\text{max}$ can vary, this represents multiple conditions, where the\nSharpened Distance Conjecture is the $p_\\text{max}=1$ case. This conjecture is\na necessary condition imposed on higher-dimensional theories in order for the\nSharpened Distance Conjecture to hold in lower-dimensional theories. We test\nour conjecture in theories with maximal and half-maximal supersymmetry in\ndiverse dimensions, finding that it is satisfied and often saturated. In some\ncases where it is saturated -- most notably, heterotic string theory in 10\ndimensions -- we argue that novel, low-tension non-supersymmetric branes must\nexist. We also identify patterns relating the rates at which various brane\ntensions vary in infinite-distance limits and relate these tensions to the\nspecies scale.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
