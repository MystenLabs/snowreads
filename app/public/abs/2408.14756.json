However,\nthese models often suffer from unstable training and require extensive\nhyperparameter tuning, leading to practical limitations. Although foundation\nmodels present a potential solution, their use in time series is limited. To\novercome these issues, we propose an innovative image-based, training-free\ntime-series anomaly detection (ITF-TAD) approach. ITF-TAD converts time-series\ndata into images using wavelet transform and compresses them into a single\nrepresentation, leveraging image foundation models for anomaly detection. This\napproach achieves high-performance anomaly detection without unstable neural\nnetwork training or hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, ITF-TAD identifies\nanomalies across different frequencies, providing users with a detailed\nvisualization of anomalies and their corresponding frequencies. Comprehensive\nexperiments on five benchmark datasets, including univariate and multivariate\ntime series, demonstrate that ITF-TAD offers a practical and effective solution\nwith performance exceeding or comparable to that of deep models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
