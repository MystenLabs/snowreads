Focusing on the regime of large applied magnetic field, we discuss\ntwo distinct but related disorder-induced phenomena, namely spin textures in\nthe vicinity of isolated impurities and magnetic excitations below the bulk\ngap. A finite impurity concentration smears the field-tuned phase transition\nand turns the isolated in-gap states into impurity bands. As a result, there is\na large field regime above the bulk transition into the high-field phase where\nimpurity-induced states fill the bulk spin gap. We illustrate the field\ndependence of these in-gap states for parameters relevant for\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and we connect our results to heat-transport and NMR data\nwhich indicated their presence.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4Gqz2c-knxTvj3G9kVGAbEG0vzmINaeOnVQXD_5H8j8","pdfSize":"21786821"}
