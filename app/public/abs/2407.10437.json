We adopt the coupled framework of\nDyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations within a contact interaction, and\nemploy a novel approach to the dressed amputated meson-meson scattering\namplitude which makes connection with the energy-momentum tensor and with the\nGFFs. The resulting GFFs fulfill the anticipated symmetry constraints. The\ncorresponding charge and mass radii and the $D-$term are also computed. We show\nthat the $D-$term for the pseudoscalar mesons is bounded within the $(-1,\n-1/3)$ range; these bounds correspond to the massless (chiral limit) and\ninfinitely massive cases, respectively. Considering the current interest in the\nGFFs, understanding the \\textit{D}-term of pseudoscalar mesons and their GFFs\ncan provide an important first step for future endeavors in the field.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
