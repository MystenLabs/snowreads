It is also essential to the formation of\nultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs). There have been lively investigations on\nthe MB mechanism(s) in both single stars and close binaries including\ncataclysmic variables and neutron star (NS) LMXBs, but with diverse\nconclusions. In this paper we explore the effect of MB on the black hole (BH)\nLMXB evolution. We combine binary population synthesis with detailed binary\nevolution to obtain the expected properties of Galactic BH LMXB population. The\nsimulated results are compared with the observational data including the BH\nmass, companion mass, companion temperature, orbital period, and mean accretion\nrate. Our results reveal that the MB laws with relatively low efficiency (i.e.,\nRM12 and RVJ83) exhibit better agreement with observations, contrary to what\nwas found for NS LMXBs. This raises the interesting question about whether MB\nreally follows the same unified law in different types of binaries. We also\npredict that only a very small fraction ($\\lesssim 2.5\\%$) of BH LMXBs can\nevolve to be UCXBs. This explains why there is no BH UCXB discovered by far.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
