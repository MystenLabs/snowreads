As an input,\nthe objective function and the weak form of the problem have to be specified\nonly once. This ensures consistency between the simulation code and its\ndocumentation. In particular, AutoFreeFem provides the linearization of the\nstate equation, the adjoint problem, the shape derivative, as well as a basic\nimplementation of the level-set based mesh evolution method for shape\noptimization. For the computation of shape derivatives we utilize the\nmathematical Lagrangian approach for differentiating PDE-constrained shape\nfunctions. Differentiation is done symbolically using Sympy. In numerical\nexperiments we verify the accuracy of the computed derivatives. Finally, we\nshowcase the capabilities of AutoFreeFem by considering shape optimization of a\nnon-linear diffusion problem, linear and non-linear elasticity problems, a\nthermo-elasticity problem and a fluid-structure interaction problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7X3bQC_5eOOU-YkiBcnWRTjlEvrnsNfqW8GSVCHZmX8","pdfSize":"1922702"}
