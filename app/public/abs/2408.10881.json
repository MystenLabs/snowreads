Our idea is based on first finding a small\nset with no solutions and then enlarging it to arbitrary size using a\nmulti-dimensional construction, crucially assuming the equation in primitive.\nWe start by presenting the technique on some new equations. Then we use it to\nshow that a symmetric equation with randomly chosen coefficients has a\nnear-optimal set with no non-trivial solutions. We also show a construction for\na wide class of symmetric equation in 6 variables. In the final section we\npresent a couple of remarks on non-symmetric equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
