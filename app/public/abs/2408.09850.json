Our study reveals that\nthe squeezed reservoir induces a stable limit cycle in the TLS, enhancing the\nquantum phase synchronization. We utilize the Husimi $Q$-function to describe\nthe phase portrait of the driven TLS, and the $S$-function to quantitatively\nillustrate the effects of signal strength and detuning on phase\nsynchronization. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the squeezed reservoir imparts\nits squeezing characteristics to the TLS, leading to a more localized and\npronounced synchronization. Additionally, we observe typical features of the\nArnold tongue in the synchronization regions. The experimental feasibility of\nour findings is discussed in the context of a circuit QED system, suggesting\nthat squeezed-reservoir engineering is an effective approach for achieving\nquantum phase synchronization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mfYgjWbrVY_MXP1IWB7B8EaKOec1SeqYF-B41vrrM4U","pdfSize":"11594278"}
