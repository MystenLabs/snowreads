Our techniques are based on the Hitchin correspondence and\nHiggs bundles.\n  For the first kind our results determine the gonality sequence, when the rank\nof the linear system is much smaller than the genus. For this the curve and the\nbranch divisor are assumed to be general. In the second case we compute\ndimensions of the finer splitting loci if these spaces are non-empty. We\ncompare this result with the existing literature about general curves with a\nfixed gonality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Suh2Z2IlDTfexIQE7vhup0riLz3IHUHDqvb0fOIpcxU","pdfSize":"230123"}
