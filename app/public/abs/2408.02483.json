The\ntechniques developed around MIMO communication systems not only brought\nunprecedented advancements in the communication rates but also substantially\nimproved the reliability of communication, measured by low error rates. Here,\nwe explore the same ideas in the paradigm of quantum MIMO communication.\nSpecifically, we utilize approximate quantum cloning to transmit multiple\ncopies of the same quantum state over a MIMO channel that incorporates\ncrosstalk, losses, and depolarizing noise. With this strategy, we find an\nachievable tradeoff between the average fidelity and communication rate over\nthis MIMO setup.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aVOqz1KDs6guxTHb51oqFhtyJJdPqqAukg2ds7T3-dw","pdfSize":"728921","txDigest":"4wiYqRGeaarksoTqbHXN54oPTvTSNVk6QFnApxgtMAsP","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
