It operates by linking individuals with genetically\nsimilar viral sequences, which forms a network. A major limitation of MHS is\nthat it depends on sequence collection, which very rarely covers the entire\npopulation of interest. Ignoring missing data by conducting complete case\nanalysis--which assumes that the observed network is complete--has been shown\nto result in significantly biased estimates of network properties. We use MHS\nto investigate disease dynamics of the HIV epidemic in Miami-Dade County (MDC)\namong men who have sex with men (MSM)--only 30.1% have a reported sequence. To\ndo so, we present an approach for making Bayesian inferences on partially\nobserved networks. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate a reduction in\nerror of 43%-63% between our estimates and complete case analyses. We estimate\nincreased mixing between MSM communities in MDC, defined by race and\ntransmission risk compared to the results based on complete case analysis. Our\napproach makes use of a flexible network model--congruence class model--to\novercome the high computational burden of previously reported Bayesian\napproaches to estimate network properties from partially observed networks.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
