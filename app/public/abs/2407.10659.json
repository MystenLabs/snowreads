The\ntest utilizes the fact that volatility is rough if and only if volatility\nincrements are negatively autocorrelated at high frequencies. It is based on\nthe sample autocovariance of increments of spot volatility estimates computed\nfrom high-frequency asset return data. By showing a feasible CLT for this\nstatistic under the null hypothesis of semimartingale volatility paths, we\nconstruct a test with fixed asymptotic size and an asymptotic power equal to\none. The test is derived under very general conditions for the data-generating\nprocess. In particular, it is robust to jumps with arbitrary activity and to\nthe presence of market microstructure noise. In an application of the test to\nSPY high-frequency data, we find evidence for rough volatility.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Economics/Econometrics","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
