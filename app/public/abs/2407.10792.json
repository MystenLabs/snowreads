These varieties were introduced in recent work by\nGriffin-Levinson-Woo to give a geometric realization of a symmetric function\nappearing in the Delta conjecture by Haglund-Remmel-Wilson. We provide an\nexplicit and combinatorial description of the irreducible components of the\ntwo-row $\\Delta$-Springer variety and compare it to the ordinary two-row\nSpringer fiber as well as Kato's exotic Springer fiber corresponding to a\none-row bipartition. In addition to that, we extend the action of the symmetric\ngroup on the homology of the two-row $\\Delta$-Springer variety to an action of\na degenerate affine Hecke algebra and relate this action to a\n$\\mathfrak{gl}_{2}$-tensor space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
