We summarize the\nstatus of the project and we present its most important results. The\nVillafranca project has been used to produce a new astrometric calibration for\n$Gaia$ (E)DR3, which improves the previous one significantly for bright stars.\nWe have discovered that dynamical interactions among massive stars at a very\nyoung age ($\\sim$1 Ma or less) can play a significant interaction in the\ndynamical evolution of clusters. As a consequence, our current view of the\nmassive-star IMF may be distorted and the number of free-floating neutron stars\nand black holes higher than previously considered.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
