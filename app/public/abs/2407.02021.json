These were\nproven in SGA3 for the special case of semilocal rings. We apply these results\nto establish cancellation theorems for hermitian and quadratic forms over\nLG-rings and show that the Brauer classes of Azumaya algebras over connected\nLG-rings have a unique representative and allow Brauer decomposition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
