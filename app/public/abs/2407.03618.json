BM25S achieves up to a 500x speedup compared\nto the most popular Python-based framework by eagerly computing BM25 scores\nduring indexing and storing them into sparse matrices. It also achieves\nconsiderable speedups compared to highly optimized Java-based implementations,\nwhich are used by popular commercial products. Finally, BM25S reproduces the\nexact implementation of five BM25 variants based on Kamphuis et al. (2020) by\nextending eager scoring to non-sparse variants using a novel score shifting\nmethod.
