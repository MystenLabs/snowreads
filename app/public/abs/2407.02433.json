This morphing is\nobtained by deforming a reference shape, through the resolution of a sequence\nof linear elasticity equations, onto the target shape. In particular, our\napproach does not assume any knowledge of a boundary parametrization.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate how constraints can be imposed on specific points,\nlines and surfaces in the reference domain to ensure alignment with their\ncounterparts in the target domain after morphing. Additionally, we show how the\nproposed methodology can be integrated in an offline and online paradigm, which\nis useful in reduced-order modeling scenarii involving variable shapes. This\nframework facilitates the efficient computation of the morphings in various\ngeometric configurations, thus improving the versatility and applicability of\nthe approach. The methodology is illustrated on the regression problem of the\ndrag and lift coefficients of airfoils of non-parameterized variable shapes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
