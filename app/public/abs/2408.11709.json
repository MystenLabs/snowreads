To explore dense gluon systems and uncover\nthe origins of nucleon mass and spin, the EIC will operate at high beam\ncurrents and luminosities. However, this approach raises beam-induced\nbackground rates, notably from synchrotron radiation (SR), which poses\nsignificant challenges to the performance and longevity of the\nElectron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) general-purpose spectrometer placed at the\ninteraction point (IP).\n  This paper presents a newly developed Monte-Carlo simulation framework for\naccurately modeling SR backgrounds in the detector, focusing on the reflection\nof X-ray photons on vacuum-metal interfaces. Utilizing the extensive\ncapabilities of Geant4 for particle-matter interactions and propagation through\nthe geometry, the study provides first estimates of SR rates in ePIC. The\nresults also propose countermeasures to protect sensitive electronics, ensuring\nstable and reliable detector operation within the EIC environment.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XY9jy5G7E3kQAc_E8mDLqZVi9Sb8-YSi-xgumzje-lk","pdfSize":"4367236"}
