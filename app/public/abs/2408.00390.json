Let $[g]$\nbe the equivalence class of $g$ with respect to the equivalence relation B. The\nB superA graph of $G$ is an undirected graph whose vertex set is $G$ and two\ndistinct vertices $g, h \\in G$ are adjacent if $[g] = [h]$ or there exist $x\n\\in [g]$ and $y \\in [h]$ such that $x$ and $y$ are adjacent in the A graph of\n$G$. In this paper, we compute spectrum of equality/conjugacy supercommuting\ngraphs of dihedral/dicyclic groups and show that these graphs are not integral.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
