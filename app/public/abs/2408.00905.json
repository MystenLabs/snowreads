No gap\nexists for conventional innovations. Rather, the gap is pervasively rooted in\ninnovations that combine ideas in unexpected ways - innovations most critical\nto scientific breakthroughs. Further, at the USPTO we find that female\nexaminers reject up to 33 percent more unconventional innovations by women\ninventors than do male examiners, suggesting that gender discrimination weakly\nexplains this innovation gap. Instead, new data indicate that a configuration\nof institutional practices explains the innovation gap. These practices\ncompromise the expertise women examiners need to accurately assess\nunconventional innovations and then \"over-assign\" women examiners to women\ninnovators, undermining women's innovations. These institutional impediments\nnegatively impact innovation rates in science but have the virtue of being more\namenable to actionable policy changes than does culturally ingrained gender\ndiscrimination.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_3MQ_JCQEzhEEHPvuW49L6Z5fzhk-lUy9n0YqaZynSo","pdfSize":"5996068"}
