Well-known are the representations of quantum channels by Choi\nmatrices and by Kraus operator-sum representation (OSR). As was shown before,\none can use Kraus OSR to parameterize quantum channels by points of a suitable\nquotient under the action of the unitary group of some complex Stiefel\nmanifold. In this work, we establish a continuity relation (homeomorphism)\nbetween the topological space of quantum channels and the quotient of the\ncomplex Stiefel manifold. Then the metric on the set of quantum channels\ninduced by the Riemannian metric on the Stiefel manifold is defined. The\nestablished relation can be applied to various quantum optimization problems.\nAs an example, we apply it to the analysis of extrema points for a wide variety\nof quantum control objective functionals defined on the complex Stiefel\nmanifolds, including mean value, generation of quantum gates, thermodynamic\nquantities involving entropy, etc.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
