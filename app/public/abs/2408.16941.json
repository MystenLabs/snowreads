Therefore, there is a\nrequirement for novel nonlinear aeroelastic model reduction approaches that are\naccurate, simple and, most importantly, efficient to generate. This paper\nproposes a novel formulation for the identification of a compact multi-input\nVolterra series, where Orthogonal Matching Pursuit is used to obtain a set of\noptimally sparse nonlinear multi-input ROM coefficients from unsteady\naerodynamic training data. The framework is exemplified using the Benchmark\nSupercritical Wing, considering; forced response, flutter and limit cycle\noscillation. The simple and efficient Optimal Sparsity Multi-Input ROM\n(OSM-ROM) framework performs with high accuracy compared to the full-order\naeroelastic model, requiring only a fraction of the tens-of-thousands of\npossible multi-input terms to be identified and allowing a 96% reduction in the\nnumber of training samples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
