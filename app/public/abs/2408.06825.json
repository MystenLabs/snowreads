The image encoder\npre-trained through MIM, involving the masking and subsequent reconstruction of\ninput images, attains state-of-the-art performance in various downstream vision\ntasks. However, most existing works focus on improving the performance of\nMIM.In this work, we take a different angle by studying the pre-training data\nprivacy of MIM. Specifically, we propose the first membership inference attack\nagainst image encoders pre-trained by MIM, which aims to determine whether an\nimage is part of the MIM pre-training dataset. The key design is to simulate\nthe pre-training paradigm of MIM, i.e., image masking and subsequent\nreconstruction, and then obtain reconstruction errors. These reconstruction\nerrors can serve as membership signals for achieving attack goals, as the\nencoder is more capable of reconstructing the input image in its training set\nwith lower errors. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three model\narchitectures and three benchmark datasets. Empirical results show that our\nattack outperforms baseline methods. Additionally, we undertake intricate\nablation studies to analyze multiple factors that could influence the\nperformance of the attack.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"espkJs9ugrX7GWi-sdYB0IFlq4T74wCuIK2Tz6zvhaI","pdfSize":"904851"}
