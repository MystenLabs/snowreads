While TeX is responsible for generating a significant\nnumber of documents, irregularities in the TeX ecosystem may produce\ninconsistent documents. These inconsistencies may occur across different TeX\nengines or different versions of TeX distributions, resulting in failures to\nadhere to formatting specifications, or the same document rendering differently\nfor different authors. In this work, we investigate and quantify the robustness\nof the TeX ecosystem through a large-scale study of 432 documents. We developed\nan automated pipeline to evaluate the cross-engine and cross-version\ncompatibility of the TeX ecosystem. We found significant inconsistencies in the\noutputs of different TeX engines: only 0.2% of documents compiled to identical\noutput with XeTeX and PDFTeX due to a lack of cross-engine support in popular\nLaTeX packages and classes used in academic conferences. A\nsmaller$\\unicode{x2014}$yet significant$\\unicode{x2014}$extent of\ninconsistencies was found across different TeX Live distributions, with only\n42.1% of documents producing the same output from 2020 to 2023. Our automated\npipeline additionally reduces the human effort in bug-finding: from a sample of\n10 unique root causes of inconsistencies, we identified two new bugs in LaTeX\npackages and five existing bugs that were fixed independently of this study. We\nalso observed potentially unintended inconsistencies across different TeX Live\ndistributions beyond the updates listed in changelogs. We expect that this\nstudy will help authors of TeX documents to avoid unexpected outcomes by\nunderstanding how they may be affected by the often undocumented subtleties of\nthe TeX ecosystem, while benefiting developers by demonstrating how different\nimplementations result in unintended inconsistencies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
