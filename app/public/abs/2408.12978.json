This research explores the deployment of a spiking recurrent neural\nnetwork (SRNN) with liquid time constant neurons for gesture recognition. We\nfocus on the energy efficiency and computational efficacy of NVIDIA Jetson Nano\nembedded GPU platforms. The embedded GPU showcases a 14-fold increase in power\nefficiency relative to a conventional GPU, making a compelling argument for its\nuse in energy-constrained applications. The study's empirical findings also\nhighlight that batch processing significantly boosts frame rates across various\nbatch sizes while maintaining accuracy levels well above the baseline. These\ninsights validate the SRNN with liquid time constant neurons as a robust model\nfor interpreting temporal-spatial data in gesture recognition, striking a\ncritical balance between processing speed and power frugality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-PmjmLgKDUWvn2Rb1XHYA-A-YJQvuJ_aif2dUxispc8","pdfSize":"2624053"}
