Current methods exhibit failures in\ngenerating physically plausible arrangements that respect the provided text\ndescription. We present SceneMotifCoder (SMC), an example-driven framework for\ngenerating 3D object arrangements through visual program learning. SMC\nleverages large language models (LLMs) and program synthesis to overcome these\nchallenges by learning visual programs from example arrangements. These\nprograms are generalized into compact, editable meta-programs. When combined\nwith 3D object retrieval and geometry-aware optimization, they can be used to\ncreate object arrangements varying in arrangement structure and contained\nobjects. Our experiments show that SMC generates high-quality arrangements\nusing meta-programs learned from few examples. Evaluation results demonstrates\nthat object arrangements generated by SMC better conform to user-specified text\ndescriptions and are more physically plausible when compared with\nstate-of-the-art text-to-3D generation and layout methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
