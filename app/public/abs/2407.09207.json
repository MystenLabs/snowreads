This\nquantification is conducted across centrality classes and collision systems at\nthe LHC and top RHIC energy. The analysis is based on the relativistic fluid\ndynamics description of $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra of identified charged hadrons. A\n$p_{\\rm T}$ range scan investigation to determine the optimal range for the\npion $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra with respect to a fluid dynamic description is\nperformed, finding 0.5~$< p_{\\rm T} < $~2.0~GeV$/c$. A significant low-$p_{\\rm\nT}$ pion excess is computed across all centrality classes and collision systems\ninvestigated, indicating that a clear low-$p_{\\rm T}$ component arises from\ndifferent physics mechanisms, rather than thermal production. Further\ncomparison with measurements by the PHOBOS Collaboration confirms the\npersistence of the pion excess into very low-$p_{\\rm T}$, with no enhancement\nobserved in kaons and protons within the current experimental precision.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
