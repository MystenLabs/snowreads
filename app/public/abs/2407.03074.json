Using methods from classical mechanics on manifolds, we\ndefine a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a\npotential energy function defined in terms of stress on the agents' beliefs.\nThe resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the classic\nDeGroot dynamics. In the two agent case, the potential function is defined\nusing the Jeffrey's divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized by\na non-linear spring. These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on\ntori but are shown numerically to produce chaos near the boundary of the space.\nWe then investigate persuasion as an information theoretic control problem\nwhere analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is\na more stable approach to altering an agent's belief than providing a slowly\nchanging belief state that approaches the target.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
