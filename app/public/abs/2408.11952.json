This\ntrade-off naively predicts that cells maximize their fitness by sufficiency,\nexpressing just enough of each essential protein for function. We test this\nprediction in the naturally-competent bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi by\ncharacterizing the proliferation dynamics of essential-gene knockouts at a\nsingle-cell scale (by imaging) as well as at a genome-wide scale (by TFNseq).\nIn these experiments, cells proliferate for multiple generations as target\nprotein levels are diluted from their endogenous levels. This approach\nfacilitates a proteome-scale analysis of protein overabundance. As predicted by\nthe Robustness-Load Trade-Off (RLTO) model, we find that roughly 70% of\nessential proteins are overabundant and that overabundance increases as the\nexpression level decreases, the signature prediction of the model. These\nresults reveal that robustness plays a fundamental role in determining the\nexpression levels of essential genes and that overabundance is a key mechanism\nfor ensuring robust growth.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
