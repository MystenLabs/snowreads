Starting from the minimally\ncoupled scalar field and the first-generation scalar-tensor gravity, the\ndiscussion is generalised to kinetic gravity braiding and Horndeski gravity. We\nhighlight the main findings by focusing on the non-minimally coupled\nGauss-Bonnet term and the extended cuscuton model. Finally, we discuss how the\npresence of matter can influence Noether symmetries. It turns out that the\nselected Horndeski functions are unchanged with respect to the vacuum case.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
