Particular emphasis is on the behaviour of the modes at the inner\nhorizon, and therein on the validity of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture\nacross the physically permissible parameter space of the RNdS metric. Lastly,\nthe behavior of the adiabatic control function has been analysed over the\nposition space of the observer to determine the regimes where the effective\ntemperature function yields a Planckian spectrum of thermal radiation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
