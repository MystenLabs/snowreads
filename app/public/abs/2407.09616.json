The free energy landscape is constructed using the Gibbons-Hawking\npath integral method. The black hole phases are characterized by taking its\nhorizon radius as the order parameter. The free energy landscape provides three\nblack hole phases: small, intermediate, and large. The small and large black\nholes are thermodynamically stable whereas the intermediate one is unstable.\nThe Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional describes the\nstochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition. The Hamiltonian flow lines\nare obtained from the MSRJD functional and are used to analyze the stability\nand the phase transition properties. The dominant kinetic path between\ndifferent phases is discussed for various configurations of the free energy\nlandscape. We discuss the effect of black hole charge and the graviton mass on\nthe critical behavior of black hole phase transition.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
