It is well known that the solution of a quadratically\nregularized linear program over any polytope converges stationarily to the\nminimal-norm solution of the linear program when the regularization parameter\ntends to zero. However, that result is merely qualitative. Our main result\nquantifies the convergence by specifying the exact threshold for the\nregularization parameter, after which the regularized solution also solves the\nlinear program. Moreover, we bound the suboptimality of the regularized\nsolution before the threshold. These results are complemented by a convergence\nrate for the regime of large regularization. We apply our general results to\nthe setting of optimal transport, where we shed light on how the threshold and\nsuboptimality depend on the number of data points.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
