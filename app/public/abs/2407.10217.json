This phenomenon relies on the abundance of\nelliptic fibrations on Enriques surfaces, characterized by various invariants\nfrom algebraic geometry. We also provide a quantitative comparison of these\ninvariants to further give a detailed examination of the distinction between\nKahler cone and symplectic cone.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
