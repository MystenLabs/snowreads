Long-term tracking,\ndefined in the timescale of months of year, can provide insights of patterns\nand changes as indicators of health changes. These insights can make medicine\nand healthcare more predictive, preventive, personalized, and participative\n(The 4P's). However, the challenges in modeling, understanding and processing\nlongitudinal data are a significant barrier to their adoption in research\nstudies and clinical settings. In this paper, we review and discuss three\nmodels used to make sense of longitudinal data: routines, rhythms and stability\nmetrics. We present the challenges associated with the processing and analysis\nof longitudinal wearable sensor data, with a special focus on how to handle the\ndifferent temporal dynamics at various granularities. We then discuss current\nlimitations and identify directions for future work. This review is essential\nto the advancement of computational modeling and analysis of longitudinal\nsensor data for pervasive healthcare.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
