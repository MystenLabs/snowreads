We provide\nstandardized and anonymous financial statements to GPT4 and instruct the model\nto analyze them to determine the direction of future earnings. Even without any\nnarrative or industry-specific information, the LLM outperforms financial\nanalysts in its ability to predict earnings changes. The LLM exhibits a\nrelative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to\nstruggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on\npar with the performance of a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM\nprediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the\nLLM generates useful narrative insights about a company's future performance.\nLastly, our trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield a higher Sharpe\nratio and alphas than strategies based on other models. Taken together, our\nresults suggest that LLMs may take a central role in decision-making.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Quantitative Finance/General Finance","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YZEopQiJapRRweccfrbtqC-Psk47oSCQawn3m0WjRRE","pdfSize":"1958768"}
