While THE as a bulk effect has been widely studied, THE\ndriven by magnetic domain boundaries (DBs) has been elusive. Here, we report\nrich Hall responses characterized by multiple peak structures and a hysteresis\nloop in films of EuCd$_2$, where Eu layers form a geometrically frustrated\nlattice of Heisenberg spins. We uncover a THE component sharply enhanced at\nmagnetic transition fields, indicating a giant contribution from non-trivial\nspin textures possibly formed at the DBs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"coIHmxHyYEwu5dGMyQcn1TEUFE_bn0wyykrpn3i0t5g","pdfSize":"1007992"}
