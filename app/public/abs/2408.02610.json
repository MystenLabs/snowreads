It is shown that the\nCherenkov wake behind the vortex shuttle trapped in the stack can trigger\nproliferation of counter-propagating vortices and antivortices which get\nsynchronized and form large-amplitude standing electromagnetic waves. This\nhappens if the dc current density $J$ exceeds a threshold value $J_s$ which can\nbe well below the Josephson interlayer critical current density $J_c$ for\nunderdamped junctions. The cavity modes stimulated by the vortex-antivortex\npair production cause peaks in the radiated power $P_N(J)$ with a nearly\nmonochromatic spectrum at discrete values of $J$ corresponding to the\nzero-field Fiske resonances. The power $P_N(J)$ was evaluated for small\nrectangular stacks in the magneto-dipole approximation and for large stacks in\na single mode state. For small stacks, the highest peak in $P_N(J)$ increases\nrapidly, $P_N\\propto N^6$, with the number of junctions at $N\\leq 81$ and\ngradually slows down to $P_N\\propto N^2$ at $161\\leq N\\leq 321$. For stacks\nlarger than the radiated wavelength, we obtained $P_N\\propto N^5$ at $N\\lesssim\n200-300$ and $P_N\\propto N^2$ at larger $N$. For stacks with up to $321$\njunctions and representative parameters of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$,\nwe observed moderate overheating and no hotspots. The vortex-antivortex pair\nproduction can amplify THz radiation from Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$\nmesas for which trapping Josephson vortices could be used to stimulate THz\nemission at subcritical currents and optimize the radiation output.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bSvBkQ77MNskfz3C0prXZE1_bRoQtW8acUmbh_UpTAs","pdfSize":"3634005","txDigest":"C46PEtimYqPaekTvSPJknmZyo5MerC6324BUQU3Jgqgv","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
