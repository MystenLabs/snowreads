In an era of exponential growth in\nscientific publications, researchers face mounting challenges in efficiently\nprocessing vast volumes of literature. LLAssist addresses this issue by\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechniques to automate key aspects of the review process. Specifically, it\nextracts important information from research articles and evaluates their\nrelevance to user-defined research questions. The goal of LLAssist is to\nsignificantly reduce the time and effort required for comprehensive literature\nreviews, allowing researchers to focus more on analyzing and synthesizing\ninformation rather than on initial screening tasks. By automating parts of the\nliterature review workflow, LLAssist aims to help researchers manage the\ngrowing volume of academic publications more efficiently.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
