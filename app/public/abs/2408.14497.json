The resulting KSGs, which require observations at centimeter and\nmillimeter wavelengths that cannot be achieved by any other facility, represent\na small subset of the broad range of astrophysical problems that the ngVLA will\nbe able address. This document presents an update to the original ngVLA KSGs,\ntaking account of new results and progress in the 7+ years since their initial\npresentation, again drawing on the expertise of the ngVLA Science Advisory\nCouncil and the broader community in the ngVLA Science Working Groups. As the\ndesign of the ngVLA has also matured substantially in this period, this\ndocument also briefly addresses initial expectations for ngVLA data products\nand processing that will be needed to achieve the KSGs. The original ngVLA KSGs\nendure as outstanding problems of high priority. In brief, they are: (1)\nUnveiling the Formation of Solar System Analogues; (2) Probing the Initial\nConditions for Planetary Systems and Life with Astrochemistry; (3) Charting the\nAssembly, Structure, and Evolution of Galaxies from the First Billion Years to\nthe Present; (4) Science at the Extremes: Pulsars as Laboratories for\nFundamental Physics; (5) Understanding the Formation and Evolution of Stellar\nand Supermassive Black Holes in the Era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0EDkZEIOoVYIvDpbeHtwYHqlDvEvTLpfljdtbQ2nXy8","pdfSize":"16480805"}
