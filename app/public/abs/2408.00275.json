Traditional methods often employ\ntrajectory generation optimization and passive time allocation strategies,\nwhich can limit the exploitation of the quadrotor's dynamic capabilities and\nintroduce delays and inaccuracies. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel motion planning framework that integrates visibility path searching and\nreinforcement learning (RL) motion generation. Our method constructs\ncollision-free paths using heuristic search and visibility graphs, which are\nthen refined by an RL policy to generate low-level motion commands. We validate\nour approach in simulated indoor environments, demonstrating better performance\nthan traditional methods in terms of time span.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
