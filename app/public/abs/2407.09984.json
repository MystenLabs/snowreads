However, these\nalgorithms face the significant challenge of balancing precision in learning\nwith the maintenance of system stability. This paper addresses this challenge\nby presenting a novel ADS algorithm that leverages neural network technology.\nThe proposed algorithm is designed to distill essential knowledge from\ndemonstration data, ensuring stability during the learning of both\npoint-to-point and periodic motions. For point-to-point motions, a neural\nLyapunov function is proposed to align with the provided demonstrations. In the\ncase of periodic motions, the neural Lyapunov function is used with the\ntransversal contraction to ensure that all generated motions converge to a\nstable limit cycle. The model utilizes a streamlined neural network\narchitecture, adept at achieving dual objectives: optimizing learning accuracy\nwhile maintaining global stability. To thoroughly assess the efficacy of the\nproposed algorithm, rigorous evaluations are conducted using the LASA dataset\nand a manually designed dataset. These assessments were complemented by\nempirical validation through robotic experiments, providing robust evidence of\nthe algorithm's performance\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
