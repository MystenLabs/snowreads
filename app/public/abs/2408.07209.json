The estimator solves a least-squares regression problem weighted by a\nlocally adaptive Dirichlet kernel, ensuring excellent boundary properties.\nAsymptotic results for the bias, variance, mean squared error, and mean\nintegrated squared error are derived, generalizing the univariate results of\nChen (2002). A simulation study shows that the proposed local linear estimator\nwith Dirichlet kernel outperforms its only direct competitor in the literature,\nthe Nadaraya-Watson estimator with Dirichlet kernel due to Bouzebda, Nezzal,\nand Elhattab (2024).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
