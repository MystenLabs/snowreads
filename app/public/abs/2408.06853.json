Our motivating problem is the fundamental task of answering $d$\ncounting queries under the add/remove neighboring relation. The standard\nGaussian mechanism solves this task by adding noise distributed as a Gaussian\nwith variance scaled by $d$ independently to each count. We show that adding a\nrandom variable distributed as a Gaussian with variance scaled by $(\\sqrt{d} +\n1)/4$ to all counts allows us to reduce the variance of the independent\nGaussian noise samples to scale only with $(d + \\sqrt{d})/4$. The total noise\nadded to each counting query follows a Gaussian distribution with standard\ndeviation scaled by $(\\sqrt{d} + 1)/2$ rather than $\\sqrt{d}$. The central idea\nof our mechanism is simple and the technique is flexible. We show that applying\nour technique to another problem gives similar improvements over the standard\nGaussian mechanism.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
