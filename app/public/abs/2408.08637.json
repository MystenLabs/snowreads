We introduce AthenIA, an\nindustrialized magazine supply optimization solution that plans the supply for\nover 20,000 points of sale in France. We modularize the supply planning process\ninto a four-step pipeline: demand sensing, optimization, business rules, and\noperating. The core of the solution is a novel group conformalized quantile\nregression method that integrates domain expert insights, coupled with a supply\noptimization technique that balances the costs of out-of-stock against the\ncosts of over-supply. AthenIA has proven to be a valuable tool for magazine\npublishers, particularly in the context of evolving economic and ecological\nchallenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BGhGjgRytGeJuuC0j-iUzUTOWgEM14vxm54xBe3AbFQ","pdfSize":"4756987"}
