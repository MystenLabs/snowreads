We focus on the exponential type function of $F(\\phi)$ and\nthe three well-motivated potential functions $V(\\phi)$. We obtain the critical\npoints of the autonomous system, along with their stability conditions and\ncosmological properties. The critical points of the autonomous system describe\ndifferent phases of the Universe. In the results of our analysis, we have found\nthe scaling solution for critical points, which determine different\nevolutionary eras for the Universe. The dark-energy-dominated critical points\nshow stable behavior and indicate the Universe's late-time cosmic acceleration\nphase. Further, the results are examined with the cosmological data sets of the\nHubble rate $H(z)$ and the Supernovae Ia.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
