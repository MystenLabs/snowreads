The \\emph{cop number}\nof a graph is the minimum number of cops required to capture the robber.\nGaven\\v{c}iak et al.~[Eur. J. of Comb. 72, 45--69 (2018)] studied the game on\nintersection graphs and established that the cop number for the class of string\ngraphs is at most 15, and asked as an open question to improve this bound for\nstring graphs and subclasses of string graphs. We address this question and\nestablish that the cop number of a string graph is at most 13. To this end, we\ndevelop a novel \\textit{guarding} technique. We further establish that this\ntechnique can be useful for other Cops and Robber games on graphs admitting a\nrepresentation. In particular, we show that four cops have a winning strategy\nfor a variant of Cops and Robber, named Fully Active Cops and Robber, on planar\ngraphs, addressing an open question of Gromovikov et al.~[Austr. J. Comb.\n76(2), 248--265 (2020)]. In passing, we also improve the known bounds on the\ncop number of boxicity 2 graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
