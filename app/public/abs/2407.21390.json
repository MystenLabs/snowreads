A transversely pumped atom-cavity setup is a prototypical example\nof such an open system, wherein limit cycles (LCs) have been observed and\nidentified as continuous time crystals (CTCs). Using truncated Wigner\napproximation (TWA), we show that the inherent quantum noise pushes the system\nto exhibit signatures of LCs for interaction strengths lower than the critical\nvalue predicted by mean-field theory, suggesting a noise-induced enhancement of\ntemporal ordering. By comparing the oscillation frequencies of the LCs for the\none-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) regimes, we find that the LC\nfrequencies have larger shot-to-shot fluctuations in 1D than in 2D. We\ndemonstrate that this has an important consequence in the effectiveness of\nentrainment of LCs for a periodically driven pump intensity or light-matter\ncoupling strength.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
