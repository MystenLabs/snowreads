This channel offers a model-independent way to probe the sign of the\ngauge-Higgs coupling. Its sensitivity to interference effects and universal\ncoupling with new physics makes it particularly effective. We show that a\nhigh-energy lepton collider such as CLIC can fully determine the sign of the\ngauge-Higgs coupling in a model-independent way and with high-confidence.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n9d7m-DegJHDQUuONy0bMjwQqMvxFnasHZvRhk1lVsU","pdfSize":"1007830"}
