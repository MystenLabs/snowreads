Using seismic\nmonitoring can aid in an accurate and robust monitoring system to ensure the\neffectiveness of CCS and mitigate associated risks. However, conventional\nseismic wave equation-based approaches are computationally demanding, which\nhinders real-time applications. In addition to efficiency, forecasting and\nuncertainty analysis are not easy to handle using such\nnumerical-simulation-based approaches. To this end, we propose a novel\nsubsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting framework utilizing video\ndiffusion models. This approach can generate high-quality representations of\nCO$2$ evolution and associated changes in subsurface elastic properties. With\nreconstruction guidance, forecasting and inversion can be achieved conditioned\non historical frames and/or observational data. Meanwhile, due to the\ngenerative nature of the approach, we can quantify uncertainty in the\nprediction. Tests based on the Compass model show that the proposed method\nsuccessfully captured the inherently complex physical phenomena associated with\nCO$_2$ monitoring, and it can predict and invert the subsurface elastic\nproperties and CO$_2$ saturation with consistency in their evolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
