In a bottom-up approach, we first study\na relevant particle-level model and then analyze a continuous theory derived\nfrom it. We show that both model and theory account qualitatively for the main\nexperimental result, i.e. accumulation of cells at the core of any type of +1\ndefect. We argue that cell accumulation is essentially due to two generally\nignored 'effective active forces'.\n  We finally discuss the relevance and consequences of our findings in the\ncontext of other cellular active nematics experiments and previously proposed\ntheories.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
