We introduce a graph theory formulation of\ngeometrically frustrated assemblies, capturing frustrated interactions through\nthe concept of incompatible flows, providing a direct link between structural\nconnectivity and frustration. This theory offers a minimal yet comprehensive\nframework for the fundamental statistical mechanics of frustrated assemblies.\nThrough numerical simulations, the theory reveals new characteristics of\nfrustrated assemblies, including two distinct percolation transitions for\nstructure and stress, a crossover between cumulative and non-cumulative\nfrustration controlled by disorder, and a divergent length scale in their\nresponse.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Bzbg7rXccIy6usAcCoDYrddlRtXeRhwhUSp1NgdClPc","pdfSize":"16753698"}
