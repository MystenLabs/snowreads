Manual\nmaintenance of these metrics is time-consuming and susceptible to human error,\nmaking early detection of performance regressions challenging. We address these\nissues by proposing an automated approach to detect performance regressions in\nsuch measurements. Our approach integrates Bayesian inference with the Pruned\nExact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm, enhancing the detection of change points\nand performance regressions with high precision and efficiency compared to\nprevious approaches. Our method minimizes false negatives and ensures SAP\nHANA's system's reliability and performance quality. The proposed solution can\naccelerate testing and contribute to more sustainable performance management\npractices in large-scale data management environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
