However, existing works mainly consider static eavesdroppers, and the\nrelated study with mobile eavesdroppers is still in its infancy due to the\ndifficulty in obtaining the channel state information (CSI) of the\neavesdropper. To this end, we propose to leverage the sensing capability of\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems to assist PLS design. To\ncomprehensively study the dynamic behaviors of the system, we propose a Pareto\noptimization framework, where a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is\nformulated to simultaneously optimize three key performance metrics: power\nconsumption, number of securely served users, and tracking performance, while\nguaranteeing the achievable rate of the users with a given leakage rate\nconstraint. A globally optimal design based on the generalized Benders\ndecomposition (GBD) method is proposed to achieve the Pareto optimal solutions.\nTo reduce the computational complexity, we further design a low-complexity\nalgorithm based on zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and successive convex\napproximation (SCA). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithms and reveal the intrinsic trade-offs between the three\nperformance metrics. It is observed that near-field communication offers a\nfavorable beam diffraction effect for PLS, where the energy of the information\nsignal is nulled around the eavesdropper and focused on the users.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
