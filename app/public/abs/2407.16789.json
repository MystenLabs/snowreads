While multiple representations for lidar exist, the\nrange-view is enticing since it losslessly encodes the entire lidar sensor\noutput. In this work, we achieve state-of-the-art amongst range-view 3D object\ndetection models without using multiple techniques proposed in past range-view\nliterature. We explore range-view 3D object detection across two modern\ndatasets with substantially different properties: Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open.\nOur investigation reveals key insights: (1) input feature dimensionality\nsignificantly influences the overall performance, (2) surprisingly, employing a\nclassification loss grounded in 3D spatial proximity works as well or better\ncompared to more elaborate IoU-based losses, and (3) addressing non-uniform\nlidar density via a straightforward range subsampling technique outperforms\nexisting multi-resolution, range-conditioned networks. Our experiments reveal\nthat techniques proposed in recent range-view literature are not needed to\nachieve state-of-the-art performance. Combining the above findings, we\nestablish a new state-of-the-art model for range-view 3D object detection --\nimproving AP by 2.2% on the Waymo Open dataset while maintaining a runtime of\n10 Hz. We establish the first range-view model on the Argoverse 2 dataset and\noutperform strong voxel-based baselines. All models are multi-class and\nopen-source.
