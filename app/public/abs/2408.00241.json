Our method enhances the approximation of the squared indefinite\nHessian matrix inherent in these problems, significantly improving both\nstability and efficiency through iterative greedy updates. We provide a\nthorough theoretical analysis of MGSR1-SP, demonstrating its linear-quadratic\nconvergence rate. Numerical experiments conducted on AUC maximization and\nadversarial debiasing problems, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms,\nunderscore our method's enhanced convergence rate. These results affirm the\npotential of MGSR1-SP to improve performance across a broad spectrum of machine\nlearning applications where efficient and accurate Hessian approximations are\ncrucial.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GOTBm7Sl3yHDil4qvcq9dAEyNI6fUr5UiQIGgBPfqL8","pdfSize":"400035","txDigest":"R77BDPRvXhLJJeTLotZ9Q5xYW6CkfXYtAvwkSjrcSCS","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
