The MLP is formulated as a polynomial of polynomial\ninvariants that remain unchanged under any rotation. The polynomial MLP\nfacilitates not only comprehensive global structure searches within the\nCu-Ag-Au alloy system but also reliable predictions of a wide variety of\nproperties across the entire composition range. The developed MLP supports\nhighly accurate and efficient atomistic simulations, thereby significantly\nadvancing the understanding of the Cu-Ag-Au system. Furthermore, the\nmethodology demonstrated in this study can be easily applied to other ternary\nalloy systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s9SDQR5xDgyyPppFSyrX0QvrCXXMdkD0aMffSjNOxbE","pdfSize":"6197358"}
