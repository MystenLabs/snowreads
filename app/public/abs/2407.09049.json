In this theory, strings constitute not only particles but also\nthe space-time. In this review, we identify perturbative vacua, and derive the\npath-integrals of all order perturbative strings on the corresponding string\nbackgrounds by considering the fluctuations around the vacua. On the other\nhand, the most dominant part of the path-integral of string geometry theory is\nthe zeroth order part in the fluctuation of the action, which is obtained by\nsubstituting the perturbative vacua to the action. This part is identified with\nthe effective potential of the string backgrounds and obtained explicitly. The\nglobal minimum of the potential is the string vacuum. The urgent problem is to\nfind the global minimum. We introduce both analytical and numerical methods to\nsolve it.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
