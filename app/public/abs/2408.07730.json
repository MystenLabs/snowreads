These not only confirm a conjecture of the author in [Israel J.\nMath. 2024], but also improve results of Hirazallah-Kittaneh in [Integral\nEquations Operator Theory 60 (2008)] and Bhatia-Kittaneh in [Bull. London Math.\nSoc. 36 (2004)]. We also give a generalization of a result for pairs\n$(A_i,B_i), 1\\le i\\le n$ and obtain another form of another inequality. The\ninfinite cases of these inequalities are also discussed. The method is an\nextension of the result obtained by Bourin and Lee in [Linear Algebra Appl. 601\n(2020)]. Some related eigenvalue inequalities are also obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
