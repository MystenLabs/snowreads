Two types of oscillations were\ninvestigated: long period damp and short period damp. The researchers observed\nperiodic perturbations in the Doppler velocity oscillations of bright points\n(BPs) in the chromosphere and transition region (TR). Deep learning techniques\nwere used to examine the statistical properties of damping in different solar\nregions. The results showed variations in damping rates, with higher damping in\ncoronal hole areas. The study provided insights into the damping behavior of\nBPs and contributed to our understanding of energy dissipation processes in the\nsolar chromosphere and TR.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qKFDN3txnboJtf-TEHnaLyiVPuUal6UZ65NEMc6QMAs","pdfSize":"1003005"}
