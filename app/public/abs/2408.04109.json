However, the current collapse poses a challenge to\nthe application of GaN FETs to electronic devices. In this study, we\ninvestigate the formation of quantum dots in GaN FETs under the current\ncollapse. By comparing the Coulomb diamond between standard measurements and\nthose under current collapse, we find that the gate capacitance is\nsignificantly decreased by the current collapse. This suggests that the current\ncollapse changes the distribution of trapped electrons at the device surface,\nwhich is reported in the previous study by operando X-ray spectroscopy. Also,\nwe show external control of quantum dot formation, previously challenging in an\nFET structure, by using current collapse.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
