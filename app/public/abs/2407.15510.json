Anti-unification (or generalization) is\n\\textit{the} part of theoretical computer science and AI studying abstraction.\nIt has been successfully applied to various AI-related problems, most\nimportantly inductive logic programming. Up to this date, anti-unification is\nstudied only from a syntactic perspective in the literature. The purpose of\nthis paper is to initiate an algebraic (i.e. semantic) theory of\nanti-unification within general algebras. This is motivated by recent\napplications to similarity and analogical proportions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
