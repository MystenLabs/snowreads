Our approach is based on a\nnew reformulation of the corresponding algebraic system. For a fixed Lie\nalgebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, the unknowns of the system consist of a scalar product\n$g$ and a $3$-form $H$ on $\\mathfrak{g}$ as well as a linear form $\\delta$ on\n$\\mathfrak{g}\\oplus\\mathfrak{g}^*$. As in arXiv:2206.01157, the Lie bracket of\n$\\mathfrak{g}$ is considered part of the unknowns. In the Riemannian case, we\nshow that the generalised Einstein condition always reduces to the commutator\nideal and we provide a full classification of solvable generalised Einstein Lie\ngroups. In the Lorentzian case, under the additional assumption $\\delta=0$, we\nclassify -- up to one case -- all almost Abelian generalised Einstein Lie\ngroups. We then particularize to four dimensions and provide a full\nclassification of generalised Einstein Riemannian Lie groups as well as\ngeneralised Einstein Lorentzian Lie groups with $\\delta =0$ and non-degenerate\ncommutator ideal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
