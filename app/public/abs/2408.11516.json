More\nprecisely, the values of the agents are represented by $N$ independent,\nincreasing $\\mathbb{N}_0$ valued processes with random, independent waiting\ntimes between jumps. We show that the event that a single agent possesses the\nmaximum value for all sufficiently large values of time (called `leadership')\noccurs with probability zero or one, and provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions for this to occur. Under mild conditions we also provide criteria\nfor a single agent to become the unique agent of maximum value for all\nsufficiently large times, and also conditions for the emergence of a unique\nagent having value that tends to infinity before `explosion' occurs (i.e.\nconditions for `strict leadership' or `monopoly' to occur almost surely). The\nnovelty of this model lies in allowing non-exponentially distributed waiting\ntimes between jumps in value. In the particular case when waiting times are\nmixtures of exponential distributions, we improve a well-established result on\nthe `balls in bins' model with feedback, removing the requirement that the\nfeedback function be bounded from below and also allowing random feedback\nfunctions. As part of the proofs we derive necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the distribution of a convergent series of independent random variables to\nhave an atom on the real line, a result which we believe may be of interest in\nits own right.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
