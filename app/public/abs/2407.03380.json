In this\nstudy, we introduce Multi-Peptide, an innovative approach that combines\ntransformer-based language models with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict\npeptide properties. We combine PeptideBERT, a transformer model tailored for\npeptide property prediction, with a GNN encoder to capture both sequence-based\nand structural features. By employing Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training\n(CLIP), Multi-Peptide aligns embeddings from both modalities into a shared\nlatent space, thereby enhancing the model's predictive accuracy. Evaluations on\nhemolysis and nonfouling datasets demonstrate Multi-Peptide's robustness,\nachieving state-of-the-art 86.185% accuracy in hemolysis prediction. This study\nhighlights the potential of multimodal learning in bioinformatics, paving the\nway for accurate and reliable predictions in peptide-based research and\napplications.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
