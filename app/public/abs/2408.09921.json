A profound way to characterize these and\nmore general probe p-brane configurations, especially for M5-branes, is\nexpected to be as \"super-embeddings\" of their super-worldvolumes into target\nsuper-spacetime - but no concrete example of these had appeared in the\nliterature.\n  Here we fill this gap by constructing the explicit holographic\nsuper-embedding of probe M5-branes and M2-branes into their corresponding\nsuper-AdS backgrounds. The result seems to be novel and shows that the\nholographic M-probes, static with respect to the Poincar\\'e chart, must sit\nexactly at the throat radius.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
