However, modeling such complex\ninformation requires novel process mining techniques and might result in\ncomplex sets of constraints. Object-centric anomaly detection exploits both the\nlifecycle and the interactions between the different objects. Therefore,\nanomalous patterns are proposed to the user without requiring the definition of\nobject-centric process models. This paper proposes different methodologies for\nobject-centric anomaly detection and discusses the role of domain knowledge for\nthese methodologies. We discuss the advantages and limitations of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) in the provision of such domain knowledge. Following our\nexperience in a real-life P2P process, we also discuss the role of algorithms\n(dimensionality reduction+anomaly detection), suggest some pre-processing\nsteps, and discuss the role of feature propagation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
