Although the increase in the\napproximation degree allows us to fit the data better in attacking least\nsquares problems, the ill-conditioning of the coefficient matrix fuels the\ndramatic decrease in the accuracy of the approximation at higher degrees. To\novercome this drawback, we first show that the column space of the coefficient\nmatrix is equivalent to a Krylov subspace. Then the connection between\northogonal polynomials or rational functions and orthogonal bases for Krylov\nsubspaces in order to exploit Krylov subspace methods like Arnoldi\northogonalization is established. Furthermore, some examples are provided to\nillustrate the theory and the performance of the proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
