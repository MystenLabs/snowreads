The fjord system has a complex shore line,\nrestricting the behavioral response options for the narwhals to escape the\nthreats. We propose a new continuous-time correlated velocity model with\nvarying coefficients that includes spatial constraints on movement. To assess\nthe sound exposure effect we compare a baseline model for the movement before\nexposure to a response model for the movement during exposure. Our model,\napplied to the narwhal data, suggests increased tortuosity of the trajectories\nas a consequence of the spatial constraints, and further indicates that sound\nexposure can disturb narwhal motion up to a couple of tens of kilometers.\nSpecifically, we found an increase in velocity and a decrease in the movement\npersistence.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
