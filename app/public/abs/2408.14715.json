First, we prove that the\n$8$-dimensional Lie group $\\operatorname{SL}(3,\\mathbb{R})$ does not admit a\nleft-invariant hypercomplex structure. To accomplish this we revise the\nclassification of left-invariant complex structures on\n$\\operatorname{SL}(3,\\mathbb{R})$ due to Sasaki. Second, we exhibit a\nleft-invariant hypercomplex structure on $\\operatorname{SL}(2n+1,\\mathbb{C})$,\nwhich arises from a complex product structure on\n$\\operatorname{SL}(2n+1,\\mathbb{R})$, for all $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$. We then show\nthat there are no HKT metrics compatible with this hypercomplex structure.\nAdditionally, we determine the associated Obata connection and we compute\nexplicitly its holonomy group, providing thus a new example of an Obata\nholonomy group properly contained in $\\operatorname{GL}(m,\\mathbb{H})$ and not\ncontained in $\\operatorname{SL}(m,\\mathbb{H})$, where $4m=\\dim_\\mathbb{R}\n\\operatorname{SL}(2n+1,\\mathbb{C})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
