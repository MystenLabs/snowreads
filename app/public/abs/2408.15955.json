Enhanced by\nadvanced data augmentation techniques, the model demonstrates significant\nrobustness and adaptability across various conditions. The integration of\nYOLOv5mu offers precise, real-time fall detection, which is crucial for\nimproving safety and emergency response for residents. Future research will\nfocus on refining the system by incorporating contextual data and exploring\nmulti-sensor approaches to enhance its performance and practical applicability\nin diverse environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bbGrVRnUMISf0ofyxEoRatP--AcWs-f71hnGXCcb2ww","pdfSize":"19985626"}
