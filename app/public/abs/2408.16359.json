Within the energy gap, a\ndamping-like torque plateau emerges within the quantum anomalous Hall phase\nupon breaking particle-hole symmetry, while for energies at the spin-split\nDirac points located within the bands, a large damping-like torque develops as\na result of a vanishing Fermi contour. Such torques are tunable by the degree\nof spin-pseudospin entanglement dictated by proximity-induced spin-orbit\ncoupling terms. This additionally allows to reach the upper limit of\ncharge-to-spin conversion in non-magnetic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UM43tlEMQ6ldiJAfN8KAjL9q7fKyuJJXiADMolvs0SY","pdfSize":"1754204"}
