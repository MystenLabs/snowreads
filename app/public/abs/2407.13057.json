However, most astrochemical models\nassume this reaction on the ice mantles of dust to be barrierless and\nefficient, without considering the states of adsorption. Recently, we found\nthat C atoms exist in either the physisorbed or chemisorbed state on compact\namorphous solid water, which is analogous to an interstellar ice mantle. These\ndistinct adsorption states considerably affect the hydrogenation reactivity of\nthe C atom. Herein, we elucidate the reactivities of physisorbed and\nchemisorbed C atoms with H atoms via sequential deposition and co-deposition\nprocesses. The results indicate that only physisorbed C atoms can produce CH4\non ice. Combining this finding with a previous estimate for the fraction of\nphysisorbed C atoms on ice, we determined the upper limit for the conversion of\nC atoms into CH4 to be 30%.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
