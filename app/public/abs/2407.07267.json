Each inhabitant service in the colony implements a\nspecific system functionality, collaborates with the other services, and makes\nproactive decisions that impact its performance and interaction patterns with\nother inhabitants. By increasing the level of self-awareness and autonomy\navailable to individual system components, the resulting system is increasingly\nmore decentralized, distributed, flexible, adaptable, distributed, modular,\nrobust, and fault-tolerant.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
