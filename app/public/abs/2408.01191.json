However, the complex structure of brain tumors and expensive\npixel-level annotations present challenges for automatic tumor segmentation. In\nthis paper, we propose a counterfactual generation framework that not only\nachieves exceptional brain tumor segmentation performance without the need for\npixel-level annotations, but also provides explainability. Our framework\neffectively separates class-related features from class-unrelated features of\nthe samples, and generate new samples that preserve identity features while\naltering class attributes by embedding different class-related features. We\nperform topological data analysis on the extracted class-related features and\nobtain a globally explainable manifold, and for each abnormal sample to be\nsegmented, a meaningful normal sample could be effectively generated with the\nguidance of the rule-based paths designed within the manifold for comparison\nfor identifying the tumor regions. We evaluate our proposed method on two\ndatasets, which demonstrates superior performance of brain tumor segmentation.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/xrt11/tumor-segmentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
