Our primary\nfocus is on the structure of stratification for the singular sets. We define\nthe $ k $-th stratification $ S^k(u) $ of $ u $ based on the tangent functions\nand measures. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of $ S^k(u) $ is at most $ k\n$ and $ S^k(u) $ is $ k $-rectifiable, and establish estimates for volumes\nassociated with points that have lower bounds on the regular scales. These\nestimates enable us to derive sharp interior estimates for the solutions.\nSpecifically, if $ \\alpha_p=\\frac{2(p+1)}{p-1} $ is not an integer, then for\nany $ j\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} $, we have $$ D^ju\\in\nL_{\\operatorname{loc}}^{q_j,\\infty}(\\Omega), $$ which implies that for any $\n\\Omega'\\subset\\subset\\Omega $, $$\n\\sup\\{\\lambda>0:\\lambda^{q_j}\\mathcal{L}^n(\\{x\\in\\Omega':|D^ju(x)|>\\lambda\\})\\}<+\\infty,\n$$ where $ \\mathcal{L}^n(\\cdot) $ is the $ n $-dimensional Lebesgue measure,\nand $$ q_j=\\frac{(p-1)(\\lfloor\\alpha_p\\rfloor+1)}{2+j(p-1)}, $$ with $\n\\lfloor\\alpha_p\\rfloor $ being the integer part of $ \\alpha_p $. The proofs of\nthese results rely on Reifenberg-type theorems developed by A. Naber and D.\nValtorta to study the stratification of harmonic maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
