During these days, it is traditional to\nthrow pyrotechnic devices of all kinds. There is a legend about the so-called\ndrunk fireworks, small rockets that move randomly at high speed. According to\nfolk wisdom, if you try to run away from a drunk firework, it will chase you\nuntil it hits you. It is performed a Monte Carlo simulation without considering\naerodynamic effects to see if there is indeed a greater chance of a person\nbeing hit when moving. The results indicate that the popular myth is correct,\nat least in terms of having a higher probability of impact. Once again, it is\ndemonstrated that popular myths can be a source of valuable knowledge beyond\nformal science.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","pdfSize":"5184742","blobId":"7U5AT_ZrGBL5tQWOfRlYDNBdH4v8cnoNZxVQF6EX68A","objectId":"0x00e2acd93d0343ac09da9caed43e678c146c86e295d7eedab2d88db30d9a1f20","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
