Utilizing the Nielsen\napproach within the thermofield dynamics (TFD) framework, we determine the\ncomplexity of thermofield double states as functions of time, temperature, and\nthe external magnetic field. Our subsequent analysis reveals various features\nof this complexity. For instance, as temperature increases, the amplitude of\ncomplexity oscillations also rises, while at low temperatures, complexity\nstabilizes at a constant positive value. Furthermore, the magnetic field\ncreates two distinct sectors: strong magnetic fields exhibit periodic\ncomplexity oscillations, whereas weak magnetic fields induce a beating effect.\nFinally, we confirm that the rate of complexity obeys the Lloyd bound.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
