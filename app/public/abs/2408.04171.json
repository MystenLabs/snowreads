The rotation center is a\ncrucial input parameter in non-blind RMD methods. Existing methods directly\nestimate the rotation center from the RMB image. However they always suffer\nsignificant errors, and the performance of RMD is limited. For the assembled\nimaging systems, the position of the rotation center remains fixed. Leveraging\nthis prior knowledge, we propose a geometric-based method for rotation center\nidentification and analyze its error range. Furthermore, we construct a RMB\nimaging system. The experiment demonstrates that our method achieves less than\n1-pixel error along a single axis (x-axis or y-axis). We utilize the\nconstructed imaging system to capture real RMB images, and experimental results\nshow that our method can help existing RMD approaches yield better RMD images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
