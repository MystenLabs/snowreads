Recent attempts to extend guidance to\nunconditional models have relied on heuristic techniques, resulting in\nsuboptimal generation quality and unintended effects. In this work, we propose\nSmoothed Energy Guidance (SEG), a novel training- and condition-free approach\nthat leverages the energy-based perspective of the self-attention mechanism to\nenhance image generation. By defining the energy of self-attention, we\nintroduce a method to reduce the curvature of the energy landscape of attention\nand use the output as the unconditional prediction. Practically, we control the\ncurvature of the energy landscape by adjusting the Gaussian kernel parameter\nwhile keeping the guidance scale parameter fixed. Additionally, we present a\nquery blurring method that is equivalent to blurring the entire attention\nweights without incurring quadratic complexity in the number of tokens. In our\nexperiments, SEG achieves a Pareto improvement in both quality and the\nreduction of side effects.
