Specifically, we explore\npseudo-labeling, by proposing a generic framework combining multiple ideas from\nexisting works. Our framework integrates multiple base models for transcription\nand evaluators for assessing audio-transcript pairs, resulting in robust\npseudo-labeling for low resource languages. We validate our approach with a new\nbenchmark, IndicYT, comprising diverse YouTube audio files from multiple\ncontent categories. Our findings show that augmenting pseudo labeled data from\nYouTube with existing training data leads to significant performance\nimprovements on IndicYT, without affecting performance on out-of-domain\nbenchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of pseudo-labeled data in enhancing ASR\ncapabilities for low-resource languages. The benchmark, code and models\ndeveloped as a part of this work will be made publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
