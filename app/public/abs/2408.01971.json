It relies on approximating the\nunderlying delay model with a system of ordinary differential equations via\npseudospectral collocation. To minimize the reconstruction error, the new\nstrategy avoids optimizing all possible multiple unknown delays, identifying\nonly the maximum one. The computational burden is thus greatly reduced,\nimproving the performance of recent implementations that work directly on the\ndelay system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
