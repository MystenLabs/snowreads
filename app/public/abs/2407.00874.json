For such goals in the physics frontiers we discuss a plan of building a\nsuper $\\eta$ factory at HIAF high-energy terminal or at CiADS after upgrade.\nThe high-intensity proton beam at HIAF provides a great opportunity of\nproducing a huge number of $\\eta$ samples of more than $10^{13}$ events per\nyear, with multiple layers of thin targets of light nucleus. The physics goals,\nthe first-version conceptual design of the spectrometer, and the preliminary\nsimulation results are present.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
