We define an edge-coloring by\ncoloring the edges according to the copy of $G(n,r)$ they belong to and study\nthe rainbow connectivity of the resulting edge-colored multigraph. We show that\n$r(n)=\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{n}\\right)^{\\frac{h-1}{2h}}$ is a threshold of the\nradius for the property of being rainbow connected. This complements the known\nanalogous results for the multilayerd graphs defined on the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\' enyi\nrandom model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rwScF_o65jwGzM0ft2BaKzVvN1pqP8qtRq3BzYdGjQU","pdfSize":"210602"}
