The performance of the strategy is evaluated based on the\nprofitability and effectiveness in stock markets. The results indicate that\ncausal discovery algorithms can successfully uncover actionable causal\nrelationships in large markets, leading to profitable investment outcomes.\nHowever, the research also identifies a critical challenge: the computational\ncomplexity and scalability of these algorithms when dealing with large\ndatasets. This challenge presents practical limitations for their application\nin real-world market analysis.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R3ushC9y3R1vhgphlGhDJKRUcWNs9wCaFyyiEPa81kY","pdfSize":"1709971"}
