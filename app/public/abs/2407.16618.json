Starting from the knowledge of the\nsolution for single-component non-interacting fermions (or strongly-interacting\nbosons), we explicitly impose periodic condition on the amplitudes of the spin\nconfigurations. This reduces drastically the number of independent complex\namplitudes that we determine by constrained diagonalization of an effective\nHamiltonian. This procedure allows us to obtain a complete basis for the exact\nlow-energy many-body solutions for mixtures with a large number of particles,\nboth for $SU(\\kappa)$ and symmetry-breaking systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
