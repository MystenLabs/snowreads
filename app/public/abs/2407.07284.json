Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches for human\navatars require per-identity optimization. However, learning a multi-identity\nrepresentation presents advantages in robustly animating humans under arbitrary\nposes. We propose to construct a high-order tensor that combines all the\nlearnable 3DGS parameters for all the training identities. By assuming a\nlow-rank structure and factorizing the tensor, we model the complex rigid and\nnon-rigid deformations of multiple subjects in a unified network, significantly\nreducing the total number of parameters. Our proposed approach leverages\ninformation from all the training identities and enables robust animation under\nchallenging unseen poses, outperforming existing approaches. It can also be\nextended to learn unseen identities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
