We introduce a framework for\nrelaxed $E(3)$ graph equivariant neural networks that can learn and represent\nsymmetry breaking within continuous groups. Building on the existing e3nn\nframework, we propose the use of relaxed weights to allow for controlled\nsymmetry breaking. We show empirically that these relaxed weights learn the\ncorrect amount of symmetry breaking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
