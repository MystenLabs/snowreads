A Monte Carlo approach is used to obtain a large number of\nrandom independent realizations of the wave fields, allowing for an\ninvestigation of the evolution of the following statistical characteristics:\nspectra, moments, and distribution functions. The simulations are conducted for\ndifferent values of the Ursell number (the ratio of nonlinearity to dispersion)\nto study the impact of nonlinearity and dispersion on the processes under\nconsideration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
