This type of quadrupoles possesses unique single-ion anisotropy\nproportional to a third order of the quadrupole moments. This provides an\nunconventional mechanism of triple-$q$ orders which does not exist for the\ndegrees of freedom with odd parity under time-reversal operation such as\nmagnetic dipoles. In addition to several single-$q$ orders, this system\nexhibits various orders including incommensurate triple-$q$ quasi-long-range\norders and a four-sublattice triple-$q$ partial order. Our Monte-Carlo\nsimulations demonstrate that the phase transition to the latter triple-q state\nbelongs to the universality class of the critical line of the Ashkin-Teller\nmodel in two dimensions close to the four-state Potts class. These results\nindicate a possibility of realizing this unique quadrupole textures in simple\ntriangular systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8NdX0oKwxR3eM4-KDT8sf9Xdg2o3nqwWMJ4hSjSqqNM","pdfSize":"4853512"}
