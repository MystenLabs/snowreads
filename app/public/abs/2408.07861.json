We\npresent several examples that illustrate our methodology for constructing\nflux-quantizing circuits, including dc- and rf-SQUIDs, tunable couplers, and\nparametric amplifiers using SNAIL and rf-SQUID arrays. We perform DC,\nS-parameter, and harmonic balance simulations to validate our models and\nmethods against theory and published experimental results.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
