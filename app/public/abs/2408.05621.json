The NbN\nthin films possess remarkable structural uniformity and consistently high\nsuperconducting quality across the entire 300 mm Si wafer, by incorporating an\nAlN buffer layer. High-resolution X-ray diffraction and transmission electron\nmicroscopy analyses unveiled enhanced crystallinity of (111)-oriented\n{\\delta}-phase NbN with the AlN buffer layer. Notably, NbN films deposited on\nAlN-buffered Si substrates exhibited a significantly elevated superconducting\ncritical temperature (~2 K higher for the 10 nm NbN) and a higher upper\ncritical magnetic field or Hc2 (34.06 T boost in Hc2 for the 50 nm NbN) in\ncomparison with those without AlN. These findings present a promising pathway\nfor the integration of quantum-grade superconducting NbN films with the\nexisting 300 mm CMOS Si platform for quantum information applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
