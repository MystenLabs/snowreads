It covers the basic\ndevelopment of prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity from an information theoretic\npoint of view, before introducing Hausdorff measures and dimension along with\nsome important examples. The main goal of the paper is to motivate and develop\nthe informal identity \"entropy = complexity = dimension\" from first principles.\nThe last section of the paper presents some new observations on multifractal\nmeasures from an algorithmic viewpoint.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
