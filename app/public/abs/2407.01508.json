We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present\nsome of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with\nYang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional\nsolutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole\nequations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills\nfunctional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal\nbundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is\nnon-degenerate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
