For the appropriate setting of the parameters\nwe provide strong convergence of the generated sequence $(x_k)$ to the minimum\nnorm minimizer of our objective function $f+g$. Further, we obtain fast\nconvergence to zero of the objective function values in a generated sequence\nbut also for the discrete velocity and the sub-gradient of the objective\nfunction. We also show that for another settings of the parameters the optimal\nrate of order $\\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ for the potential energy\n$(f+g)(x_k)-\\min(f+g)$ can be obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HjkV8ImgY8apa9kDuCdWb7VlcL4c98EGO9oFwrj8CSg","pdfSize":"574740","objectId":"0xbddc554c00245ed2c33b6bbe8a1619a11a5f4c690503b589e405aeeb20a00ccd","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
