We give an exposition of two\nimportant results from that paper which are not readily accessible in the\nliterature.\n  The first is an example of a Skorokhod problem in two dimensions in the\nquadrant for which there is not uniqueness. The second is a proof of uniqueness\nfor the Skorokhod problem in two dimensions in the quadrant in a critical case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
