The calculation\nof aggregate losses, an essential step in insurance pricing, has attracted\nconsiderable attention in recent years. This research develops a path-based\nk-generation risk contagion model in a tree-shaped network structure that\nincorporates the impact of the origin contagion location and the heterogeneity\nof security levels on contagion probability and local loss, distinguishing it\nfrom most existing models. Furthermore, we discuss the properties of\nk-generation risk contagion among multi-paths using the concept of d-separation\nin Bayesian network (BN), and derive explicit expressions for the mean and\nvariance of local loss on a single path. By combining these results, we compute\nthe mean and variance values for aggregate loss across the entire network until\ntime $t$, which is crucial for accurate cyber insurance pricing. Finally,\nthrough numerical calculations and relevant probability properties, we have\nobtained several findings that are valuable to risk managers and insurers.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
