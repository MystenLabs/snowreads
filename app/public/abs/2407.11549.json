A Simulation\n  based on Large Language Models","authors":"Yin Jou Huang and Rafik Hadfi","authorsParsed":[["Huang","Yin Jou",""],["Hadfi","Rafik",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 09:52:51 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-17","timestamp":1721123571000,"abstract":"  Psychological evidence reveals the influence of personality traits on\ndecision-making. For instance, agreeableness is generally associated with\npositive outcomes in negotiations, whereas neuroticism is often linked to less\nfavorable outcomes. This paper introduces a simulation framework centered on\nLarge Language Model (LLM) agents endowed with synthesized personality traits.\nThe agents negotiate within bargaining domains and possess customizable\npersonalities and objectives. The experimental results show that the behavioral\ntendencies of LLM-based simulations could reproduce behavioral patterns\nobserved in human negotiations. The contribution is twofold. First, we propose\na simulation methodology that investigates the alignment between the linguistic\nand economic capabilities of LLM agents. Secondly, we offer empirical insights\ninto the strategic impact of Big-Five personality traits on the outcomes of\nbilateral negotiations. We also provide a case study based on synthesized\nbargaining dialogues to reveal intriguing behaviors, including deceitful and\ncompromising behaviors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
