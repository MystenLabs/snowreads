Once the\nfield's degrees of freedom are traced out on factorized states, the reduced\ndynamics of the particles' system is described by an effective Schr\\\"{o}dinger\noperator keeping track of the field's state. We prove that, under suitable\nassumptions on the latter, such effective models are well-posed even if the\nparticles are point-like, that is no ultraviolet cut-off is imposed on the\ninteraction with quantum fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
