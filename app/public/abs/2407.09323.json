Our\nresults do not require the semigroup to be uniformly bounded, and for unbounded\nsemigroups we improve upon previous results by, for example, removing a\nlogarithmic loss on non-Hilbertian Banach spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
