Our\nresults do not require the semigroup to be uniformly bounded, and for unbounded\nsemigroups we improve upon previous results by, for example, removing a\nlogarithmic loss on non-Hilbertian Banach spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CyNn_WfiXa_Mtgnym8-H0t7RRpI8EtoHNvr6xDaOYOY","pdfSize":"257049","objectId":"0xe7ba1f08f566342954ee1c35d8235b84375958d319f6071a5f339e96997d9e3d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
