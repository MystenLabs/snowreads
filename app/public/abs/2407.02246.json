For $m \\in \\mathbb{N}:=\\{1, 2, \\ldots\\}$\nfixed, the hydrodynamic equation is $\\partial_t \\rho(t,u)= [-(-\\Delta)^{\\gamma\n/2} \\rho^m](t,u) $. For $m=1$, this {is} the fractional equation, which is\nlinear. On the other hand, for $m \\geq 2$, this is the fractional porous medium\nequation (which is nonlinear), obtained by choosing a rate which depends on the\nnumber of particles next to the initial and final position of a jump.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
