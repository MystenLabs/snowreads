We\npropose a matrix completion algorithm on French customs data to obtain\nmultidimensional counterfactuals at the firm, product and destination levels.\nWe find a small but significant positive impact on average at the product-level\nintensive margin. On the other hand, the extensive margin shows product\nchurning due to the treaty beyond regular entry-exit dynamics: one product in\neight that was not previously exported substitutes almost as many that are no\nlonger exported. When we delve into the heterogeneity, we find that the effects\nof the treaty are higher for products at a comparative advantage. Focusing on\nmultiproduct firms, we find that they adjust their portfolio in Canada by\nreallocating towards their first and most exported product due to increasing\nlocal market competition after trade liberalization. Finally, multidimensional\ncounterfactuals allow us to evaluate the general equilibrium effect of the\nCETA. Specifically, we observe trade diversion, as exports to other\ndestinations are re-directed to Canada.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"asDhhVOOFjaKQrFUtFfwldO_MpFhwhQsXm_OQAIskzQ","pdfSize":"2738545"}
