This study introduces a\nhybrid approach to address these issues, focusing on forecasting hourly PM2.5\nconcentrations using Support Vector Regression (SVR). Meta-heuristic\nalgorithms, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),\noptimize SVR Hyper-parameters \"C\" and \"Gamma\" to enhance prediction accuracy.\nEvaluation metrics include R-squared (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and\nMean Absolute Error (MAE). Results show significant improvements with PSO-SVR\n(R2: 0.9401, RMSE: 0.2390, MAE: 0.1368) and GWO-SVR (R2: 0.9408, RMSE: 0.2376,\nMAE: 0.1373), indicating robust and accurate models suitable for similar\nresearch applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
