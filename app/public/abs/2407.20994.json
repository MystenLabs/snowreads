In particular, they\nallow us to see when and how any given sequence of polynomials is Darboux\nrelated to a diagonal matrix of classic orthogonal polynomials. We also explore\nthe notion of Darboux-irreducibility and study some sequences that are not a\nDarboux transformation of classical orthogonal polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
