In this\nwork, we explore the robustness and explainability of AI-based forecasting\nsystems. We provide an in-depth analysis of the underlying causality involved\nin the effect prediction task and further establish a causal graph based on\ntreatment, adjustment variable, confounder, and outcome. Correspondingly, we\ndesign a causal interventional prediction system (CIPS) based on a variational\nautoencoder and fully conditional specification of multiple imputations.\nExtensive results demonstrate the superiority of our system over\nstate-of-the-art methods and show remarkable versatility and extensibility in\npractice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
