If the expected value premium principle\nis used, our findings confirm that, similar to the VaR model, a truncated\nstop-loss indemnity is optimal in the $\\Lambda\\VaR$ model. We further provide a\nclosed-form expression of the deductible parameter under certain conditions.\nMoreover, we study the use of a $\\Lambda'\\VaR$ as premium principle as well,\nand show that full or no insurance is optimal. Dual stop-loss is shown to be\noptimal if we use a $\\Lambda'\\VaR$ only to determine the risk-loading in the\npremium principle. Moreover, we study the impact of model uncertainty,\nconsidering situations where the loss distribution is unknown but falls within\na defined uncertainty set. Our findings indicate that a truncated stop-loss\nindemnity is optimal when the uncertainty set is based on a likelihood ratio.\nHowever, when uncertainty arises from the first two moments of the loss\nvariable, we provide the closed-form optimal deductible in a stop-loss\nindemnity.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
