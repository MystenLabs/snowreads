The\ngoal of the Fant\\^omas analysis is to quantify the dependence on the\nparametrization form in global QCD analyses, with a first application to the\npion PDFs. We highlight the anti-correlation between the experimentally allowed\ngluon and sea distributions in the pion, as made apparent by the sampling over\nparametrization forms. This result, for the sea and gluon sector, illustrates\nthe importance of accounting for epistemic uncertainties in data-driven QCD\nanalyses. In that regard, we further discuss the meaning of the sampling\nuncertainty and why it is key in phenomenological studies of hadron structure.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
