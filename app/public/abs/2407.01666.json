We use tools\nprovided by these networks to study the relationship between non-isometries and\nquantum extremal surfaces behind the horizon. Furthermore, we introduce a\nlimited notion of dynamics for these interior tensor networks based on the\nqudit models introduced by Akers et al., and study the evolution of quantum\nextremal surfaces in an evaporating black hole. We also find a tensor network\ndescription of a wormhole connecting the black hole interior to the radiation,\nproviding a mechanism for interior states and operators to be encoded in the\nradiation after the Page time. As a particular case, we construct a tensor\nnetwork realization of the backwards-forwards maps recently proposed to\nincorporate non-trivial effective dynamics in dynamical constructions of these\nnon-isometric black hole codes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
