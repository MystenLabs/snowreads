The PoPreRo dataset includes a varied compilation\nof post samples from five distinct subreddits of Romania, totaling 28,107 data\nsamples. Along with our novel dataset, we introduce a set of competitive models\nto be used as baselines for future research. Interestingly, the top-scoring\nmodel achieves an accuracy of 61.35% and a macro F1 score of 60.60% on the test\nset, indicating that the popularity prediction task on PoPreRo is very\nchallenging. Further investigations based on few-shot prompting the Falcon-7B\nLarge Language Model also point in the same direction. We thus believe that\nPoPreRo is a valuable resource that can be used to evaluate models on\npredicting the popularity of social media posts in Romanian. We release our\ndataset at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/PoPreRo.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
