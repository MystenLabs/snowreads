Traditional LiF\nmethods involve expensive high-speed electronics or narrow-pulse light sources.\nWe present a novel computational LiF approach that only requires\ncontinuous-wave (CW) lasers and off-the-shelf CMOS cameras to capture the full\nLiF information about the scene. From multiple CW scene measurements at\ndifferent optical wavelengths, we create multiple \"synthetic fields,\" each at a\n\"synthetic wave\" which is the beat wave of two respective optical waves. Due to\ntheir robustness to speckle, the synthetic fields can be computationally\ncombined into a \"synthetic light pulse,\" which precisely sections the\nvolumetric scene. Moreover, the complex synthetic fields can be freely\nmanipulated in the computer after their acquisition, which allows for spatial\nand temporal shaping of different sets of pulses from the same set of\nmeasurements to maximize the decoded information output for each scene. In\naddition, the relative speed at which the pulse travels through the scene can\nbe used to characterize physical scene properties such as depth or indices of\nrefraction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
