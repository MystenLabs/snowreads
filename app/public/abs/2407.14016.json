This process, called learning by\nexporting, is usually modeled as a Hicks-neutral TFP shifter, overlooking\nfactor-biased technical improvements. We develop a dynamic model of production,\nexporting, and capital investment that incorporates factor-augmenting\nefficiencies. We find that exporting increases TFP by 9%, skilled labor\nproductivity by 2%, and unskilled labor productivity by 8%. For new exporters,\nskilled labor productivity rises by 45%, and unskilled labor productivity\nincreases by 75% within four years of entering export markets.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
