First, we prove that stable\nhypersurfaces are not $C^2$-dense in any isotopy class of embedded\nhypersurfaces on any ambient symplectic manifold of dimension $2n\\geq 8$. Our\nsecond result is that on any manifold of dimension $2m+1\\geq 5$, the set of\nnon-degenerate stable Hamiltonian structures is not $C^2$-dense among stable\nHamiltonian structures in any given stable homotopy class that satisfies a mild\nassumption. The latter generalizes a result by Cieliebak and Volkov to\narbitrary dimensions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
