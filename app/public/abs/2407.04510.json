The\ndesk chooses either to internalise the inflow or externalise it to the market\nin a cost effective manner. In this model, externalising the order flow creates\nboth price impact costs and an additional market feedback reaction for the\ninflow of trades. The desk's objective is to maximise the daily trading P&L\nsubject to end of the day inventory penalization. We formulate this setting as\na partially observable stochastic control problem and solve it in two steps.\nFirst, we derive the filtered dynamics of the inventory and toxicity, projected\nto the observed filtration, which turns the stochastic control problem into a\nfully observed problem. Then we use a variational approach in order to derive\nthe unique optimal trading strategy. We illustrate our results for various\nscenarios in which the desk is facing momentum and mean-reverting toxicity. Our\nimplementation shows that the P&L performance gap between the partially\nobservable problem and the full information case are of order $0.01\\%$ in all\ntested scenarios.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
