We identified a research gap in the current state of the\nart, which lies in the inability of models to adapt to changes in the power\ngrid, such as loss of sensors and branch switching. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat graph neural networks are the most promising models for this use case and\nthat their performance can degrade with scale. We propose augmentations to\nremedy this issue and perform a comprehensive grid search of different model\nconfigurations for common zero-shot learning scenarios in neural state\nestimation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
