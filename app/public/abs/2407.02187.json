Modern deep learning approaches typically require large annotated\ntraining data which complicates instant applicability. In this paper, we make\nuse of the segment anything model, a deep foundation model based on interactive\npoint-prompts, which enables class-agnostic segmentation without tuning the\nnetwork's parameters based on domain specific training data. The proposed\nmethod clearly outperformed a semi-objective baseline method that required\nmanual inspection and, if necessary, adjustment of parameters per image. Even\nthough the point prompts of the proposed approach are theoretically also a\nsource for subjectivity, results attested very low intra- and interobserver\nvariability, even compared to manual segmentation of domain experts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
