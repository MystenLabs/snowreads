A modern approach to\nmitigate these issues is feature screening. In this work, the High-dimensional\nOrdinary Least-squares Projection (HOLP) feature screening method is advanced\nby employing adaptive ridge regularization. The impact of the ridge penalty on\nthe Ridge-HOLP method is examined and Air-HOLP is proposed, a data-adaptive\nadvance to Ridge-HOLP where the ridge-regularization parameter is selected\niteratively and optimally for better feature screening performance. The\nproposed method addresses the challenges of penalty selection in high\ndimensions by offering a computationally efficient and stable alternative to\ntraditional methods like bootstrapping and cross-validation. Air-HOLP is\nevaluated using simulated data and a prostate cancer genetic dataset. The\nempirical results demonstrate that Air-HOLP has improved performance over a\nlarge range of simulation settings. We provide R codes implementing the\nAir-HOLP feature screening method and integrating it into existing feature\nscreening methods that utilize the HOLP formula.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7wOL8IyYWo1nSY6vPnL3JS_d-kiQT2VFCdAFw2Ryrp4","pdfSize":"481837"}
