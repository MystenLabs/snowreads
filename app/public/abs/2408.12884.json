These anomalies are observed at relatively high energies, among\nothers, in superconducting cuprates and nickelates. The prevalent understanding\nis that they originate from the coupling to some boson, with spin fluctuations\nand phonons being the usual suspects. Here, we show that waterfalls occur\nnaturally in the process where a Hubbard band develops and splits off from the\nquasiparticle band. Our results for the Hubbard model with $\\textit{ab initio}$\ndetermined parameters well agree with waterfalls in cuprates and nickelates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h0JVracZkXg-c0YVq7IYId1-FMal_siWjfbBkHNaKVM","pdfSize":"19576261"}
