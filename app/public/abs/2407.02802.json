This paper analyzes the robust instability of\nlinear discrete-time systems against stable perturbations via the notion of\nrobust instability radius (RIR) as a measure of instability. We determine the\nexact RIR for certain unstable systems using small-gain type conditions by\nformulating the problem in terms of a phase change rate maximization subject to\nappropriate constraints at unique peak-gain frequencies, for which stable\nfirst-order all-pass functions are shown to be optimal. Two real-world\napplications -- minimum-effort sampled-data control of magnetic levitation\nsystems and neural spike generations in the FitzHugh--Nagumo model subject to\nperturbations -- are provided to illustrate the utility of our results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mXbF4t3wOaxC1s4G9qM8xStiXX03Ok96VMytrz7DlKo","pdfSize":"515473"}
