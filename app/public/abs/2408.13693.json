Here, we look at the one-dimensional MMT\n(Majda, McLaughlin, and Tabak) model on a large interval of length $L$ with\nnonlinearity of size $\\alpha$, restricting to the case where there are no\nderivatives in the nonlinearity. The dispersion relation here is $|k|^\\sigma$\nfor $0 < \\sigma \\leq 2$ and $\\sigma \\neq 1$, and when $\\sigma = 2$, the MMT\nmodel specializes to the cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation. In the\nrange of $1 < \\sigma \\leq 2$, the proposed collision kernel in the kinetic\nequation is trivial, begging the question of what is the appropriate kinetic\ntheory in that setting. In this paper we study the kinetic limit $L \\to \\infty$\nand $\\alpha \\to 0$ under various scaling laws $\\alpha \\sim L^{-\\gamma}$ and\nexhibit the wave kinetic equation up to timescales $T \\sim\nL^{-\\epsilon}\\alpha^{-\\frac{5}{4}}$ (or $T \\sim L^{-\\epsilon}\nT_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{\\frac{5}{8}}$). In the case of a trivial collision kernel,\nour result implies there can be no nontrivial dynamics of the second moment up\nto timescales $T_{\\mathrm{kin}}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
