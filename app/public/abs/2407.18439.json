Its ability to adapt to\nunforeseen pattern changes and swiftly identify anomalies enables prompt\nresponses and critical decision-making. While several such anomaly detection\napproaches have been introduced in recent years, they primarily utilize a\nsingle type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and have been implemented in\nonly one deep learning framework. It is unclear how the use of different types\nof RNNs available in various deep learning frameworks affects the performance\nof these anomaly detection approaches due to the absence of comprehensive\nevaluations. Arbitrarily choosing a RNN variant and a deep learning framework\nto implement an anomaly detection approach may not reflect its true performance\nand could potentially mislead users into favoring one approach over another. In\nthis paper, we aim to study the influence of various types of RNNs available in\npopular deep learning frameworks on real-time lightweight time series anomaly\ndetection. We reviewed several state-of-the-art approaches and implemented a\nrepresentative anomaly detection approach using well-known RNN variants\nsupported by three widely recognized deep learning frameworks. A comprehensive\nevaluation is then conducted to analyze the performance of each implementation\nacross real-world, open-source time series datasets. The evaluation results\nprovide valuable guidance for selecting the appropriate RNN variant and deep\nlearning framework for real-time, lightweight time series anomaly detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
