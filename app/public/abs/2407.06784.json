It is shown that under the mesh condition\nthat $\\kappa^3 h^2$ is sufficiently small, the errors of the solutions to both\nmethods are bounded by $\\mathcal{O} (\\kappa h + \\kappa^3 h^2 )$ in the energy\nnorm and $\\mathcal{O} (\\kappa h^2 + \\kappa^2 h^2 )$ in the $\\boldsymbol{L}^2$\nnorm, where $\\kappa$ is the wave number and $h$ is the mesh size. Numerical\ntests are provided to verify our theoretical results and to illustrate the\npotential of CIP-EEM in significantly reducing the pollution effect.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
