However, the high variance of\ntheir training objective hinders optimisation. We attempt to reduce it with a\ncontrol variate, derived via a $k$-th order Taylor expansion on the training\nobjective and its gradient. We prove an equivalence between the two and\ndemonstrate empirically the effectiveness of our approach on a low dimensional\nproblem setting; and study its effect on larger problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vQDMI7ycgXsYbTGsXQfdOOiO71J568TTsMihoRfkWIA","pdfSize":"7563142"}
