To investigate the\nintrinsic energy scale of the spinon subsystem arising from the model, we\ndevelop a constrained subspace update algorithm within the framework of the\nstochastic series expansion method (SSE) to extract the singlet-triplet gap of\nthe system. The 2D RS state exhibits scaling behavior similar to the infinite\nrandomness fixed point (IRFP), at least within the length scales that we\nsimulate. Furthermore, by rescaling the system size according to the strength\nof randomness, we observe that the data for the excitation gap and the width of\nthe gap distribution collapse onto a single curve. This implies that the model\nwith different strengths of randomness may correspond to the same fixed point.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
