The final aim of the methodology is to build and test\nsmart legal ecosystems (SLE) for Industry 4.0 and 5.0.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1t766Aooj5fL-6gqdtwc9ReAPH3MUb5taTW8w90Z3fc","pdfSize":"718997"}
