In\nthis work, we address this challenge by exploring the estimation of Probability\nDensity Functions (PDFs) for the photometric redshifts of galaxies across a\nvast area of 17,000 square degrees, encompassing objects with a median\n5$\\sigma$ point-source depth of $g$ = 24.3, $r$ = 23.9, $i$ = 23.5, and $z$ =\n22.8 mag. Our approach uses deep learning, specifically integrating a Recurrent\nNeural Network architecture with a Mixture Density Network, to leverage\nmagnitudes and colors as input features for constructing photometric redshift\nPDFs across the whole DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey sky\nfootprint. Subsequently, we rigorously evaluate the reliability and robustness\nof our estimation methodology, gauging its performance against other\nwell-established machine learning methods to ensure the quality of our redshift\nestimations. Our best results constrain photometric redshifts with the bias of\n$-0.0013$, a scatter of $0.0293$, and an outlier fraction of $5.1\\%$. These\npoint estimates are accompanied by well-calibrated PDFs evaluated using\ndiagnostic tools such as Probability Integral Transform and Odds distribution.\nWe also address the problem of the accessibility of PDFs in terms of disk space\nstorage and the time demand required to generate their corresponding\nparameters. We present a novel Autoencoder model that reduces the size of PDF\nparameter arrays to one-sixth of their original length, significantly\ndecreasing the time required for PDF generation to one-eighth of the time\nneeded when generating PDFs directly from the magnitudes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
