When confined along\none or more spatial dimensions, these condensates exhibit a dispersion relation\nreminiscent of superfluid liquid helium, featuring a roton-like minimum. This\nstudy investigates the existence of two-dimensional solitary waves in dBECs\ncharacterised by topological defects (quantised vortices) and their transition\nto vortex-free Jones-Roberts solitons. The explicit connection between solitary\nwaves and roton excitation is demonstrated, supporting Feynman's hypothesis\nregarding the nature of rotons as fading vortex excitations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
