The core concept of GC is to create a smaller, more\nmanageable graph that retains the characteristics of the original graph.\nDespite the proliferation of graph condensation methods developed in recent\nyears, there is no comprehensive evaluation and in-depth analysis, which\ncreates a great obstacle to understanding the progress in this field. To fill\nthis gap, we develop a comprehensive Graph Condensation Benchmark (GC-Bench) to\nanalyze the performance of graph condensation in different scenarios\nsystematically. Specifically, GC-Bench systematically investigates the\ncharacteristics of graph condensation in terms of the following dimensions:\neffectiveness, transferability, and complexity. We comprehensively evaluate 12\nstate-of-the-art graph condensation algorithms in node-level and graph-level\ntasks and analyze their performance in 12 diverse graph datasets. Further, we\nhave developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different GC\nmethods to facilitate reproducible research. The GC-Bench library is available\nat https://github.com/RingBDStack/GC-Bench.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
