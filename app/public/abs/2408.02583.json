Upon\nthe SSB of the $SU(2)$ gauge, the VEV of the Higgs doublet is proportional to\nthe field $\\chi$. Fujii and Wetterich employed this linkage to make particle\nmasses dependent on $\\chi$. We shall present an $\\textit alternative$\nmechanism: at a given point $x^*$, the prevailing Higgs VEV will be used to\n$\\textit construct$ a quantum of action $\\hbar_*$ and a speed of light $c_*$ in\nassociation with $\\chi(x^*)$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given\npoint $x^*$ on the manifold is equipped with a replica of the\nGlashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of\n$\\hbar_*$ and $c_*$, whereas particle masses induced via Higgs SSB remain\nindependent of $\\chi(x^*)$. Our mechanism unambiguously generates the\ndependencies $\\hbar_*\\propto\\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\\propto\\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$,\ncausing these \"fundamental constants\" to vary along with the dynamical field\n$\\chi$ across the manifold. For late-time cosmology, a varying $c$ along the\ntrajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards Earth renders the\nclassic Lema\\^itre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-1}$ inapplicable. Using the\ndependency $c_*\\propto\\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, we derive the new (variable-$c$)\nLema\\^itre redshift relation and apply it to analyze the Pantheon Catalog of\nSneIa $\\textit without$ invoking the dark energy hypothesis. Key consequences\nare: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog with a fit exceeding the quality\nof the $\\Lambda$CDM model; (2) Explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration\nbased on variable $c$, eliminating the need for dark energy; (3) Revitalizing\nBlanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that\nbypassed dark energy [A&A 412, 35 (2003)].\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
