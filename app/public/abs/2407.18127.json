By introducing a family of\nparametrized bounds, we obtain tighter lowering bounds for the monogamy\nrelation compared with the most recently discovered relations. We provide\ndetailed examples to illustrate why our bounds are better.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
