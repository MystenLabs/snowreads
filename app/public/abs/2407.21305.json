Most fiber-based long-distance experiments reported to\ndate have utilized photon pair sources generated in bulk optical crystals, with\nthe entanglement encoded in the polarization degree of freedom. Here, we create\ntime-energy entanglement for photon pairs generated from an on-chip silicon\nring resonator via SFWM process and report the distribution of the entanglement\nover standard optical fiber with distance >81 km.
