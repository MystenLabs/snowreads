For constant transport\ncoefficients, the model has been solved analytically. Here, we extend it to\ninclude energy-dependent transport coeffcients and numerically solve the\nnonlinear equation. Our results are compared with the earlier analytical model\nfor constant transport coeffcients, and with recent deep-quench data for K-39\nat various scattering lengths. Some non-physical predictions from the\nconstant-coefficient model are resolved using energy-dependent drift and\ndiffusion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"FTg3RUgMkrTAcIj5VKjZ1hYNaLcs5zTrhkS631elDC4","pdfSize":"1082408"}
