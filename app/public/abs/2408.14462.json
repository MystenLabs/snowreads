We also consider a general definition of\nthe fluid four-velocity allowing the theory to be valid in a general frame and\nmatching conditions. Consequently, we construct the frame-invariant bulk,\nshear, particle diffusion, and spin transport coefficients, showing that the\nevolution of fluid remains unaffected by spin in the limit of small\npolarization as was the case where the relaxation time was independent of spin\nor momentum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
