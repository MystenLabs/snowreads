Specifically, the MLD of\nGSM is first formulated as a novel polynomial optimization problem, followed by\nthe application of a quantum algorithm, namely, the Grover adaptive search. The\nperformance in terms of query complexity of the proposed method is evaluated\nand compared to the classical alternative via a numerical analysis, which\nreveals that under fault-tolerant quantum computation, the proposed method\noutperforms the classical solution if the number of data symbols and the\nconstellation size are relatively large.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Qfd-kSErl7pq-OvpQWE1OonS2TrE1GyRAXJbdey4Wyg","pdfSize":"511054"}
