In this paper, we give\na complete characterization of the Lawvere-Tierney topologies on\n(semi-)simplicial sets, on bicolored graphs, and on fuzzy sets. We apply our\nresults to establish that 'partially simple' simplicial sets and 'partially\nsimple' graphs form quasitoposes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
