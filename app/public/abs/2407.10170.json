Initially, the preference\nlists of the agents in A are given but the preferences of the agents in B are\nunknown. An algorithm can make queries to reveal information about the\npreferences of the agents in B. We examine three query models: comparison\nqueries, interviews, and set queries. Using competitive analysis, our aim is to\ndesign algorithms that minimize the number of queries required to solve the\nproblem of finding a stable matching or verifying that a given matching is\nstable (or stable and optimal for the agents of one side). We present various\nupper and lower bounds on the best possible competitive ratio as well as\nresults regarding the complexity of the offline problem of determining the\noptimal query set given full information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
