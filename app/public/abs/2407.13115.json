Clinical trial recruitment has a significant impact on trial\nsuccess. Forecasting whether the recruitment process would be successful before\nwe run the trial would save many resources and time. This paper develops a\nnovel deep & cross network with large language model (LLM)-augmented text\nfeature that learns semantic information from trial eligibility criteria and\npredicts enrollment success. The proposed method enables interpretability by\nunderstanding which sentence/word in eligibility criteria contributes heavily\nto prediction. We also demonstrate the empirical superiority of the proposed\nmethod (0.7002 PR-AUC) over a bunch of well-established machine learning\nmethods.
