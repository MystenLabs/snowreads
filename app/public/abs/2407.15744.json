They were first considered in the path analysis developed by Sewall\nWright and play an essential role in statistical modeling. We introduce a\nmatrix algebra for walks on such graphs. Each element of the algebra is a\nmatrix whose entries are sets of walks on the graph from the corresponding row\nto the corresponding column. The matrix algebra is then generated by applying\naddition (set union), multiplication (concatenation), and transpose to the two\nbasic matrices consisting of directed and bidirected edges. We use it to\nformalize, in the context of Gaussian linear systems, the correspondence\nbetween important graphical concepts such as latent projection and graph\nseparation with important probabilistic concepts such as marginalization and\n(conditional) independence. In two further examples regarding confounder\nadjustment and the augmentation criterion, we illustrate how the algebra allows\nus to visualize complex graphical proofs. A \"dictionary\" and LATEX macros for\nthe matrix algebra are provided in the Appendix.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
