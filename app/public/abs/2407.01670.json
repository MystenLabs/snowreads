In many scenarios, some fraction\nof the DM may be boosted to large velocities enhancing and generally modifying\npossible detection signatures. We investigate the scenario where 100% of the DM\nis boosted at the Earth due to new attractive long-range forces. This leads to\ntwo main improvements in detection capabilities: 1) the large boost allows for\ndetectable signatures of DM well below a GeV at large-volume neutrino\ndetectors, such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and JUNO, as possible DM detectors,\nand 2) the flux at the Earth's surface is enhanced by a focusing effect. In\naddition, the model leads to a significant anisotropy in the signal with the DM\nflowing dominantly vertically at the Earth's surface instead of the typical\napproximately isotropic DM signal. We develop the theory behind this model and\nalso calculate realistic constraints using a detailed GENIE simulation of the\nsignal inside detectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
