The mathematical problem\ncan be phrased in terms of quantities in ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge\ntheories that can be calculated by using localization and the AGT\ncorrespondence. In particular through this mapping, the post-Newtonian\nexpansion of the wave form is expressed as a double instanton sum with rational\ncoefficients that resums all tail contributions into Gamma functions and\nexponentials. The formulae we obtain are valid for generic values of the\norbital quantum numbers $\\ell$ and $m$. For $\\ell=2,3$ we check explicitly that\nour results agree with the small mass ratio limit of the wave forms derived in\nthe Multipole Post-Minkowskian and the amplitudes approaches. We show how the\nso-called tail and tail of tail contributions to the wave form arise in our\napproach. Finally, we derive a universal formula for the soft limit of the wave\nform that resums all logarithmic divergent terms of the form $\\omega^{n-1}\n(\\log \\omega)^n$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
