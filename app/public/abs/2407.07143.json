In type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds in the geometric\nregime, the QCD axion mass, $m_a$, is strongly correlated with the topological\nHodge number $h^{1,1}$. We compute $m_a$ in a scan of $185{,}965$\ncompactifications of type IIB string theory on toric hypersurface Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds. We compute the range of $h^{1,1}$ probed by different experiments\nunder the condition that the QCD axion can provide the observed dark matter\ndensity with minimal fine-tuning. Taking the experiments DMRadio, ADMX, MADMAX,\nand BREAD as indicative on different mass ranges, the $h^{1,1}$ distributions\npeak near $h^{1,1}=24.9, \\ 65.4, \\ 196.8,$ and $310.9,$ respectively. We\nfurthermore conclude that, without severe fine tuning, detection of the QCD\naxion as dark matter \\emph{at any mass} disfavours 80% of models with $h^{1,1}\n=491$, which is thought to have the most known Calabi-Yau threefolds.\nMeasurement of the solar axion mass with IAXO is the dominant probe of all\nmodels with $h^{1,1}\\gtrsim 250$. This study demonstrates the immense\nimportance of axion detection in experimentally constraining the string\nlandscape.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
