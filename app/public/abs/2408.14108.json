However, the effectiveness of different policies can vary across\ndifferent aspects of epidemic containment. Identifying the most effective\npolicies is essential for providing informed recommendations for pandemic\ncontrol. This paper examines the relationship between various public policy\nresponses and their impact on COVID-19 containment. Using the propensity score\nmatching-difference in differences (PSM-DID) model to address endogeneity, we\nanalyze the causal significance of each policy on epidemic control. Our\nanalysis reveals that that policies related to vaccine delivery, debt relief,\nand the cancellation of public events are the most effective measures. These\nfindings provide key insights for policymakers, highlighting the importance of\nfocusing on specific, high-impact measures in managing public health crises.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
