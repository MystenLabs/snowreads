We introduce a notion of span between $2$-Segal objects\nand extend this correspondence to an equivalence of $\\infty$-categories.\nAdditionally, for every $\\infty$-category with finite limits $\\mathcal{C}$, we\nintroduce a notion of a birelative $2$-Segal object in $\\mathcal{C}$ and\nestablish a similar equivalence with the $\\infty$-category of bimodule objects\nin spans. Examples of these concepts arise from algebraic and hermitian\nK-theory through the corresponding Waldhausen $S_{\\bullet}$-construction. Apart\nfrom their categorical relevance, these concepts can be used to construct\nhomotopy coherent representations of Hall algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
