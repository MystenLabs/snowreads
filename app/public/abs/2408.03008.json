Previous best bounds for this\nproblem are O(n log n) time with O(n) space, due to Amir et al. [IPL 2002] for\nthe online model, and due to Larsson [CPM 2014] for the sliding model. In this\npaper, we present faster O(n log n/log log n)-time solutions to both of the\nonline/sliding models. Our algorithms are built on a simple data structure\nnamed BP-linked trees, and on a slightly improved version of the range\nminimum/maximum query (RmQ/RMQ) data structure on a dynamic list of integers.\nWe also present other applications of our algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
