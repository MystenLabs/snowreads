The masses of $^{152,153}$La\nwere experimentally determined for the first time. We confirm the sharp kink in\nthe two-neutron separation energies at the neutron number ${N=93}$ in the\ncerium (${Z=58}$) isotopic chain. Our precision mass measurements of the most\nexotic neutron-rich lanthanum (${Z=57}$) isotopes reveal a sudden increase in\ntwo-neutron separation energies from ${N=92}$ to ${N=93}$. Unlike in the cerium\nisotopic chain, the kink is not sharp but extends to ${N=94}$ forming a\nprominent bump. The gain in energy is about 0.4 MeV, making it one of the\nstrongest changes in two-neutron separation energies over the whole chart of\nnuclides, away from nuclear shell closures. The results call for further\nstudies to elucidate the structure of neutron-rich lanthanum isotopes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
