Our system\nextracts metadata, such as author names, titles, publication dates, and\nkeywords, to create standardized annotations within the document. CiteAssist\nautomatically attaches the BibTeX citation to the end of a PDF and links it on\nthe first page of the document so other researchers gain immediate access to\nthe correct citation of the article. This method promotes platform flexibility\nby ensuring that annotations remain accessible regardless of the repository\nused to publish or access the preprint. The annotations remain available even\nif the preprint is viewed externally to CiteAssist. Additionally, the system\nadds relevant related papers based on extracted keywords to the preprint,\nproviding researchers with additional publications besides those in related\nwork for further reading. Researchers can enhance their preprints organization\nand reference management workflows through a free and publicly available web\ninterface.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
