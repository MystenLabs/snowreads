When such states are heavy enough that they\ncannot be produced in oscillations, they are referred to as Heavy Neutral\nLeptons (HNLs). In minimal models, the HNL production and decay are controlled\nby SM interactions and the mixing between HNLs and the active neutrino and\ntypically result in relatively long lifetimes if the masses are in the MeV-GeV\nrange. We have studied the physics case and technical feasibility for a\ndedicated HNL search using the NuMI beam at an ICARUS-like detector. Our\nanalysis conclusively demonstrates that the constraints on the mixing of the\nHNL as a function of its mass for an ICARUS-like detector with NuMI beam are\nhighly competitive with the limits obtained from present experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"CCVIG6ktzjiZF1SkE_1wK_CqHZFvn6bM4PbDtypu6-Y","pdfSize":"2223384"}
