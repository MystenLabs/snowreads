However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costs\nand limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches that\nintegrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novel\nphysics-based AI model called the \"Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger Network\", which\ntreats the Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purpose\ntrainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and\nmemory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methods\nuse neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential\nequations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as a\ntrainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwise\nrequire neural networks. As a type of physics-AI symbiosis, it offers a more\ninterpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-box\nneural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in some time series\nclassification tasks while significantly reducing the number of required\nparameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger Network is\ninterpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of a\nvirtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space.\nThis interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of the\ndata transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have also\nbeen explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposed\nmethod of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinear\nmappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to other\nmaster equations of physics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8AylR1gnEsmw1NP_M3O4UXaQCyOqKLfu7deMWkSUWGM","pdfSize":"1978011"}
