This\nconjecture was recently verified for triangle-free graphs by Lin, Ning and Wu\nand for regular graphs by Zhang. Elphick, Wocjan and Linz proposed a\ngeneralization of this conjecture. In this note, we verify this generalized\nconjecture for the family of graphs on $m$ edges, which contain at most\n$O(m^{1.5-\\varepsilon})$ triangles for some $\\varepsilon > 0$. In particular,\nwe show that the conjecture is true for planar graphs, book-free graphs and\ncycle-free graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
