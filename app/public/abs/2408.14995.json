Algebraically, we demonstrate that the degree-$0$\npersistence diagram of a star-shaped object in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be derived\nfrom the degree-$0$ persistence diagrams of its sectors. Using this, we then\nestablish sufficient conditions for star-shaped objects in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ so\nthat they have ``trivial geometric monodromy''. Consequently, the PHT of such a\nshape can be decomposed as a union of curves parameterized by $S^1$, where the\ncurves are given by the continuous movement of each point in the persistence\ndiagrams that are parameterized by $S^{1}$. Finally, we discuss the current\nchallenges of generalizing these results to higher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
