Local time is the time used in a flat patch of spacetime. We compare\nthe dynamics of a scalar field with respect to choices of global time and\nMinkowski patch time in an expanding cosmology. Our main results are that\nevolutions starting from the same initial conditions are similar on the time\nscales of terrestrial experiments, and that global time leads to a mechanism\nfor evolving coupling constants.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
