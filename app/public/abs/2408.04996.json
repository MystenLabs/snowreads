Both\nconnectionist and symbolic AI are currently being used to support such\ndetection and response. In this paper, we make the case for combining them\nusing neurosymbolic AI. We identify a set of challenges when using AI today and\npropose a set of neurosymbolic use cases we believe are both interesting\nresearch directions for the neurosymbolic AI community and can have an impact\non the cyber security field. We demonstrate feasibility through two\nproof-of-concept experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o0vE2L7l1rRbIvYI71MpelZDqh6QyS3CszHrfbO3MtM","pdfSize":"292744"}
