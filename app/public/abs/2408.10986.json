In this\ncontext, a missing ingredient has been the absence of a bulk description dual\nto a confined hadronic phase at finite baryon density. In this work, we discuss\na class of backgrounds that fill this lacuna. Applying physically motivated\nboundary conditions, we obtain phase diagrams which compare reasonably with\napproaches based on the PNJL model. We also show that such backgrounds can play\na similar role in geometries with a dilaton field.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D2-98RI7a-py4Q344IQ_31ZSfWsDut--r71mkL0apKQ","pdfSize":"1069654"}
