The bench is composed of a Cs+ ion gun installed on\na HV platform and providing beams up to 25 keV. A beam profiler and an\nAllison-type emittance-meter allow the qualification of the setup and also the\ncharacterization of the beam. During the commissioning process, the\nelectronics, and the control system were upgraded in order to push the limits\ntowards low beam currents measured by the emittance-meter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"TfG9VzLIkVpAOnY3CPQFblQFiDb08ejTGNoS_v5zhsg","pdfSize":"988046","objectId":"0x9fb3c816fa800795a9d5312174fde4b5aad1052d8c704fa0c99a2f0ec229e4b0","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
