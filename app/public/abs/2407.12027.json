By\nfine-tuning configuration parameters correctly, we achieved a 40.13-fold\nreduction in configuration energy. Moreover, augmented with power-saving\nmethods, our Idle-Waiting strategy outperformed the traditional On-Off strategy\nin duty-cycle mode for request periods up to 499.06 ms. Specifically, at a 40\nms request period within a 4147 J energy budget, this strategy extends the\nsystem lifetime to approximately 12.39x that of the On-Off strategy.\nEmpirically validated through hardware measurements and simulations, these\noptimizations provide valuable insights and practical methods for achieving\nenergy-efficient and sustainable deployments in IoT.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
