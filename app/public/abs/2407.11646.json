In this paper, we address the challenge\nof causal discovery and effect inference for two traits while accounting for\nunmeasured confounding and potential feedback loops. By leveraging possibly\ninvalid instrumental variables, we provide identification conditions for causal\nparameters in a model that allows for bi-directional relationships, and we also\nestablish identifiability of the causal direction under the introduced\nconditions. Then we propose a data-driven procedure to detect the causal\ndirection and provide inference results about causal effects along the\nidentified direction. We show that our method consistently recovers the true\ndirection and produces valid confidence intervals for the causal effect. We\nconduct extensive simulation studies to show that our proposal outperforms\nexisting methods. We finally apply our method to analyze real data sets from UK\nBiobank.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
