Here, we present a 5-mm-diameter whispering gallery\nmode resonator made of undoped gallium arsenide. The fabrication was done using\nsingle-point diamond turning followed by polishing with diamond solutions of\nvarying grain size. The resulting resonator was optically characterized to have\na quality factor of more than a million.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AhccuSGjEcCd53Y9WbNTZoe_QYeLHvFMGpCKdv3ZGJ4","pdfSize":"8780628"}
