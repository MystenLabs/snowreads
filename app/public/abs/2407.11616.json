Although these libraries are feature-rich and easy to use,\ntheir scalability limitations require more robust computational resources. In\nthis paper, we present PyTond, an efficient approach to push the processing of\ndata science workloads down into the database engines that are already known\nfor their big data handling capabilities. Compared to the previous work, by\nintroducing TondIR, our approach can capture a more comprehensive set of\nworkloads and data layouts. Moreover, by doing IR-level optimizations, we\ngenerate better SQL code that improves the query processing by the underlying\ndatabase engine. Our evaluation results show promising performance improvement\ncompared to Python and other alternatives for diverse data science workloads.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
