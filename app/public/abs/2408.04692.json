DeepVATS is a tool that\nmerges Deep Learning (Deep) with Visual Analytics (VA) for the analysis of\nlarge time series data (TS). It has three interconnected modules. The Deep\nLearning module, developed in R, manages the load of datasets and Deep Learning\nmodels from and to the Storage module. This module also supports models\ntraining and the acquisition of the embeddings from the latent space of the\ntrained model. The Storage module operates using the Weights and Biases system.\nSubsequently, these embeddings can be analyzed in the Visual Analytics module.\nThis module, based on an R Shiny application, allows the adjustment of the\nparameters related to the projection and clustering of the embeddings space.\nOnce these parameters are set, interactive plots representing both the\nembeddings, and the time series are shown. This paper introduces the tool and\nexamines its scalability through log analytics. The execution time evolution is\nexamined while the length of the time series is varied. This is achieved by\nresampling a large data series into smaller subsets and logging the main\nexecution and rendering times for later analysis of scalability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"7QLaBRstw24ZrGL6CNlFFDwzACaxUqHrEFPAgI2H8Ng","pdfSize":"1343576"}
