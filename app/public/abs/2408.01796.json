It provides fast, incremental, and\nreversible actions that allow for an iterative process on a visual\nrepresentation of the result. Despite its numerous advantages, some users\nprefer a programming-based approach where they describe the 3D model they\ndesign with a specific programming language, such as OpenSCAD. It allows users\nto create complex structured geometries and facilitates abstraction.\nUnfortunately, most current knowledge about CAD practices only focuses on\ndirect manipulation programs. In this study, we interviewed 20\nprogramming-based CAD users to understand their motivations and challenges. Our\nfindings reveal that this programming-oriented population presents difficulties\nin the design process in tasks such as 3D spatial understanding, validation and\ncode debugging, creation of organic shapes, and code-view navigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8JQqq2mNpr5YlBH1K0qJbMzNoVIxhHfaAO841F_YgWc","pdfSize":"5476380","txDigest":"NDomwrgdgnc2wkk6Cogxb42kcqAtNCFYyaitYYeVtyf","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
