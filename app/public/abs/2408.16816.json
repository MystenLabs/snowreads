In contrast, the early Universe\nplasma probes these interactions at a more fundamental level. In this paper, we\nconsider the case of a scalar mediating a fifth force, and show that the\neffects of dimensional transmutation, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the\nrunning of the gauge couplings cause the scalar's low-energy interactions to\nmix, leading to nearly universal dynamics at early times. We use known\nexpressions for the pressure of the Standard Model during its various epochs to\ncompute the scalar effective potential, and find that the cosmological dynamics\nof this scalar are very sensitive to the reheat temperature of the Universe.\nGiven the unknown reheat temperature, we show that scalar couplings to matter\nlarger than $\\sim 10^{-6}(m_\\phi/{\\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity produce\nthe correct dark matter abundance, motivating new physics searches in this part\nof parameter space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lC7MfKoEmDxxY4vWp5l7fEnRV7ozExRKRm5mf-S303M","pdfSize":"8217828"}
