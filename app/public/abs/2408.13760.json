Only recently\nnatural examples of theorems from the mathematical mainstream were identified\nthat fit this category. In this paper, we provide many examples of theorems of\nreal analysis that sit within the range of hyperarithmetical analysis, namely\nbetween the higher-order version of $\\Sigma_1^1$-AC$_0$ and\nweak-$\\Sigma_1^1$-AC$_0$, working in Kohlenbach's higher-order framework. Our\nexample theorems are based on the Jordan decomposition theorem, unordered sums,\nmetric spaces, and semi-continuous functions. Along the way, we identify a\ncouple of new systems of hyperarithmetical analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
