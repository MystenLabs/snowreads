Despite its\nimportance for metrology and fundamental physics, our microscopic understanding\nof the QHE is not yet complete. For decades, there has been a discussion about\nthe current distribution inside a Hall bar for the case of a quantized Hall\nresistance. With the advent of quantum technology, the questions, if the\ncurrent flows in compressible Landauer-B\\\"uttiker edge channels or in\nincompressible strips with varying geometry and whether the current flow is\nchiral or not, gain importance, because the quantum phase of each charge\ncarrier depends on its exact pathway. In the present work, we compare\nmulti-terminal current measurements in the regime of the QHE with model\ncalculations in order to unravel the current density distribution in a Hall-bar\ndevice. We find, that the conjecture of chirality is justified for the plateaus\nof quantized Hall resistance, while in between plateaus the current density\nlooses its chirality. The latter is described by the Drude model, which\npredicts a homogeneous current density for a sample with homogeneous mobility\nand carrier density.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
