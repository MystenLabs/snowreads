We show that the relative monodromy group of the abelian logarithm is\nnon-trivial and of full rank. As a consequence we deduce a new proof of Manin's\nkernel theorem and of the algebraic independence of the coordinates of abelian\nlogarithms with respect to the coordinates of periods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"83FKwXB8Ag-vCIvAqiA3KaAA3hMOGgZIC1KKjOaDB2o","pdfSize":"373201"}
