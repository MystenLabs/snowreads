However, the nonlinearity\nof general relativity makes it extremely difficult. There are different methods\nto study inhomogeneous cosmology and provide a straightforward solution to the\naveraging problem in cosmology, such as Buchert's spatial averaging. I am\nattempting to study early cosmic inflation using Buchert equations and the\nMori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism. Buchert equations and Mori-Zwanzig\nformalism's coarse-grained description are the geometrical source of early\ncosmic inflation through higher-order differential equations. It can be seen\nthat the observational data and the given theoretical results are in agreement.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
