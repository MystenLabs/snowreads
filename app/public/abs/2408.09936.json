We propose to\nuse the TL technique in physics. The DNN learns the physics of one process, and\nafter fine-tuning, it makes predictions for related processes. We consider the\nDNNs, trained on inclusive electron-carbon scattering data, and show that after\nfine-tuning, they accurately predict cross sections for electron interactions\nwith nuclear targets ranging from lithium to iron. The method works even when\nthe DNN is fine-tuned on a small dataset.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gPfoMuZCBSON3MR5kSLoJ_Z3qYgr_8hSJKNo4F14EVk","pdfSize":"392040"}
