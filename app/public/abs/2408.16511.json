We consider the case when\na small periodic perturbation is applied to a uniform mesh. For this case, we\nestablish a sufficient stability condition. This allows to prove the (p+1)-th\norder convergence of finite-volume schemes based on p-th order polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
