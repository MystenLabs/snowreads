Asimov, A.C. Clarke) or more\nmodern ones (K.S. Robinson), comics (the adventures of Valerian and Laureline),\nor video games (Mass Effect, No Man's sky) that have a very large cumulated\naudience. Astronomers can use Science Fiction to illustrate physics or\nastronomical facts. It might be a good way to talk about our work, our methods,\nby comparing them to examples with which a large audience is familiar. A few\nexamples are provided in this contribution. In a recent study (Stanwey, 2022),\nit was shown that 93 percent of British professional astronomers have an\ninterest for Science Fiction, and 69 percent consider that Science Fiction\ninfluenced their career or life choice. I am presenting a similar study made\nfor French astronomers, performed during and just after the 2024 French\nastronomer meeting (Journees de la SF2A).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Popular Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
