In general, the\nlacking spontaneous spin-splitting hinders the implementation and detection of\nanomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). Here, we propose to implement AVHE in\nelectric-potential-difference antiferromagnetic $\\mathrm{Cr_2CHCl}$ monolayer\nwith excellent stability, where the spontaneous spin-splitting can be induced\ndue to layer-dependent electrostatic potential caused by out-of-plane built-in\nelectric field. From a symmetry perspective, the introduction of Janus\nstructure breaks the combined symmetry ($PT$ symmetry) of spatial inversion\n($P$) and time reversal ($T$), which gives rise to spin-splitting. Both\nunstarined and strained monolayer $\\mathrm{Cr_2CHCl}$ possess valley splitting\nof larger than 51 meV, which is higher than the thermal energy of room\ntemperature (25 meV). The layer-locked Berry curvature gives rise to\nlayer-locked AVHE. Our work reveals a route to achieve AVHE in AFM monolayer\nwith spontaneous spin-splitting.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
