Moreover,\nblockchain technology has become a pivotal platform with widespread\napplications, especially in finance. Cross-border payments have emerged as a\nkey area of interest, with blockchain offering inherent benefits such as\nenhanced security, transparency, and efficiency compared to traditional banking\nsystems. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging blockchain technology\nand smart contracts to emulate cross-border payments, ensuring interoperability\nand compliance with international standards such as ISO20022. Key contributions\nof this paper include a novel prototype framework for implementing smart\ncontracts and web clients for streamlined transactions and a mechanism to\ntranslate ISO20022 standard messages. Our framework can provide a practical\nsolution for secure, efficient, and transparent cross-border transactions,\ncontributing to the ongoing evolution of global finance and the emerging\nlandscape of decentralized finance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZcCNqpkLoRtb8oiHuOfTbG6B1WhiKQE4aDzrFGz5NP4","pdfSize":"341598"}
