In this work, we critically review and further develop the\nformalism introduced by Dashen, Ma, and Bernstein, which connects the\nthermodynamics of relativistic systems to the information contained in their\nscattering amplitudes. As a demonstration, we revisit the computation of the\nQCD equation of state to leading order in the strong coupling, showcasing the\nadvantages of this method over traditional Thermal Field Theory techniques.\nAdditionally, we apply these tools to the effective theory of a long confining\nFlux Tube in D dimensions, analyzing thermal effects up to and including NNLO\ncontributions. Our results are compared with those obtained using the\nThermodynamic Bethe Ansatz method. We also discuss how these techniques enable\nthe inclusion of non-universal effects in the study of Flux Tubes, while\nrelying solely on the S-matrix as input.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
