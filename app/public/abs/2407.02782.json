Such maps arise naturally in the study of grazing\nbifurcations of hybrid and piecewise flows. In this context the boundary\ncollision of a fixed point of the map with $\\Sigma$ then corresponds to a\ngrazing bifurcation of the flow. We will start by studying one-dimensional\nmaps, and the main result of this paper is a classification of all bifurcation\nscenarios, including: period doubling and robust chaos.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
