Despite that, a standardized HD map framework supporting all\nparts of map-based automated driving and training label generation from map\ndata does not exist. Furthermore, feeding map perception models with map data\nas part of the input during real-time inference is not addressed by the\nresearch community. In order to fill this gap, we presentlanelet2_ml_converter,\nan integrated extension to the HD map framework Lanelet2, widely used in\nautomated driving systems by academia and industry. With this addition Lanelet2\nunifies map based automated driving, machine learning inference and training,\nall from a single source of map data and format. Requirements for a unified\nframework are analyzed and the implementation of these requirements is\ndescribed. The usability of labels in state of the art machine learning is\ndemonstrated with application examples from the field of map perception. The\nsource code is available embedded in the Lanelet2 framework under\nhttps://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2/tree/feature_ml_converter\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
