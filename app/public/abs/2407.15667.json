In this paper, we shall study the growth of\nthe Sylow $p$-subgroups of the even $K$-groups in a $p$-adic Lie extension of\n$F$, where the $p$-adic Lie extension is assumed to contain the cyclotomic\n$\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$. We also establish a duality between the direct\nlimit and inverse limit of the even $K$-groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e0xf04oOU_M2AuNdJiylqbt1FUHuCA0oPyBYiYz3QNQ","pdfSize":"203676"}
