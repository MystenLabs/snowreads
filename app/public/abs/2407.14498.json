Our approach leverages the YOLOv8 vision model to\ndetect multiple hotspots within each layout image, even when dealing with large\nlayout image sizes. Additionally, to enhance pattern-matching effectiveness, we\nintroduce a novel approach to augment the layout image using information\nextracted through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The core of our proposed\nmethod is an algorithm that utilizes PCA to extract valuable auxiliary\ninformation from the layout image. This extracted information is then\nincorporated into the layout image as an additional color channel. This\naugmentation significantly improves the accuracy of multi-hotspot detection\nwhile reducing the false alarm rate of the object detection algorithm. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of our framework using four datasets generated from\nlayouts found in the ICCAD-2019 benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate that\nour framework achieves a precision (recall) of approximately 83% (86%) while\nmaintaining a false alarm rate of less than 7.4\\%. Also, the studies show that\nthe proposed augmentation approach could improve the detection ability of\nnever-seen-before (NSB) hotspots by about 10%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
