Deep learning (DL) shows promise for\nautomation, yet progress is slowed by the lack of large, diverse, openly\navailable labeled datasets of single tree point clouds. This has impacted the\nrobustness of DL models and the ability to establish best practices for species\nclassification.\n  To overcome these challenges, the FOR-species20K benchmark dataset was\ncreated, comprising over 20,000 tree point clouds from 33 species, captured\nusing terrestrial (TLS), mobile (MLS), and drone laser scanning (ULS) across\nvarious European forests, with some data from other regions. This dataset\nenables the benchmarking of DL models for tree species classification,\nincluding both point cloud-based (PointNet++, MinkNet, MLP-Mixer, DGCNNs) and\nmulti-view image-based methods (SimpleView, DetailView, YOLOv5).\n  2D image-based models generally performed better (average OA = 0.77) than 3D\npoint cloud-based models (average OA = 0.72), with consistent results across\ndifferent scanning platforms and sensors. The top model, DetailView, was\nparticularly robust, handling data imbalances well and generalizing effectively\nacross tree sizes.\n  The FOR-species20K dataset, available at https://zenodo.org/records/13255198,\nis a key resource for developing and benchmarking DL models for tree species\nclassification using laser scanning data, providing a foundation for future\nadvancements in the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
