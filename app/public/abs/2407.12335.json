As an application, we derive $K$-closedness results for various\nclasses of noncommutative martingale Hardy spaces, addressing a problem raised\nby Randrianantoanina. The proof of this general result adapts Bourgain's\napproach to the real interpolation of classical Hardy spaces on the disk within\nthe framework of noncommutative martingales.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
