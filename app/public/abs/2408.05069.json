However, none formalize\nthese capabilities in a flexible and quantifiable way. In this paper, we\npropose Capability Deltas, which establish a quantifiable source to craft\nautonomous assistance systems in which one agent takes the leader and the other\nthe supporter role. We deduct the quantification of human capabilities based on\nan established assessment and documentation procedure from occupational\ninclusion of people with disabilities. This allows us to quantify the delta, or\ngap, between a team's current capability and a requirement established by a\nwork process. The concept is then extended to the multi-dimensional capability\nspace, which then allows to formalize compensation behavior and assess required\nactions by the autonomous agent.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
