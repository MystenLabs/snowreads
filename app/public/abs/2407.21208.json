One of the approaches is to consider random\nmanifolds by associating a probability measure to the space of discrete\nsubgroups of the isometry Lie group. The main goals are to prove results about\ndeterministic groups and manifolds by considering appropriate measures. In this\noverview paper we describe several such results, observing the evolution\nprocess of the measures involved. Starting with a result whose proof considered\nfinitely supported measures (more precisely, measures supported on finitely\nmany conjugacy classes) and proceeding with results which were outcome of the\nsuccessful and popular theory of IRS (invariant random subgroups). In the last\ncouple of years the theory has expanded to SRS (stationary random subgroups)\nallowing to deal with a lot more problems and establish stronger results. In\nthe last section we shall review a very recent (yet unpublished) result whose\nproof make use of random subgroups which are not even stationary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"5kOoccRE0B6TMBJE_qNwWXmLkuRxdNA3GZ4oqcpx43Y","pdfSize":"1586693"}
