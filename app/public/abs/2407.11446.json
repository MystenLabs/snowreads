The method allows for analytic\ncomputation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional\nsemi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size\nof the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on\n$\\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave\ninterferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary\nspatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to\nnumerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum\ncorrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the\nearth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local\nproof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters,\nthese corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic\nerrors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially\nimportant for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter\nwave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are\nbecoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity\nsurveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and\nsearches for dark energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
