While the bi-encoder architecture is\nwidely used due to its simplicity and scalability at test time, it has some\nnotable issues such as low performance on seen datasets and weak zero-shot\nperformance on new datasets. In this paper, we analyze these issues and\nsummarize two main critiques: the encoding information bottleneck problem and\nlimitations of the basic assumption of embedding search. We then construct a\nthought experiment to logically analyze the encoding and searching operations\nand challenge the basic assumption of embedding search. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a new perspective on the bi-encoder architecture\ncalled the \\textit{encoding--searching separation} perspective, which\nconceptually and practically separates the encoding and searching operations.\nThis new perspective is applied to explain the root cause of the identified\nissues and discuss ways to mitigate the problems. Finally, we discuss the\nimplications of the ideas underlying the new perspective, the design surface\nthat it exposes and the potential research directions arising from it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
