BNs\nand PBNs are also applied to model manufacturing systems, financial risk and\nhealthcare service systems. In this paper, we propose a novel Greedy Entry\nRemoval (GER) algorithm for constructing sparse PBNs. We derive theoretical\nupper bounds for both existing algorithms and the GER algorithm. Furthermore,\nwe are the first to study the lower bound problem of the construction of sparse\nPBNs, and to derive a series of related theoretical results. In our numerical\nexperiments based on both synthetic and practical data, GER gives the best\nperformance among state-of-the-art sparse PBN construction algorithms and\noutputs sparsest possible decompositions on most of the transition probability\nmatrices being tested.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
