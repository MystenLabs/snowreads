We found that, despite the significant difference in initial\nconditions, the mean density profiles of all models are still close to the\nNavarro-Frenk-White one, albeit with some dispersion. We demonstrate that the\ndensity profile slopes in the innermost part of halo have a significant\nevolution with $z$, which can be used to identify the cosmological model. We\nalso present a toy model resulting in the appearance of core in the central\npart of gravitationally bound dark matter halo.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
