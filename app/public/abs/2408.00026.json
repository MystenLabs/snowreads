In this study,\nwe present an image of the Virgo Cluster taken by LEIA in the 0.5-4.5 keV band\nwith an exposure time of $\\sim$17.3 ks in the central region. This extended\nemission is generally consistent with the results obtained by ROSAT. However,\nthe field is affected by bright point sources due to the instrument's Point\nSpread Function (PSF) effect. Through fitting of the LEIA spectrum of the Virgo\nCluster, we obtained a temperature of $2.1^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ keV, which is\nconsistent with the XMM-Newton results ($\\sim$2.3 keV). Above 1.6 keV, the\nspectrum is dominated by the X-ray background. In summary, this study validates\nLEIA's extended source imaging and spectral resolution capabilities for the\nfirst time.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
