It extends to establishing comprehensive upper and lower bounds for\nthe efficiency of two subsystems. These bounds are applicable to a wide range\nof Markovian stochastic processes, which enhances the accuracy in depicting the\nrange of energy conversion efficiency between subsystems. Empirical validation\nis conducted using a two-quantum-dot system model, which serves to confirm the\neffectiveness of our inequality in refining the boundaries of efficiency.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8lKUCMIW_PKNXN_gWA4cDzCO3j3BQoqSWk_4AFc7eCo","pdfSize":"729339"}
