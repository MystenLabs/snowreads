This critical acoustic signal for human communication is thus\ncharacterized at distinct representational and temporal scales, related to\ndistinct linguistic features, from acoustic to supra-lexical. This chapter\npresents an overview of experimental work devoted to the characterization of\nthe speech signal at different timescales, beyond its acoustic properties. The\nfunctional relevance of these different levels of analysis for speech\nprocessing is discussed. We advocate that studying speech perception through\nthe prism of multi-time scale representations effectively integrates work from\nvarious research areas into a coherent picture and contributes significantly to\nincrease our knowledge on the topic. Finally, we discuss how these experimental\nresults fit with neural data and current dynamical models of speech perception.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
