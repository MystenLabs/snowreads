By using causal factorization and system level synthesis, we\nreformulate this problem as a rank minimization problem over a convex set. When\nheuristics like nuclear norm minimization are used for rank minimization, the\nresulting matrix is only numerically low rank and must be truncated, which can\nlead to an infeasible solution. To address this issue, we introduce approximate\ncausal factorization to control the factorization error and provide a bound on\nthe degradation of the L2 gain in terms of the factorization error. The\neffectiveness of our method is demonstrated using a benchmark.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TIU_LBktsbCWNtAR05-9gT9gkgudYftFESJzJYDU6bA","pdfSize":"827012"}
