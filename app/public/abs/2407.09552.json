Leadered labels have\na large degree of freedom in position con-figuration, but existing methods are\nmostly based on limited position candidate models, which not only fail to\neffectively utilize the map space but also make it difficult to consider the\nrelative relationships between labels. Therefore, we conceptualize the dynamic\nconfiguration process of computing label positions as akin to solving a map\ndisplacement problem. We use a triangulated graph to delineate spatial\nrelationships among labels and calculate the forces exerted on labels\nconsidering the constraints associated with point feature labels. Then we use\nthe Beams Displacement Method to iteratively calculate new positions for the\nlabels. Our experimental outcomes demonstrate that this method effectively\nmitigates label overlay issues while maintaining minimal average directional\ndeviation between adjacent labels. Furthermore, this method is adaptable to\nvarious types of leader line labels. Meanwhile, we also discuss the block\nprocessing strategy to improve the efficiency of label configuration and\nanalyze the impact of different proximity graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
