The existing virtual inertia and frequency\nsupport control are restricted by the normally non-dispatchable energy\nresources behind the power electronic converters. In this letter, an improved\nvirtual synchronous machine (VSM) control based on energy storage is proposed,\nconsidering the limitation of state-of-charge. The steady-state energy consumed\nby energy storage in inertia, damping and frequency services is investigated.\nBased on bandwidth separation principle, an energy recovery control is designed\nto restore the energy consumed, thereby ensuring constant energy reserve.\nEffectiveness of the proposed control and design is verified by comprehensive\nsimulation results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
