To this end, we utilize \\emph{coresets},\nwhich, in the context of the paper, are essentially weighted sets of points in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ that approximate the fitting loss for every model in a given\nset, up to a multiplicative factor of $1\\pm\\varepsilon$. We provide [Section 3\nand Section E in the appendix] experiments that show the empirical contribution\nof our suggested methods for real images (novel and reference), synthetic data,\nand real-world data. We also propose choice clustering, which by combining\nclustering algorithms yields better performance than each one separately.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
