Graphon theory provides an\napproach to overcome these issues by defining limit objects for infinite\nsequences of graphs permitting one to approximate arbitrarily large networks by\ninfinite dimensional operators. This is extended to stochastic systems by the\nuse of Q-noise, a generalization of Wiener processes in finite dimensional\nspaces to processes in function spaces. The optimal control of linear quadratic\nproblems on graphon systems with Q-noise disturbances are defined and shown to\nbe the limit of the corresponding finite graph optimal control problem. The\ntheory is extended to low rank systems, and a fully worked special case is\npresented. In addition, the worst-case long-range average and infinite horizon\ndiscounted optimal control performance with respect to Q-noise distribution are\ncomputed for a small set of standard graphon limits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
