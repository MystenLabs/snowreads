In this\nprequel, we address tackling misinformation in the unique and increasingly\npopular context of podcasts. The rise of podcasts as a popular medium for\ndisseminating information across diverse topics necessitates a proactive\nstrategy to combat the spread of misinformation. Inspired by the proven\neffectiveness of \\textit{auditory alerts} in contexts like collision alerts for\ndrivers and error pings in mobile phones, our work envisions the application of\nauditory alerts as an effective tool to tackle misinformation in podcasts. We\npropose the integration of suitable auditory alerts to notify listeners of\npotential misinformation within the podcasts they are listening to, in\nreal-time and without hampering listening experiences. We identify several\nopportunities and challenges in this path and aim to provoke novel\nconversations around instruments, methods, and measures to tackle\nmisinformation in podcasts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
