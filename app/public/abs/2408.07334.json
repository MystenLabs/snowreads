The medium modifications\nin the pion properties have been stimulated through the effective quark masses\ncomputed using the chiral SU($3$) quark mean field model. We have primarily\nfocused on the impact of isospin asymmetric medium on the distribution\namplitudes (DAs) and parton distribution functions (PDFs) of a valence quark\nfor different baryon density and temperature values. Also, the DAs and PDFs\nhave been evolved to $Q^2=10$ GeV$^2$ and $Q^2=16$ GeV$^2$ for different\ndensities of nuclear medium and results have been compared with the available\nexperimental data. The DAs and PDFs are found to modify substantially as a\nfunction of baryon density as compared to temperature and isospin asymmetry of\nthe medium.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
