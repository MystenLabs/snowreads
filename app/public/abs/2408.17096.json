In this\npaper, we present a Bayesian estimation method that can localize an unknown\nnumber of static sources in 3-D based on TDOA measurements. The proposed\nlocalization algorithm based on particle flow (PFL) can overcome the challenges\nrelated to the highly nonlinear TDOA measurement model, the data association\n(DA) uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the number of sources to be localized.\nDifferent PFL strategies are compared within a unified belief propagation (BP)\nframework in a challenging multisensor source localization problem. In\nparticular, we consider PFL-based approximation of beliefs based on one or\nmultiple Gaussian kernels with parameters computed using deterministic and\nstochastic flow processes. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can correctly determine the number of sources and provide accurate\nlocation estimates. The stochastic flow demonstrates greater accuracy compared\nto the deterministic flow when using the same number of particles.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
