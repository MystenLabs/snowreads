WLQs are an exceptional population of type 1 quasars that exhibit\nweak or no broad emission lines in the ultraviolet (e.g., the C IV $\\lambda\n1549$ line), and they display remarkable X-ray properties. We derive\nH$\\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole masses (median value $\\rm 1.7\n\\times 10^{9} M_{\\odot}$) and Eddington ratios (median value $0.5)$ for our\nsources. We confirm the previous finding that WLQ H$\\beta$ lines, as a major\nlow-ionization line, are not significantly weak compared to typical quasars.\nThe most prominent feature of the WLQ optical spectra is the universally\nweak/absent [O III] $\\lambda 5007$ emission. They also display stronger optical\nFe II emission than typical quasars. Our results favor the super-Eddington\naccretion scenario for WLQs, where the weak lines are a result of a soft\nionizing continuum; the geometrically thick inner accretion disk and/or its\nassociated outflow is responsible for obscuring the nuclear high-energy\nradiation and producing the soft ionizing continuum. We also report candidate\nextreme [O III] outflows (blueshifts of $\\approx 500$ and $\\rm 4900 km s^{-1}$)\nin one object.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
