The\nguiding principle of the proposed approach is that any AI algorithm must\noutperform a random guesser. This may appear trivial, but empirical results\nfrom a simplistic sequential decision-making scenario involving roulette games\nshow that sophisticated AI-based approaches often underperform the random\nguesser by a significant margin. We highlight that modern recommender systems\nmay exhibit a similar tendency to favor overly low-risk options. We argue that\nthis \"random guesser test\" can serve as a useful tool for evaluating the\nutility of AI actions, and also points towards increasing exploration as a\npotential improvement to such systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mu3IbhO6b9SmL75pCDdntf4aElcUZvhEURhWdJ0F-UI","pdfSize":"1079602"}
