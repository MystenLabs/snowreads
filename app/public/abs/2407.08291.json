This type of transformation naturally appears in variational\nrepresentation formulae originating from the theory of large deviations and can\nbe interpreted in some cases, as the solution of a specific stochastic control\nproblem. Under a very general Markovian assumption on $\\P$, we fully\ncharacterize the exponential twist probability measure as the solution of a\nmartingale problem and prove that it inherits the Markov property of the\nreference measure. The ''generator'' of the martingale problem shows a drift\ndepending on a ''generalized gradient'' of some suitable ''value function''\n$v$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
