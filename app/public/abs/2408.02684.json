In such scenarios, the classifiers should be able to i)\nperform classification on known classes, and at the same time, ii) identify\nsamples from unknown classes. This is known as open-set recognition. Although\nrandom forest has been an extremely successful framework as a general-purpose\nclassification (and regression) method, in practice, it usually operates under\nthe closed-set assumption and is not able to identify samples from new classes\nwhen run out of the box. In this work, we propose a novel approach to enabling\nopen-set recognition capability for random forest classifiers by incorporating\ndistance metric learning and distance-based open-set recognition. The proposed\nmethod is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental\nresults indicate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art\ndistance-based open-set recognition methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
