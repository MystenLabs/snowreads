By rewriting it into constrained gradient\nflows, three and four steps numerical schemes based on the Lagrange multiplier\napproach \\cite{ChSh22,ChSh_II22} are proposed to solve the constrained gradient\nsystem. Numerical schemes proposed for the constrained gradient flows satisfy\nthe nice properties of orthogonality-preserving, norm-preserving,\npositivity-preserving and energy dissipating. The proposed schemes are very\nefficient in which only linear Poisson equations are solved at each time step.\nExtensive numerical results in 2D and 3D for optimal partition problem are\npresented to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed numerical\nschemes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
