It is shown that the copulas of symmetric GARCH processes are\njointly symmetric but non-exchangeable, while the copulas of processes with\nsymmetric innovation distributions and asymmetric leverage effects have weaker\nh-symmetry; copulas with asymmetric innovation distributions have neither form\nof symmetry. Since the actual copulas are typically inaccessible, due to the\nunknown functional forms of the marginal distributions of GARCH processes,\nmethods of mimicking them are proposed. These rely on constructions that\ncombine standard bivariate copulas for positive dependence with two\nuniformity-preserving transformations known as v-transforms. A variety of new\ncopulas are introduced and the ones providing the best fit to simulated data\nfrom GARCH-type processes are identified. A method of constructing tractable\nsimplified d-vines using linear v-transforms is described and shown to coincide\nwith the vt-d-vine model when the two v-transforms are identical.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
