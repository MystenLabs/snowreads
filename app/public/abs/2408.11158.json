Here, we introduce a Transition Edge Sensor (TES) based\nphoton sensor with a high sensitivity athermal phonon sensor coupled to the\nsubstrate on which the TES is deposited. We show that single photons absorbed\nlocally in the TES have $\\sim$35% energy deposition in the electronic system of\nthe TES, with $\\sim$26% of the photon energy absorbed by the athermal photon\nsensor (due to athermal phonons leaking out of the TES during the\ndownconversion process). Backgrounds are observed to be largely coupled to\neither the TES or phonon system. At high energies, these backgrounds can be\nefficiently discriminated from TES photon absorption events, while at low\nenergies, their leakage into the passage band is well modeled. With significant\nsensitivity improvements to both the photon and phonon channel, this\ncoincidence technique could be used to suppress backgrounds in bosonic dark\nmatter searches down to energies near the superconducting bandgap of the\nsensor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
