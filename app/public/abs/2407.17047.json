In\nthis work we show how the limiting eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a symmetric\nmatrix $K(\\varepsilon)$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ can be obtained relatively\neasily from successive Schur complements, provided that the entries scale in\ndifferent orders of $\\varepsilon$. If the matrix does not directly exhibit this\nstructure, we show that putting the matrix into a ``generalised kernel form''\ncan be very informative. The resulting formulas are much simpler than classical\nexpressions obtained from complex integrals involving the resolvent. We apply\nour results to the problem of computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of\nkernel matrices in the ``flat limit'', a problem that appears in many\napplications in statistics and approximation theory. In particular, we prove a\nconjecture from [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 2021, 42(1):17--57] which connects\nthe eigenvectors of kernel matrices to multivariate orthogonal polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
