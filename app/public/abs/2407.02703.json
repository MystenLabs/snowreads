It is\nknown that in the classical $K$-theory ring for a given flag variety the ideal\nsheaf basis is dual to the Schubert basis with regard to the sheaf Euler\ncharacteristic. We define a quantization of the ideal sheaf basis for the\nequivariant quantum $K$-theory of cominuscule flag varieties. These quantized\nideal sheaves are then dual to the Schubert basis with regard to the quantum\n$K$-metric. We prove explicit type-uniform combinatorial formulae for the\nquantized ideal sheaves in terms of the Schubert basis for any cominuscule flag\nvariety. We also provide an application ultilizing the quantized ideal sheaves\nto calculate the Schubert structure constants associated to multiplication by\nthe top exterior power of the tautological quotient bundle in $QK_T(Gr(k,n))$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
