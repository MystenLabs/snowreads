It starts with the entry-level \"Physics Playground in\nPython\" for high school and freshman students with no programming experience,\ndesigned in the spirit of the \"Hello World\" approach. At the sophomore and\njunior level, students from all sciences and engineering disciplines learn\n\"Scientific Computing with Python\" in an environment based on the \"Two Bites at\nEvery Apple\" approach. Ultimately, upper undergraduate and entry-level graduate\nstudents take \"Computational Physics,\" to develop their skills in solving\nadvanced problems using complex numerical algorithms and computational tools.\nThis journey showcases the increasing complexity and sophistication of\ncomputational tools and techniques that can be incorporated into the physical\nscience curriculum, serving as a guide for educators looking to integrate\ncomputing into their teaching. It also aims to inspire students by showcasing\nthe impact and potential of computational methods in science education and\nresearch.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EPo4KJ29M6zY0y8NL2oA7KEgO8s90pYP8TwNhCwYvbM","pdfSize":"343633","txDigest":"4J2JBCAGTkWhRdGzEG95VqYf9d8dxBm3noZRpbABXGr5","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
