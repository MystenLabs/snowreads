The Kameko squaring operation $(\\widetilde {Sq^0_*})_{(s; N)}:\n(\\mathbb F_2\\otimes_{\\mathscr A} \\mathcal {P}_s)_{2N+s} \\longrightarrow\n(\\mathbb F_2\\otimes_{\\mathscr A} \\mathcal {P}_s)_{N}$ is rather useful in\nstudying an open problem of determining the dimension of the indecomposables\n$(\\mathbb F_2\\otimes_{\\mathscr A} \\mathcal {P}_s)_N.$ As a continuation of our\nrecent works, this paper deals with the kernel of the Kameko $(\\widetilde\n{Sq^0_*})_{(s; N_d)}$ for the case where $s = 5$ and the \"generic\" degree $N_d$\nis of the form $N_d = 5(2^{d} - 1) + 11.2^{d+1}$ for arbitrary $d > 0.$ We then\nrectify almost all of the main results that were inaccurate in an earlier\npublication [Rev. Real Acad. Cienc. Exactas Fis. Nat. Ser. A-Mat. 116:81\n(2022)] by Nguyen Khac Tin. We have also constructed several advanced\nalgorithms in SAGEMATH to validate our results. These new algorithms make an\nimportant contribution to tackling the intricate task of explicitly determining\nboth the dimension and the basis for the indecomposables $\\mathbb F_2\n\\otimes_{\\mathscr A} \\mathcal {P}_s$ at positive degrees, a problem concerning\nalgorithmic approaches that had not previously been addressed by any author.\nAlso, the present study encompasses an investigation of the behavior of the\ncohomological transfer in bidegrees $(5, 5+N_d)$, with the internal degree\n$N_d$ mentioned above. The appendix discusses the relationship between Nguyen\nSum's papers [38, 42] and our earlier research [18, 21].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
