The high\nresolution X-ray spectra are almost unchanged in the two different dates. The\naverage unabsorbed X-ray luminosity during the exposure was\n4.64$-$5.46$\\times10^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in 2001 and 4.54$-$4.82\n$\\times10^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in 2003, with prominent and red-shifted emission\nlines, mostly of nitrogen, oxygen, iron and argon, contributing to at least\n30\\% of the X-ray flux. The continuum X-ray flux is at least an order of\nmagnitude too small for a hot, hydrogen burning WD. However, the continuum flux\nis consistent with Thomson-scattering reflecting about 5\\% of the light of a\nhydrogen burning WD with effective temperature of 800,000 K, and a mass of\n$\\sim$ 1.2 M$_\\odot$. It has been noted before that a large Thomson-scattering\ncorona explains the X-ray eclipse of CAL 87, in which the eclipsed region is\nfound to be of size the order of a solar radius. The emission lines originate\nin an even more extended region, beyond the eclipsed central X-ray source; the\nemission spectrum is very complex, with unusual line ratios.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
