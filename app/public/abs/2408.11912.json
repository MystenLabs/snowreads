We perform a search for ultraviolet (UV)\nreflection nebulae produced by extraplanar dust around 551 nearby ($D < 100$\nMpc), edge-on disk galaxies using archival near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV)\nimages from GALEX, accounting for the point-spread function (FWHM $= 4''-5''$).\nWe detect extraplanar emission ubiquitously in stacks of galaxies binned by\nmorphology and star-formation rate, with scale heights of $h_{\\text{h}} = 1 -\n2.3$ kpc and $\\approx 10\\%$ of the total (reddened) flux in the galaxy found\nbeyond the B-band isophotal level of $\\mu_{\\text{B}} = 25$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$.\nThis emission is detected in $7\\%$ of the individual galaxies, and an\nadditional one third have at least $5\\%$ of their total flux found beyond\n$\\mu_{\\text{B}} = 25$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in a disk component. The extraplanar\nluminosities and colors are consistent with reflection nebulae rather than\nstellar halos and indicate that, on average, disk galaxies have an extraplanar\ndust mass of $5\\% - 15\\%$ of that in their interstellar medium. This suggests\nthat recycled material composes at least a third of the inner circumgalactic\nmedium ($R < 10$ kpc) in $\\sim L^{*}$ galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
