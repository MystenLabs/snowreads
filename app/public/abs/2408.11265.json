Magnetic Weyl semimetal is one\nespecially interesting example that hosts an interplay between the spontaneous\ntime-reversal symmetry-breaking topology and the external magnetic field.\nHowever, it is less known beyond the anomalous Hall effect thereof, which is\nunable to account for plenty of magnetotransport measurements. We propose a new\nHall effect characteristically nonmonotonic with respect to the external field,\nintrinsic to the three-dimensional Weyl topology and free from chemical\npotential fine-tuning. Two related mechanisms from the Landau level bending and\nchiral Landau level shifting are found, together with their relation to\nShubnikov-de Hass effect. This field-dependent Hall response, universal to thin\nfilms and bulk samples, provides a concrete physical picture for existing\nmeasurements and is promising to guide future experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
