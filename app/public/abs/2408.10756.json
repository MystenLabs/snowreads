While they emerge from attempts to understand and\ncommunicate with nonhumans, they also raise questions on the ethics of nonhuman\ndata use, for example regarding the unintended consequences such data\nextraction can have to nonhumans. In this paper, we discuss power relations and\naspects of representation in nonhuman data practices, and their potential\ncritical implications to nonhumans. Drawing from prior research on data ethics\nand posthumanities, we conceptualize two challenges of nonhuman data ethics for\nthe design of Human-Nonhuman Interaction (HNI) and technologies in sound\necologies. We provide takeaways for how sensitivities toward nonhuman\nstakeholders can be considered in the design of HNI in the context of sound\necologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"iUyKUPX0qhruIkjz5Uxg7U8fCJC_4xCrGt9ge8_-_QE","pdfSize":"98086"}
