For this, we embark on a deeper study of Suszko's Thesis\n($\\mathbf{ST}$) and show that the truth or falsity of $\\mathbf{ST}$ depends, at\nleast, on the precise notion of semantics. We propose two different notions of\nsemantics and three different notions of entailment. The first one helps us\nformulate a precise definition of inferentially many-valued logical structures.\nThe second and the third help us to generalise Suszko Reduction and provide\nadequate bivalent semantics for monotonic and a couple of nonmonotonic logical\nstructures. All these lead us to a closer examination of the played by\nlanguage/metalanguage hierarchy vis-\\'a-vis $\\mathbf{ST}$. We conclude that\nmany-valued logical structures can be obtained if the bivalence of all the\nhigher-order metalogics of the logic under consideration is discarded, building\nformal bridges between the theory of graded consequence and the theory of\nmany-valued logical structures, culminating in generalisations of Suszko's\nThesis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
