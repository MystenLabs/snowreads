We make use of\nthe differential equations method, augmented by an $\\epsilon$-factorized basis,\nwhich allows us to gain full control over the differential forms appearing in\nthe iterated integrals to all orders in the dimensional regulator. We obtain\ncompact analytic expressions, for which we provide generalized series expansion\nrepresentations that allow us to evaluate the result numerically for all values\nof the electron momentum squared. As a by product, we also obtain\n$\\epsilon$-resummed results for the self-energy in the on-shell limit $p^2 =\nm^2$, which we use to recompute the known three-loop renormalization constants\nin the on-shell scheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
