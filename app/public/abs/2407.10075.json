The proposed system integrates photovoltaic\n(PV) sources directly with an electrolyser stack, thereby eliminating the need\nfor traditional power converters. With the removal of traditional power\nconverters, maximum power point tracking is achieved through dynamic switching\nof electrolyser cells in the stack, enabling load variation to maintain optimal\nvoltage for maximum power output. The demonstration methodology involves\ncomprehensive MATLAB Simulink analysis of the integrated system performance\nthrough controlled PV-electrolyser interactions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cEQVJTe4lNCJejXnD2C_W6RsJDTCIRc-0vnF8ShBHIg","pdfSize":"847328"}
