The demand for deploying efficient,\nrobust EPSs in the field, characterized by exceptional (phase) stability, has\nbecome increasingly apparent. This work introduces a polarization-entangled\nphoton source, leveraging type-0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and\nconstructed using commercial bulk optomechanical components. Our system is\nversatile, enabling the generation of N00N states for sensing applications or\nBell states for quantum key distribution protocols. We attained a maximal Bell\ninequality violation, with the average entanglement visibility exceeding 99% .\nThe potential for further performance enhancements is also explored.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"agem-t5hIyjBQ3zkY2uLdvPOpYSZXtTUpt3ae6oyW8c","pdfSize":"786211"}
