Diverging from previous\nevidential deep learning approaches that rely on a single Gaussian\ndistribution, our framework posits that individual image data adheres to a\nmixture-of-Gaussian distribution in stereo matching. This assumption yields\nmore precise pixel-level predictions and more accurately mirrors the real-world\nimage distribution. By further employing the inverse-Gamma distribution as an\nintermediary prior for each mixture component, our probabilistic model achieves\nimproved depth estimation compared to its counterpart with the single Gaussian\nand effectively captures the model uncertainty, which enables a strong\ncross-domain generation ability. We evaluated our method for stereo matching by\ntraining the model using the Scene Flow dataset and testing it on KITTI 2015\nand Middlebury 2014. The experiment results consistently show that our method\nbrings improvements over the baseline methods in a trustworthy manner. Notably,\nour approach achieved new state-of-the-art results on both the in-domain\nvalidated data and the cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness\nand robustness in stereo matching tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
