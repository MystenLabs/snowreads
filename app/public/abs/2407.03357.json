Our GCD formula simplifies a formula of Mazzanti and is derived\nusing Kronecker substitution techniques from our earlier research. By combining\nthis GCD formula with our recent result on an arithmetic term for $\\sqrt{n}$,\nwe derive explicit expressions for the prime factors of a semiprime $n=p q$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
