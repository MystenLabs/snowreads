Theoretical analyses\nhave progressively validated the comprehensive security of this protocol,\npaving the way for practical experimentation. However, imperfect source in\npractical implementations introduce noise. The traditional approach is to\nassume that eavesdroppers can control all of the source noise, which\noverestimates the ability of eavesdroppers and underestimates secret key rate.\nIn fact, some parts of source noise are intrinsic and cannot be manipulated by\neavesdropper, so they can be seen as trusted noise. We tailor a trusted model\nspecifically for the discrete-modulated protocol and upgrade the security\nanalysis accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach\nsuccessfully mitigates negative impact of imperfect source on system\nperformance while maintaining security of the protocol. Furthermore, our method\ncan be used in conjunction with trusted detector noise model, effectively\nreducing the influence of both source and detector noise in experimental setup.\nThis is a meaningful contribution to the practical deployment of\ndiscrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
