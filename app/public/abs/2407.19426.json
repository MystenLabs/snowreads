Ignoring either of the two challenges can lead to detecting spurious\ncausal links among variables of interest. In this paper, we study the problem\nof causal discovery in systems where these two challenges can be present\nsimultaneously. We consider linear models which include four types of\nvariables: variables that are directly observed, variables that are not\ndirectly observed but are measured with error, the corresponding measurements,\nand variables that are neither observed nor measured. We characterize the\nextent of identifiability of such model under separability condition (i.e., the\nmatrix indicating the independent exogenous noise terms pertaining to the\nobserved variables is identifiable) together with two versions of faithfulness\nassumptions and propose a notion of observational equivalence. We provide\ngraphical characterization of the models that are equivalent and present a\nrecovery algorithm that could return models equivalent to the ground truth.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
