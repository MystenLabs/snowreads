These ALMs have\nsignificantly lowered the barrier to creating deepfake audio, generating highly\nrealistic and diverse types of deepfake audio, which pose severe threats to\nsociety. Consequently, effective audio deepfake detection technologies to\ndetect ALM-based audio have become increasingly critical. This paper\ninvestigate the effectiveness of current countermeasure (CM) against ALM-based\naudio. Specifically, we collect 12 types of the latest ALM-based deepfake audio\nand utilizing the latest CMs to evaluate. Our findings reveal that the latest\ncodec-trained CM can effectively detect ALM-based audio, achieving 0% equal\nerror rate under most ALM test conditions, which exceeded our expectations.\nThis indicates promising directions for future research in ALM-based deepfake\naudio detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iptCo22NhsUSi9gl-wJO5eanmzhKFOLZOJFE_McRQW4","pdfSize":"1411332"}
