In\norder to avoid using a sort, we present an $O(m)$ approximation of\n$\\textbf{prox}_{\\alpha ||\\cdot||_\\infty}(\\mathbf{x})$ using a neural network. A\nnovel aspect of the network is that it is able to accept vectors of varying\nlengths due to a feature selection process that uses moments of the input data.\nWe present results on the accuracy of the approximation, feature importance,\nand computational efficiency of the approach. We show that the network\noutperforms a \"vanilla neural network\" that does not use feature selection. We\nalso present an algorithm with corresponding theory to calculate\n$\\textbf{prox}_{\\alpha ||\\cdot||_\\infty}(\\mathbf{x})$ exactly, relate it to the\nMoreau decomposition, and compare its computational efficiency to that of the\napproximation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bLHdvuuY1KiLnisL-eqbofJkF3WHjH7nydrCo5lZ-q8","pdfSize":"966450"}
