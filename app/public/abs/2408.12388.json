There are many forms of oblivious\ntransfer; we explore a variant known as Rabin oblivious transfer. Here the\nsender Alice has one bit, and the receiver Bob obtains this bit with a certain\nprobability. The sender does not know whether the receiver obtained the bit or\nnot. For a previously suggested protocol, we show a possible attack using a\ndelayed measurement. This allows a cheating party to pass tests carried out by\nthe other party, while gaining more information than if they would have been\nhonest. We show how this attack allows perfect cheating, unless the protocol is\nmodified, and suggest changes which lower the cheating probability for the\nexamined cheating strategies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
