In this paper, we study the robustness of optimal quantum\nannealing protocols against coherent control errors, which are multiplicative\nHamlitonian errors causing detrimental effects on current quantum devices. We\nshow that the norm of the Hamiltonian quantifies the robustness against these\nerrors, motivating the introduction of an additional regularization term in the\ncost function. We analyze the optimality conditions of the resulting robust\nquantum optimal control problem based on Pontryagin's maximum principle,\nshowing that robust protocols admit larger smooth annealing sections. This\nsuggests that quantum annealing admits improved robustness in comparison to\nbang-bang solutions such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm.\nFinally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our analytical results and\ndemonstrate the improved robustness of the proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
