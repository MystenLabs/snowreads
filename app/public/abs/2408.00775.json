Drawing inspiration from the representation of\nmultiscale parameterized solutions as a combination of low-rank global bases\n(such as low-frequency Fourier modes) and localized bases over coarse patches\n(analogous to dilated convolution), we propose the Dilated Convolutional Neural\nOperator (DCNO). The DCNO architecture effectively captures both high-frequency\nand low-frequency features while maintaining a low computational cost through a\ncombination of convolution and Fourier layers. We conduct experiments to\nevaluate the performance of DCNO on various datasets, including the multiscale\nelliptic equation, its inverse problem, Navier-Stokes equation, and Helmholtz\nequation. We show that DCNO strikes an optimal balance between accuracy and\ncomputational cost and offers a promising solution for multiscale operator\nlearning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
