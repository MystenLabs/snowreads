The group\nstructures induce two nonequivalent metrics: the Euclidean metric and the Dunkl\nmetric. In this paper, the L^2 space and the Dunkl-Calderon-Zygmund singular\nintegral operator in the Dunkl setting play a fundamental role. The main tools\nused in this paper are as follows: (i) the Dunkl-Calderon-Zygmund singular\nintegral operator and a new Calderon reproducing formula in L^2 with the\nTriebel-Lizorkin space norms; (ii) new test functions in terms of the L^2\nfunctions and distributions; (iii) the Triebel-Lizorkin spaces in the Dunkl\nsetting which are defined by the wavelet-type decomposition with norms and the\nanalogous atomic decomposition of the Hardy spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
