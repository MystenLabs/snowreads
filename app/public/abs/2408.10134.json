However, previous research\ninvestigations in the depth quality of 3D/stereoscopic images are rather\nlimited, and in particular, are largely lacking for 3D viewing of 360-degree\nomnidirectional content. In this work, we make one of the first attempts to\ndevelop an objective quality assessment model named depth quality index (DQI)\nfor efficient no-reference (NR) depth quality assessment of stereoscopic\nomnidirectional images. Motivated by the perceptual characteristics of the\nhuman visual system (HVS), the proposed DQI is built upon multi-color-channel,\nadaptive viewport selection, and interocular discrepancy features. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image\nquality assessment (IQA) and depth quality assessment (DQA) approaches in\npredicting the perceptual depth quality when tested using both single-viewport\nand omnidirectional stereoscopic image databases. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat combining the proposed depth quality model with existing IQA methods\nsignificantly boosts the performance in predicting the overall quality of 3D\nomnidirectional images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
