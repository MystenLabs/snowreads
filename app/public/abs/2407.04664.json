While recent works\nhave shifted focus on achieving fairness (e.g. minimizing the number of envious\nagents), they often come with notable costs on efficiency notions such as\nutilitarian or egalitarian welfare. We investigate the trade-offs between these\nwelfare measures and several natural fairness measures that rely on the number\nof envious agents, the total (aggregate) envy of all agents, and maximum total\nenvy of an agent. In particular, by focusing on envy-free allocations, we first\nshow that, should one exist, finding an envy-free allocation with maximum\nutilitarian or egalitarian welfare is computationally tractable. We highlight a\nrather stark contrast between utilitarian and egalitarian welfare by showing\nthat finding utilitarian welfare maximizing allocations that minimize the\naforementioned fairness measures can be done in polynomial time while their\negalitarian counterparts remain intractable (for the most part) even under\nbinary valuations. We complement our theoretical findings by giving insights\ninto the relationship between the different fairness measures and conducting\nempirical analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
