We propose\nthe idiographic personality Gaussian process (IPGP) framework, an intermediate\nmodel that accommodates both shared trait structure across a population and\n\"idiographic\" deviations for individuals. IPGP leverages the Gaussian process\ncoregionalization model to handle the grouped nature of battery responses, but\nadjusted to non-Gaussian ordinal data. We further exploit stochastic\nvariational inference for efficient latent factor estimation required for\nidiographic modeling at scale. Using synthetic and real data, we show that IPGP\nimproves both prediction of actual responses and estimation of individualized\nfactor structures relative to existing benchmarks. In a third study, we show\nthat IPGP also identifies unique clusters of personality taxonomies in\nreal-world data, displaying great potential in advancing individualized\napproaches to psychological diagnosis and treatment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
