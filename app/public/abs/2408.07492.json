This scheme allows for stationary entanglement in parameter regimes\nwhere strategies based on total energy minimisation ($cooling$) would fail.\nThis feedback strategy, applied to the system of two masses driven\nout-of-thermal equilibrium [arXiv:2408.06251] enables unconditional\nentanglement generation under realistic experimental conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cKCfQ69K8e0u8vTsEdgzDLNb_p5Hcqe9_YbLxyFUo5Q","pdfSize":"653932"}
