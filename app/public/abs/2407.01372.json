Building on this\nobservation, we here introduce a comprehensive approach for examining the\nlocalization characteristics and mobility edges of non-reciprocal\nquasicrystals, referred to as asymmetric transfer matrix analysis. We\ndemonstrate the application of this method to three specific scenarios: the\nnon-reciprocal Aubry-Andr\\'e model, the non-reciprocal off-diagonal\nAubry-Andr\\'e model, and the non-reciprocal mosaic quasicrystals. This work may\ncontribute valuable insights to the investigation of non-Hermitian quasicrystal\nand disordered systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
