Theoretically, we establish a conditional Lipschitz stability for this\ninverse problem. Numerically, we develop an easily implementable iterative\nalgorithm to recover the unknown coefficient, and also derive rigorous error\nbounds for the discrete reconstruction. These results are attained by using the\n(discrete) solution theory of direct problems, and applying error estimates\nthat are optimal with respect to problem data regularity. Numerical simulations\nare provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
