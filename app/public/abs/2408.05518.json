However, it can develop defects that affect the\noptoelectronic performance whether in the production preparation or in actual\nuse. The development of in-situ non-destructive testing (NDT) devices for\nmetallic mesh requires long working distances, reflective optical path design,\nand miniaturization. To address the limitations of existing smartphone\nmicroscopes, which feature short working distances and inadequate transmission\nimaging for industrial in-situ inspection, we propose a novel long-working\ndistance reflective smartphone microscopy system (LD-RSM). LD-RSM builds a 4f\noptical imaging system with external optical components and a smartphone,\nutilizing a beam splitter to achieve reflective imaging with the illumination\nsystem and imaging system on the same side of the sample. It achieves an\noptical resolution of 4.92$\\mu$m and a working distance of up to 22.23 mm.\nAdditionally, we introduce a dual prior weighted Robust Principal Component\nAnalysis (DW-RPCA) for defect detection. This approach leverages spectral\nfilter fusion and Hough transform to model different defect types, enhancing\nthe accuracy and efficiency of defect identification. Coupled with an optimized\nthreshold segmentation algorithm, DW-RPCA method achieves a pixel-level\naccuracy of 84.8%. Our work showcases strong potential for growth in the field\nof in-situ on-line inspection of industrial products.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
