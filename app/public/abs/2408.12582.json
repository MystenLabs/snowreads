This usually consists of some form of the Richards and\nshallow water equations. A typical setup couples these two nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations in a partitioned approach via boundary conditions. Full\ninteraction between the subsolvers is ensured by an iterative coupling\nprocedure. This can be accelerated using relaxation.\n  In this paper, we apply continuous and fully discrete linear analysis\ntechniques to study an idealized, linear, 1D-0D version of a surface-subsurface\nmodel. These result in explicit expressions for the convergence factor and an\noptimal relaxation parameter, depending on material and discretization\nparameters. We test our analysis results numerically for fully nonlinear 2D-1D\nexperiments based on existing benchmark problems. The linear analysis can\nexplain fast convergence of iterations observed in practice for different\nmaterials and test cases, even though we are not able to capture various\nnonlinear effects.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZC9SXgaOjgbhbcU9SBddQgnzLA038Z3f6Uld5wBjI88","pdfSize":"960125"}
