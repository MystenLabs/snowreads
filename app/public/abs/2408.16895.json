Let $V$\nbe a finite dimensional faithful highest weight $\\mathfrak g$-module and let\n$V_\\mathbb{Z}$ be a Chevalley $\\mathbb{Z}$-form of $V$. Let\n$\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z})$ be the subgroup of $G(\\mathbb{Q})$ that preserves\n$V_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ and let $G(\\mathbb{Z})$ be the group of $\\mathbb{Z}$-points of\n$G(\\mathbb{Q})$. Then $G(\\mathbb{Q})$ is \\emph{integral} if\n$G(\\mathbb{Z})=\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z})$. Chevalley's original work constructs a\nscheme-theoretic integral form of $G(\\mathbb{Q})$ which equals\n$\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z})$. Here we give a representation-theoretic proof of\nintegrality of $G(\\mathbb{Q})$ using only the action of $G(\\mathbb{Q})$ on $V$,\nrather than the language of group schemes. We discuss the challenges and open\nproblems that arise in trying to extend this to a proof of integrality for\nKac-Moody groups over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
