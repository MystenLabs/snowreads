We prove that among the 18 consistent normal modal logics\nof finite height extending $\\mathbf{S4}$ known to have CIP, 11 logics have LIP\nand 7 logics do not. We also prove that for intermediate propositional logics,\nthe Craig interpolation property, LIP, and ULIP are equivalent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
