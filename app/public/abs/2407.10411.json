In this paper, to understand how sex ratio and food quantity affect\nthe population growth rate of lampreys, the researchers draw inspiration from\nthe logistics model and established a model called EcoSexChange(ESC), which\nresults in a population initially increasing and then stabilizing, a reasonable\noutcome that may apply to other organisms with significant differences in\nconsumption between sexes. Subsequently, this paper develops the Sex Ratio\nAdaptation Eco Impact (SRAEI) model based on the ESC model using the ABM\nalgorithm to simulate how the population of lampreys, whose lives are divided\ninto seven stages, grows and stabilizes. Then introduces a sudden disaster\nfactor in the middle of the simulation, while also comparing lampreys that\ncannot adjust their sex ratio. The results of this paper are of great reference\nsignificance for people to analyze the population changes of lampreys in\ndifferent living environments, and they are also easy to apply to other species\nwith large differences between males and females.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"SQi0VGXq0Donw58l08t9mFZpRhfLhPtiS-3x3ZrM_E4","pdfSize":"1909731"}
