Here, we\npresent the discovery of two galaxy clusters at $z \\sim 0.95$ with contrasting\nQFs despite having similar masses (log ($M_{200}/M_{\\odot}$)$ \\sim 14$) and\nspectra and redshifts of 29 galaxies in these clusters and 76 galaxies in the\nsurrounding area. The clusters are found in the Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) field\nand confirmed through multi-object spectroscopic (MOS) observation using the\nInamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) on the Magellan\ntelescope. The two clusters exhibit QFs of $0.094^{+0.11}_{-0.032}$ and\n$0.38^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$, respectively. Analysis of large-scale structures (LSSs)\nsurrounding these clusters finds that properties of these clusters are\nconsistent with the anti-correlation trend between the QF and the extent of\nsurrounding LSS, found in Lee et al. (2019), which can be interpreted as a\nresult from the replenishment of young, star-forming galaxies keeps the QF low\nwhen galaxy clusters are accompanied by rich surrounding environments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
