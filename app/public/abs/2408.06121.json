Our approach explores three dynamic knowledge graph\nrepresentations: sequential data, one-hop graph structure, and two-hop graph\nstructure, with each representation incorporating increasingly complex\nstructural information. Each phase includes different machine learning and deep\nlearning models. We empirically analyse their performance and propose an\napproach based on ensemble learning of these models. Our approach significantly\noutperforms the baseline on the ISWC 2024 Dynamic Knowledge Graph Anomaly\nDetection dataset, providing a robust solution for anomaly detection in dynamic\ncomplex data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
