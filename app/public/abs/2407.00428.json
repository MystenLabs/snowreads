In such scenarios, many\ntime-adaptive algorithms based on the interplay of implicit and explicit time\nschemes fail to capture the fast transient dynamics of pressure fields. We\npresent an algorithm that relies on a temporal error estimator using Backward\nDifferentiation Formulae (BDF$k$) of order $k=2,3$. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that the implicit BDF$3$ solution can be well approximated by\napplying a single Newton-type nonlinear solver correction to the implicit\nBDF$2$ solution. The difference between these solutions determines our adaptive\ntemporal error estimator. The effectiveness of our approach is confirmed by\nnumerical experiments conducted on a backward-facing step flow CFD test case\nwith Reynolds number $300$ and on a two-dimensional haemodynamics FSI\nbenchmark.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
