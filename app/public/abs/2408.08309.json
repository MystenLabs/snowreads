Building on\nthese works, we study the even natural moments of partial sums of Steinhaus\nrandom multiplicative functions defined over function fields. Using a\ncombination of analytic arguments and combinatorial arguments, we obtain\nasymptotic expressions for all the even natural moments in the large field\nlimit and large degree limit, as well as an exact expression for the fourth\nmoment.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
