More recent work jointly separates and transcribes, but requires\na separate decoding component for each speaker. We propose the TOGGL model to\nsimultaneously transcribe the speech of multiple speakers. The TOGGL model uses\nspecial output tokens to attribute the speech to each speaker with only a\nsingle decoder. Our approach generalizes beyond two speakers, even when trained\nonly on two-speaker data. We demonstrate superior performance compared to\ncompeting approaches on a conversational speech dataset. Our approach also\nimproves performance on single-speaker audio.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WkQR0yxcH9wiUQzDljOkqGZQjzhj-tsR83XeE_3ok7s","pdfSize":"235150"}
