A spreading-vanishing dichotomy and some sharp\ncriteria were obtained in \\cite{LL}. In this paper, when spreading happens, we\nnot only obtain the exact spreading speed of the spreading front described by\nthe right boundary, but derive some sharp estimates on the asymptotical\nbehavior of solution component $(u,v)$. Our arguments depend crucially on some\ndetailed understandings for a corresponding semi-wave problem and a steady\nstate problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
