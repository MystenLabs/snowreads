In this\npaper we show that if we restrict to models which are generated by finitely\nmany torsion elements (finitely torsion-generated), then we can recover\nstriking rigidity results. Our main result is that if $(W, S)$ is a Coxeter\nsystem whose irreducible components are either spherical, or affine or (Gromov)\nhyperbolic, and $G$ is finitely torsion-generated and elementarily equivalent\nto $W$, then $G$ is itself a Coxeter group. This combines results of the second\nauthor et al. from [MPS22, PS23] with the following main hyperbolic result: if\n$W$ is a Coxeter hyperbolic group and $G$ is $\\mathrm{AE}$-equivalent to $W$\nand finitely torsion-generated, then $G$ belongs to a finite collection of\nCoxeter groups (modulo isomorphism). Furthermore, we show that there are two\nhyperbolic Coxeter groups $W$ and $W'$ which are non-isomorphic but\n$\\mathrm{AE}$-equivalent. We also show that, on other hand, if we restrict to\ncertain specific classes of Coxeter groups then we can recover the strongest\npossible form of first-order rigidity, which we call first-order\ntorsion-rigidity, namely the Coxeter group $W$ is the only finitely\ntorsion-generated model of its theory. Crucially, we show that this form of\nrigidity holds for the following classes of Coxeter groups: even hyperbolic\nCoxeter groups and free products of one-ended or finite hyperbolic Coxeter\ngroups. We conjecture that the same kind of phenomena occur for the whole class\nof Coxeter groups. In this direction, we prove that if $W$ and $W'$ are even\nCoxeter groups which are elementarily equivalent, then they are isomorphic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
