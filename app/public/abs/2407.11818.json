The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is\nroutinely used to solve prototype problems. Currently, hybrid algorithms use no\nmore than one kind of quantum computer connected to a classical computer. In\nthis work, a novel triple-hybrid algorithm combines the effective use of a\nclassical computer, a gate-based quantum computer, and a quantum annealer. The\nsolution of a graph coloring problem found using a quantum annealer reduces the\nresources needed from a gate-based quantum computer to accelerate VQE by\nallowing simultaneous measurements within commuting groups of Pauli operators.\nWe experimentally validate our algorithm by evaluating the ground state energy\nof H$_2$ using different IBM Q devices and the DWave Advantage system requiring\nonly half the resources of standard VQE. Other larger problems we consider\nexhibit even more significant VQE acceleration. Several examples of algorithms\nare provided to further motivate a new field of multi-hybrid algorithms that\nleverage different kinds of quantum computers to gain performance improvements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
