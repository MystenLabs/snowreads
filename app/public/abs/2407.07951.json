Here we present\na conjectured generalization to higher dimensions. For an arbitrary symmetry\nprotected topological phase of time reversal whose action depends on\nStiefel--Whitney classes, we construct a corresponding QCA that we conjecture\ndisentangles that phase. Some of our QCA are Clifford, and we relate these to a\nclassification theorem of Clifford QCA. We identify Clifford QCA in $4m+1$\ndimensions, for which we find a low-depth circuit description using\nnon-Clifford gates but not with Clifford gates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
