Thus, smoke removal task for laparoscopic images is\nhighly desirable. Despite laparoscopic image desmoking has attracted the\nattention of researchers in recent years and several algorithms have emerged,\nthe lack of publicly available high-quality benchmark datasets is the main\nbottleneck to hamper the development progress of this task. To advance this\nfield, we construct a new high-quality dataset for Laparoscopic Surgery image\nDesmoking, named LSD3K, consisting of 3,000 paired synthetic non-homogeneous\nsmoke images. In this paper, we provide a dataset generation pipeline, which\nincludes modeling smoke shape using Blender, collecting ground-truth images\nfrom the Cholec80 dataset, random sampling of smoke masks and etc. Based on the\nproposed benchmark, we further conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the\nexisting representative desmoking algorithms.
