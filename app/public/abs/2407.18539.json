To reformulate generalized games as quasi-variational inequality\nproblems, we will first form a suitable principal operator and study some\nsignificant properties of this operator. Then, we deduce the sufficient\nconditions under which an equilibrium for the generalized game can be obtained\nby solving a quasi-variational inequality. Based on this variational\nreformulation, we derive the existence of equilibrium for generalized games\nwith non-ordered (that is, associated weak preference relations need not be\ncomplete and transitive) and mid-point continuous preference maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U77Kf3IMhxzXr1B7TanV_nEAOsxVgOvZA3N94s6tNr8","pdfSize":"194300"}
