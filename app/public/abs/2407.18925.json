Existing work in the literature\nprimarily focuses on assessing the structural damage at a given moment instead\nof evaluating the development of deterioration over time. To address this gap,\nwe proposed a novel five-component digital twin framework to monitor\ntime-varying changes in historic structures. A testbed of a casemate in Fort\nSoledad on the island of Guam was selected to validate our framework. Using\nthis testbed, key implementation steps in our digital twin framework were\nperformed. The findings from this study confirm that our digital twin framework\ncan effectively monitor deterioration over time, which is an urgent need in the\ncultural heritage preservation community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P8uvXGkZsdLVf0xx0EravxjB_rfzFpLzow8-PQ8_l1s","pdfSize":"1609381","objectId":"0x05555612a6ad34e9920d7bdf743c6d681271d28a1455ffb5f283eb15edcd6f99","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
