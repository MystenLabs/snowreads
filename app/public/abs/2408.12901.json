A group has the PT property if any non-periodic set that\ntiles the group by translation has a periodic tiling complement. This property\nextends the scope beyond groups with the Haj\\'os property. We classify all\ncyclic groups having the PT property. Additionally, we construct groups that\npossess the PT property but without the Haj\\'os property. As byproduct, we\nidentify new groups for which the implication ``Tile $\\Longrightarrow$\nSpectral\" holds. For elementary $p$-groups having the PT property, we show that\na tile must be a complete set of representatives of the cosets of some\nsubgroup, by analyzing the structure of tiles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
