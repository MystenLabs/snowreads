However, maintaining these\nqubits at ultra-low temperatures typically requires complex cryogenic systems.\nThis paper proposes a novel gate-defined double quantum dot (DQD) cooling\nsystem using microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering to\nachieve local temperatures below 10 mK at a bath temperature of 1 K. The system\nutilizes microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering, combined\nwith fast cyclic detuning of the quantum dot on-site energies and Rabi\noscillations, to efficiently transfer thermal populations to the ground state,\nthereby surpassing natural thermal transition rates. The cooling cycle involves\nadjusting gate potentials to drive the system through adiabatic and diabatic\ntransitions, complemented by microwave pulses resonant with specific energy\nlevel differences. This mechanism continuously pumps the population from\nexcited states into the ground state, effectively reducing the system's\ntemperature. Numerical calculations demonstrate the feasibility of achieving\nthese low local temperatures, with detailed analysis showing the sensitivity of\ncooling performance to detuning energy, magnetic field strength, and diabatic\nreturn time.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
