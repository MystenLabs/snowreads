The simulated events are used to\nstudy the model predictions for the Collins asymmetries of mesons produced\nback-to-back in the $e^+e^-$ center of mass system by using both the thrust\naxis method and the hadronic plane method. The obtained asymmetries are\ncompared to the available data from the BELLE and BABAR experiments and the\nunderlying Collins analysing power from the string+${}^3P_0$ model is compared\nwith phenomenological extractions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
