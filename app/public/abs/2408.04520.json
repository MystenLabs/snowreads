Its importance ranges from the fundamentals of chemical\nreactions to the design of new therapies and materials. Previous molecular\nmachine learning models have employed strings, fingerprints, global features,\nand simple molecular graphs that are inherently information-sparse\nrepresentations. However, as the complexity of prediction tasks increases, the\nmolecular representation needs to encode higher fidelity information. This work\nintroduces a novel approach to infusing quantum-chemical-rich information into\nmolecular graphs via stereoelectronic effects. We show that the explicit\naddition of stereoelectronic interactions significantly improves the\nperformance of molecular machine learning models. Furthermore,\nstereoelectronics-infused representations can be learned and deployed with a\ntailored double graph neural network workflow, enabling its application to any\ndownstream molecular machine learning task. Finally, we show that the learned\nrepresentations allow for facile stereoelectronic evaluation of previously\nintractable systems, such as entire proteins, opening new avenues of molecular\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
