Then,\nwe analyze the performance of sensing and communication in terms of achievable\nmean square error (MSE) and achievable rate, respectively, and reveal the\nimpact of key parameters. Next, with the derived performance expressions, we\njointly optimize the phase shift matrix of IRS and the receive combining vector\nat the base station (BS) to improve the overall performance of integrated\nsensing and communication. Finally, extensive simulation results confirm the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms in high-mobility systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
