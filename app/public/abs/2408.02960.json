MAPF-LNS, based on Large Neighborhood\nSearch (LNS), is the current state-of-the-art approach where a fast initial\nsolution is iteratively optimized by destroying and repairing selected paths of\nthe solution. Current MAPF-LNS variants commonly use an adaptive selection\nmechanism to choose among multiple destroy heuristics. However, to determine\npromising destroy heuristics, MAPF-LNS requires a considerable amount of\nexploration time. As common destroy heuristics are non-adaptive, any\nperformance bottleneck caused by these heuristics cannot be overcome via\nadaptive heuristic selection alone, thus limiting the overall effectiveness of\nMAPF-LNS in terms of solution cost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive\nDelay-based Destroy-and-Repair Enhanced with Success-based Self-Learning\n(ADDRESS) as a single-destroy-heuristic variant of MAPF-LNS. ADDRESS applies\nrestricted Thompson Sampling to the top-K set of the most delayed agents to\nselect a seed agent for adaptive LNS neighborhood generation. We evaluate\nADDRESS in multiple maps from the MAPF benchmark set and demonstrate cost\nimprovements by at least 50% in large-scale scenarios with up to a thousand\nagents, compared with the original MAPF-LNS and other state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
