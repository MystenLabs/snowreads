The paper\nretraces the events that led to the discovery of unexpected quantum behavior of\nkeV atoms during the thesis of Patrick Rousseau in Orsay and Andreas Schueller\nin Berlin. In Orsay, it started by diffraction spots whereas in Berlin\nsupernumerary rainbows were first identified at keV. Though the discovery was\nnot anticipated, it did not take place by accident, everything was in place\nseveral years before, waiting only for an interest in neutral projectiles with\na touch of curiosity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
