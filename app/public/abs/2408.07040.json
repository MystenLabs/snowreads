Deep\nlearning models adopted for this task must ensure accurate and reliable\npredictions to avoid economic losses and environmental impact. The newly\nproposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer promising advancements in the\nperformance of neural networks. This paper analyzes the integration of KAN\nlayers into the U-Net architecture (U-KAN) to segment crop fields using\nSentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images and provides an analysis of the\nperformance and explainability of these networks. Our findings indicate a 2\\%\nimprovement in IoU compared to the traditional full-convolutional U-Net model\nin fewer GFLOPs. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation techniques show that\nU-KAN predictions are highly plausible and that the network has a very high\nability to focus on the boundaries of cultivated areas rather than on the areas\nthemselves. The per-channel relevance analysis also reveals that some channels\nare irrelevant to this task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
