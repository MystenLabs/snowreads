In particular, we investigate\ninterfaces and parameterized families of them within the framework of matrix\nproduct states. After revealing how to extract the $\\mathcal{C}$-SPT invariant,\nwe identify the algebraic structure of symmetry operators acting on the\ninterface of two $\\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. By studying the representation\ntheory of this algebra, we show that there must be a degenerate interface mode\nbetween different $\\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. This result generalizes the\nbulk-boundary correspondence for ordinary SPT phases. We then propose the\nclassification of one-parameter families of $\\mathcal{C}$-SPT states based on\nthe explicit construction of invariants of such families. Our invariant is\nidentified with a non-abelian generalization of the Thouless charge pump, which\nis the pump of a local excitation within a $\\mathcal{C}$-SPT phase. Finally, by\ngeneralizing the results for one-parameter families of SPT phases, we\nconjecture the classification of general parameterized families of general\ngapped phases with finite non-invertible symmetries in both 1+1d and higher\ndimensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
