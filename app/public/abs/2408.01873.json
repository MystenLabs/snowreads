We construct a\nmapping from the set of operator coefficients to the set of spectral data,\nsimilar to the corresponding mapping for the Hill operator constructed by E.\nKorotyaev. We prove that in a neighborhood of zero our mapping is analytic and\none-to-one.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
