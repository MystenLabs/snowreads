Using\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy\n(IETS), covalently-bonded phenalenyl dimers have been shown to feature\nconductance steps associated with singlet-triplet excitations of a spin-$1/2$\ndimer with antiferromagnetic exchange. Here, we address the possibility of\ntuning the magnitude of the exchange interactions by varying the dihedral angle\nbetween the two molecules within a dimer. Theoretical methods, ranging from\ndensity functional theory calculations to many-body model Hamiltonians solved\nwithin different levels of approximation, are used to explain STM-IETS\nmeasurements of twisted phenalenyl dimers on a h-BN/Rh(111) surface. By means\nof first-principles calculations, we also propose strategies to induce sizable\ntwist angles in surface-adsorbed phenalenyl dimers via functional groups,\nincluding a photoswitchable scheme. This work paves the way toward tuning\nmagnetic couplings in carbon-based spin chains and two-dimensional lattices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
