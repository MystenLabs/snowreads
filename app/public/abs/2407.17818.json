Master rate equations with\nthe inelastic scattering are established. The scattering is caused by quark\ninterchange in association with color interactions between all constituent\npairs in different mesons. We consider fifty-one reactions between charmed\nstrange mesons and open-charm mesons. Unpolarized cross sections for the\nreactions are obtained from a temperature-dependent interquark potential.\nTemperature dependence of the cross sections leads to that contributions of the\nreactions to the production of $\\psi (4040)$, $\\psi (4160)$, and $\\psi (4415)$\nchange with decreasing temperature during evolution of hadronic matter. For\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV it turned out from the\nmaster rate equations that the $\\psi(4040)$ number density is larger than the\n$\\psi(4160)$ number density which is larger than the $\\psi(4415)$ number\ndensity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
