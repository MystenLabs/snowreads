This paper introduces a novel approach that\nleverages large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, combined with\nmulti-round prompt engineering to enhance decision-making processes in\nagricultural machinery management. We systematically developed and refined\nprompts to guide the LLMs in generating precise and contextually relevant\noutputs. Our approach was evaluated using a manually curated dataset from\nvarious online sources, and performance was assessed with accuracy and GPT-4\nScores. Comparative experiments were conducted using LLama-2-70B, ChatGPT, and\nGPT-4 models, alongside baseline and state-of-the-art methods such as Chain of\nThought (CoT) and Thought of Thought (ThoT). The results demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms these approaches, achieving higher accuracy\nand relevance in generated responses. This paper highlights the potential of\nadvanced prompt engineering techniques in improving the robustness and\napplicability of AI in agricultural contexts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
