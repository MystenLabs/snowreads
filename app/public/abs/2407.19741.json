We find that,the scaling size\ndetermines the scaling behavior of the processes like in \\cite{MR3313750}.\nSpecifically,after suitable rescaling, the limit of the sequence of Hawkes\nprocesses is deterministic.And also with another appropriate rescaling, the\nsequence converges in law to an integrated Cox Ingersoll Ross like process.\nThis theoretical result may apply to model the recent COVID19 in epidemiology\nand in social network.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
