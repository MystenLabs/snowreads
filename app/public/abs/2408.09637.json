We use the widely\nstudied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where\nan atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators.\nIn this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the\nenvironment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of\nquantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in\nopen quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment\nvaries with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to\nthese nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a\nnonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state\namplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the\nnon-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement\nfeedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the\nsteady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple\ncoupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can\ninfluence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the\nresulting stable and unstable subspaces.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
