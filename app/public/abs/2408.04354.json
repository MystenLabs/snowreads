The model\nintroduces a parameter $c$ affecting the evolution equations, motivated by a\nmodified Poisson algebra inspired by effective Loop Quantum Cosmology. Our\nanalysis includes diverse background datasets such as Cosmic Chronometers,\nPantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae (with and without the SH0ES calibration), SDSS,\nDESY6 and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and background information of the\nCosmic Microwave Background. We find that the model alleviates the Hubble\ntension in most of the dataset combinations, with cases reducing discrepancies\nto below $1\\sigma$ when including SH0ES. However, the model exhibits minimal\nimprovement in the overall fit when compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, and Bayesian\nevidence generally favors the standard model. Theoretical foundations support\nthis approach as a subtle adjustment to low-redshift dynamics, suggesting\npotential for further exploration into extensions of $\\Lambda$CDM. Despite\nchallenges in data fitting, our findings underscore the promise of small-scale\nmodifications in reconciling cosmological tensions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
