The molecules are produced by laser ablation inside the\ncell and extracted into a beam by a flow of cold helium. We measure the flux\nand velocity distribution of the beam as a function of ablation energy, helium\nflow rate, cell temperature, and the size of the gap between the first and\nsecond stages of the cell. We also compare the velocity distributions from\none-stage and two-stage cells. The one-stage cell emits a beam with a speed of\nabout 82 m s$^{-1}$ and a translational temperature of 0.63 K. The slowest\nbeams are obtained using the two-stage cell at the lowest achievable cell\ntemperature of 1.8 K. This beam has a peak velocity of 56 m s$^{-1}$ and a flux\nof $9 \\times 10^9$ ground state molecules per steradian per pulse, with a\nsubstantial fraction at speeds below 40 m s$^{-1}$. These slow molecules can be\ndecelerated further by radiation pressure slowing and then captured in a\nmagneto-optical trap.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
