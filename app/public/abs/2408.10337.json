{"id":"2408.10337","title":"Classifying Fano 4-folds with a rational fibration onto a 3-fold","authors":"Cinzia Casagrande, Saverio Andrea Secci","authorsParsed":[["Casagrande","Cinzia",""],["Secci","Saverio Andrea",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 18:22:34 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-21","timestamp":1724091754000,"abstract":"  We study smooth, complex Fano 4-folds X with a rational contraction onto a\n3-fold, namely a rational map X-->Y that factors as a sequence of flips X-->X'\nfollowed by a surjective morphism X'->Y with connected fibers, where Y is\nnormal, projective, and dim Y=3. We show that if X has a rational contraction\nonto a 3-fold and X is not a product of del Pezzo surfaces, then the Picard\nnumber rho(X) of X is at most 9; this bound is sharp. As an application, we\nshow that every Fano 4-fold X with rho(X)=12 is isomorphic to a product of\nsurfaces, thus improving the result by the first named author that shows the\nsame for rho(X)>12. We also give a classification result for Fano 4-folds X,\nnot products of surfaces, having a \"special\" rational contraction X-->Y with\ndim Y=3, rho(X)-rho(Y)=2, and rho(X)>6; we show that there are only three\npossible families. Then we prove that the first family exists if rho(X)=7, and\nthat the second family exists if and only if rho(X)=7. This provides the first\nexamples of Fano 4-folds with rho(X)>6 different from products of del Pezzo\nsurfaces and from the Fano models of the blow-up of P^4 in points. We also\nconstruct three new families with rho(X)=6. Finally we show that if a Fano\n4-fold X has Lefschetz defect delta(X)=2, then rho(X) is at most 6; this bound\nis again sharp.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
