We present evidence that this new\nparameterization is algorithmically useful in the form of new results for two\ndifficult, well-studied problems: Integer Programming and Subset Sum.\n  First, we show that determining the feasibility of bounded Integer Programs\nis a tractable problem when parameterized in the doubling constant.\nSpecifically, we prove that the feasibility of an integer program $I$ with $n$\npolynomially-bounded variables and $m$ constraints can be determined in time\n$n^{O_C(1)} poly(|I|)$ when the column set of the constraint matrix has\ndoubling constant $C$.\n  Second, we show that the Subset Sum and Unbounded Subset Sum problems can be\nsolved in time $n^{O_C(1)}$ and $n^{O_C(\\log \\log \\log n)}$, respectively,\nwhere the $O_C$ notation hides functions that depend only on the doubling\nconstant $C$. We also show the equivalence of achieving an FPT algorithm for\nSubset Sum with bounded doubling and achieving a milestone result for the\nparameterized complexity of Box ILP. Finally, we design near-linear time\nalgorithms for $k$-SUM as well as tight lower bounds for 4-SUM and nearly tight\nlower bounds for $k$-SUM, under the $k$-SUM conjecture.\n  Several of our results rely on a new proof that Freiman's Theorem, a central\nresult in additive combinatorics, can be made efficiently constructive. This\nresult may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z44QYkZjEbkezA48Zblz55cijdcVPt4qhVW5ZHCuJes","pdfSize":"366850","objectId":"0xdc06ff638d46e055c71a5225c1846f2b05a1e1dc2aca252975fa51cf35fb6c26","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
