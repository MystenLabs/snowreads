When a\nmirror segment becomes misaligned due to various environmental factors, such as\nspace debris, the images can become distorted with a shifted copy of itself\ncalled a \"ghost image\". To detect whether segments are misaligned, we use\npre-trained, large-scale image models trained on the Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT) of patches of satellite images in grayscale. Multi-mirror designs can use\nany arbitrary number of mirrors. For our purposes, the tests were performed on\nsimulated CubeSats with 4, 6, and 8 segments. For system design, we took this\ninto account when we want to know when a satellite has a misaligned segment and\nhow many segments are misaligned. The intensity of the ghost image is directly\nproportional to the number of segments misaligned. Models trained for intensity\nclassification attempted to classify N-1 segments. Across eight classes, binary\nmodels were able to achieve a classification accuracy of 98.75%, and models for\nintensity classification were able to achieve an accuracy of 98.05%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
