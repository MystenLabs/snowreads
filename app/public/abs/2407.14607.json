This presents a difficulty for their\ncalculation in general, where there are no restrictions on the gauge function\nexcept that it be differentiable. These cases are relevant for complex-valued\nelectronic wave functions, such as those that arise in the presence of a\nmagnetic field or spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, the Berry curvature and\nBerry force play an important role in molecular dynamics in a magnetic field,\nand are also relevant in the context of spin-orbit coupling. For methods such\nas surface hopping, excited-state Berry curvatures will also be of interest.\nWith this in mind, we have developed a scheme for the calculation of\ncontinuous, differentiable NACMEs as a function of the molecular geometry for\ncomplex-valued wave functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by\nusing the H$_2$ molecule at the full configuration-interaction (FCI) level of\ntheory. Additionally, ground- and excited- state Berry curvatures are computed\nfor the first time using FCI theory. Finally, Berry phases are computed\ndirectly in terms of diagonal NACMEs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
