By simultaneously transmitting multiple beams,\nthe system can accurately receive sound waves reflected from the seabed,\nproviding more precise and comprehensive water depth information while\neffectively revealing the complexity and characteristics of underwater terrain.\nBuilding upon the background and application provided by Question B of the 2023\nNational Mathematical Contest in Modeling for College Students, this paper\ninvestigates the relationship between ocean floor width measurement and factors\nsuch as beam position, angle, and slope. Utilizing geometric relations,\ntrigonometric similarity, and sine theorem, a mathematical model is established\nto determine adjacent strip coverage width and overlap ratio. Furthermore, an\noptimal strategy is determined using a greedy algorithm, while binary search\nbacktracking is employed to derive the interval of the next adjacent survey\nline with the required overlap ratio in order to obtain an optimal terrain\ndetection strategy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
