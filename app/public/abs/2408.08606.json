In this paper we weaken primitivity and permit several pairs of (left and\nright) eigenvalues satisfying a more general fusion rule, bringing in\ninteresting new examples such as the band semigroup algebras and other\ncommutative and noncommutative examples. Also we broaden our investigation and\ndescribe 2-generated algebras in which only one of the generating axes is\nweakly primitive and satisfies the fusion rules, on condition that its\nzero-eigenspace is one dimensional. We also characterize when both axes satisfy\nthe fusion rules (weak PAJ's), and describe precisely the 2-dimensional axial\nalgebras. In contrast to the previous situation, there are weak PAJ's of\ndimension~$> 3$ generated by two axes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
