These refined\n$q,t$-Catalan numbers depend on a vector of parameters $\\vec{k}$ and the\nclassical $q,t$-Catalan numbers are recovered when $\\vec{k} = (1,\\ldots,1)$. We\ninterpret Xin and Zhang's generating functions by developing polyhedral cones\narising from constraints on $\\vec{k}$-Dyck paths and their associated area and\nbounce statistics. Through this polyhedral approach, we recover Xin and Zhang's\ntheorem on $q,t$-symmetry of the refined $q,t$-Catalan numbers in the cases\nwhere $\\vec{k} = (k_1,k_2,k_3)$ and $(k,k,k,k)$, give some extensions,\nincluding the case $\\vec{k} = (k,k+m,k+m,k+m)$, and discuss relationships to\nother generalizations of the $q,t$-Catalan numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
