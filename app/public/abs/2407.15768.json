The earliest\ndetection of this SN can be traced back to a few hours after the explosion.\nWithin the first few days the light curve shows a bump feature, while the B - V\ncolor is blue and remains nearly constant. The overall spectral evolution is\nsimilar to that of an SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like SN Ia, while the C II\n$\\lambda6580$ absorption line appears to be unusually strong in the first\nspectrum taken at $t \\approx -$15.4 days after the maximum light. This carbon\nfeature disappears quickly in subsequent evolution but it reappears at around\nthe time of peak brightness. The complex evolution of the carbon line and the\npossible detection of Ni III absorption around 4700 {\\AA} and 5300 {\\AA} in the\nearliest spectra indicate macroscopic mixing of fuel and ash. The strong carbon\nlines is likely related to collision of SN ejecta with unbound carbon,\nconsistent with the predictions of pulsational delayed-detonation or\ncarbon-rich circumstellar-matter interaction models. Among those carbon-rich\nSNe Ia with strong C II $\\lambda6580$ absorption at very early times, the\nline-strength ratio of C II to Si II and the B-V color evolution are found to\nexhibit large diversity, which may be attributed to different properties of\nunbound carbon and outward-mixing $^{56}$Ni.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
