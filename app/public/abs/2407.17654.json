The model, trained\non data from the US Army's Predictive Logistics program, aims to support\npredictive maintenance. It forecasts faults far enough in advance to execute a\nmaintenance intervention before a breakdown occurs. The model incorporates\nreal-world factors that affect vehicle health. It also allows us to understand\nthe vehicle's condition by analyzing operating data, and characterizing each\nvehicle into discrete states. Importantly, the model predicts the time to first\nfault with high accuracy. We compare its performance to other models and\ndemonstrate its successful training.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GIcKI7b3oFgs0IsqoxWa-5b2UcLrxH9tLxYLNdHfQpY","pdfSize":"3898853"}
