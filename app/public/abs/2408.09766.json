We design and prototype DSL Assistant, a tool that\nintegrates generative language models to support the development of DSLs. DSL\nAssistant uses OpenAI's assistant API with GPT-4o to generate DSL grammars and\nexample instances. To reflect real-world use, DSL Assistant supports several\ndifferent interaction modes for evolving a DSL design, and includes automatic\nerror repair. Our experiments show that DSL Assistant helps users to create and\nmodify DSLs. However, the quality of the generated DSLs depends on the specific\ndomain and the followed interaction patterns.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
