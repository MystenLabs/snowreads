Let\n$R=\\mathbb{K}[x_1, \\ldots, x_d]$ with $d\\geq 4$ be a polynomial ring with\nhomogeneous maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$. We study the $R$-ideals $I$, which\nare $\\mathfrak{m}$-primary, Gorenstein, generated in degree 2, and have a\nGorenstein linear resolution. In the smallest case, $d=4$, this family includes\nthe ideals of $2\\times 2$ minors of a general $3\\times 3$ matrix of linear\nforms in $R$. We show that the defining ideal of the Rees algebra will be of\nfiber type. That is, the defining ideal of the Rees algebra is generated by the\ndefining ideals of the special fiber ring and of the symmetric algebra. We use\nthe fact that these ideals differ from $\\mathfrak{m}^2$ by exactly one minimal\ngenerator to describe the defining ideal $\\mathfrak{F}(I)$ as a sub-ideal of\nthe defining ideal of $\\mathfrak{F}(\\mathfrak{m}^2)$, which is well known to be\nthe ideal of $2\\times 2$ minors of a symmetric matrix of variables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Yeuk577ewmzc7wPLP9SLsLIXtOR901fEUM9tFU-TWIs","pdfSize":"242227"}
