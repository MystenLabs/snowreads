This\nspacial nonconforming $P_2$ finite element, combined with the discontinuous\n$P_1$ finite element on general tetrahedral grids, is inf-sup stable for\nsolving the Stokes equations. Consequently such a mixed finite element method\nproduces optimal-order convergen solutions for solving the stationary Stokes\nequations. Numerical tests confirm the theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AJ56Br2vkZ858PgQfmT6gDgAfma-KMd_MP0-UTmOYYc","pdfSize":"414901"}
