We integrate\nthe push- and pull-based update communication models to obtain a push-and-pull\nmodel, which allows the transmission controller at the SA to decide to push an\nupdate to the AA and the query controller at the AA to pull updates by raising\nqueries at specific time instances. To gauge effectiveness, we utilize a grade\nof effectiveness (GoE) metric incorporating updates' freshness, usefulness, and\ntimeliness of actions as qualitative attributes. We then derive effect-aware\npolicies to maximize the expected discounted sum of updates' effectiveness\nsubject to induced costs. The effect-aware policy at the SA considers the\npotential effectiveness of communicated updates at the endpoint, while at the\nAA, it accounts for the probabilistic evolution of the source and importance of\ngenerated updates. Our results show the proposed push-and-pull model\noutperforms models solely based on push- or pull-based updates both in terms of\nefficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, using effect-aware policies at both\nagents enhances effectiveness compared to periodic and/or probabilistic\neffect-agnostic policies at either or both agents.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
