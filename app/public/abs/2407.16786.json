In this paper,\nwe consider a structural equation model where the target variable is described\nby a generalised additive model conditional on its parents. Besides having\nfinite moments, no modelling assumptions are made on the conditional\ndistributions of the other variables in the system. Under this setting, we\ncharacterise the causal model uniquely by means of two key properties: the\nPearson residuals are invariant under the causal model and conditional on the\ncausal parents the causal parameters maximise the population likelihood. These\ntwo properties form the basis of a computational strategy for searching the\ncausal model among all possible models. Crucially, for generalised linear\nmodels with a known dispersion parameter, such as Poisson and logistic\nregression, the causal model can be identified from a single data environment.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
