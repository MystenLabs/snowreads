The communication graph\nspecifies potential interactions (\\ie communication) between agent pairs. This\npaper addresses the complete graph identification problem, requiring agents to\ndetermine if their communication graph is a clique or not. We evaluate various\nsettings based on: (i) the fairness preserved by the adversarial scheduler --\neither global fairness or weak fairness, and (ii) the knowledge provided to\nagents beforehand -- either the exact population size $n$, a common upper bound\n$P$ on $n$, or no prior information. Positively, we show that $O(n^2)$ states\nper agent suffice to solve the complete graph identification problem under\nglobal fairness without prior knowledge. With prior knowledge of $n$, agents\ncan solve the problem using only $O(n)$ states under weak fairness. Negatively,\nwe prove that complete graph identification remains unsolvable under weak\nfairness when only a common upper bound $P$ on the population size $n$ is\nknown.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
