In soft, partially ordered systems, these\nfeatures can often be achieved via self-assembly, allowing for the combination\nof diverse components in a complex nanostructured material. Here, we\ndemonstrate an example of a liquid that simultaneously displays both\nferroelectric and ferromagnetic types of order. This material is a\nnanostructured liquid crystalline hybrid comprising ferrimagnetic barium\nhexaferrite nanoplatelets suspended in a ferroelectric nematic host.\nDirector-mediated interactions drive the self-assembly of nanoplatelets in an\nintricate network. Due to the couplings between the polar electric and magnetic\ntypes of order, this material demonstrates magnetically driven electric and\nnonlinear optical responses, as well as electrically driven magnetic response.\nSuch multiferroic liquids are highly promising for applications in energy\nharvesting, nonlinear optics, and sensors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
