These tests are crucial for guiding the\nsetup of bilateral CIs to optimise delivery of binaural cues. Our primary goal\nis to introduce a clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) procedure to assess\nbinaural hearing function at various stages within the auditory pathway.\nPrevious research demonstrated that bilateral CI users significantly decrease\nin ability to discriminate interaural time differences when pulse rates exceed\n300 pulses per second. Our paradigm utilizes different pulse rates to\nobjectively explore the limits. A notable challenge with this EEG procedure is\nthe interference induced by CI electrical stimulus artefacts. Despite this\nobstacle, the potential benefits of CI stimulation artefacts often go\nunnoticed. This paper outlines positive applications of the frequently\ncriticized CI artefacts for optimizing the experiment setup.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LbFpVUm9W-WZslSyLxB_s3PBA3cnKoP2QI7k5Q5whNs","pdfSize":"975911"}
