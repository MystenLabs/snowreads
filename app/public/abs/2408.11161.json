Moreover, we present a weakly $c(n/k)$-competitive online algorithm\nwith advice complexity $O(k(\\log N + \\log n))$ where $n$ is the number of\nservers, $N$ is the distance of the minimal and maximal servers, and $c(n)$ is\nthe complexity of the best online algorithm without advice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wItNGY-OGX0Y2WRSUeNUdh_khANTyRGO3llArAt4lEs","pdfSize":"130984"}
