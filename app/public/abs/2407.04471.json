We present the first formal analysis of a sponsored QA platform. The\nplatform fuses an organic answer to a question with an ad to produce a so\ncalled {\\em sponsored answer}. Advertisers then bid on their sponsored answers.\nInspired by Generalized Second Price Auctions (GSPs), the QA platform selects\nthe winning advertiser, sets the payment she pays, and shows the user the\nsponsored answer. We prove an array of results. For example, advertisers are\nincentivized to be truthful in their bids; i.e., set them to their true value\nof the sponsored answer. The resultant setting is stable with properties of VCG\nauctions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
