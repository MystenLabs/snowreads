However, they can be resource-intensive and are frequently\nunderutilized. To alleviate the burden of these essential processes, we\ndeveloped the Requirements Organization and Optimization Tool (ROOT). ROOT\ncentralizes project information and offers project visualizations and AI-based\ntools designed to streamline engineering processes. With ROOT's assistance,\nengineers benefit from improved oversight and early error detection, leading to\nthe successful development of software systems.
