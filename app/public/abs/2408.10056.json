We prove that there exists a potential\non these quivers that ensures the resulting quiver with potential is\nJacobian-finite. As an application, we first demonstrate through covering\ntheory that a Jacobian-finite potential exists on a class of 2-acyclic quivers.\nSecondly, by using the 2-cyclic Caldero-Chapoton formula defined on section\n4.2, the $\\tau$-rigid modules obtained from the Jacobian algebras of our proven\nJacobian-finite 2-cyclic quiver with potential can categorify\nPaquette-Schiffler's generalized cluster algebras in three specific cases: one\nfor a disk with two marked points and one 3-puncture, one for a sphere with one\npuncture, one 3-puncture and one orbifold point, and another for a sphere with\none puncture and two 3-punctures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
