Given\ndiscrete samples of the state of the system evolving in space-time, one obtains\nupdated `posterior' measures on a function space containing all possible\ntrajectories. We give a general set of conditions under which these\nnon-Gaussian posterior distributions are approximated, in Wasserstein distance\nfor the supremum-norm metric, by the law of a Gaussian random function. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of our results to periodic non-linear reaction\ndiffusion equations \\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} u - \\Delta u &=\nf(u) \\\\ u(0) &= \\theta \\end{align*} where $f$ is any smooth and compactly\nsupported reaction function. In this case the limiting Gaussian measure can be\ncharacterised as the solution of a time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation with\n`rough' Gaussian initial conditions whose covariance operator we describe.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
