However, the issue of data heterogeneity among\nclients often compels local models to diverge, leading to suboptimal global\nmodels. To mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity on FL performance, we\nstart with analyzing how FL training influence FL performance by decomposing\nthe global loss into three terms: local loss, distribution shift loss and\naggregation loss. Remarkably, our loss decomposition reveals that existing\nlocal training-based FL methods attempt to reduce the distribution shift loss,\nwhile the global aggregation-based FL methods propose better aggregation\nstrategies to reduce the aggregation loss. Nevertheless, a comprehensive joint\neffort to minimize all three terms is currently limited in the literature,\nleading to subpar performance when dealing with data heterogeneity challenges.\nTo fill this gap, we propose a novel FL method based on global loss\ndecomposition, called FedLD, to jointly reduce these three loss terms. Our\nFedLD involves a margin control regularization in local training to reduce the\ndistribution shift loss, and a principal gradient-based server aggregation\nstrategy to reduce the aggregation loss. Notably, under different levels of\ndata heterogeneity, our strategies achieve better and more robust performance\non retinal and chest X-ray classification compared to other FL algorithms.
