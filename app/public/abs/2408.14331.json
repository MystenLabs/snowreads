However, the performance of most ML tasks\nheavily depends on data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter\noptimization, which are considered to be intensive in terms of domain\nknowledge, experience, and manual labor. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)\naims to automatically complete the full life-cycle of ML tasks and provides\nstate-of-the-art ML models without human intervention or supervision. This\npaper introduces an AutoML workflow that allows users without domain knowledge\nor prior experience to achieve robust and effortless ML deployment by writing\nonly a few lines of code. This proposed AutoML is specifically tailored for the\ninsurance application, with features like the balancing step in data\npreprocessing, ensemble pipelines, and customized loss functions. These\nfeatures are designed to address the unique challenges of the insurance domain,\nincluding the imbalanced nature of common insurance datasets. The full code and\ndocumentation are available on the GitHub repository.\n(https://github.com/PanyiDong/InsurAutoML)\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
