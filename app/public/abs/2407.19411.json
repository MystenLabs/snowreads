Vivekanand","authorsParsed":[["Vivekanand","M.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 06:30:03 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-27","timestamp":1722148203000,"abstract":"  After receiving an X-ray photon, an X-ray detector is not operational for a\nduration known as deadtime. It is detector specific and its effect on the data\ndepends upon the luminosity of the source. It reduces the observed photon count\nrate in comparison to the expected one. In periodic sources such as the Crab\npulsar, it can distort the folded light curve (FLC). An undistorted FLC of the\nCrab pulsar is required in combination with its polarization properties for\nstudying its X-ray emission mechanism. This work derives a simple formula for\nthe distortion of the FLC of a pulsar caused by the detector deadtime, and\nvalidates it using Crab pulsar data from the X-ray observatories {{\\it NICER}}\nand {{\\it NUSTAR}}, which have very small and relatively large detector\ndeadtimes respectively. Then it derives a method for correcting the distorted\nFLC of the Crab pulsar in {{\\it IXPE}} data, which has intermediate detector\ndeadtime. The formula is verified after addressing several technical issues.\nThis work ends with a discussion of why an undistorted FLC is important for\nstudying the formation of cusps in the FLC of the Crab pulsar.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CEIzQE1UkAqwlp0RbmPkSw-26fj0YDugAEkqJW1Bs7w","pdfSize":"392169"}
