Our bounds are in terms of Lyapunov's coefficients and the\n$\\mathscr L^{r/2}$ fluctuation of the total conditional variances. We will show\nthat our Wasserstein-1 bound is optimal up to a multiplicative constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
