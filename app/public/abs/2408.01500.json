There are also corresponding changes in the helicity\nof the hypermagnetic field ($h$) and the Chern-Simons numbers of the\nnon-Abelian gauge fields ($N_{\\rm CS,W}$ and $N_{\\rm CS,S}$). In this study, we\ninvestigate a baryogenesis process in the symmetric phase of the early Universe\nby taking into account the Abelian and non-Abelian anomalous effects as well as\nthe perturbative chirality-flip processes of all fermions. We calculate\nexplicitly the time evolution of all relevant physical quantities, including\nthose of $h$ and $N_{\\rm CS,W}$, and show that there is another conserved\nglobal charge involving total matter-antimatter asymmetry $B+L$, hypermagnetic\nhelicity $h_B$ and $N_{\\rm CS,W}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
