This emphasizes the need for users to detect such fraud to protect\ntheir investments and ensure computational integrity. This study introduces a\nnovel dynamic fingerprinting method for detecting fraudulent service provision\non quantum cloud platforms, specifically targeting machine substitution and\nprofile fabrication attacks. The dynamic fingerprint is constructed using a\n\\textit{single} probing circuit to capture the unique error characteristics of\nquantum devices, making this approach practical because of its trivial\ncomputational costs. When the user examines the service, the execution results\nof the probing circuit act as the device-side fingerprint of the quantum device\nproviding the service. The user then generates the user-side fingerprint by\nestimating the expected execution result, assuming the correct device is in\nuse. We propose an algorithm for users to construct the user-side fingerprint\nwith linear complexity. By comparing the device-side and user-side\nfingerprints, users can effectively detect fraudulent services. Our experiments\non the IBM Quantum platform, involving seven devices with varying capabilities,\nconfirm the method's effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
