However, most\nreal-world systems are only metastable, that is, the dynamics appear to be\nstable on some time scale, but are in fact unstable over longer time scales.\nConsistency of inference for metastable systems may not be possible, but one\ncan ask about metaconsistency: Do inference procedures converge when\nobservations are taken over a large but finite time interval, but diverge on\nlonger time scales? In this paper we introduce, discuss, and quantify\nmetaconsistency in a Bayesian framework. We discuss how metaconsistency can be\nexploited to efficiently infer a model for a sub-system of a larger system,\nwhere inference on the global behavior may require much more data. We also\ndiscuss the relation between meta-consistency and the spectral properties of\nthe model dynamical system in the case of uniformly ergodic diffusions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aYhlstokg-qDi_man4fcHcr_W36YGyNYyHhmUvI-wU4","pdfSize":"1142200","txDigest":"Atwf4NMemXT7WFDbC7whw88ZkfAoQ7yyeC1cCc3Vxr7Z","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
