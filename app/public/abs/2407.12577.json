On the other hand, certain types of\naperiodic lattices have enabled new phenomena that may not be otherwise\nattainable in periodic ones. In this paper, a new class of aperiodic lattices\ninspired by cellular automaton is introduced. Cellular automaton was originally\ndeveloped as a machine replication algorithm and it has been intensively\nexplored in computer science. These algorithms yield structures that are not\nnecessarily periodic, yet follow well-defined rules that lead to interesting\naperiodic patterns. The concept is utilized here to build elastic lattices\nfollowing such rules, and Ulam-Warburton Cellular Automaton (UWCA) is\ndemonstrated as an example. Resulted UWCA lattices are shown to exhibit unique\ndynamical properties, including symmetric eigenfrequency spectra, repeated\nnatural frequencies of large multiplicity, and the emergence of strongly\nlocalized corner modes. It is envisioned that computer-algorithm-inspired\nlattices may unlock new wave phenomena that could outperform existing lattice\ndesigns.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fBbaM-N1yhlr-g-aIUSor6VFKuPgFK1A8hH_TlfDAvw","pdfSize":"1389495"}
