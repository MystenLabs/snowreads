Such distributions, learned from rich data using a machine\nlearning algorithm, are not constrained by restrictive model assumptions and\nallow the exploration of non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed data and their non-linear\ninteractions. The method uses a two-stage quantile neural network combined with\nspline interpolation. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms\nalternative models in terms of out-of-sample losses. Furthermore, we show that\nthe moments derived from such distributions can be useful as alternative\nempirical estimates in many cases, including mean estimation and forecasting.\nFinally, we examine the relationship between cross-sectional returns and\nseveral distributional characteristics. The results are robust to a wide range\nof US and international data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
