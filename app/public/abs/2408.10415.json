The edge mode appears along the 1D\nboundary with a magnetic insulator (MI), dependent on the angle $\\theta$ which\nthe magnetization $M$ makes with the normal to surface and on the chemical\npotential mismatch $\\delta\\mu$ across the TI--MI interface (assuming\n$1>\\delta\\mu/M\\equiv\\sin\\phi)$. The propagation along the interface is chiral,\nwith velocity $v\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)$ smaller than the Dirac fermion velocity $v$.\nIn momentum space the edge mode is an arc state, extending over the finite\nmomentum interval that connects the Dirac point of the gapless Dirac fermions\nwith the magnetic band gap. An electric field parallel to the boundary pumps\ncharge between TI and MI via this arc state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
