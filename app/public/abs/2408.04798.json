A few scene\nabstractions have been proposed, but they are restricted to specific\napplications for a limited set of visualization types. A unified and expressive\nmodel of data visualization scenes for different applications has been missing.\nTo fill this gap, we present Manipulable Semantic Components (MSC), a\ncomputational representation of data visualization scenes, to support\napplications in scene understanding and augmentation. MSC consists of two\nparts: a unified object model describing the structure of a visualization scene\nin terms of semantic components, and a set of operations to generate and modify\nthe scene components. We demonstrate the benefits of MSC in three applications:\nvisualization authoring, visualization deconstruction and reuse, and animation\nspecification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
