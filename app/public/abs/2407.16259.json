The Fourier-Wigner transform is closely\nrelated to the group Fourier transform of the Heisenberg group. The first\nresult shows that Fourier-Wigner restriction for Schatten class operators is\nequivalent to the restriction of the symplectic Fourier transform of functions\non phase space. We deduce various Schatten class results for the quantum\nFourier extension operator and answer a conjecture by Mishra and Vemuri\nconcerning the Weyl transform of measures in the affirmative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
