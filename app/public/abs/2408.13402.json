However,\nto truly democratize AI, models must exhibit strong capabilities and be able to\nrun efficiently on small compute footprints accessible by most. Part of this\nquest, we introduce LLaVaOLMoBitnet1B - the first Ternary Multimodal LLM\ncapable of accepting Image(s)+Text inputs to produce coherent textual\nresponses. The model is fully open-sourced along with training scripts to\nencourage further research in this space. This accompanying technical report\nhighlights the training process, evaluation details, challenges associated with\nternary models and future opportunities.
