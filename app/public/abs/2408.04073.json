The specific physical properties linked to a three-dimensional atomic\narrangement make this an essential task in the development of new materials. We\npresent a method that efficiently uses active learning of neural network force\nfields for structure relaxation, minimizing the required number of steps in the\nprocess. This is achieved by neural network force fields equipped with\nuncertainty estimation, which iteratively guide a pool of randomly generated\ncandidates towards their respective local minima. Using this approach, we are\nable to effectively identify the most promising candidates for further\nevaluation using density functional theory (DFT). Our method not only reliably\nreduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude across the\nbenchmark systems Si16 , Na8Cl8 , Ga8As8 and Al4O6 , but also excels in finding\nthe most stable minimum for the unseen, more complex systems Si46 and Al16O24 .\nMoreover, we demonstrate at the example of Si16 that our method can find\nmultiple relevant local minima while only adding minor computational effort.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
