However, the temperature-induced band\nrenormalization is commonly ignored. By employing the recently-developed\nelectron-phonon renormalization (EPR) method, the nature of band\nrenormalization in half-Heusler (HH) compounds TiCoSb and NbFeSb is revealed,\nand the key factors for temperature-induced conduction band convergence in HH\nare found out. Using these as the screening criteria, 3 out of 274 HHs (TiRhBi,\nTiPtSn, NbPtTl) are then stood out from our MatHub-3d database. Taking TiPtSn\nas the example, it shows the conduction band convergence at mid-high\ntemperature, and further resulting in enhanced Seebeck coefficient S: e.g., at\n600 K with electron concentration 10^20 cm^-3, the predicted S with and without\nrenormalized band is 352.83 uV/K and 289.52 uV/K, respectively. Herein, the\nformer is closer to our measurement value of 338.79 uV/K. Besides, the\neffective masses obtained from calculation and experiment are both enlarged\nwith temperature, indicating the existence of band convergence. Our work\ndemonstrates for the first time the significance of adding the temperature\neffect on electronic structure in the design of potential high-performance TE\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
