By\ncombining numerical and analytical techniques, we find linear Homes scaling\nrelations between the zero-temperature superfluid density and the normal-state\nDC conductivity. This is due to Galilean invariance being broken, either via a\nlarge impurity scattering rate or inelastic scattering of electrons and\nEinstein phonons at large electron-phonon coupling. Our work thus shows that\nHomes scaling is more universal than either cuprate or BCS-like physics, and is\ninstead a fundamental result in a wide class of superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
