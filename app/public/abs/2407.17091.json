The theory is based on the\namplitudes entering their density-wave representation. We introduce a free\nenergy functional for complex amplitudes and assume non-conserved dissipative\ndynamics to describe their evolution. Elasticity, including phononic and\nphasonic deformation, defect nucleation and motion, emerges self-consistently\nby prescribing only the symmetry of quasicrystals. Predictions on the formation\nof semi-coherent interfaces and dislocation kinematics are given.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
