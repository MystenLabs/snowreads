They offer potential for use\nacross a wide range of applications such as sensors and quantum transducers.\nDouble-disk WGM resonators, which host strongly interacting mechanical and\noptical modes co-localized around their circumference, are particularly\nattractive due to their high optomechanical coupling. Large-scale integrated\nfabrication of silicon double-disk WGM resonators has not previously been\ndemonstrated. In this work we present a process for the fabrication of\ndouble-layer silicon-on-insulator wafers, which we then use to fabricate\nfunctional optomechanical double silicon disk resonators with on-chip optical\ncoupling. The integrated devices present an experimentally observed optical\nquality factors of the order of 10^5 and a single-photon optomechanical\ncoupling of approximately 15 kHz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jDMu6n9syInn35HaM_gDdZfvTQ3tIsjeOs2gslHMbv4","pdfSize":"10706027","txDigest":"CMRwiGhgqrUqbMXzrieUWrSqMyTvizHMdWqrP3DJB8Qn","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
