Chen and C.S. Lin [Comm. An. Geom. 1998],\nwhich considered the regular case $\\alpha=0$. Part of the argument of Chen-Lin\ncan be adapted to the singular case by means of an isoperimetric inequality for\nsurfaces with conical singularities. However, the case $\\alpha\\in(-1,0)$ turns\nout to be more delicate, due to the lack of traslation invariance of the\nsingular problem, which requires a different approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
