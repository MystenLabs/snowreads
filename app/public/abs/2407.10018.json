The input datum is the pivotal\nbicategory $\\mathbf{Mod}^{\\mathrm{sph}}(\\mathcal{A})$ of spherical module\ncategories over a spherical fusion category $\\mathcal{A}$.\n  The interplay of algebraic structures in this pivotal bicategory with moves\nof skeleta ensures that our state sum is independent of the skeleton on the\nmanifold. We show that the bicategorical invariant recovers the value of the\nstandard Turaev-Viro invariant associated to $\\mathcal{A}$, thereby proving the\nindependence of the Turaev-Viro invariant under pivotal Morita equivalence\nwithout recurring to the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction.\n  A key ingredient for the construction is the evaluation of graphs on the\nsphere with labels in $\\mathbf{Mod}^{\\mathrm{sph}}(\\mathcal{A})$ that we\ndevelop in this article. A central tool are Nakayama-twisted traces on pivotal\nbimodule categories which we study beyond semisimplicity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
