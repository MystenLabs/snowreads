Concurrently, research indicates\nthat dissipation can serve as an effective resource in quantum computation. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel dissipation-driven quantum generative\nadversarial network (DQGAN) architecture specifically tailored for generating\nclassical data. Our DQGAN comprises two interacting networks: a generative\nnetwork and a discriminative network, both constructed from qubits. The\nclassical data is encoded into the input qubits of the input layer via strong\ntailored dissipation processes. This encoding scheme enables us to extract both\nthe generated data and the classification results by measuring the observables\nof the steady state of the output qubits. The network coupling weight, i.e.,\nthe strength of the interaction Hamiltonian between layers, is iteratively\nupdated during the training process. This training procedure closely resembles\nthe training of conventional generative adversarial networks (GANs). By\nalternately updating the two networks, we foster adversarial learning until the\nequilibrium point is reached. Our preliminary numerical test on a simplified\ninstance of the task substantiate the feasibility of our DQGAN model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
