This paper introduces a formal definition of the cryptographic\nmigration problem and explores its complexities using a suitable directed graph\nmodel. Characteristics of the resulting migration graphs are analyzed and\ntrade-offs discussed. By using classical mathematical results from\ncombinatorics, probability theory and combinatorial analysis, we assess the\nchallenges of migrating ``random'' large cryptographic IT-infrastructures. We\nshow that any sufficiently large migration project that follows our model has\nan intrinsic complexity, either due to many dependent (comparatively easy)\nmigration steps or due to at least one complicated migration step. This proves\nthat in a suitable sense cryptographic migration is hard in general.\nFurthermore, we analyze the proposed model with respect to practical\napplicability and explain the difficulties that emerge when we try to model\nreal-world migration projects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
