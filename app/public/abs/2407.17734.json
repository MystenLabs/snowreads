Yet applying these models into clinics\nmust deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial,\nand computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction\nlearning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only\ntrains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the\nparameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we\npropose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based\ninstructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from\nthe Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a\nhigh-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital\npathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of\nhybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive\nresults show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and\nclosed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess\n37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from\nGPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot\nlearning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that\ncost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid\nconversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
