We consider some aspects of this correspondence.\nFor under damped scalars with mass $M^2R_{ds}^2>{d^2\\over4}$, belonging to the\nprincipal series, we show that for the Bunch Davies vacuum a suitable source in\nthe boundary theory can be identified in terms of the coherent state\nrepresentation of the wave function. We argue that terms in the resulting\ncorrelation functions, which are independent of the late time cut-off, satisfy\nthe Ward identities of a conformal field theory. We also discuss other ways to\nidentify sources, both in the under damped and the over damped case, where\n$M^2R_{ds}^2<{d^2\\over4}$, and argue that these too can lead to correlators\nsatisfying the Ward identities of a CFT. Some comments on the violation of\nreflection positivity, and the cut-off dependent terms, along with some\nexplicit checks and sample calculations, are also included.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
