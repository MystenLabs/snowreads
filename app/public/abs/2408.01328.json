However, the question of its complexity remains open\nfor the class of antiprismatic graphs, which are the complement of prismatic\ngraphs and one of the four remaining cases highlighted by Lozin and Malishev.\nIn this article we focus on the equivalent question of the complexity of the\nclique cover problem in prismatic graphs.\n  A graph $G$ is prismatic if for every triangle $T$ of $G$, every vertex of\n$G$ not in $T$ has a unique neighbor in $T$. A graph is co-bridge-free if it\nhas no $C_4+2K_1$ as induced subgraph. We give a polynomial time algorithm that\nsolves the clique cover problem in co-bridge-free prismatic graphs. It relies\non the structural description given by Chudnovsky and Seymour, and on later\nwork of Preissmann, Robin and Trotignon.\n  We show that co-bridge-free prismatic graphs have a bounded number of\ndisjoint triangles and that implies that the algorithm presented by Preissmann\net al. applies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
