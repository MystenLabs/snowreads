An innovative approach\nto monitor manatee populations is passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), where\nvocalisations are extracted from submarine audio. We propose a novel end-to-end\napproach to detect manatee vocalisations building on the Audio Spectrogram\nTransformer (AST). In a transfer learning spirit, we fine-tune AST to detect\nmanatee calls by redesigning its filterbanks and adapting a real-world dataset\ncontaining partial positive labels. Our experimental evaluation reveals the two\nkey features of the proposed model: i) it performs on par with the state of the\nart without requiring hand-tuned denoising or detection stages, and ii) it can\nsuccessfully identify missed vocalisations in the training dataset, thus\nreducing the workload of expert bioacoustic labellers. This work is a\npreliminary relevant step to develop novel, user-friendly tools for the\nconservation of the different species of manatees.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
