Although several methods have been proposed to\ntackle this problem, most of them prioritize optimizing the fidelity in dancing\nmovement, constrained by predetermined dancer counts in datasets. This\nlimitation impedes adaptability to real-world applications. Our study addresses\nthe scalability problem in group choreography while preserving naturalness and\nsynchronization. In particular, we propose a phase-based variational generative\nmodel for group dance generation on learning a generative manifold. Our method\nachieves high-fidelity group dance motion and enables the generation with an\nunlimited number of dancers while consuming only a minimal and constant amount\nof memory. The intensive experiments on two public datasets show that our\nproposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches by a large\nmargin and is scalable to a great number of dancers beyond the training data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fr0ItXum4_tcAzS5l90QDG6bez2dVntRzfjNABOL45c","pdfSize":"4722304"}
