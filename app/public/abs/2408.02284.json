However, estimating\nalignment in noisy environments is challenging. This paper introduces a\ncascading refinement video denoising method that can refine alignment and\nrestore images simultaneously. Better alignment enables restoration of more\ndetailed information in each frame. Furthermore, better image quality leads to\nbetter alignment. This method has achieved SOTA performance by a large margin\non the CRVD dataset. Simultaneously, aiming to deal with multi-level noise, an\nuncertainty map was created after each iteration. Because of this, redundant\ncomputation on the easily restored videos was avoided. By applying this method,\nthe entire computation was reduced by 25% on average.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
