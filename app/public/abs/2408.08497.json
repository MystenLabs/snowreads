These abstractions provide simplified models that capture the\nfundamental behaviors of the original systems. However, the creation of such\nabstractions typically relies on the availability of precise knowledge\nconcerning system dynamics, which might not be available in many real-world\napplications. In this work, we introduce an innovative, data-driven, and\ncompositional approach to generate finite abstractions for interconnected\nsystems that consist of discrete-time control subsystems with unknown dynamics.\nThese subsystems interact through an unknown static interconnection map. Our\nmethodology for abstracting the interconnected system involves constructing\nabstractions for individual subsystems and incorporating an abstraction of the\ninterconnection map.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
