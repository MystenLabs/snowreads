This study\ndemonstrates that significant delayed ionization responses and stepwise\nionization processes are crucial factors in determining the ionization state of\nsuch systems. When an intense laser begins to ionize an initially cold argon\nplasma, the conditions change rapidly, leading to a delayed response in\nionization. Consequently, the dynamics do not reach a steady state, even if the\nelectron temperature and density appear unchanged, particularly when the atomic\ntransition process is not sufficiently rapid compared to the relevant time\nscales. Furthermore, in this case, numerous highly excited states are created\nprimarily through collisional excitation. Thus, even low-energy photons can\npredominantly ionize plasmas, challenging the conventional belief that such\nphoton energies insufficient to overcome the binding energy of bound electrons\ntypically contribute less to the ionization. These findings underscore the\nnecessity of incorporating these processes in ionization modeling within\nradiation hydrodynamic simulations for various laser-plasma experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6hGNGx3m5a_P-z1mogIpjI4whtr2HQGvc2VP5SWjhT0","pdfSize":"2497704"}
