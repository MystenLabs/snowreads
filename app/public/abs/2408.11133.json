These disasters have significant societal\nimpacts, necessitating mental health services for the millions affected. To\nprepare for and respond effectively to such events, it is important to\nunderstand people's emotions and the life incidents they experience before and\nafter a disaster strikes. In this case study, we collected a dataset of\napproximately 400,000 public tweets related to the storm. Using a BERT-based\nmodel, we predicted the emotions associated with each tweet. To efficiently\nidentify these topics, we utilized the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\ntechnique for topic modeling, which allowed us to bypass manual content\nanalysis and extract meaningful patterns from the data. However, rather than\nstopping at topic identification like previous methods \\cite{math11244910}, we\nfurther refined our analysis by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and\nLarge Language Models (LLM). The GNN was employed to generate embeddings and\nconstruct a similarity graph of the tweets, which was then used to optimize\nclustering. Subsequently, we used an LLM to automatically generate descriptive\nnames for each event cluster, offering critical insights for disaster\npreparedness and response strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
