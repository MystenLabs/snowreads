In\nparticular, the case when nondynamical CSMG with noncanonical CS scalar is\nconsidered. We provide a new solution different from the previously obtained\none \\cite{Konno:2007ze} which we refer to as KMT model. The present solution\naccounts for frame dragging effect which includes not only radial dependence as\nin the KMT. Nevertheless, it reduces to KMT as a particular case. We show that\nthe tidal gravitational force (Kretschmann invariant) associated to the present\nsolution contains a term of order $1/r^3$ additional to Schwarzschild but\nabsent from directional divergence, unlike KMT model which diverges along the\naxis of symmetry. We derive the corresponding circular velocity of a massive\ntest particle in which the KMT velocity is recovered in addition to an extra\nterm $\\propto r$. We investigate possible constraints on KMT and the present\nsolutions from the observed rotation curve of UGC11455 galaxy as an example. We\nshow that perturbation solutions cannot physically explain the flattening of\ngalactic rotation curves.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KgKZOLbBibHYO1Xjj3j5Av_tZ0zdip7qKNk2twbH_Wg","pdfSize":"473233"}
