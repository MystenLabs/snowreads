This paper explores the feasibility of using\nstate-of-the-art commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices for Wi-Fi sensing\napplications, particularly respiration monitoring and motion detection. We\nutilize the Intel AX210 network interface card (NIC) to transmit Wi-Fi signals\nin both 2.4 GHz and 6 GHz frequency bands. Our experiments rely on channel\nfrequency response (CFR) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) data,\nwhich are processed using a moving average algorithm to extract human behavior\npatterns. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in capturing and representing human respiration and motion patterns.\nFurthermore, we compare the performance of Wi-Fi sensing across different\nfrequency bands, highlighting the advantages of using higher frequencies for\nimproved sensitivity and clarity. Our findings showcase the practicality of\nusing COTS devices for Wi-Fi sensing and lay the groundwork for the development\nof non-invasive, contactless sensing systems. These systems have potential\napplications in various fields, including healthcare, smart homes, and\nMetaverse.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
