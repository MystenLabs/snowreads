The attractors\nemerge near the triple instability threshold of the splay-phase synchronization\nstate of the oscillators. We provide theoretical arguments and verify\nnumerically, based on the pseudohyperbolicity test, that the chaotic dynamics\nare robust with respect to small, e.g. time-dependent, perturbations of the\nsystem. The robust chaoticity should also be inherited by any network of weakly\ninteracting systems with such attractors.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
