In this work, we address this question\nin the context of Public Goods Games. We study learning in a novel\nmulti-objective version of the Public Goods Game where agents have different\nrisk preferences, by means of multi-objective reinforcement learning. We\nintroduce a parametric non-linear utility function to model risk preferences at\nthe level of individual agents, over the collective and individual reward\ncomponents of the game. We study the interplay between such preference\nmodelling and environmental uncertainty on the incentive alignment level in the\ngame. We demonstrate how different combinations of individual preferences and\nenvironmental uncertainties sustain the emergence of cooperative patterns in\nnon-cooperative environments (i.e., where competitive strategies are dominant),\nwhile others sustain competitive patterns in cooperative environments (i.e.,\nwhere cooperative strategies are dominant).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
