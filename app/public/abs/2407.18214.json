Mode coupling dynamics between ``cold'' EPW with\nphase velocity $v_{\\phi}$ greater than thermal velocity i.e $v_{\\phi} \\gg\nv_{thermal}$ and its inhomogeneity induced sidebands is illustrated as an\ninitial value problem. In driven cases, formation of BGK like phase space\nstructures corresponding to sideband modes due to energy exchange from primary\nmode to bulk particles via wave-wave and wave-particle interactions leading to\nparticle trapping is demonstrated for inhomogeneous plasma. Qualitative\ncomparison studies between initial value perturbation and driven problem is\npresented, which examines the relative difference in energy transfer time\nbetween the interacting modes. Effect of variation in background ion\ninhomogeneity amplitude as well as ion inhomogeneity scale length on the driven\nEPWs is reported.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
