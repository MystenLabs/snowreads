The challenge of determining the energy gap requires\nidentifying both the excited and ground states of a system. In this work, we\nconsider preparing the prior distribution and circuits for the eigenspectrum of\ntime-independent Hamiltonians, which can benefit both classical and quantum\nalgorithms for solving eigenvalue problems. The proposed algorithm unfolds in\nthree strategic steps: Hamiltonian transformation, parameter representation,\nand classical clustering. These steps are underpinned by two key insights: the\nuse of quantum circuits to approximate the ground state of transformed\nHamiltonians and the analysis of parameter representation to distinguish\nbetween eigenvectors. The algorithm is showcased through applications to the 1D\nHeisenberg system and the LiH molecular system, highlighting its potential for\nboth near-term quantum devices and fault-tolerant quantum devices. The paper\nalso explores the scalability of the method and its performance across various\nsettings, setting the stage for more resource-efficient quantum computations\nthat are both accurate and fast. The findings presented here mark a new insight\ninto hybrid algorithms, offering a pathway to overcoming current computational\nchallenges.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
