Though this CQ\nholds generically, failure is pervasive in applications such as semidefinite\nrelaxations of hard discrete optimization problems. In this paper we relate FR\nto the analysis of the convergence behaviour of a semi-smooth Newton root\nfinding method for the projection onto a spectrahedron, i.e., onto the\nintersection of a linear manifold and the semidefinite cone. In the process, we\nderive and use an elegant formula for the projection onto a face of the\nsemidefinite cone. We show further that the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian of\nthe Newton method near optimality characterizes the degeneracy of the nearest\npoint in the spectrahedron. We apply the results, both theoretically and\nempirically, to the problem of finding nearest points to the sets of: (i)\ncorrelation matrices or the elliptope; and (ii) semidefinite relaxations of\npermutation matrices or the vontope, i.e., the feasible sets for the\nsemidefinite relaxations of the max-cut and quadratic assignment problems,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
