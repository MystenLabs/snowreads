The thermo-magnetization\nmeasurements at 100 Oe reveal the presence of two magnetic transitions at\nT$\\rm_{C1}=278~K$ and T$\\rm_{C2}=270~K$, respectively, with saturation\nmagnetization of around 1.2 $\\mu \\rm_ B$/f.u. at 5~K. Our magnetic field\ndependent studies reveal the dominance of T$\\rm_{C1}$ transition at lower\nfields ($\\mu_0\\rm H \\leqslant 0.03~Tesla$); however, at higher fields the\nT$\\rm_{C2}$ transition becomes more pronounced. The observation of remnant\nmagnetization above Curie temperature suggests the development of\nGriffiths-like phase, which is extensively analyzed through {\\it ac} and {\\it\ndc}- magnetic susceptibility ($\\chi$) data. The evaluation of magnetocaloric\npotential indicates second order phase transition with notable $\\Delta S_{\\rm\nM}=$ 2.22 Jkg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 7 Tesla. The low-field ($\\mu_0\\rm H \\leqslant\n0.1~Tesla$) magnetic entropy ($\\Delta S_{\\rm M}$) curves exhibit two\nnon-identical positive peaks. The nature and range of spin interactions near\nT$\\rm_C$ were scrutinized through rigorous critical phenomenon analysis, and\nthe values of exponents $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ and $\\delta$ to be $0.063,\n0.361, 1.108$ and $3.943$, respectively, which are found to be slightly\ndeviating from mean-field theory towards 3D Heisenberg model. Additionally, the\nexchange magnetic interactions are found to decay as $J(r) \\sim r^{-4.6}$.\nFurthermore, the density functional theory results reveal the half-metallic\nnature exhibiting 100\\% spin polarization (SP). However, the electronic and\nmagnetic properties are greatly affected by the incorporation of structural\ndisorder, which results in drastic reduction of SP to mere 8.3\\%.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
