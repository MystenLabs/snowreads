In this paper, we introduce an Ising\nannealer based on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which updates the variables of\nall dimensions in parallel. The main innovation is the fusion of an approximate\ngradient-based approach into the Ising annealer which introduces significant\nacceleration and allows a portable and scalable implementation on the\ncommercial FPGA. Comprehensive simulation and hardware experiments show that\nthe proposed Ising annealer has promising performance and scalability on all\ntypes of benchmark problems when compared to other Ising annealers including\nthe state-of-the-art hardware. In particular, we have built a prototype\nannealer which solves Ising problems of both integer and fraction coefficients\nwith up to 200 spins on a single low-cost FPGA board, whose performance is\ndemonstrated to be better than the state-of-the-art quantum hardware D-Wave\n2000Q and similar to the expensive coherent Ising machine. The sub-linear\nscalability of the annealer signifies its potential in solving challenging\ncombinatorial optimization problems and evaluating the advantage of quantum\nhardware.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
