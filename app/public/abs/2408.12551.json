Our framework employs a method known as greybox\nlearning, which enables the learning of event-recording automata with a minimal\nnumber of control states. This approach avoids learning the region automaton\nassociated with the language, contrasting with existing methods. We have\nimplemented our greybox learning algorithm with various heuristics to maintain\nlow computational complexity. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated\nthrough several examples.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
