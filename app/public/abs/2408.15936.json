In this work, we develop\nconstant-rate entanglement distillation methods to address this bottleneck in\nthe setting of noisy local operations. By using a sequence of two-way\nentanglement distillation protocols based on quantum error detecting codes with\nincreasing rate, and combining with standard fault tolerance techniques, we\nachieve constant-rate entanglement distillation. We prove the scheme has\nconstant-rate in expectation and further numerically optimize to achieve low\npractical overhead subject to memory constraints. We find our optimized schemes\noutperform existing computationally efficient quantum interconnect schemes by\nan order of magnitude in relevant regimes, leading to a direct speed-up in the\nexecution of distributed quantum algorithms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
