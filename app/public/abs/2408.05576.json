Our investigation focuses on\nblack holes within X-ray binary systems, namely GRS 1915+105, GRO J1655-40, XTE\nJ1550-564, A0620-00, H1743-322, and GRS 1124-683. Our findings indicate that\nthe Kerr+PFDM spacetime can account for the radiative efficiency of these\nsources as determined through the continuum fitting method (CFM). Additionally,\nemploying the Blandford-Znajeck mechanism, we demonstrate the ability to\nreplicate the observed jet power. By combining the outcomes of both analyses\nfor the selected objects, we establish more rigorous constraints on the\nspacetime parameters. Notably, our results reveal that similar to the Kerr\nspacetime, the Kerr+PFDM spacetime cannot simultaneously account for the\nobserved jet power and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
