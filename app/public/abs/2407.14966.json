Packings are\ntrained via the application of several identical shear cycles, either of a\nsingle shear type or combinations of the two types. The memory is then read out\nusing a standard protocol capable of revealing memories as a cusp at the point\nwhere readout reaches the training strain. The ability to read out a memory is\nsensitive not only to the type of deformation applied but also to the order in\nwhich different types of training are performed. These results underscore the\nimportance of thinking of memories not as single remembered value (amplitude)\nbut as a learned path through phase space.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-ui-x2Nw16nX3DahEi01o65SCNvMuCRU1MuzhrsE1nk","pdfSize":"2284039"}
