Throughout the manuscript, we\nexplore a specific type of multiparty entanglement which can be detected\nthrough the fluctuation of a collective observable. We thoroughly analyze its\nproperties and how it can be extended to mixed states while placing it within\nthe context of the existing literature. The novelty of our approach also lies\nin the fact that we present a graphical point of view. This is done by\nintroducing a spectral space on which the various properties of our\nentanglement quantifier have a direct pictorial interpretation. Notably, this\napproach proves particularly effective for assessing $k$-entanglement, as we\nshow its ability to extend previously established inequalities. To enhance\nunderstanding, we also demonstrate how this framework applies to specific\nscenarios, encompassing both finite-dimensional cases and infinite-dimensional\nsystems, the latter being exemplified by the time-frequency modal degree of\nfreedom of co-propagating single photons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
