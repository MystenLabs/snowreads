Methods addressing this task\ncommonly rely on sequence alignment algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models or\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) applied directly to note or onset sequences. While\nsuccessful in many cases, such methods struggle with large mismatches between\nthe versions. In this work, we learn note-wise representations from data\naugmented with various complex mismatch cases, e.g. repeats, skips, block\ninsertions, and long trills. At the heart of our approach lies a transformer\nencoder network - TheGlueNote - which predicts pairwise note similarities for\ntwo 512 note subsequences. We postprocess the predicted similarities using\nflavors of weightedDTW and pitch-separated onsetDTW to retrieve note matches\nfor two sequences of arbitrary length. Our approach performs on par with the\nstate of the art in terms of note alignment accuracy, is considerably more\nrobust to version mismatches, and works directly on any pair of MIDI files.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
