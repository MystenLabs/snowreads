However, evaluating explanations is often not\ntrivial, and differences in applied metrics can be subtle, especially with\nnon-intelligible data. Thus, there is a need for visualizations tailored to\nexplore explanations for domains with such data, e.g., time series. We propose\nDAVOTS, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore raw time series\ndata, activations of neural networks, and attributions in a dense-pixel\nvisualization to gain insights into the data, models' decisions, and\nexplanations. To further support users in exploring large datasets, we apply\nclustering approaches to the visualized data domains to highlight groups and\npresent ordering strategies for individual and combined data exploration to\nfacilitate finding patterns. We visualize a CNN trained on the FordA dataset to\ndemonstrate the approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k9D2rZaL-ZVKDRRYm6ADmYM_IgKOqQhu4oJgFqkYZX4","pdfSize":"1585964"}
