We\npresent the ODMR study of single (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells (QWs) with\nthe hole gas. We observe different characteristics of the ODMR signals obtained\nsimultaneously using the optical signals of neutral and positively charged\nexciton. From that, we infer an existence of local fluctuations of carrier gas\ndensity resulting in separate populations of Mn$^{2+}$ ions. At the same time,\nthe shape of the ODMR signal contains information about the temperature of the\nmagnetic ions involved in the absorption of the MW. Studying it in detail\nprovides even more information about the interactions with charge carriers. In\nthe QW, two separate ensembles of ions are thermalized differently in the\npresence of carriers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N7jbRtctNEALSuEGI_x9GglgwzChAzc3dEMSmeHZ_nw","pdfSize":"818062"}
