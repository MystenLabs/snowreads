We prove that the quotient space of an orientable\nthree-dimensional small cover by such an involution belonging to the 2-torus is\nhomeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of $S^2 \\times S^1$. If this quotient\nspace is a 3-sphere, then the corresponding small cover is a two-fold branched\ncovering of the 3-sphere along a link. We provide a description of this link in\nterms of the polytope and the characteristic function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
