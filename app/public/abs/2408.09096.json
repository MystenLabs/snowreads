This error process is often assumed to\nfollow an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, or seasonal\nvariants thereof, which are unable to capture a long-range dependency structure\nof the error process. We propose a novel dynamic linear regression model that\nincorporates the long-range dependency feature of the errors. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed error process may (i) have a significant impact on the\nposterior uncertainty of the estimated regression parameters and (ii) improve\nthe model's forecasting ability. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo method\nto fit general dynamic linear regression models based on a frequency domain\napproach that enables fast, asymptotically exact Bayesian inference for large\ndatasets. We demonstrate that our approximate algorithm is faster than the\ntraditional time domain approaches, such as the Kalman filter and the\nmultivariate Gaussian likelihood, while retaining a high accuracy when\napproximating the posterior distribution. We illustrate the method in simulated\nexamples and two energy forecasting applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
