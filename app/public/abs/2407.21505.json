These formulations,\nfor example, commonly arise in the computation of multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) transfer functions for diffusion PDEs.\n  We propose an approximation scheme for $B^T \\phi(A) B$ leveraging the block\nLanczos algorithm and its equivalent representation through Stieltjes matrix\ncontinued fractions. We extend the notion of Gauss-Radau quadrature to the\nblock case, facilitating the derivation of easily computable error bounds. For\nproblems stemming from the discretization of self-adjoint operators with a\ncontinuous spectrum, we obtain sharp estimates grounded in potential theory for\nPad\\'e approximations and justify extrapolation algorithms at no added\ncomputational cost. The obtained results are illustrated on large-scale\nexamples of 2D diffusion and 3D Maxwell's equations as well as a graph from the\nSNAP repository. We also present promising experimental results on convergence\nacceleration via random enrichment of the initial block $B$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
