We then show that the radial (or\nrotationally symmetric) solutions for biharmonic equation on the model space $(\n\\mathbb{R}^+\\times S^{m-1}, dr^2 + \\sigma^2(r)\\, g^{S^{m-1}})$ can be given by\nan integral formula. We also prove that the model space always admits proper\nbiharmonic functions as the products of any eigenfunctions of the factor sphere\nwith certain radial functions. Many explicit examples of proper biharmonic\nfunctions on space forms are given. Finally, we give a complete classification\nof proper biharmonic functions with positive Laplacian on the punctured\nEuclidean space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
