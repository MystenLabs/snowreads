However, the evidence in favor of\nit did not include the full set of cosmological observables. Here we examine\nthe implications of this model for both early and late universe cosmology using\ndata from Planck collaboration, DESI 2024 and other experiments. We find that\nthe pure baby universe model gives a poor fit to current data. Extending it to\ninclude a contribution from the cosmological constant, we find two allowed\nregions of parameter space: one close to $\\Lambda$CDM, and another with\n$\\Lambda <0$ plus the exotic dark energy component. The two regions can be\nsignificantly favored over $\\Lambda$CDM, depending on the choice of supernova\ndatasets, and they can ameliorate the Hubble tension to the level of $2\\sigma$,\ndepending on the supernova dataset. The model with $\\Lambda<0$ features an\nequation of state $w(a)$ with a pole singularity at early times.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jf-s7CrAMwQJdi4fDaDWtzLmLMRK-NQgbLBgBfuV4b0","pdfSize":"893496"}
