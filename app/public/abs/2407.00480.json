When compared in the ratio of male to\nfemale, it has been duly found that the prone of having breast cancer is more\nin females than males. Breast lumps are classified mainly into two groups\nnamely: cancerous and non-cancerous. When we say that the lump in the breast is\ncancerous, it means that it can spread via lobules, ducts, areola, stroma to\nvarious organs of the body. On the other hand, non-cancerous breast lumps are\nless harmful but it should be monitored under proper diagnosis to avoid it\nbeing transformed to cancerous lump. To diagnose these breast lumps the method\nof mammogram, ultrasonic images and MRI images are undertaken. Also, for better\ndiagnosis sometimes doctors recommend for biopsy and any unforeseen anomalies\noccurring there may give rise to inaccurate test report. To avoid these\ndiscrepancies, processing the mammogram images is considered to be one of the\nmost reliable methods. In the proposed method MATLAB GUI is developed and some\nsample images of breast lumps are placed accordingly in the respective axes.\nWith the help of sliders the actual breast lump image is compared with the\nalready stored breast lump sample images and then accordingly the history of\nthe breast lumps is generated in real time in the form of test report.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aN0ww0Hc1DKHp0FoAuIa3fW7iZFaJcTiwh93w97ol1g","pdfSize":"794574"}
