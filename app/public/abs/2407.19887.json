Using the recently-developed wave model of geometric phase, we show\nthat it is better to define geometric phase more generally, allowing every\npolarized wave to have a well-defined value at any point in its path. Using\nseveral example systems, we show how this approach provides more insight into\nthe wave's behavior. Moreover, by tracking the continuous evolution of\ngeometric phase as a wave propagates through an optical system, we encounter a\nnatural explanation of why the conventional Poincare sphere solid angle method\nuses geodesic paths rather than physical paths of the polarization state.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lT4G4k_0UfiKCFha68OZ7lN6awV-MsNZHsD0rf2INHM","pdfSize":"1947727"}
