This paper presents a novel framework for contextual\ngrounding in textual models, with a particular emphasis on the Context\nRepresentation stage. Our approach aims to enhance the reliability and ethical\nalignment of these models through a comprehensive, context-aware methodology.\nBy explicitly capturing and representing relevant situational, cultural, and\nethical contexts in a machine-readable format, we lay the foundation for\nanchoring a model's behavior within these contexts. Our approach leverages\ntechniques from knowledge representation and reasoning, such as ontologies,\nsemantic web technologies, and logic-based formalisms. We evaluate our\nframework on real-world textual datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nimproving model performance, fairness, and alignment with human expectations,\nwhile maintaining high accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss the other key\ncomponents of the framework, including context-aware encoding, context-aware\nlearning, interpretability and explainability, and continuous monitoring and\nadaptation. This research contributes to the growing body of work on\nresponsible AI, offering a practical approach to developing more reliable,\ntrustworthy, and ethically-aligned language models. Our findings have\nsignificant implications for the deployment of LLMs in sensitive domains such\nas healthcare, legal systems, and social services, where contextual\nunderstanding is paramount.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WJBH9Mm39XIZcg6hG6LGcqP7XwOrbWzLy0T6KGkdwug","pdfSize":"1370926"}
