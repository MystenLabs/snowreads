However,\nthese extensions to nonlinear systems depend on solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\n(HJB) partial differential equations, which are infeasible for large-scale\nsystems. Polynomial approximations are a viable alternative for modest-sized\nsystems, but conventional polynomial approximations may yield negative values\nof the energy away from the origin. To address this issue, we explore\npolynomial approximations expressed as a sum of squares to ensure non-negative\napproximations. In this study, we focus on a reduced sum of squares polynomial\nwhere the coefficients are found through least-squares collocation --\nminimizing the HJB residual at sample points within a desired neighborhood of\nthe origin. We validate the accuracy of these approximations through a case\nstudy with a closed-form solution and assess their effectiveness for\ncontrolling a ring of van der Pol oscillators with a Laplacian-like coupling\nterm and discretized Burgers equation with source terms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
