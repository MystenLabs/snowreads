As a generalization of this\nquestion, Weston--Zaurova formulated conjectures concerning the distribution of\npower residues of degree $m$ of the Fourier coefficients of elliptic curves\n$E/\\mathbb{Q}$ with complex multiplication. In this paper, we prove their\nconjecture for cubic residues using the analytic theory of spin. Our proof\nworks for all elliptic curves $E$ with complex multiplication.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
