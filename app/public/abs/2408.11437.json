This extends several results for classical\nstrongly continuous semigroups on Banach spaces. In particular, we show that\nTravis' characterization of $\\mathrm{C}$-maximal regularity using the notion of\nbounded semivariation carries over to the general case. Under some topological\nassumptions, we further show the equivalence between maximal regularity and\nadmissibility in this context.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
