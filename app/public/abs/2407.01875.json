Many research works, including Potential\nOutcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it.\nHowever, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches\nare usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer\nspatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal\ninteractions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to\ninvestigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models,\ntheories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal\nframeworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
