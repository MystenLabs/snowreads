We discuss how difficulties associated with\nghosts are overcome in the context of 0+1d QFT. Obtaining a probability\ninterpretation is the key issue, and for this we discuss how an appropriate\ninner product can be constructed to define a sensible Born rule. Ghost theories\nare intrinsically unitary and perturbatively stable. They can also display\nnonperburbative stability even when the corresponding normal theory does not.\nThe spectra and propagators are numerically obtained at both weak and strong\ncoupling. Normalizable wave functions are obtained for the energy eigenstates\nand they show a violation of normal parity. We discuss connections to\nPT-symmetric quantum mechanics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
