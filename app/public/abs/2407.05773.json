What is the minimum number\n$f_k(n,t)$ of permutations of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ that $t$-shatter all subsets of\nsize $k$? For $t \\le 2$, $f_k(n,t) = \\Theta(1)$. Spencer showed that $f_k(n,t)\n= \\Theta(\\log \\log n)$ for $3 \\le t \\le k$ and $f_k(n,k!) = \\Theta(\\log n)$. In\n1996, F\\\"uredi asked whether partial shattering with permutations must always\nfall into one of these three regimes. Johnson and Wickes recently settled the\ncase $k = 3$ affirmatively and proved that $f_k(n,t) = \\Theta(\\log n)$ for $t >\n2 (k-1)!$.\n  We give a surprising negative answer to the question of F\\\"uredi by showing\nthat a fourth regime exists for $k \\ge 4$. We establish that $f_k(n,t) =\n\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ for certain values of $t$ and prove that this is the\nonly other regime when $k = 4$. We also show that $f_k(n,t) = \\Theta(\\log n)$\nfor $t > 2^{k-1}$. This greatly narrows the range of $t$ for which the\nasymptotic behaviour of $f_k(n,t)$ is unknown.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
