In particular, we\nfocus on recently made claims about the crucial role played by the degree of\nnon-Markovianity of the dynamics of the information carrier whose state we aim\nto teleport. We prove that any link between efficiency of teleportation and\nback-flow of information depends fundamentally on the way the various\noperations entailed by the measurement-free teleportation protocol are\nimplemented, while - in general - no claim of causal link can be made. Our\nresult reinforces the need for the explicit assessment of the underlying\nphysical platform when assessing the performance and resources for a given\nquantum protocol and the need for a rigorous quantum resource theory of\nnon-Markovianity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
