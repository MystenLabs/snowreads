We prove soficity for this family of groups under a\nflexible technical hypothesis for $H$ called $\\sigma$-co-sofic. This proves\nsoficity for group doubles $*_H G$, where $H<G$ is an arbitrary separable\nsubgroup and $G$ is countable and sofic. This includes arbitrary finite index\ngroup doubles of sofic groups among various other examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"o6C97YQFQ3arX8X2GZRRkOGc9hDat8ChevKylGdrni0","pdfSize":"177867"}
