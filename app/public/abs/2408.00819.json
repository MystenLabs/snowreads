Transportation\nagencies struggle to plan for these effects as ADAS availability is not tracked\nin vehicle registration databases. This paper examines methods to leverage\nexisting public reports and databases to estimate the proportion of vehicles\nequipped with or utilizing Levels 1 and 2 ADAS technologies in the United\nStates. Findings indicate that in 2022, between 8% and 25% of vehicles were\nequipped with various ADAS features, though actual usage rates were lower due\nto driver deactivation. The study proposes strategies to enhance estimates,\nincluding analyzing crash data, expanding event data recorder capabilities,\nconducting naturalistic driving studies, and collaborating with manufacturers\nto determine installation rates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
