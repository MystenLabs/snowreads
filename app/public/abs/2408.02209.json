Most existing performance prediction methods heavily rely\non the source data in their estimation process, limiting their applicability in\na more realistic setting where only the trained model is accessible. The few\nmethods that do not require source data exhibit considerably inferior\nperformance. In this work, we propose a source-free approach centred on\nuncertainty-based estimation, using a generative model for calibration in the\nabsence of source data. We establish connections between our approach for\nunsupervised calibration and temperature scaling. We then employ a\ngradient-based strategy to evaluate the correctness of the calibrated\npredictions. Our experiments on benchmark object recognition datasets reveal\nthat existing source-based methods fall short with limited source sample\navailability. Furthermore, our approach significantly outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art source-free and source-based methods, affirming its\neffectiveness in domain-invariant performance estimation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
