(Because the solid displaces\nliquid, the rate of decrease of the liquid level provides information about the\ncross-sectional area of the solid at that height; as the liquid level drops, it\n\"scans\" the area of the solid as a function of height.) We combine mathematical\nmodeling, Bayesian statistical inversion, Monte Carlo simulation, and wet\nexperiments of a tank draining of water to demonstrate and test our ability to\ninfer the cross-sectional area of the exogenous solid as a function of height.\nIn our experiment, the posterior distribution over the [held-out] shape of the\nsolid (a bottle) agreed reasonably well with our length-measurements (<10% mean\nreconstruction error on its radius). Our approach may be practically useful to\nnon-destructively characterize the geometry of an unknown solid, or a packed\nbed of solid particles, contained in an opaque tank.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
