Such\ndetected voltage emerges after a delay time td, which is intimately connected\nto the gap relaxation and heat escape times. By employing time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau theory to link the delay time to the applied current, we\ndetermined that the gap relaxation time depends linearly on film thickness,\naligning with the acoustic mismatch theory for phonon transmission at the\nsuperconductor-substrate interface. We thereby find a gap relaxation time of\n104 ps per nm of thickness for NbTi films on polished sapphire. We further show\nthat interfacial interaction with the substrate significantly impacts the gap\nrelaxation time, with observed values of 9 ns on SiOx, 6.8 ns on fused silica,\nand 5.2 ns on sapphire for a 50 nm thick NbTi strip at T = 5.75 K. These\ninsights are valuable for optimizing superconducting sensing technologies,\nparticularly the single-photon detectors that operate in the transient regime\nof nanothin superconducting bridges and filaments\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
