To emulate the common\neducational scenario where children/students learn by listening to and\nparticipating in conversations of their parents/teachers, we create\nCollaborative STORM (Co-STORM). Unlike QA systems that require users to ask all\nthe questions, Co-STORM lets users observe and occasionally steer the discourse\namong several LM agents. The agents ask questions on the user's behalf,\nallowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate\nuser interaction, Co-STORM assists users in tracking the discourse by\norganizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately\ngenerating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, we\nconstruct the WildSeek dataset by collecting real information-seeking records\nwith user goals. Co-STORM outperforms baseline methods on both discourse trace\nand report quality. In a further human evaluation, 70% of participants prefer\nCo-STORM over a search engine, and 78% favor it over a RAG chatbot.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
