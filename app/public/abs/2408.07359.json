We establish that an abstract surface admits a PNMC\nbiconservative immersion in \\mathbb{H}^4 if and only if it satisfies a certain\nintrinsic condition; if such an immersion exists, it is unique. We further\nanalyze these abstract surfaces, showing that they form a two-parameter family.\nAdditionally, we provide three characterizations of the intrinsic condition to\nexplore the geometric properties of these surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
