These galaxies also host populous systems of star clusters\nthat are on average larger and more luminous than typical globular clusters\n(GCs). We report an initial attempt to identify new candidate DM-deficient\ndwarfs via their unusual GC systems. Using a large catalog of LSB galaxies from\nthe Dark Energy Survey, we inspect their Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey\n(DECaLS) imaging and identify FCC 224 as a candidate found on the outskirts of\nthe Fornax cluster. We analyze the GC system using DECaLS and archival Hubble\nSpace Telescope WFPC2 imaging, and find an apparent population of overluminous\nGCs. More detailed follow-up of FCC 224 is in progress.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
