These\nconjectures assert that for every odd quadratic Dirichlet Character of\nconductor $f$, $\\chi_{-f}=\\left(\\frac{-f}{.}\\right)$, there exists a bivariate\npolynomial (or a rational polynomial in the weak version) whose Mahler measure\nis a rational multiple of $L'(\\chi_{-f},-1)$. To obtain such solutions for the\nconjectures we study a polynomial family denoted by $P_d(x,y)$, whose Mahler\nmeasure has been fully studied in \\cite{mehrabdollahei2021mahler}, and\n\\cite{BGMP}. We demonstrate that the Mahler measure of $P_d$ can be expressed\nas a linear combination of Dirichlet $L$-functions, which has the potential to\ngenerate solutions to the conjectures. Specifically, we prove that this family\nprovides solutions for conductors $f=3,4,8,15,20,24$. Notably, $P_d$\npolynomials provide intriguing examples where the Mahler measures are linked to\n$L'(\\chi,-1)$ with $\\chi$ being an odd non-real primitive Dirichlet character.\nThese examples inspired us to generalize Chinburg's conjectures from real\nprimitive odd Dirichlet characters to all primitive odd characters. For the\ngeneralized version of Chinburg's conjecture, $P_d$ polynomials provide\nsolutions for conductors $5,7,9$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uSijYGCC6KdDIPrAtJkgQK4QJ5RXrxIvrUk2TrVC5m0","pdfSize":"472262","objectId":"0x1e7438d5d012928f9e3263bc71866abb50eece0941bbfa6409199396a35451ff","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
