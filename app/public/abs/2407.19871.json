In response, we propose LocPIR, a novel framework using\nhomomorphic encryption (HE), specifically the TFHE scheme, to preserve user\nlocation privacy when retrieving data from public clouds. Our system employs\nTFHE's expertise in non-polynomial evaluations, crucial for comparison\noperations. LocPIR showcases minimal client-server interaction, reduced memory\noverhead, and efficient throughput. Performance tests confirm its computational\nspeed, making it a viable solution for practical scenarios, demonstrated via\napplication to a COVID-19 alert model. Thus, LocPIR effectively addresses\nprivacy concerns in location-based services, enabling secure data sharing from\nthe public cloud.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cVjhGhQjvH7kNw0z8SkRoXIAALHCTX9hg4BR56IWnnI","pdfSize":"860895"}
