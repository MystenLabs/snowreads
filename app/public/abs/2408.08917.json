The Python programming language is\nused to recreate the local constant crossed-field approximation (LCFA) with the\naim of determining values for transverse polarization given a nonzero initial\npolarization. It has been shown that over multiple laser shots, lower values of\nthe quantum efficiency parameter are associated with higher transverse\npolarization output, yet require a greater number of shots to attain maximal\npolarization. Moreover, the quantum efficiency parameter has been redefined as\na function of intensity for a Ti:sapphire laser necessary to induce\npolarization in the Electron-Ion Collide\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
