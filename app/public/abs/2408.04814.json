We\nask: what is the maximal sacrifice that can be imposed on another individual\naccording to an evaluator for the sake of this increment? We show that the\nanswer can reveal how inequality averse an evaluator is. In particular, all\nKolm-Pollak evaluators would sacrifice the full income of the sacrificed\nindividual if their income was low enough and a declining fraction of their\nincome otherwise. Kolm-Atkinson evaluators would sacrifice the full income of\nthe sacrificed individual, for all income levels, if their inequality aversion\nwas no greater than one, and sacrifice a constant fraction of their income\notherwise. Motivated by these findings, we propose a class of social\npreferences that, starting from a baseline level of protection, protect a\nhigher fraction of the sacrificed individual's income the lower their income.\nIn addition to relating levels of protected income to coefficients of\ninequality, we also characterize the classes of additively separable social\nwelfare functions that guarantee specific (absolute or relative) levels of\nprotection.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
