In this letter we propose a new interpretation\nfor $P_c(4457)$, which is the state generated from the coupled-channel\n$\\bar{D}^0\\Lambda_c^{+}(2595)$ and $\\pi^0 P_c(4312)$ since they can exchange an\nalmost on-shell $\\Sigma_c^+$. In this scenario, the parity of $P_c(4457)$ will\nbe positive, which is different from the candidate of the bound state of\n$\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c$. The main decay channel of $P_c(4457)$ in this model is\n$P_c(4312)\\pi$. We propose three processes $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi K_s p\n\\pi^-$, $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi K^- p \\pi^0$, and $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi p\n\\pi^- \\pi^+ K^-$ to verify $P_c(4457)\\to P_c(4312)\\pi$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
