However, this structure is\naccompanied by additional challenges in locomotion controller design,\nespecially in complex real-world environments. As a result, existing humanoid\nrobots are limited to relatively simple terrains, either with model-based\ncontrol or model-free reinforcement learning. In this work, we introduce\nDenoising World Model Learning (DWL), an end-to-end reinforcement learning\nframework for humanoid locomotion control, which demonstrates the world's first\nhumanoid robot to master real-world challenging terrains such as snowy and\ninclined land in the wild, up and down stairs, and extremely uneven terrains.\nAll scenarios run the same learned neural network with zero-shot sim-to-real\ntransfer, indicating the superior robustness and generalization capability of\nthe proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PdhCu1qvELu3WOOkSvi_NjPk-6G72RbiG4WtNmdSDq4","pdfSize":"10470079"}
