However, its complexity and extensive configuration options\noften lead to security vulnerabilities if not managed properly. This paper\npresents a detailed analysis of misconfigurations in Kubernetes environments\nand their significant impact on system reliability and security. A centralized\nlogging solution was developed to detect such misconfigurations, detailing the\nintegration process with a Kubernetes cluster and the implementation of\nrole-based access control. Utilizing a combination of open-source tools, the\nsolution systematically identifies misconfigurations and aggregates diagnostic\ndata into a central repository. The effectiveness of the solution was evaluated\nusing specific metrics, such as the total cycle time for running the central\nlogging solution against the individual open source tools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
