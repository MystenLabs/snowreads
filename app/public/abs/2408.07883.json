However, missing\nscores can degrade performance as well as limit the possible fusion techniques\nthat can be applied. Imputation is a promising technique in multibiometric\nsystems for replacing missing data. In this paper, we evaluate various score\nimputation approaches on three multimodal biometric score datasets, viz. NIST\nBSSR1, BIOCOP2008, and MIT LL Trimodal, and investigate the factors which might\ninfluence the effectiveness of imputation. Our studies reveal three key\nobservations: (1) Imputation is preferable over not imputing missing scores,\neven when the fusion rule does not require complete score data. (2) Balancing\nthe classes in the training data is crucial to mitigate negative biases in the\nimputation technique towards the under-represented class, even if it involves\ndropping a substantial number of score vectors. (3) Multivariate imputation\napproaches seem to be beneficial when scores between modalities are correlated,\nwhile univariate approaches seem to benefit scenarios where scores between\nmodalities are less correlated.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4HnrT4fPih5zseSQ0j7Yflks2niUUyNJpaagSOzCoGg","pdfSize":"416101"}
