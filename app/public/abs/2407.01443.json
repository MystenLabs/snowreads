Specifically, we extend the Corbino-Castillo operators so they\ncan be utilized to solve problems in non-trivial geometries. We prove that the\nresulting curvilinear operators satisfy the discrete analog of the extended\nGauss-Divergence theorem. In addition, we demonstrate energy and mass\nconservation in curvilinear coordinates for the acoustic wave equation. These\nfindings are illustrated in two-dimensional and three-dimensional\nelliptic/hyperbolic equations and can be extended to other partial differential\nequations as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
