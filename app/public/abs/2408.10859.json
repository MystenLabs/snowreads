In the regime where the characteristic\ndata is close to Minkowski data, we show that this $C^3$-null gluing problem is\nsolvable up to a $20$-dimensional space of obstructions. The obstructions\ncorrespond to $20$ linearly conserved quantities: $10$ of which are already\npresent in the $C^2$-null gluing problem analysed by Aretakis, Czimek and\nRodnianski, and $10$ are novel obstructions inherent to the $C^3$-null gluing\nproblem. The $10$ novel obstructions are linearly conserved charges calculated\nfrom third-order derivatives of the metric.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
