We obtain some expressions for the\nBerwald-Weyl curvature. This quantity is a projective invariant with respect to\na fixed volume form. We prove that for any spray of scalar curvature on a\nmanifold of dimension $n\\geq 3$, the Berwald-Weyl curvature vanishes with\nrespect to any volume form. We also show that for any Finsler metric of\nconstant Ricci curvature and constant S-curvature, the Berwald-Weyl curvature\nvanishes with respect to the Busemann-Hausdorff volume form. This study leads\nto a new notion of BWeyl-flat sprays/Finsler metrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
