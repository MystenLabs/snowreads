The purpose of this research is to study these convergence/divergence\nquestions by measuring the size of the set $A\\subset\\mathbb{N}$ in a more\nprecise way in terms of the recently introduced asymptotic $\\psi$-density. The\nconvergence of the associated sub-signed series $\\sum_{n=1 }^{\\infty}m_nc_n$ is\nalso discussed, where $\\{m_n\\}_n$ is a real sequence with values restricted to\nthe set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
