In Ref.[1], we have constructed a neural network\nwhich can accurately identify the CME-related signal from the final-state pion\nspectra. In this paper, we generalize such a neural network to the case of CMW\nsearch. We show that, after a updated training, the neural network can\neffectively recognize the CMW-related signal. Additionally, we assess the\nperformance of the neural network compared to other known methods for CMW\nsearch.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"luliJQ3wLFW92CHqwQxpa7bCDPWkdbyyKHpBeYmQzys","pdfSize":"1089091"}
