In this paper, we explore the converse\ndirection and show that many groupoids in the literature serving as models for\nclassifiable $C^*$-algebras are almost elementary. In particular, for a large\nclass $\\mathcal{C}$ of Elliott invariants and a $C^*$-algebra $A$ with\n$\\operatorname{Ell}(A)\\in \\mathcal{C}$, we show that $A$ is classifiable if and\nonly if $A$ possesses a minimal, effective, amenable, second countable, almost\nelementary groupoid model, which leads to a groupoid-theoretic characterization\nof classifiability of $C^*$-algebras with certain Elliott invariants. Moreover,\nwe build a connection between almost elementariness and pure infiniteness for\ngroupoids and study obstructions to obtaining a transformation groupoid model\nfor the Jiang-Su algebra $\\mathcal{Z}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
