However, they often struggle to maintain their\nperformance in extreme and adverse weather conditions due to significant\ndifferences in the domain and a lack of adverse weather images for training. To\naddress this issue and enhance the model's robustness in adverse weather, we\npropose a two-stage crowd counting method. Specifically, in the first stage, we\nintroduce a multi-queue MoCo contrastive learning strategy to tackle the\nproblem of weather class imbalance. This strategy facilitates the learning of\nweather-aware representations by the model. In the second stage, we propose to\nrefine the representations under the guidance of contrastive learning, enabling\nthe conversion of the weather-aware representations to the normal weather\ndomain. While significantly improving the robustness, our method only\nmarginally increases the weight of the model. In addition, we also create a new\nsynthetic adverse weather dataset. Extensive experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves competitive performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tucDq15J5KJsCMzJWcPIBUgp_c45HTdQgsWDIbO3iig","pdfSize":"6921612"}
