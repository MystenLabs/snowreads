We\nstudy a quantum analogue of this model called the common Haar state (CHS)\nmodel. In this model, every party participating in the cryptographic system\nreceives many copies of one or more i.i.d Haar random states. We study\nfeasibility and limitations of cryptographic primitives in this model and its\nvariants:\n  - We present a construction of pseudorandom function-like states with\nsecurity against computationally unbounded adversaries, as long as the\nadversaries only receive (a priori) bounded number of copies. By suitably\ninstantiating the CHS model, we obtain a new approach to construct pseudorandom\nfunction-like states in the plain model.\n  - We present separations between pseudorandom function-like states (with\nsuper-logarithmic length) and quantum cryptographic primitives, such as\ninteractive key agreement and bit commitment, with classical communication. To\nshow these separations, we prove new results on the indistinguishability of\nidentical versus independent Haar states against LOCC (local operations,\nclassical communication) adversaries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
