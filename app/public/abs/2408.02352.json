The coupling structure is defined by\nan undirected network, while the dynamic equations are derived from a\nHamiltonian; as such, the energy is conserved. We provide sufficient conditions\non the energy for bounded motion, identifying the oscillatory regime. We also\ndescribe the bifurcations of synchronised states, exploiting the quantities\nrelated to the network structure. Moreover, we consider patterns of\nanti-synchrony arising from the specific properties of the model. Such patterns\ncan be linked to global properties of the system by looking at motion of the\ncentre of mass. Nonetheless, the anti-synchrony patterns play also a relevant\nrole in the bifurcation analysis. For the case of graphs with a large number of\nnodes, we characterise the parameter range in which the bifurcations occur. We\ncomplement the analysis with some numerical simulations showing the interplay\nbetween bifurcations of the origin and transitions to chaos of nearby orbits. A\nkey feature is that the observed chaotic regime emerges at low energies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
