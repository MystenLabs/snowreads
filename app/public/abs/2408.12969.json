The hub is located near the geometric center of the cloud and\nrepresents its most massive clump. We studied the central 2 pc $\\times$ 2 pc\narea of the hub with 5$\\sigma$ limiting magnitudes of 20.5, 20.1, and 18.6 mag\nin the $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ bands, respectively. Using the $K_s$-band luminosity\nfunction and comparing it with the synthetic clusters, we obtained the age of\nthe cluster as $\\sim$0.5 Myr, which was found to corroborate well with the\nvisual extinction versus the age of nearby embedded clusters. We find that the\npresent mass of the cluster is around $\\sim$180 $M_\\odot$, and the cluster is\ncurrently forming stars at a rate of $\\sim$330 $M_\\odot$ $\\rm{Myr}^{-1}$, with\nan efficiency of $\\sim$20%. The cluster is connected to an extended gas\nreservoir through a filamentary network; thus, we hypothesize that the cluster\nhas the potential to become a richer cluster in a few Myr of time.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UXvMtnVGetgVwYKFjy4LJk6Yxyu2yBMrJycUvNU-UVs","pdfSize":"6223598"}
