Examples include self-similar sets, self-affine sets etc. A\nbeautiful variant on the standard IFS model was introduced by Barnsley and\nDemko in 1985 where one builds an \\emph{inhomogeneous} attractor by taking the\nclosure of the orbit of a fixed compact condensation set under a given standard\nIFS. In this expository article I will discuss the dimension theory of\ninhomogeneous attractors, giving several examples and some open questions. I\nwill focus on the upper box dimension with emphasis on how to derive good\nestimates, and when these estimates fail to be sharp.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
