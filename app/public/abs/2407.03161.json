In particular, QD\narrays offer a natural representation of the interacting $\\pi$-electron system\nof small hydrocarbons. Here we investigate the prospects for extending QD\nsimulators to encompass also the nuclear degrees of freedom. We represent the\nmolecular vibrational modes by single-mode microwave resonators coupled\ncapacitively to the QDs and study the gate-tunable energy transfer from a\nvoltage-biased triple quantum dot (TQD) system to a single damped resonator\nmode. We determine the QD population inversions, the corresponding charge and\nenergy currents as well as the resonator photon number, using Lindblad master\nequations and lowest-order perturbation theory within Keldysh Green function\nformalism. Along the way, we discuss the merits and shortcomings of the two\nmethods.A central result is the interrelation of a pronounced minimum in the\ncharge current with a maximum in energy transfer, arising from a gate-tunable\ninterference effect in the molecular orbitals of the TQD electron system.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
