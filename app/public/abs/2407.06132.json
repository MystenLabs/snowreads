Until now, analytic expressions for the R\\'enyi common information of\nall orders in $[0,\\infty]$ have been completely known for this source. We also\nconsider the R\\'enyi common information of all orders in $[-\\infty,0)$ and\nevaluate it for the DSBS. We provide a sufficient condition under which the\nR\\'enyi common information of such orders coincides with Wyner's common\ninformation for the DSBS. Based on numerical analysis, we conjecture that there\nis a certain phase transition as the crossover probability increasing for the\nR\\'enyi common information of negative orders for the DSBS. Our proofs are\nbased on a lemma on splitting of the entropy and the analytic expression of\nrelaxed Wyner's common information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
