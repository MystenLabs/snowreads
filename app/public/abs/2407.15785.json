Then, applying again the concept of weak Freiman isomorphism, we show\nthat any subset of size $k$ of the dicyclic group $\\mathrm{Dic}_{m}$ is\nsequenceable, provided that the prime factors of $m$ are larger than $k^k$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DuZCyc9bLhRxN-hcsqnABxaco4Gkw1ybhOfnG2Z-Ix4","pdfSize":"376790"}
