Quantifiers represent a significant challenge for SMT and\nare technically a source of undecidability. In our approach, we train an\nefficient machine learning model that informs the solver which quantifiers\nshould be instantiated and which not. Each quantifier may be instantiated\nmultiple times and the set of the active quantifiers changes as the solving\nprogresses. Therefore, we invoke the ML predictor many times, during the whole\nrun of the solver. To make this efficient, we use fast ML models based on\ngradient boosting decision trees. We integrate our approach into the\nstate-of-the-art cvc5 SMT solver and show a considerable increase of the\nsystem's holdout-set performance after training it on a large set of\nfirst-order problems collected from the Mizar Mathematical Library.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
