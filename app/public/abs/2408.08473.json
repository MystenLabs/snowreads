A\npromising way of generating them is heralding entanglement generation at a high\nrate from letting independent photons interfere. However, such schemes often\nwork for a specific internal degree of freedom of the interfering photons only.\nGoing to higher numbers of entangled photons, the success probabilities\ndecrease while the number of necessary resources, e.g., auxiliary photons and\noptical elements, increases. To make probabilistic schemes feasible also for\nlarger quantum states, it is therefore important to find resource-efficient\ngeneration schemes with high success probabilities. In this work, we introduce\neasily implementable schemes to herald qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nstates, higher-dimensional Bell states and higher-dimensional three-party GHZ\nstates. Our schemes solely rely on multiphoton interference, i.e., they can be\nadjusted to work for arbitrary degrees of freedom. Furthermore, they\ndemonstrate high success probabilities and need comparably few auxiliary\nphotons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
