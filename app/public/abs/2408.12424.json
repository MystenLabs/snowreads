The gauge theory of baryons induces non-trivial\ntriangle gauge anomalies, and we provide a simple anomaly-free solution by\nadding three exotic fermions. A scalar $S$ spontaneously breaks the $U(1)_B$\nsymmetry, leaving behind a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry that ensures the stability\nof the lightest exotic fermion was originally introduced to cancel the triangle\ngauge anomalies. Scenarios with weakly interacting DM candidates having\nnon-zero hypercharge usually face stringent constraints from experimental\nbounds on the DM spin-independent direct-detection (SIDD) cross-section. In\nthis work, we consider a two-component singlet-doublet fermionic dark matter\nscenario, which significantly relaxes the constraints from bounds on the DM\nSIDD cross-section for suppressed singlet-doublet mixing. We show that the\nmodel offers a viable parameter space for a cosmologically consistent DM\ncandidate that can be probed through direct and indirect searches, collider\nexperiments, and gravitational wave (GW) experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8x3tT-kxPt2R6EeHJvKt7rjcca7srySAROk4X8J4Gc8","pdfSize":"1032305"}
