In the absence of linear coupling, the relative pump phase does\nnot affect counterpropagating intraresonator intensities, and two asymmetric\nstates arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Contrariwise, in the\npresence of weak linear intermode coupling, the asymmetry of the states is\ndeterministically controlled via changes in phase (for all phases except 0 and\n$\\pi$). Spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero phase is suppressed when the\nlinear intermode coupling is increased, while for the $\\pi$ phase it can be\nenhanced, so that the overall threshold for the spontaneous symmetry breaking\ncan be significantly lower for nonzero linear coupling. These results are\nimportant for fundamental understanding of the processes in Kerr resonators and\nother systems with Kerr-like nonlinearities and linear intermode coupling and\nhave high prospects for the development of photonic devices such as\nultrasensitive sensors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
