In this work, we investigate the effective interactions between\nlow-energy matter excitations induced by the off-resonant coupling with cavity\nelectromagnetic modes. We extend previous work by going beyond the dipole\napproximation accounting for the full polarization and magnetization densities\nof matter. We further include the often neglected diamagnetic interaction and,\nfor the cavity, we consider general linear absorbing media with possibly\nnon-local and non-reciprocal response. We demonstrate that, even in this\ngeneral scenario, the effective cavity-induced interactions between the matter\ndegrees of freedom are of electrostatic and magnetostatic nature. This confirms\nthe necessity of a multimode description for cavity engineering of matter\nsystems where the low-energy assumption holds. Our findings provide a\ntheoretical framework for studying the influence of general optical\nenvironments on extended low-energy matter excitations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
