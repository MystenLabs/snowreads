A second part\ndiscusses applications; from confidence intervals through testing problems to\nconnections to Bernoulli distributions and stationary Markov chains.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
