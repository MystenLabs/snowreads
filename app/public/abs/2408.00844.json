Multiple\nstrategies have been proposed to approach and optimize such protocols, most\nhowever restricted to Clifford operations. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nsuperposed entanglement purification design strategy, leveraging coherent\nsuperpositions of the roles of entangled states to enhance purification\nefficiency. We demonstrate how this approach can be hierarchically integrated\nwith existing entanglement purification strategies, consistently improving\nprotocols performance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
