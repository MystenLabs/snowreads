We introduce a scaled\nversion of the classic Aalen--Johansen estimator that overcomes this challenge.\nStrong uniform consistency and asymptotic normality are established under\nentirely random right-censoring, subject to lax moment conditions on the\nmultivariate counting process. In a simulation study, the estimator outperforms\nearlier proposals from the literature. Finally, we showcase the potential of\nthe presented method to other areas of actuarial science.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
