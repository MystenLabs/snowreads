Colin and T. Colin (2004) as\na model of laser-plasma interaction. For the nonperiodic setting, the authors\nproved some well-posedness results, which contain the scaling critical case for\n$d\\geq 2$. In the present paper, we prove the well-posedness of this system for\nthe periodic setting. In particular, well-posedness is proved at the scaling\ncritical regularity for $d\\geq 3$ under some conditions for the coefficients of\nthe Laplacian. We also prove some ill-posedness results. As long as we use an\niteration argument, our well-posedness results are optimal except for some\ncritical cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
