UME is a methodology designed for mapping observations of the same\nobject, related by rigid transformations, into a single low-dimensional linear\nsubspace. This process yields a transformation-invariant representation of the\nobservations, with its matrix form representation being covariant (i.e.\nequivariant) with the transformation. We extend the UME framework by\nintroducing a UME-compatible feature extraction method augmented with a unique\nUME contrastive loss and a sampling equalizer. These components are integrated\ninto a comprehensive and robust registration pipeline, named UMERegRobust. We\npropose the RotKITTI registration benchmark, specifically tailored to evaluate\nregistration methods for scenarios involving large rotations. UMERegRobust\nachieves better than state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark,\nespecially when strict precision of (1{\\deg}, 10cm) is considered (with an\naverage gain of +9%), and notably outperform SOTA methods on the RotKITTI\nbenchmark (with +45% gain compared the most recent SOTA method).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
