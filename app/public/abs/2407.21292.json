A fermion dark matter $\\chi$ carrying\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ charge is introduced to the model but not coupling with other\nparticles. We consider the freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms, and obtain the\ncorrect relic density respectively. We have scanned the feasible parameter\nspace and found that the dark matter direct detection experiments imposed the\nmost stringent constraints on the parameter space. The constraint on the\nparameter space places a limit on the mass of dark matter with $m_{\\chi}\n\\approx 1/2 M_{Z'}$ within a narrow region in the case of freeze-out scenario,\nand we can obtain the right baryon asymmetry result in the case of\n$m_{\\chi}\\subset[654$ GeV, 664 GeV]. For the freeze-in scenario, we have a much\nbroader parameter space for $m_{\\chi}$ and $M_{Z^\\prime}$ but $g_{BL}$ is\nrestricted at $10^{-5}$ level for $Q=0.1$. In both scenarios,\n$g_{BL}-M_{Z^\\prime}$ is limited within a narrow region by the dark matter\nrelic density, direct detection and baryon asymmetry constraints.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
