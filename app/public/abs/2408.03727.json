The cooperative chromatic\nnumber of a class $\\mathcal{H}$ is the smallest number of hypergraphs from\n$\\mathcal{H}$ that always possess a cooperative coloring. For the classes of\n$k$-uniform tight cycles, $k$-uniform loose cycles, $k$-uniform tight paths,\nand $k$-uniform loose paths, we find that their cooperative chromatic numbers\nare all exactly two utilizing a new proved set system partition theorem, which\nalso has its independent interests and offers a broader perspective. For the\nclass of $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraphs with sufficient large maximum\ndegree $d$, we prove that its cooperative chromatic number has lower bound\n$\\Omega(\\log_k d)$ and upper bound $\\text{O}\\left(\\frac{d}{\\ln\nd}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{k-1}}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
