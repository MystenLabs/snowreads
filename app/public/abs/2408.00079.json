In these\nstates, qubits are partitioned into sensing groups with relatively large\ncorrelations within a group but small correlations between groups. The states\nare obtainable from local Hamiltonian evolution, and we design a metrologically\noptimal and efficient measurement protocol utilizing time-reversed dynamics and\nsingle-qubit local measurements. Using quantum domino dynamics, we also present\na protocol free of the time-reversal step that has an estimation error roughly\ntwice the best possible value.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
