Employing NMR on a floating object could unveil novel possibilities\nbeyond conventional operational paradigms. Here, we observe Nuclear Magnetic\nResonance (NMR) within a levitating micro-diamond using the nuclear spins of\nnitrogen-14 atoms. By tightly confining the angular degrees of freedom of the\ndiamond in a Paul trap, we achieve efficient hyperfine interaction between\noptically polarized electronic spins of nitrogen-vacancy centers and the\n$^{14}$N nuclear spin, enabling nuclear spin polarization and quantum state\nread-out revealing coherence times up to hundreds of microseconds. This\nrepresents the longest recorded spin coherence time in a levitated system,\nsurpassing previous records by three orders of magnitude. Our results offer\npromise for various applications, including cooling macroscopic particles to\ntheir motional ground state and exploring geometric phases for gyroscopy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
