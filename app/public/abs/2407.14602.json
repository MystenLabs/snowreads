However, using these tools is not\nstraightforward, and users must dive into different codes, input-output\nformats, and methodologies, hindering an efficient and robust exploration of\nthe available data. We present the SHERLOCK pipeline, an end-to-end public\nsoftware that allows the users to easily explore observations from space-based\nmissions such as TESS or Kepler to recover known planets and candidates issued\nby the official pipelines and search for new planetary candidates that remained\nunnoticed. The pipeline incorporates all the steps to search for transit-like\nfeatures, vet potential candidates, provide statistical validation, conduct a\nBayesian fitting, and compute observational windows from ground-based\nobservatories. Its performance is tested against a catalog of known and\nconfirmed planets from the TESS mission, trying to recover the official TESS\nObjects of Interest (TOIs), explore the existence of companions that have been\nmissed, and release them as new planetary candidates. SHERLOCK demonstrated an\nexcellent performance, recovering 98% of the TOIs and confirmed planets in our\ntest sample and finding new candidates. Specifically, we release four new\nplanetary candidates around the systems WASP-16 (with P$\\sim$10.46 d and\nR$\\sim$2.20 $R_\\oplus$), HAT-P-27 (with P$\\sim$1.20 d and R$\\sim$4.33\n$R_\\oplus$), HAT-P-26 (with P$\\sim$6.59 d and R$\\sim$1.97 $R_\\oplus$), and\nTOI-2411 (with P$\\sim$18.75 d and R$\\sim$2.88 $R_\\oplus$).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pjkk5bX4AQ1OexbfQ_G7ZIkBbT69JUAhN8dQi8Sxg3w","pdfSize":"6904503","objectId":"0x4fc67fa6fc54a29c55a3cd26ef9371985c955abdd563443047a03b7caac148fa","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
