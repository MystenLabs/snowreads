In particular, there have been efforts to\nintegrate LLMs into various aspects of wireless communication systems. The use\nof LLMs in wireless communication systems has the potential to realize\nartificial general intelligence (AGI)-enabled wireless networks. In this paper,\nwe investigate an LLM-based resource allocation scheme for wireless\ncommunication systems. Specifically, we formulate a simple resource allocation\nproblem involving two transmit pairs and develop an LLM-based resource\nallocation approach that aims to maximize either energy efficiency or spectral\nefficiency. Additionally, we consider the joint use of low-complexity resource\nallocation techniques to compensate for the reliability shortcomings of the\nLLM-based scheme. After confirming the applicability and feasibility of\nLLM-based resource allocation, we address several key technical challenges that\nremain in applying LLMs in practice.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"41hr75At9tW6zIy5ZetPgsgTJEuOqrAKiq-Rec5XxT4","pdfSize":"912795"}
