Here, we study stochastic second-order coupled Kuramoto\noscillators with higher-order interactions, and show that as noise strength\nincreases the critical points associated with synchronization transitions shift\ntoward higher coupling values. By employing the perturbation analysis, we\nobtain an expression for the forward critical point as a function of inertia\nand noise strength. Further, for overdamped systems we show that as noise\nstrength increases, the first-order transition switches to second-order even\nfor higher-order couplings. We include a discussion on nature of critical\npoints obtained through Ott-Antonsen ansatz.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
