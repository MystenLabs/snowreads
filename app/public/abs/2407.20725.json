In\nparticular, we focus on the optimal set of actuation parameters found by Tousi\net al. [1, 2] for a SD7003 airfoil at a Reynolds number Re = 6 e4 and\npost-stall angle of attack alpha = 14 degrees fitted with a Synthetic Jet\nActuator (SJA). The Large Eddy Simulation (LES) presented in that work is taken\nas the reference to identify the best choice of boundary conditions for the\nturbulence field nu' at both domain inlet and jet orifice in two-dimensional\nRANS-SA computations. Although SA-RANS is far less accurate than LES, our\nfindings show that it can still predict macroscopic aggregates such as lift and\ndrag coefficients quite statisfactorily and at a much lower computational cost,\nprovided that turbulence levels of the actuator jet are set to a realistic\nvalue. An adequate value of nu'is instrumental in capturing the correct flow\nbehaviour of the reattached boundary layers for close-to-optimal actuated\ncases. This validates the use of RANS-SA as a reliable and cost-effective\nsimulation method for the preliminary optimisation of SJA parameters in AFC\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
