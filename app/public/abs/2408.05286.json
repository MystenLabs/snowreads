We conducted two driving simulator\nexperiments to examine how different cognitive demands of texting, priorities,\nand takeover time budgets affect drivers' takeover strategies. We also\nevaluated how different takeover strategies affect takeover performance. We\nfound that the choice of takeover strategy was influenced by the priority and\ntakeover time budget but not by the cognitive demand of the NDRT. The takeover\nstrategy did not have any effect on takeover quality or NDRT engagement but\ninfluenced takeover timing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
