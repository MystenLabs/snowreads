The angular momentum is presented as the sum of the angular\nmomentum relative to the point where the charge is located at a retarded moment\nof time and the angular momentum relative to an arbitrary stationary center. In\nparticular, the instantaneous center of curvature of the trajectory is\nconsidered as such a center. Explicit expressions for the angular distribution\nof these components of angular momentum fluxes are obtained and studied. It is\nshown that the angular momentum of the field relative to the position of the\ncharge is determined only by the properties of the electromagnetic radiation\nfield, and the angular momentum relative to an arbitrarily distant point is the\nvector product of the displacement of this point and the force corresponding to\nradiation pressure. It is shown that in the ultrarelativistic limit, the\ncanonical angular momentum of the radiation coincides with the angular momentum\nfollowing from the symmetrized energy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic\nfield.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
