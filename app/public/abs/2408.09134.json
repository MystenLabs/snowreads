As the\nuse of LLMs for coding assistance grows, so do concerns about the\nmaintainability of the code they produce. Previous research has mainly\nconcentrated on the functional accuracy and testing success of generated code,\noverlooking aspects of maintainability.\n  Our approach involves the use of a specifically designed dataset for training\nand evaluating the model, ensuring a thorough assessment of code\nmaintainability. At the heart of our work is the fine-tuning of an LLM for code\nrefactoring, aimed at enhancing code readability, reducing complexity, and\nimproving overall maintainability.\n  After fine-tuning an LLM to prioritize code maintainability, our evaluations\nindicate that this model significantly improves code maintainability standards,\nsuggesting a promising direction for the future of AI-assisted software\ndevelopment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6_jHPHgxid7h5iafn_DSQHFn-x8yauzAs0alzPewrbk","pdfSize":"1291385"}
