In contrast to existing solutions that decompose the\nobstacle-free space into multiple convex sets, the continuous corridors\ncomputed by our method are smooth and differentiable, making them compatible\nwith existing numerical techniques for learning and optimization. To achieve\nthis, we represent the collision-free corridors as a path-parametric\noff-centered ellipse with a polynomial basis. We show that the problem of\nmaximizing the volume of such corridors is convex, and can be efficiently\nsolved. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we examine its\nperformance in a synthetic case study and subsequently evaluate its\napplicability in a real-world scenario from the KITTI dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
