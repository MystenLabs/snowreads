These uncertainties\nsignificantly influence portfolio outcomes in both classical and\nmulti-objective Markowitz models. To address these challenges, our research\nexplores the power of robust multi-objective optimization. Since portfolio\nmanagers frequently measure their solutions against benchmarks, we enhance the\nmulti-objective min-regret robustness concept by incorporating these benchmark\ncomparisons.\n  This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world\ninvestment scenarios, offering portfolio managers more reliable and adaptable\nstrategies for navigating market uncertainties. Our framework provides a more\nnuanced and practical approach to portfolio optimization under real-world\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eqtZKF5x7M4pszaULAkG3V9-lQ02kXjlek9LVDgdgKQ","pdfSize":"1130402","objectId":"0x39f6fa80bfe234d64edde2a843463710dd777562f98542f7d87bc828f8e8c476","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
