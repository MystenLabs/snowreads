These uncertainties\nsignificantly influence portfolio outcomes in both classical and\nmulti-objective Markowitz models. To address these challenges, our research\nexplores the power of robust multi-objective optimization. Since portfolio\nmanagers frequently measure their solutions against benchmarks, we enhance the\nmulti-objective min-regret robustness concept by incorporating these benchmark\ncomparisons.\n  This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world\ninvestment scenarios, offering portfolio managers more reliable and adaptable\nstrategies for navigating market uncertainties. Our framework provides a more\nnuanced and practical approach to portfolio optimization under real-world\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
