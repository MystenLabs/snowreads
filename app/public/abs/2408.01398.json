We discretize the problem with the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method in space and with the leapfrog scheme in time. An\nanalytical setting is provided in which we show wellposedness of the problem,\nderive stability estimates, and exploit this in the error analysis to prove\nrigorous error bounds for both the spatial and full discretization. The\ntheoretical findings are confirmed with numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
