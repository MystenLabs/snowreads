A fundamental question emerges: what role, if\nany, do quantum coherences between molecular electron states play in\nphotochemical reactions? Answering this question necessitates quantum\ntomography: the determination of the electronic density matrix from\nexperimental data, where the off-diagonal elements represent these coherences.\nThe Maximal Entropy (MaxEnt) based Quantum State Tomography (QST) approach\noffers unique advantages in studying molecular dynamics, particularly with\npartial tomographic data. Here, we explore the application of MaxEnt-based QST\non photoexcited ammonia, necessitating the operator form of observables\nspecific to the performed measurements. We present two methodologies for\nconstructing these operators: one leveraging Molecular Angular Distribution\nMoments (MADMs) which accurately capture the orientation-dependent vibronic\ndynamics of molecules; and another utilizing Angular Momentum Coherence\nOperators to construct measurement operators for the full rovibronic density\nmatrix in the symmetric top basis. A key revelation of our study is the direct\nlink between Lagrange multipliers in the MaxEnt formalism and the unique set of\nMADMs. Furthermore, we achieve a groundbreaking milestone by constructing, for\nthe first time, the entanglement entropy of the electronic subsystem: a metric\nthat was previously inaccessible. The entropy vividly reveals and quantifies\nthe effects of coupling between the excited electron and nuclear degrees of\nfreedom. Consequently, our findings open new avenues for research in ultrafast\nmolecular spectroscopy within the broader domain of quantum information\nscience.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hWiny78GhH3317M3Ai6ZuZq_CObwRq1SzHqPZOKYGcc","pdfSize":"2036617"}
