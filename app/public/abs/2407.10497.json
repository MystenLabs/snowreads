We obtain a necessary and sufficient\ncondition characterizing BTP manifolds in terms of Bismut curvature tensor\nalone (Theorem 1.1). We also present examples and discuss some general\nproperties for BTP manifolds, as well as give a classification result for\nnon-balanced BTP threefolds (Theorem 1.16).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VM0PlI3BvdX0tisUAyxT8fAiFsMvhJedFl6qHw5TPuE","pdfSize":"443427"}
