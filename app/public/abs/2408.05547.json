For $x\\in V(G)$, let $N(x)=\\{y\\in V(G)\\colon xy\\in\nE(G)\\}$. The minimum common degree of $G$, denoted by $\\delta_{2}(G)$, is\ndefined as the minimum of $|N(x)\\cap N(y)|$ over all non-edges $xy$ of $G$. In\n1982, H\\\"{a}ggkvist showed that every triangle-free graph with minimum degree\ngreater than $\\lfloor\\frac{3n}{8}\\rfloor$ is homomorphic to a cycle of length\n5. In this paper, we prove that every triangle-free graph with minimum common\ndegree greater than $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{8}\\rfloor$ is homomorphic to a cycle of\nlength 5, which implies H\\\"{a}ggkvist's result. The balanced blow-up of the\nM\\\"{o}bius ladder graph shows that it is best possible.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
