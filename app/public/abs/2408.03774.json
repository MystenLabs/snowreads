We give a lower bound on\nthe size of fundamental solutions for almost all $d$ in a certain class, based\non a recent conjecture of Browning and Wilsch about integer points on log K3\nsurfaces. We also obtain an upper bound on the average of class number in this\nclass, assuming the same conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"czXHFHcrCFHkZ5lg5h4TSeyfd3KZJuotd_q0RK7_30k","pdfSize":"200286"}
