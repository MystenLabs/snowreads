Human translators solve this problem with monolingual or\nbilingual dictionaries. In this paper, we propose appending definitions from a\nbilingual dictionary to source sentences and using attention masking to link\ntogether rare words with their definitions. We find that including definitions\nfor rare words improves performance by up to 1.0 BLEU and 1.6 MacroF1.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
