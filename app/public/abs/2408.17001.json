In the design\nof Congame, a platform for running such economic studies, we decided to use\ndelimited continuations to manage the common flow of participants through a\nstudy. Here we report on the positives of this approach, as well as some\nchallenges of using continuations, such as persisting data across requests,\nworking with dynamic variables, avoiding memory leaks, and the difficulty of\ndebugging continuations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
