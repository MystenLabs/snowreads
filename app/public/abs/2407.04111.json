Here we\ninvestigate the distribution of entanglement in quantum Drude oscillator\nassemblies, minimal models for dispersion bound systems. We analytically\ndetermine a relation between entanglement and energy, showing how the\nentanglement distribution governs dispersive bonding. This suggests that the\nmonogamy of entanglement explains deviations of multipartite dispersive binding\nenergies compared to the commonly used pairwise prediction. We illustrate our\nfindings using examples of a trimer and extended crystal lattices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
