The complexity of reasoning in such algebras -\nranging from the equational theory to the Horn one, with restricted fragments\nof the latter in between - was analyzed by Kozen (2002). This paper deals with\nsimilar problems for $\\ast$-continuous residuated Kleene lattices, also called\n$\\ast$-continuous action lattices, where the product operation is augmented by\nadding residuals. We prove that in the presence of residuals the fragment of\nthe corresponding Horn theory with $\\ast$-free hypotheses has the same\ncomplexity as the $\\omega^\\omega$ iteration of the halting problem, and hence\nis properly hyperarithmetical. We also prove that if only commutativity\nconditions are allowed as hypotheses, then the complexity drops down to\n$\\Pi^0_1$ (i.e. the complement of the halting problem), which is the same as\nthat for $\\ast$-continuous Kleene algebras. In fact, we get stronger upper\nbound results: the fragments under consideration are translated into suitable\nfragments of infinitary action logic with exponentiation, and the upper bounds\nare obtained for the latter ones.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
