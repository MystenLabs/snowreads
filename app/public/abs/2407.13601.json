Spikes and spines are prime examples\nfor such configurations. They pose a significant challenge for a desired\ncontinuum limit, for which the average lengths of edges ought to become very\nsmall. Here we investigate spike and spine configurations in four-dimensional\nLorentzian quantum Regge calculus. We find that the expectation values of\narbitrary powers of the bulk length are finite. To that end, we explore new\ntypes of asymptotic regimes for the Regge amplitudes, in which some of the\nedges are much larger than the remaining ones. The amplitudes simplify\nconsiderably in such asymptotic regimes and the geometric interpretation of the\nresulting expressions involves a dimensional reduction, which might have\napplications to holography.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
