It's hard to get an equivalent model from any\nmanufacturer of any Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) power electronics\nconverters because of intellectual property (IP) and safety concerns. Most COTS\nproducts don't reveal the exact topology of the converter as well as the\ncontrol architecture and corresponding control gains. Because of these reasons,\nit's very hard to implement an exact equivalent model of COTS converters.\nHierarchical control is widely used in microgrid applications, where different\ncontrol layers are decoupled on the timescale. This article gives a baseline\napproach to build an equivalent model of any droop controlled COTS converter to\nmimic its control performance. Bandwidths of the different control loops are\nestimated along with the control logic from experiments on COTS converter and\nthen hierarchical control is followed to come up with the equivalent model. The\napproach is verified on COTS CE+T Stabiliti 30C3 converter with its equivalent\nmodel build in MATLAB Simulink.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
