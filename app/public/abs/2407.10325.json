However, the\nadditional angular information also brings a large volume of data. Classical\ncoding methods are not effective to describe the relationship between different\nviews, leading to redundancy left. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nlight field compression scheme based on implicit neural representation to\nreduce redundancies between views. We store the information of a light field\nimage implicitly in an neural network and adopt model compression methods to\nfurther compress the implicit representation. Extensive experiments have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves\ncomparable rate-distortion performance as well as superior perceptual quality\nover traditional methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
