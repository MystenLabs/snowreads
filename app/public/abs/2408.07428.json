However, most modern parallel\nprogramming models lack schemes for the remote process to detect the completion\nof RMA operations. Many previous works have proposed programming models and\nextensions to notify the communication peer, but they did not solve the\nmulti-NIC aggregation, portability, hardware-software co-design, and usability\nproblems. In this work, we proposed a Unified Notifiable RMA (UNR) library for\nHPC to address these challenges. In addition, we demonstrate the best practice\nof utilizing UNR within a real-world scientific application, PowerLLEL. We\ndeployed UNR across four HPC systems, each with a different interconnect. The\nresults show that PowerLLEL powered by UNR achieves up to a 36% acceleration on\n1728 nodes of the Tianhe-Xingyi supercomputing system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
