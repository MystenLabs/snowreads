Conventional photon blockade(CPB) suffers\nfrom low single-photon purity and high requirements for system nonlinearity,\nwhile unconventional photon blockade(UPB) has the disadvantage of low\nbrightness. Recent research by [Laser Photon.Rev 14,1900279,2020] demonstrates\nthat UPB can be used to enhance the strength of CPB, thereby improving the\npurity of single-photon sources. Research by [Opt. Express 30(12),21787,2022]\nshows that there is an intersection point between CPB and UPB in certain\nnonlinear systems, where the performance of single photons is better. In this\nstudy, we investigated the phenomenon of photon blockade in a non-degenerate\nfour-wave mixing system, where CPB and UPB can occur simultaneously within the\nsame parameter range. We refer to this phenomenon as composite photon blockade.\nParticularly, when the system achieves composite photon blockade, the value of\ng(2)(0) is smaller, and there are more single photons. We conducted analytical\nanalysis and numerical calculations to study the conditions for the realization\nof CPB, UPB, and 2PB in the system, and discussed in detail the influence of\nsystem parameters on various blockade effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
