This changes the overall\npicture of the monopole production mechanism in the early universe drastically\nand has deep implications in cosmolpgy. In particular, this enhances the\npossibility that the electroweak monopoles turned to the primordial magnetic\nblackholes could become the seed of stellar objects and galaxies, and account\nfor the dark matter of the universe. Moreover, this tells that we have a new\ntype of primordial blackhole different from the popular primordial blackhole in\ncosmology, the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole based on a totally\ndifferent production mechanism. We discuss the physical implications of the\nelectroweak primordial magnetic blackhole.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
