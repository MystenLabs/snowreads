Given $n=m_1+m_2+\\ldots +m_t$ newlywed couples at a\nconference and $t$ round tables of sizes $2m_1,2m_2,\\ldots,2m_t$, is it\npossible to arrange the $2n$ participants at these tables for $2n-2$ meals so\nthat each participant sits next to their spouse at every meal, and sits next to\nevery other participant exactly once? A solution to\nHOP$(2m_1,2m_2,\\ldots,2m_t)$ is a decomposition of $K_{2n}+(2n-3)I$, the\ncomplete graph $K_{2n}$ with $2n-3$ additional copies of a fixed 1-factor $I$,\ninto 2-factors, each consisting of disjoint $I$-alternating cycles of lengths\n$2m_1,2m_2,\\ldots,2m_t$.\n  The Honeymoon Oberwolfach Problem was introduced in a 2019 paper by Lepine\nand \\v{S}ajna. The authors conjectured that HOP$(2m_1,2m_2,\\ldots,$ $2m_t)$ has\na solution whenever the obvious necessary conditions are satisfied, and proved\nthe conjecture for several large cases, including the uniform cycle length case\n$m_1=\\ldots=m_t$, and the small cases with $n \\le 9$. In the present paper, we\nextend the latter result to all cases with $n \\le 20$ using a computer search.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"PDUC9Y4kG2f-plkkqSIf0WJd_IqYFWBt_oJQAzP39z4","pdfSize":"533328"}
