This effect is strongest for low-mass galaxies and is\nconsistent with a rapid quenching of star formation. These results imply that\nmerger shocks in the intracluster medium play a role in driving environmental\nquenching, which we argue is due to the elevated ram pressure experienced by\nsatellite galaxies in these disturbed systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
