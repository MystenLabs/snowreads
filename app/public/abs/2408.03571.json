In this work, two-level Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioners\nare enhanced by coarse space constructed using higher-order B\\'ezier\ninterpolation. The numerical results indicate numerical scalability and\nrobustness with respect the wavenumber, as long as the wavenumber times the\nelement size of the coarse mesh is sufficiently low.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
