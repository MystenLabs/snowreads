We consider situations where\nthe original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a\nsignificant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates\nhaving tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our\nphonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the\ninteraction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie\njust below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where\nthe sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter\nbands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the\nlarge energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the\nabsence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nU9bpnefY3KqFWRWyFL4IzyfxV25tNQu6cYOQPhN5vI","pdfSize":"3660351"}
