It seems natural, then, to raise the\nbid: Are LLMs ready to compete in creative writing skills with a top (rather\nthan average) novelist? To provide an initial answer for this question, we have\ncarried out a contest between Patricio Pron (an awarded novelist, considered\none of the best of his generation) and GPT-4 (one of the top performing LLMs),\nin the spirit of AI-human duels such as DeepBlue vs Kasparov and AlphaGo vs Lee\nSidol. We asked Pron and GPT-4 to provide thirty titles each, and then to write\nshort stories for both their titles and their opponent's. Then, we prepared an\nevaluation rubric inspired by Boden's definition of creativity, and we\ncollected 5,400 manual assessments provided by literature critics and scholars.\nThe results of our experimentation indicate that LLMs are still far from\nchallenging a top human creative writer, and that reaching such level of\nautonomous creative writing skills probably cannot be reached simply with\nlarger language models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z2U9zipp68iJdSup2WJ5WsYanJ3xuOJc5sw7s-fjWdc","pdfSize":"485067"}
