We develop the initial list by analyzing 21 publicly\navailable videos featuring BLV individuals navigating various settings. Then,\nwe refine the list through feedback from a focus group study involving blind,\nlow-vision, and sighted companions of BLV individuals. A subsequent analysis\nreveals that most contemporary datasets used to train recent computer vision\nmodels contain only a small subset of the objects in our proposed list.\nFurthermore, we provide detailed object labeling for these 90 objects across 31\nvideo segments derived from the original 21 videos. Finally, we make the object\nlist, the 21 videos, and object labeling in the 31 video segments publicly\navailable. This paper aims to fill the existing gap and foster the development\nof more inclusive and effective navigation aids for the BLV community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
