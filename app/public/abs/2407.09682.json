It is shown that the partial\nbreaking of the vacuum degeneracy provides a mechanism for the appearance of\nstatic multi-kinks, whenever some false vacuum states appear between two true\nvacuum states. A multi-kink is a stable field configuration with an internal\nstructure, consisting of various localized energy packages with well-defined\nseparations between them. General results for multi-kinks properties are\npresented. We introduce the commensurable and non degenerate double sine-Gordon\nmodel as a specific realization of this mechanism, supporting the existence of\nmulti-kinks with an arbitrary $n$-number of subkinks. The multi-kinks\nproperties are thoroughly analyzed including the novel phenomenology displayed\nwhen two of them collide.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
