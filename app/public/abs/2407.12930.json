The axion\npotential is flattened at the origin, corresponding to the only minimum, while\nit is unsuppressed at $\\pi$. These potential features arise by assuming a\nmirror sector with the strong CP phase $\\bar\\theta$ shifted by $\\pi$ compared\nto the SM sector, which allows the mirror axion potential to be tuned against\nthe usual QCD axion potential. Before the QCD phase transition, assuming the\nmirror sector is decoupled and much colder than the SM thermal bath, the mirror\nsector potential dominates, causing the axion to initially roll to a temporary\nminimum at $\\pi$. However, after the QCD phase transition, the potential\nminimum changes, and the axion relaxes from the newly created \"hilltop\" near\n$\\pi$ to the CP-conserving minimum at the origin. As the axion adiabatically\ntracks this shift in the potential minimum through the QCD phase transition,\nwith non-adiabatic evolution near $\\pi$ and 0, it alters the usual prediction\nof the dark matter abundance. Consequently, this \"hilltop\" misalignment\nmechanism opens new regions of axion parameter space, with the correct relic\nabundance while still solving the strong CP problem, that could be explored in\nfuture experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
