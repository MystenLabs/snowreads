In\nheavy-ion collisions at highest energies provided by the LHC, light cluster\nabundances should follow the statistical model because of low baryon densities.\nChemical freeze-out in this domain is correlated with the QCD crossover\ntransition. At low energies, in the nuclear fragmentation region, where the\nfreeze-out interferes with the liquid-gas phase transition, self-energy and\nPauli blocking effects are important. We demonstrate that at intermediate\nenergies the chemical freeze-out line correlates with the maximum mass fraction\nof nuclear bound states, in particular $\\alpha$ particles. In this domain, the\nHADES, FAIR and NICA experiments can give new insights.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mbqcNNzMTBAf5QJhiHaaEjRSDGxc1UTOOwcRMCoSn7E","pdfSize":"483427"}
