Our approach is inspired by\nVariation Theory, a theory of human concept learning that emphasizes the\nessential features of a concept by focusing on what stays the same and what\nchanges. Instead of just querying with existing datapoints, our approach\nsynthesizes artificial datapoints that highlight potential key similarities and\ndifferences among labels using a neuro-symbolic pipeline combining large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and rule-based models. Through an experiment in the\nexample domain of text classification, we show that our approach achieves\nsignificantly higher performance when there are fewer annotated data. As the\nannotated training data gets larger the impact of the generated data starts to\ndiminish showing its capability to address the cold start problem in AL. This\nresearch sheds light on integrating theories of human learning into the\noptimization of AL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
