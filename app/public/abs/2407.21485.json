One of the\ncurrent advancements has been the introduction of Best-First Generalized\nPlanning (BFGP), a GP algorithm based on a novel solution space that can be\nexplored with heuristic search, one of the foundations of modern planners. This\npaper evaluates the application of parallel search techniques to BFGP, another\ncritical component in closing the performance gap. We first discuss why BFGP is\nwell suited for parallelization and some of its differentiating characteristics\nfrom classical planners. Then, we propose two simple shared-memory parallel\nstrategies with good scaling with the number of cores.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
