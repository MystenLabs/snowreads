All major screen readers support MathML to generate\nspeech, allow navigation of the math, and generate braille. A troublesome area\nremains: handling ambiguous notations such as \\( \\vert x\\vert\\). While it is\npossible to speak this syntactically, anecdotal evidence indicates most people\nprefer semantic speech such as ``absolute value of x'' or ``determinant of x''\ninstead of ``vertical bar x vertical bar'' when first hearing an expression.\nSeveral heuristics to infer semantics have improved speech, but ultimately, the\nauthor is the one who definitively knows how an expression is meant to be\nspoken. The W3C Math Working Group is in the process of allowing authors to\nconvey their intent in MathML markup via an intent attribute. This paper\ndescribes that work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
