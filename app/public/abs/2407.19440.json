Then, for a computably locally\ncompact group $G$, we show that the Chabauty space $\\mathcal S(G)$ of closed\nsubgroups of $G$ has a canonical effectively-closed (i.e., $\\Pi^0_1$)\npresentation as a subspace of the hyperspace $\\mathcal K(G^*)$ of closed sets\nof $G^*$. We construct a computable discrete abelian group $H$ such that\n$\\mathcal S(H)$ is not computably closed in $\\mathcal K(H^*)$; in fact, the\nonly computable points of $\\mathcal S(H)$ are the trivial group and $H$ itself,\nwhile $\\mathcal S(H)$ is uncountable. In the case that a computably locally\ncompact group $G$ is also totally disconnected, we provide a further\nalgorithmic characterization of $\\mathcal S(G)$ in terms of the countable meet\ngroupoid of $G$ introduced recently by the authors (arXiv: 2204.09878). We\napply our results and techniques to show that the index set of the computable\nlocally compact abelian groups that contain a closed subgroup isomorphic to\n$(\\mathbb{R},+)$ is arithmetical.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MOGL04A-CUx0F1LeD-KrsqjVyCpD5xgADN4UQGvCpqc","pdfSize":"368056"}
