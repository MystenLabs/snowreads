Recent research has shown that the\nUAV-to-UAV (U2U) cooperative perception system has great potential to\nrevolutionize the autonomous flight industry. However, the lack of a\nlarge-scale dataset is hindering progress in this area. This paper presents\nU2UData, the first large-scale cooperative perception dataset for swarm UAVs\nautonomous flight. The dataset was collected by three UAVs flying autonomously\nin the U2USim, covering a 9 km$^2$ flight area. It comprises 315K LiDAR frames,\n945K RGB and depth frames, and 2.41M annotated 3D bounding boxes for 3 classes.\nIt also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values\ncovering all flight routes. U2USim is the first real-world mapping swarm UAVs\nsimulation environment. It takes Yunnan Province as the prototype and includes\n4 terrains, 7 weather conditions, and 8 sensor types. U2UData introduces two\nperception tasks: cooperative 3D object detection and cooperative 3D object\ntracking. This paper provides comprehensive benchmarks of recent cooperative\nperception algorithms on these tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
