We first discuss Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black\nholes with electric and magnetic charge and present new results demonstrating\nthe existence of a second branch of solutions. Moreover, we find that the\npresence of the magnetic charge allows for smaller mass and Noether charge when\nthe clouds are close to their minimal possible mean radius. Replacing standard\nelectrodynamics by Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics, the background model\npossesses globally regular, star-like as well as black hole solutions. We show\nthat the former can be scalarized as well and that the scalar clouds become\nmore compact when decreasing the electric charge of the BI star. Finally, we\ndiscuss a magnetic dipole field in the background of the scalarized BI star and\nshow that the strong gravitational field of this star leads to a significant\nchange.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qfllhhszFqIIs4F1TjwhpNWSxXmBXJ6b6KHCY73wCBM","pdfSize":"496002","objectId":"0x281cd3af7a8c229588828adf5d65344d06239d3ae232077d7d71760b9b709f5d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
