Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De Gennes approach, we systematically\nanalyze the local density states, whose subgap energy dependence enables us to\ndistinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes and identify the\nmagnetic nature of the impurity. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial\ndependence of the local density of states is a sensitive probe of the\nmicroscopic processes resulting in subgap impurity-induced bound states. The\nFourier analysis evidences the wavevectors related to the momenta of the high\ntransmissive channels in ballistic graphene.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
