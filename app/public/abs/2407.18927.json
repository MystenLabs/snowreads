This paper presents an audio spectrogram-guided\nclassification framework called ASGIR for improved bird sound recognition and\ninformation retrieval. Our work is accompanied by a simple-to-use, two-step\ninformation retrieval system that uses geographical location and bird sounds to\nlocalize and retrieve relevant bird information by scraping Wikipedia page\ninformation of recognized birds. ASGIR offers a substantial performance on a\nrandom subset of 51 classes of Xeno-Canto dataset Bird sounds from European\ncountries with a median of 100\\% performance on F1, Precision and Sensitivity\nmetrics.
