However, LLMs still struggle to generate natural and colloquial\nresponses in real-world applications such as chatbots and psychological\ncounseling that require more human-like interactions. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce NICO, a Natural Interactive COnversation dataset in\nChinese. We first use GPT-4-turbo to generate dialogue drafts and make them\ncover 20 daily-life topics and 5 types of social interactions. Then, we hire\nworkers to revise these dialogues to ensure that they are free of grammatical\nerrors and unnatural utterances. We define two dialogue-level natural\nconversation tasks and two sentence-level tasks for identifying and rewriting\nunnatural sentences. Multiple open-source and closed-source LLMs are tested and\nanalyzed in detail. The experimental results highlight the challenge of the\ntasks and demonstrate how NICO can help foster the natural dialogue\ncapabilities of LLMs. The dataset will be released.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
