We construct conditional logic\nsystem {\\L}CR based on {\\L}ukasiewicz m-valued propositional logic. We\nconstruct world semantics for the system by generalizing conditional and\naccessibility relation from classical bivalent to m-valued, and prove its\nsoundness, completeness and finite model property. Conditionals of {\\L}CR\ncannot be generalized directly to variable strict conditionals, but they are\nstricter than classical conditionals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ABg5ageAEZsMKm215t09SpZd71EgOJwmC1PDqLeqFBc","pdfSize":"427179"}
