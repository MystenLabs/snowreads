As\nmotivation, we first demonstrate our approach for the Rindler geometry in flat\nspace before then applying it for the case of Schwarzschild time in the\nmaximally extended Kruskal geometry. One notable advantage of our approach is\nthat it can be utilized in the Kerr case, again without reference to a\nEuclidean manifold, and without complexifying the angular momentum parameter,\n$a$. One unusual feature of our application in the Kerr case is that, even for\nthe purely Lorentzian geometry, it is developed in terms of explicitly complex\ncoordinates which are associated with distinct families of $\\alpha-$surfaces.\nMoreover, coordinatization of these gives a single set of coordinates which\ncover the entire geometry outside the inner horizon.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aoWgHUuVjx7e-qcLnXc0mU9d4Ac7f0E8GhOZOmcbARE","pdfSize":"273054"}
