In undirected graphs, constant-round\nalgorithms are known for cycles of even length. Our algorithm greatly improves\nupon the state of the art for odd values of $h$. Moreover, our running time\napplies also to directed graphs, in which case the improvement is for all\nvalues of $h$. Further, our techniques allow us to obtain a triangle detection\nalgorithm in the quantum variant of this model, which is faster than prior\nwork.\n  A key technical contribution we develop to obtain our fast cycle detection\nalgorithm is a new algorithm for computing the product of many pairs of small\nmatrices in parallel, which may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MLT6n0L3V8-b0mGNB1m9WQn9GcS9ic4c2Dhc1_19waU","pdfSize":"785444"}
