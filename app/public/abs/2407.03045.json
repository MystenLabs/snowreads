Jailbreak prompts, a popular type of\nadversarial attack towards LLMs, have appeared and constantly evolved to breach\nthe safety protocols of LLMs. To address this issue, LLMs are regularly updated\nwith safety patches based on reported jailbreak prompts. However, malicious\nusers often keep their successful jailbreak prompts private to exploit LLMs. To\nuncover these private jailbreak prompts, extensive analysis of large-scale\nconversational datasets is necessary to identify prompts that still manage to\nbypass the system's defenses. This task is highly challenging due to the\nimmense volume of conversation data, diverse characteristics of jailbreak\nprompts, and their presence in complex multi-turn conversations. To tackle\nthese challenges, we introduce JailbreakHunter, a visual analytics approach for\nidentifying jailbreak prompts in large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets.\nWe have designed a workflow with three analysis levels: group-level,\nconversation-level, and turn-level. Group-level analysis enables users to grasp\nthe distribution of conversations and identify suspicious conversations using\nmultiple criteria, such as similarity with reported jailbreak prompts in\nprevious research and attack success rates. Conversation-level analysis\nfacilitates the understanding of the progress of conversations and helps\ndiscover jailbreak prompts within their conversation contexts. Turn-level\nanalysis allows users to explore the semantic similarity and token overlap\nbetween a singleturn prompt and the reported jailbreak prompts, aiding in the\nidentification of new jailbreak strategies. The effectiveness and usability of\nthe system were verified through multiple case studies and expert interviews.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
