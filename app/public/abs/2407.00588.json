For the forward problem, we establish the well-posedness of\nthe system, leveraging the eigensystem of the corresponding elliptic system as\nthe foundation. When considering the backward problem, specifically the\ndetermination of initial values through final time observations, we demonstrate\na Lipschitz stability estimate, which is consist with the stability observed in\nthe case of a single equation. To numerically address this backward problem, we\nrefer to the explicit formulation of Tikhonov regularization to devise a\nmulti-channel neural network architecture. This innovative architecture offers\na versatile approach, exhibiting its efficacy in multidimensional settings\nthrough numerical examples and its robustness in handling initial values that\nhave not been trained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
