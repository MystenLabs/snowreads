This is a crucial step in\nresolving Hilbert's sixth problem, and also extends Lanford's landmark theorem\n(1975) which justifies such derivation for sufficiently short time.\n  The general strategy follows the paradigm introduced by the first two authors\nfor the long-time derivation of the wave kinetic equation in wave turbulence\ntheory. This is based on proving a long-time cumulant ansatz, which keeps\nmemory of the full collision history of the particle system. At the heart of\nthe matter is a reduction to combinatorial estimates for the Feynman diagrams\n(referred to as Collision History (CH) molecules), which are then proved by\ndevising an elaborate cutting algorithm, a major novelty of this work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
