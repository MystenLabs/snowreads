In medical imaging, these models contribute to the advancement\nof medical diagnoses due to the difficulty in obtaining labeled data. However,\nit is unclear whether using a large amount of unlabeled data, biased by the\npresence of sensitive attributes during pre-training, influences the fairness\nof the model. This research examines the bias in the Foundation model\n(RetFound) when it is applied to fine-tune the Brazilian Multilabel\nOphthalmological Dataset (BRSET), which has a different population than the\npre-training dataset. The model evaluation, in comparison with supervised\nlearning, shows that the Foundation Model has the potential to reduce the gap\nbetween the maximum AUC and minimum AUC evaluations across gender and age\ngroups. However, in a data-efficient generalization, the model increases the\nbias when the data amount decreases. These findings suggest that when deploying\na Foundation Model in real-life scenarios with limited data, the possibility of\nfairness issues should be considered.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
