We now extend the\ntheory to fractional charges. Based on the exact properties of degeneracy and\nsize consistency, we show that the exact energy functional for fractional\ncharges, expressed as a linear combination of the $\\gamma_{s}$ of an\n$N-$electron and that of an $\\left(N+1\\right)-$electron excited state, is a\nstraight line interpolating the energies at integers. We introduce the concepts\nof excited-state chemical potentials to describe the slopes of these linear\nlines. Numerical calculations reveal the excited-state delocalization error\nwith common approximate functionals but good performance of corrected\nfunctionals on the proven linear conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
