Here, we\ngive a pedagogical review to frequentist parameter inference in cosmology with\nparticular focus on when the graphical profile likelihood construction gives\nmeaningful constraints, i.e.\\ confidence intervals with correct coverage. This\nconstruction rests on the assumption of the asymptotic limit of a large data\nset such as in \\textit{Wilks' theorem}. We assess the validity of this\nassumption in the context of three cosmological models with \\textit{Planck}\n2018 \\texttt{Plik\\_lite} data: While our tests for the $\\Lambda$CDM model\nindicate that the profile likelihood method gives correct coverage,\n$\\Lambda$CDM with the sum of neutrino masses as a free parameter appears\nconsistent with a Gaussian near a boundary motivating the use of the\nboundary-corrected or Feldman-Cousins graphical method; for $w_0$CDM with the\nequation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, as a free parameter, we find\nindication of a violation of the assumptions. Finally, we compare frequentist\nand Bayesian constraints of these models. Our results motivate care when using\nthe graphical profile likelihood method in cosmology.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
