These supercurvatures are the building blocks\nof various linearized $4D, \\, \\mathcal{N}=2$ Einstein supergravity invariants.\nThe supercurvatures involving the scalar and Ricci curvatures are analytic\nharmonic ${\\cal N}=2$ superfields, while the Weyl supertensor is a chiral\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield. As the basic distinguished feature of our\nconstruction, all these objects are expressed through the fundamental analytic\ngauge prepotentials $h^{++M}, M= (\\alpha\\dot\\alpha, +\\alpha, +\\dot\\alpha, 5)$.\nThe related characteristic features are the heavy use of harmonic derivatives\nand harmonic zero-curvature equations. On a number of instructive examples, we\ndescribe the component reduction of the superfield invariants constructed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
