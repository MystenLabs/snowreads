To address this\nissue, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has emerged as a promising\ntechnique for conserving energy while maintaining the quality of service (QoS)\nof GPU applications. However, existing solutions using DVFS are hindered by\ninefficiency or inaccuracy as they depend either on dynamic or static\ninformation respectively, which prevents them from being adopted to practical\npower management schemes. To this end, we propose a novel energy efficiency\noptimizer, called DSO, to explore a light weight solution that leverages both\ndynamic and static information to model and optimize the GPU energy efficiency.\nDSO firstly proposes a novel theoretical energy efficiency model which reflects\nthe DVFS roofline phenomenon and considers the tradeoff between performance and\nenergy. Then it applies machine learning techniques to predict the parameters\nof the above model with both GPU kernel runtime metrics and static code\nfeatures. Experiments on modern DVFS-enabled GPUs indicate that DSO can enhance\nenergy efficiency by 19% whilst maintaining performance within a 5% loss\nmargin.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
