The spatial component of the\ndensity of states for these special polarons is determined by the length scale\nof spatial modulation of electronegativity caused by a separate set of\nstandalone topological defects. The latter length scale is fixed by the\ncooperativity size for structural relaxation; the size is largely independent\nof temperature in the glass but above melting, it decreases with temperature.\nThus we predict that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity\nshould exhibit a jump in the slope near the glass transition; the size of the\njump is predicted to increase with the fragility of the melt. The predicted\nvalues of the jump and of the conductivity itself are consistent with\nexperiment.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
