We include both the deSitter and anti-deSitter\ncases. We find that the quantization puts a Planckian upper limit on the\npossible values of a positive cosmological constant similar to the bounds\nobtained earlier from studies of homogeneous spacetimes with a cosmological\nconstant. Using semiclassical physical states, we obtain the effective metric\nand demonstrate the causal structure for various cases. Quantum gravity\nmodifications ensure that the singularity is replaced by a transition surface\nin all the cases, where the curvature invariants approach mass-independent\nPlanckian bounds. Analysis of the effective stress-energy tensor shows that the\nnull energy condition is violated in the vicinity of the transition surface.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
