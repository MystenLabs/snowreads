In this work,\nwe propose a theoretical framework to characterize time-reversal invariant\ntopological superconductors hosting Majorana Kramers pairs (MKP) of corner\nstates by using a series of spin Bott indices, which capture both bulk and\nboundary states topology. The developed invariants can characterize MKP in\narbitrarily shaped systems and all distinct spatial distribution patterns of\nMKP. As an illustrative example, we apply our theory to analyze the Kane-Mele\nmodel with sublattice-dependent superconducting pairing potentials. In this\nrepresentative model, various patterns of MKP can be engineered through edge\ncleavage, and despite their high sensitivity to boundary terminations, MKP can\nbe faithfully characterized by the proposed topological invariants.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
