These techniques use a\nsharp metallic tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) to enhance incoming and\nscattered light by excited near-fields at the tip apex leading to high\nsensitivity and a spatial resolution of a few nanometers. However, this\nrestricts the near-field orientation to out-of-plane polarization, limiting\noptical polarization choices. We introduce double tips that offer in-plane\npolarization for enhanced imaging and spectroscopy. These double tips provide\nsuperior enhancement over single tips, although with a slightly lower spatial\nresolution (~30nm). They enable advanced studies of nanotubes, graphene\ndefects, and transition metal dichalcogenides, benefiting from polarization\ncontrol. The double tips allow varied polarization in tip-enhanced Raman\nscattering and selective excitation of transverse-electric and -magnetic\npolaritons, expanding the range of nanoscale samples that can be studied.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
