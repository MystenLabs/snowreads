We show\nthat this class of molecules (AuX, X = C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) features\nlaser-accessible electronic transitions with nearly diagonal Franck-Condon\nfactors. The $^2\\Pi_{1/2}$ ground states can be easily polarized in the\nlaboratory frame and have near-zero magnetic moments, valuable features for\nquantum science and precision measurement applications. The sensitivities of\nAuX molecules to the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) are found to be\nfavorable, with effective electric fields of 10-30 GV/cm. Together, these\nfeatures imply that AuX molecules may enable significantly improved searches\nfor time-reversal symmetry violation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
