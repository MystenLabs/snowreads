Our results indicate that the\nLHC data prefers even stronger saturation effects at the highest collision\nenergies. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the linear polarization of photons in\nulra peripheral collisions generates azimuthal modulations in the decay\nproducts of the exclusively produced vector meson. We show how these\nmeasurements can probe details of the nuclear geometry, specifically the\ndeformed structure of the uranium nuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
