However, how\ncommunication on the single cell-level impacts the collective structural,\ndynamical and mechanical behavior of active soft matter is not well understood.\nHere, we report how communication controls the spatiotemporal structure and\nphase behavior of active, hydrogel-based colloidal liquids using Brownian\nparticle-based simulations with explicit resolution of the chemical signaling\nwaves as well as the individual particle's elastic response to communication\nand crowding. We find a rich topology of nonequilibrium active phases, vastly\ntuneable by the signaling magnitude, in particular, active melting,\nsynchronization transitions from uncorrelated to antiphase oscillatory liquids,\nor to in-phase oscillations with accompanying elasto-chemical cluster waves.\nOur work employs minimal physical principles required for\ncommunication-mediated dynamics of microscopic, fluctuating systems, thus\nuncovering universal aspects in signaling soft systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ulMiHcrdHw3dhr-KbXG3d4HPjk8moGFSMbFtRYXSF1Q","pdfSize":"1276380"}
