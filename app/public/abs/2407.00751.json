The study emphasises that this specific form of\ngreenwashing is not currently considered in existing ESG assessments,\npotentially leading to an inflated perception of corporate ethical practices.\nUnlike traditional greenwashing, crosswashing involves companies strategically\ninvesting in sustainable activities to boost Environmental, Social, and\nGovernance (ESG) scores while preserving nonsustainable core operations. By\nunveiling the nuances of crosswashing, the research contributes to a more\nnuanced understanding of sustainable investing, offering insights for improved\nevaluation and regulation of corporate environmental and ethical\nresponsibilities.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
