Their photochemical reactions induced by solar radiation have recently\nbeen discovered as an abiotic source of volatile organic compounds, which serve\nas precursors of secondary organic aerosols. However, photoabsorption of\nwavelengths longer than 250 nm in liquid saturated fatty acids remains\nunexplained, despite being first reported in 1931. Here we demonstrate that the\npreviously reported absorption of wavelengths longer than 250 nm by liquid\nnonanoic acid [CH3(CH2)7COOH)] originates from traces of impurities (0.1% at\nmost) intrinsically contained in nonanoic acid reagents. Absorption cross\nsections of nonanoic acid newly obtained here indicate that the upper limit of\nits photolysis rate is three-to-five orders of magnitude smaller than those for\natmospherically relevant carbonyl compounds.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AQcScNvWAR8Kffi65Nftrh-ekCz_ZD38JoG4FNr6EUY","pdfSize":"866945"}
