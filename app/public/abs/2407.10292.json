It aims to enhance real-time\nmonitoring, decision-making, and resource management through the Service-based\nHierarchical Framework for Cybertwins in sixth-generation networks. The paper\naddresses the deployment challenges and proposes system theory as a\ncomprehensive framework for designing complex interactions among\nhealthcare-assigned Cybertwins. The article highlights the role of Cybertwin\ntechnology in advancing healthcare solutions, promising improved patient care\nand operational efficiency. It examines the current network setups and the\npotential of 6G infrastructure, discussing network topology optimization,\ntheoretical modelling, and future directions. The paper underlines the\ntransformative impact of combining 6G and Cybertwin technologies on healthcare,\nfrom high-definition telemedicine to large-scale patient monitoring. The paper\nfurther acknowledges the implementation challenges, such as technical\ncomplexity, security, and interoperability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
