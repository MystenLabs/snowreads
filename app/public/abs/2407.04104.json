Current statistical analysis on biological\nmodules predominantly focuses on either detecting the functional modules in\nbiological networks or sub-group regression on the biological features without\nusing the network data. This paper proposes a novel network-based neighborhood\nregression framework whose regression functions depend on both the global\ncommunity-level information and local connectivity structures among entities.\nAn efficient community-wise least square optimization approach is developed to\nuncover the strength of regulation among the network modules while enabling\nasymptotic inference. With random graph theory, we derive non-asymptotic\nestimation error bounds for the proposed estimator, achieving exact minimax\noptimality. Unlike the root-n consistency typical in canonical linear\nregression, our model exhibits linear consistency in the number of nodes n,\nhighlighting the advantage of incorporating neighborhood information. The\neffectiveness of the proposed framework is further supported by extensive\nnumerical experiments. Application to whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing\nAutism datasets demonstrates the usage of the proposed method in identifying\nthe association between the gene modules of genetic variations and the gene\nmodules of genomic differential expressions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
