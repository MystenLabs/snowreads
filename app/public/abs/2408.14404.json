This study introduces the NeuralPlasmaODE, a\nmulti-region multi-timescale transport model to simulate the complex energy\ntransfer processes in ITER deuterium-tritium (D-T) plasmas. Our model captures\nthe interactions between energetic alpha particles, electrons, and ions, which\nare vital for understanding phenomena such as thermal runaway instability. We\nemploy neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) for the numerical\nderivation of diffusivity parameters, enabling precise modeling of energy\ninteractions between different plasma regions. By leveraging transfer learning,\nwe utilize model parameters derived from DIII-D experimental data, enhancing\nthe efficiency and accuracy of our simulations without training from scratch.\nApplying this model to ITER's inductive and non-inductive operational\nscenarios, our results demonstrate that radiation and transport processes\neffectively remove excess heat from the core plasma, preventing thermal runaway\ninstability. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in\nadvancing our understanding and control of burning plasma dynamics in fusion\nreactors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
