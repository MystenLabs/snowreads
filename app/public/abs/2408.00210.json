Currently, little existing literature offers a solution to this problem.\nIn response, we propose a prior embedding-driven architecture for long distance\nblind iris recognition. We first proposed a blind iris image restoration\nnetwork called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind\niris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a\nPrior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more\nefficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the\nbottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality\nblind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image\nundergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public\nCASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly\nsuperior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both\nquantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for\nlong-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods,\nrepresenting an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to\nimages without restoration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
