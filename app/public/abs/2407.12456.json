One of the\nmost extreme cases is HD 80606b -- a hot Jupiter orbiting a sun-like star with\nan eccentricity of $0.93$ -- which experiences an increase in incident flux of\nnearly three orders of magnitude as the star-planet separation decreases from\n$0.88\\,{\\rm au}$ at apoastron to $0.03\\,{\\rm au}$ at periastron. We observed\nthe planet's periastron passage using \\emph{JWST}'s NIRSpec/G395H instrument\n($2.8-5.2\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$) during a $21\\,{\\rm hr}$ window centered on the\neclipse. We find that, as the planet passes through periastron, its emission\nspectrum transitions from a featureless blackbody to one in which CO and CH$_4$\nabsorption features are visible. We obtain significant detections of CH$_4$\nduring post-periapse phases at $3.7-4.8\\sigma$ depending on the phase.\nFollowing periapse, CO and H$_2$O are also detected at $3.4\\sigma$ and\n$3.1\\sigma$, respectively. Furthermore, we rule out the presence of a strong\ntemperature inversion near the IR photosphere -- predicted by GCMs to form\ntemporarily during periapse passage -- based on the lack of obvious emission\nfeatures throughout the observing window. Our study demonstrates the\nfeasibility of studying hot Jupiter atmospheres using partial phase curves\nobtained with NIRSpec/G395H.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
