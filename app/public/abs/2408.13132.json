Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry\nof S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by\nthe fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified\ncrossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying\nintegrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed\nregions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua\ntransform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a\nconnection to a dual category $\\mathscr C^{*}_{\\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry\nTopological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the\nanalysis of scattering amplitudes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
