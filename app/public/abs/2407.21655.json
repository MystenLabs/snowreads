Taking into account its non-asymptotically flat\ncharacter, we use the inferred size of the central brightness depression of the\nsupermassive object at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy (Sgr A*) by the Event\nHorizon Telescope to constrain at $2\\sigma$ the CG parameter as $\\gamma M\n\\approx 3.5 \\times 10^{-12}$. We study the potential observational consequences\nfrom the smallness of such a value using exact and numerical expressions for\nthe deflection angle, optical images from optically and geometrically thin\naccretion disks, isoradials, and instability scales (Lyapunov index) of nearly\nbound geodesics associated to photon rings. Our results point towards the\nimpossibility to distinguish between these two geometries using current and\nforeseeable techniques in the field of interferometric detection of optical\nsources.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
