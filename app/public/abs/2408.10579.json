Photoreforming\nis emerging as a clean photocatalytic technology that degrades plastic waste to\norganic compounds while simultaneously producing hydrogen fuel. This study\nintroduces high-pressure torsion (HPT), a severe plastic deformation (SPD)\nmethod, as an innovative technique to enhance the photoreforming of\npolypropylene (PP) plastic mixed with a brookite TiO2 photocatalyst. Hydrogen\nproduction systematically increases with the number of HPT turns, accompanied\nby the formation of valuable small organic molecules. The enhancement in\nphotocatalytic activity is attributed to strain-induced defect formation in\nboth catalysts and plastics, as well as the creation of catalyst/plastic\ninterphases that enhance charge carrier transport between inorganic and organic\nphases. These findings reveal a new functional application for SPD in energy\nconversion and sustainability.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
