However, multi-photon\nentanglement in the transmission window of green light under the water has not\nbeen reported yet. Here, by combining femtosecond laser based multi-photon\nentanglement and entanglement-maintaining frequency upconversion techniques, we\nsuccessfully generate a green two-photon polarization-entangled Bell state and\na green three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, whose state\nfidelities are 0.893$\\mathbf{\\pm}$0.002 and 0.595$\\mathbf{\\pm}$0.023,\nrespectively. Our result provides a scalable method to prepare green\nmulti-photon entanglement, which may have wide applications in underwater\nquantum information.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9jGP6Z3L8tcode871M7vkDBrKykmOJacIjUX94T0ecA","pdfSize":"1213368"}
