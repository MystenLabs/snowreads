The investigation of these exceptional constituents has led to\nfruitful applications. The responsivity of the eigenvalue diverges at EPs, and\nchiral state transfer occurs when encircling an EP. Traditionally, it was\nbelieved that these exceptional features were unique to non-Hermitian systems\nrequiring gain, loss, or nonreciprocal hopping. Here, we show that these\nexceptional features are also present in nonlinear Hermitian systems. We\nconsider two coupled resonators with Kerr nonlinearity in one resonator, and no\nnon-Hermitian terms. We identify EP-like points (ELPs) on the eigenspectra\nwhere the critical behaviors are the same as those of typical EPs.\nAdditionally, this nonlinear Hermitian system can be mapped to linear\nnon-Hermitian systems, with ELPs corresponding to EPs. We also demonstrate that\nencirclement around an ELP in the parameter space leads to unique chiral state\ntransfer behavior.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
