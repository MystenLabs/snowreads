We present determinant representations for the space-, time-, and\ntemperature-dependent correlation functions of the strongly interacting\none-dimensional Hubbard model in the presence of an external trapping\npotential. These representations are exact and valid in both equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium scenarios like the ones initiated by a sudden change of the\nconfinement potential. In addition, they can be implemented numerically very\neasily significantly outperforming other numerical approaches. As applications\nof our results we investigate the single particle spectral functions of systems\nwith harmonic trapping and show that dynamical quasicondensation occurs for\nboth fermionic and bosonic spin-$1/2$ systems released from a Mott insulator\nstate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
