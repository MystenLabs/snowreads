The spin space can be\nan arbitrary, possibly unbounded subset of the real axis with a suitable\na-priori measure. For general unbounded spins, our method works at high-enough\ntemperature, but for bounded spins our results hold for every temperature. Our\nproof relies on the control of the integrated characteristic function, which is\nachieved by dividing the integration into three different regions, following a\nstandard approach proposed forty years ago by Campanino, Del Grosso and\nTirozzi. The bounds required in the different regions are obtained through\ncluster-expansion techniques. For bounded spins, the arbitrariness of the\ntemperature is achieved through a decimation (\"dilution\") technique, also\nintroduced in the later reference.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
