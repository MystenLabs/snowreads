They present a theory (developed by NC, NR and collaborators) of\nlinear neural networks -- a fundamental model in the study of optimization and\ngeneralization in deep learning. Practical applications born from the presented\ntheory are also discussed. The theory is based on mathematical tools that are\ndynamical in nature. It showcases the potential of such tools to push the\nenvelope of our understanding of optimization and generalization in deep\nlearning. The text assumes familiarity with the basics of statistical learning\ntheory. Exercises (without solutions) are included.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
