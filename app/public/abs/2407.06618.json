We show that, in addition to\nsuch approaches, it can also emerge from local F-Theory bottom-up\nconstructions. As a first example of the new approach, we have analysed in\ndetail a concrete F-Theory Fluxed $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) with\nmodular $S_4$ family symmetry. The model fits the fermion mass and mixing data\nvery well and serves as a demonstration of the bottom-up approach to modular\nfamily symmetry in F-Theory fluxed GUTs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
