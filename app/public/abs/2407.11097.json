With the introduction of the finite\namplitude method (FAM), large-scale calculations of the nuclear linear response\nin heavy deformed nuclei have become possible. This work provides a detailed\nstudy of multipole responses in actinide nuclei with Skyrme energy density\nfunctionals. We quantify both systematic and statistical uncertainties induced\nby the functional parameterization in FAM calculations. We also extend the FAM\nformalism to perform blocking calculations with the equal filling approximation\nfor odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei, and analyze the impact of blocking\nconfigurations on the response. By examining the entire plutonium isotopic\nchain from the proton to the neutron dripline, we find a large variability of\nthe response with the neutron number and study how it correlates with the\ndeformation of the nuclear ground state.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
