In the case of the\nWess-Zumino model with a single chiral superfield, I also obtain the effective\nauxiliary field potential at three-loop order, extending previous results at\none-loop order. The method used is inferential, relying on existing knowledge\nof the ordinary scalar effective potential.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
