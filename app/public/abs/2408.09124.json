While bounds obtained using the\nstandard argument typically are of the form $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-\\alpha})$\nfor some positive $\\alpha$, the refined results are of the form\n$o(\\epsilon^{-\\alpha})$. We then explore to which known algorithms our refined\nbounds are applicable and finally describe an example showing how close the\nstandard and refined bounds can be.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
