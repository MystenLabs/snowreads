A game\nproceeds by solving words, which are segments of sites in a two-dimensional\nlattice. As test case, the \\emph{iid} variant allows for independently\noccupying sites with letters, only the percolation criterion depends on the\nexistence of solved words. For the \\emph{game} variant, inspired by real\ncrossword puzzles, it becomes more likely to solve crossing words which share\nsites with the already solved words. In this way avalanches of solved words may\noccur. Both model variants exhibit a percolation transition as function of the\na-priori site or word solving probability, respectively. The \\emph{iid} variant\nis in the universality class of standard two-dimensional percolation. The\n\\emph{game} variant exhibits a non-universal critical exponent $\\nu$ of the\ncorrelation length. The actual value of $\\nu$ depends on the function which\ncontrols how much solved words accelerate the solved of crossing words.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
