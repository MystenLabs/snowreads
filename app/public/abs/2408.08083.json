Recent studies have shown that LLMs can surpass humans in certain\ntasks, such as predicting the outcomes of neuroscience studies. What role does\nthis leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that\nhumans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed\nwith them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when\nteam members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which\ntasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We\nsimplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a\nlogistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for\nany number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated\nin a neuroscience forecasting task that, even when humans were inferior to\nLLMs, their combination with one or more LLMs consistently improved team\nperformance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for\nintegrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive\ncollaborations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xp4UdVA1EPZdtKKa7y_PG3XnE7LHs8ZKLUbafxhZXOw","pdfSize":"1042555"}
