In this paper we study distributions and quantiles of\nindividual treatment effects to provide a more comprehensive and robust\nunderstanding of treatment effects beyond usual averages, despite they are more\nchallenging to infer due to nonidentifiability from observed data. Recent\nrandomization-based approaches offer finite-sample valid inference for\ntreatment effect distributions and quantiles in both completely randomized and\nstratified randomized experiments, but can be overly conservative by assuming\nthe worst-case scenario where units with large effects are all assigned to the\ntreated (or control) group. We introduce two improved methods to enhance the\npower of these existing approaches. The first method reinterprets existing\napproaches as inferring treatment effects among only treated or control units,\nand then combines the inference for treated and control units to infer\ntreatment effects for all units. The second method explicitly controls for the\nactual number of treated units with large effects. Both simulation and\napplications demonstrate the substantial gain from the improved methods. These\nmethods are further extended to sampling-based experiments as well as\nquasi-experiments from matching, in which the ideas for both improved methods\nplay critical and complementary roles.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
