Originally introduced by Angluin et. al. in 2004 with a constant\nnumber of states, research nowadays focuses on protocols where the space usage\ndepends on the number of agents. The expressive power of population protocols\nhas so far however only been determined for protocols using $o(\\log n)$ states,\nwhich compute only semilinear predicates, and for $\\Omega(n)$ states. This\nleaves a significant gap, particularly concerning protocols with $\\Theta(\\log\nn)$ or $\\Theta(\\operatorname{polylog} n)$ states, which are the most common\nconstructions in the literature. In this paper we close the gap and prove that\nfor any $\\varepsilon>0$ and $f\\in\\Omega(\\log\nn)\\cap\\mathcal{O}(n^{1-\\varepsilon})$, both uniform and non-uniform population\nprotocols with $\\Theta(f(n))$ states can decide exactly $\\mathsf{NSPACE}(f(n)\n\\log n)$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
