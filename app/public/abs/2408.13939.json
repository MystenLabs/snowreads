We investigate the output consensus of the network where the\ndynamics are subject to external disturbance and/or reference input. For a\nnetwork of output-feedback passive subsystems, we first introduce an index that\ncharacterises the gap between a pair of adjacent subsystems by the difference\nof their input-output trajectories. The set of these indices quantifies the\nlevel of heterogeneity of the networks. We then provide a condition in terms of\nthe level of heterogeneity and the connectivity of the networks for ensuring\nthe output consensus of the interconnected network.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
