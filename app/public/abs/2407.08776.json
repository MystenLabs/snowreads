First\napproach which was recently proposed by the authors relies on the computations\nof superconformal indices of class $\\mathcal{S}$ $4d$ ${\\mathcal N}=2$ theories\nwith the insertion of surface defects. Second approach uses computations of\nNekrasov-Shatashvili limit of $5d$ ${\\mathcal N} = 1^*$ instanton partition\nfunctions in the presence of co-dimension two defect. We compare results of\nthese two approaches for the low-lying levels of Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.\nWe also discuss different previously proposed exact quantization conditions for\nthe Coulomb branch parameters of the instanton partition functions and their\ninterpretations in terms of index calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
