The matrix fill\nperformance of the CBIE proves to be fast for small to moderately sized\nproblems compared to its counterparts, e.g. the locally corrected Nystr\\\"om\n(LCN) method, due to the way it handles the singularities by means of a global\nchange of variable method. However, in the case of electrically large\nscattering problems, the matrix fill and factorization still dominate the\nsolution time when using a direct solution approach. To address this issue, an\nH-Matrix framework is employed, effectively resolving the challenge and\nestablishing the CBIE as a competitive high-order method for solving scattering\nproblems with poorly conditioned matrix equations. The efficacy of this\napproach is demonstrated through numerical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
