However, fewer studies\nhave been proposed to study the inductive MKGC (IMKGC) involving emerging\nentities unseen during training. Existing inductive approaches focus on\nlearning textual entity representations, which neglect rich semantic\ninformation in visual modality. Moreover, they focus on aggregating structural\nneighbors from existing KGs, which of emerging entities are usually limited.\nHowever, the semantic neighbors are decoupled from the topology linkage and\nusually imply the true target entity. In this paper, we propose the IMKGC task\nand a semantic neighbor retrieval-enhanced IMKGC framework CMR, where the\ncontrast brings the helpful semantic neighbors close, and then the memorize\nsupports semantic neighbor retrieval to enhance inference. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a unified cross-modal contrastive learning to simultaneously\ncapture the textual-visual and textual-textual correlations of query-entity\npairs in a unified representation space. The contrastive learning increases the\nsimilarity of positive query-entity pairs, therefore making the representations\nof helpful semantic neighbors close. Then, we explicitly memorize the knowledge\nrepresentations to support the semantic neighbor retrieval. At test time, we\nretrieve the nearest semantic neighbors and interpolate them to the\nquery-entity similarity distribution to augment the final prediction. Extensive\nexperiments validate the effectiveness of CMR on three inductive MKGC datasets.\nCodes are available at https://github.com/OreOZhao/CMR.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
