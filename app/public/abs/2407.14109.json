We demonstrate the existence of\nAnderson localization of single photon states in an energy band centered at the\nresonant energy of the atoms. Additionally, for a Bosonic model of the atoms\nthe results can be extended to multiple photon states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
