A novel proof for Pascal's\nTheorem will then be given by showing that this binary operation is associative\nindependent of Pascal's Theorem. Specifically, this operation is equivalent to\neither addition of real numbers, multiplication of real numbers, or rotations\non the plane depending on the type of the conic. Since each of these is already\nknown to be associative, it will follow that the binary operation is\nassociative and this will prove Pascal's Theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
