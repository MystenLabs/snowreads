Focusing on\ne-hailing services, this paper explores the sensing potential of taxi fleets,\nby designing a joint matching and pricing scheme based on a double auction\nprocess. The matching module maximizes the sensing utility by prioritizing\ntrips with high sensing potentials, and the pricing module allocates the\ncorresponding social welfare according to the participants' contributions to\nthe sensing utility. We show that the proposed scheme is allocative efficient,\nindividually rational, budget balancing, envy-free, and group incentive\ncompatible. The last notion guarantees that the participants, as a cohort, will\nend up with the same total utility regardless of mis-reporting on part of its\nmembers. Extensive numerical tests based on a real-world scenario reveal that\nthe sensing externality can be well aligned with the level of service and\nbudget balance. Various managerial insights regarding the applicability and\nefficacy of the proposed scheme are generated through scenario-based\nsensitivity analyses.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
