Each admissible control is known to produce\na nontrivial corresponding state by applying the Mountain Pass Theorem to\nfractional equations. The main theoretical contribution is the construction of\na suitable set of admissible controls on which the the standard existence\ntheory for control problems with linear and semi-linear state constraints can\nbe adapted. Extra care is taken to explain what new difficulties arise for\nthese types of control problems, to justify the limitations of this theory. For\ncompleteness, the corresponding local elliptic control problem is also studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MTT1ae5mQbP9GQvfeM2heR5GKpEf2NA9CUp_sbb8Q6A","pdfSize":"188268"}
