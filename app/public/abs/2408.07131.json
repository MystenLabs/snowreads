Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes nucleon as a\ncomposite object containing current quarks (valence quarks and sea\n(anti-)quarks) and gluons. These subatomic elements and their interactions are\nknown to contribute in complex ways to the overall nucleon spin and mass. In\nthe early development of QCD theory in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis\npostulated that the baryon number might manifest itself through a\nnon-perturbative configuration of gluon fields forming a Y-shaped topology\nknown as the gluon junction. In this work, we propose to test such hypothesis\nby measuring (i) the Regge intercept of the net-baryon distributions for\n$e$+($p$)Au collisions, (ii) baryon and charge transport in the isobaric ratio\nbetween $e$+Ru and $e$+Zr collisions, and (iii) target flavor dependence of\nproton and antiproton yields at large rapidity, transported from the hydrogen\nand deuterium targets in $e+p$(d) collisions. Our study indicates that these\nmeasurements at the EIC can help determine what carries the baryon number.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
