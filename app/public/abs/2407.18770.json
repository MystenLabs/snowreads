It is motivated by recent advances in artificial\nintelligence and applications of machine learning, where the notion of analogy\nis used to infer results, create data and even as an assessment tool of object\nrepresentations, or embeddings, that are basically collections of numbers\n(vectors, matrices, tensors). This extended analogy use asks for mathematical\nfoundations and clear understanding of the notion of analogy between numbers.\nWe propose a unifying view of analogies that relies on generalized means\ndefined in terms of a power parameter. In particular, we show that any four\nincreasing positive real numbers is an analogy in a unique suitable power. In\naddition, we show that any such analogy can be reduced to an equivalent\narithmetic analogy and that any analogical equation has a solution for\nincreasing numbers, which generalizes without restriction to complex numbers.\nThese foundational results provide a better understanding of analogies in areas\nwhere representations are numerical.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
