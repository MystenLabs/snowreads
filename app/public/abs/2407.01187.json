However, the strong spin-orbit\ncoupling that enables such a conversion, causes rapid relaxation of spins,\nmaking them difficult to transport over large length scales. Here, we show that\nspin-momentum entanglement at the Fermi surface of chiral tellurium crystals\nleads to the appearance of slow collective relaxation modes. These modes,\ncalled relaxons, resemble the persistent spin helix, a collective spin-wave\nexcitation with extended lifetime observed in quantum wells. The slow relaxons\ndominate the electrically generated spin and orbital angular momentum\naccumulation in tellurium and make it possible to combine a very high 50%\nconversion efficiency with a long spin lifetime. These results, obtained from\nthe exact solution of the Boltzmann transport equation, show that chiral\ncrystals can be used for highly efficient generation and transmission of spin\nsignals over long distances in spintronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
