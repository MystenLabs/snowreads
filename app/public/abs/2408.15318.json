Dark matter annihilation products can excite molecular hydrogen, which\nthen deexcites to produce ultraviolet emission in the Lyman and Werner bands.\nWe search for this new effect by analyzing nightside ultraviolet radiation data\nfrom Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons flybys of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn,\nand Jupiter. Our findings set new constraints on the dark matter-nucleon\nscattering cross section down to about $10^{-40}~$cm$^2$. We highlight that\nfuture ultraviolet airglow measurements of Solar System planets or other worlds\nprovide a new dark matter discovery avenue.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
