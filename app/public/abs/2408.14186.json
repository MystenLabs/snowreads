The main idea is to use the representation theory of GL(2) to generalize\nthe recently introduced concept of steerers from rotations to affine\ntransformations. Affine steerers give high control over how keypoint\ndescriptions transform under image transformations. We demonstrate the\npotential of using this control for image matching. Finally, we propose a way\nto finetune keypoint descriptors with a set of steerers on upright images and\nobtain state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks.
