Our approach involves\nimposing CP as an inherent symmetry of the Lagrangian, which is then\nspontaneously broken. To generate the correct texture for the Yukawa matrices,\nwe introduce a discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is softly broken by the\nscalar potential. By identifying a benchmark point for the Yukawa couplings\nthat aligns with the measured quark masses, the CKM matrix, and low-energy\nflavor-changing constraints, our findings suggest that this model offers a\nviable solution to the CP problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
