Particularly, we compute\nthe entanglement entropy (EE) as a function of the number of link components.\nWe find evidence of lower and upper bounds for the entanglement entropy. We\nshow that the $SU(2)$ theory exhibits sensitivity to the parity of links. We\nalso find evidence suggesting the existence of a well-defined limit of the\nlarge number of link components.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
