LiDAR-based gait recognition has also begun to evolve most\nrecently, due to the provision of 3D structural information. However, in\ncertain applications, cameras fail to recognize persons, such as in low-light\nenvironments and long-distance recognition scenarios, where LiDARs work well.\nOn the other hand, the deployment cost and complexity of LiDAR systems limit\nits wider application. Therefore, it is essential to consider cross-modality\ngait recognition between cameras and LiDARs for a broader range of\napplications. In this work, we propose the first cross-modality gait\nrecognition framework between Camera and LiDAR, namely CL-Gait. It employs a\ntwo-stream network for feature embedding of both modalities. This poses a\nchallenging recognition task due to the inherent matching between 3D and 2D\ndata, exhibiting significant modality discrepancy. To align the feature spaces\nof the two modalities, i.e., camera silhouettes and LiDAR points, we propose a\ncontrastive pre-training strategy to mitigate modality discrepancy. To make up\nfor the absence of paired camera-LiDAR data for pre-training, we also introduce\na strategy for generating data on a large scale. This strategy utilizes\nmonocular depth estimated from single RGB images and virtual cameras to\ngenerate pseudo point clouds for contrastive pre-training. Extensive\nexperiments show that the cross-modality gait recognition is very challenging\nbut still contains potential and feasibility with our proposed model and\npre-training strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\naddress cross-modality gait recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
