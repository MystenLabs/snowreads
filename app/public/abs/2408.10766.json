However, the requirements for publishing and sharing open data are in\nmany cases difficult to meet in compliance with strict data protection\nregulations. Consequently, researchers need to rely on proven methods that\nallow them to anonymize their data without sharing it with third parties. To\nthis end, this paper presents the implementation of a Python library for the\nanonymization of sensitive tabular data. This framework provides users with a\nwide range of anonymization methods that can be applied on the given dataset,\nincluding the set of identifiers, quasi-identifiers, generalization hierarchies\nand allowed level of suppression, along with the sensitive attribute and the\nlevel of anonymity required. The library has been implemented following best\npractices for integration and continuous development, as well as the use of\nworkflows to test code coverage based on unit and functional tests.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zdTW3nzgvB-75Rdi5qAUYuNaEv9OAsfwb9CGVzXZfdA","pdfSize":"209634"}
