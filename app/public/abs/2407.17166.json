Originating from uPCN, designed for microcontrollers, uD3TN has\nundergone significant architectural refinement to increase flexibility,\ncompatibility, and performance across various DTN applications. Key\ndevelopments include achieving platform independence, supporting multiple\nBundle Protocol versions concurrently, introducing abstract Convergence Layer\nAdapter (CLA) interfaces, and developing the so called Application Agent\nProtocol (AAP) for interaction with the application layer. Additional\nenhancements, informed by field tests, include Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation\nand exploring a port to the Rust programming language, indicating the project's\nongoing adaptation to practical needs. The paper also introduces the Generic\nBundle Forwarding Interface and AAPv2, showcasing the latest innovations in the\nproject. Moreover, it provides a comparison of uD3TN's architecture with the\nInterplanetary Overlay Network (ION) protocol stack, highlighting some general\narchitectural principles at the foundation of DTN protocol implementations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
