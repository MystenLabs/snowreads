It happens because the\ncorresponding analog of the Riemann vanishing theorem gives twice as many\npoints as the dimension of the Prym variety. However, if the Riemann surface\nhas a second involution commuting with the one defining the Prym variety and\nsatisfying a certain additional condition, an analog of the Jacobi inversion\ncan be defined, and expressed in terms of the Prym theta function. We formulate\nthese conditions and refer to the pairs of involutions satisfying them as to\npairs of the first type. We formulate necessary conditions for the pair of\ninvolutions to be a pair of the first type, and give a series of examples of\ncurves with such pairs of involutions, mainly spectral curves of Hitchin\nsystems, and also a spectral curve of the Kovalewski system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
