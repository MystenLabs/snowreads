However, RIS is generally passive and thus difficult to\nobtain corresponding full channel state information (CSI), which severely\nimpacts the EE enhancement of RIS-assisted wireless communications. To solve\nthis problem, in this paper we propose the new single-active-antenna combined\nRIS transmitter structure, which can replace traditional multiple antennas to\nreduce hardware cost and power consumption. Based on the single-active-antenna\ncombined RIS structure, we develop the Dumb RIS-Assisted Random Beamforming\n(Darb)-based Joint RIS-Elements and Transmit-power optimizAtion (Jeta) scheme,\nwhere dumb RIS randomly changes its phase shift according to isotropic\ndistribution only depending on the CSI feedback from users to RIS-assisted\ntransmitter. Then, we jointly design the number of RIS elements and optimize\nthe transmit power to maximize the EE of RIS-assisted wireless communications.\nSimulation results show that compared with the traditional multi-antenna\nsystem, our developed Darb-based-Jeta scheme can significantly increase the EE\nwithout the full CSI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
