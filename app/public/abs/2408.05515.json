We\nadvocate the {\\it general} two Higgs doublet model without $Z_2$ symmetry,\nallowing extra Yukawa couplings, where we present 5 clear merits. We report on\nthe search effort at LHC for $pp \\to tt\\bar\n  c$, then on the new effort of $pp \\to bH^+ \\to bt\\bar b$ search for $H^+$,\nand comment on our \\underline{\\bf Decadal Mission} program in Taiwan. Finally,\nwe turn to the $e^+e^- \\to H^+H^-\n  \\to c\\bar b\\bar cb$ program at ILC500 as a {\\it what-if} situation at the\nLHC, demonstrating light $H^+$ reconstruction without $c$-tagging. We then end\nwith discussion and conclusion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
