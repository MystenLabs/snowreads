We work to construct holographic descriptions\nof bubble wall junctions where we can tune the bubble wall height and pressure\ndifference in a theory at zero temperature and density. We study the system in\nthe presence of a background axial vector field b that induces a Weyl\nsemi-metal, massless phase and a background magnetic field B which favours mass\ngeneration. We find a first order transition line in the mass-$B$ plane, at\nfixed b, ending at a critical point. We present some preliminary solutions of\nPDEs that describe the motion of one dimensional bubble walls in this theory,\nwith a stationary initial condition - large pressure differences accelerate the\nwall to the speed of light whilst when the pressure difference is small the\nwall slumps to an interpolating solution. We also take the first steps to\ninclude temperature and see evidence of thermal drag slowing the wall motion.\nSlump configurations at finite temperature show some signs of a back pressure\nwave against the wall motion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
