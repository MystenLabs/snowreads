In addition to reducing potential hazards, this has guaranteed a\nconsistent desktop environment for every user. On the other hand, the attack\nsurface is greatly increased because all endpoints are connected to the company\nnetwork, which could harbor malware and other advanced persistent threats. This\nresults in a considerable loss of system resources on each individual endpoint.\nHence our work proposes a standard called Colaboot that enables machines\nthroughout a company to boot from a single operating system in order to address\nthese problems and guarantee a consistent operating system environment that\ncould be easily updated to the most recent security patches across all work\nstations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-p87r6ZHB0jLQCumkmYuT5g-doqnwYhMMJ4BW1mJrhU","pdfSize":"432561"}
