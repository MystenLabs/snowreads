First an\nextension of the MOOD methodology to nonconservative systems based on Taylor\nexpansions is presented. This extension combined with an in-cell discontinuous\nreconstruction operator are the key points to develop a new family of\nhigh-order methods that are able to capture exactly isolated shocks. Several\ntest cases are proposed to validate these methods for the Modified Shallow\nWater equations and the Two-Layer Shallow Water system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
