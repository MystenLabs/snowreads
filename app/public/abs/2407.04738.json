However, due to the complexity of ERP signal\ncomponents, their low signal-to-noise ratio, and significant inter-subject\nvariability, cross-subject ERP signal detection has been challenging. The\ncontinuous advancement in deep learning has greatly contributed to addressing\nthis issue. This brief proposes a contrastive learning training framework and\nan Inception module to extract multi-scale temporal and spatial features,\nrepresenting the subject-invariant components of ERP signals. Specifically, a\nbase encoder integrated with a linear Inception module and a nonlinear\nprojector is used to project the raw data into latent space. By maximizing\nsignal similarity under different targets, the inter-subject EEG signal\ndifferences in latent space are minimized. The extracted spatiotemporal\nfeatures are then used for ERP target detection. The proposed algorithm\nachieved the best AUC performance in single-trial binary classification tasks\non the P300 dataset and showed significant optimization in speller decoding\ntasks compared to existing algorithms.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
