For example, single crystal diffuse scattering\nexperiments provide insights into the driving forces behind local order\nphenomena. In this work, we present a time- and resource-efficient approach\nbased on mean field theory, that quantifies local interaction energies but\nunlike other techniques does not require computationally expensive supercell\nmodels. The method is employed to quantify competing interactions in\nfunctionally disordered materials such as disordered rock salt cathode\nmaterials and Prussian blue analogs that share an underlying face-centred\nlattice.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
