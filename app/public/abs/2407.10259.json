In this work, we build on FluxRGNN, a recently developed\nhybrid model of continental-scale bird migration, which combines a movement\nmodel inspired by fluid dynamics with recurrent neural networks that capture\nthe complex decision-making processes of birds. While FluxRGNN has been shown\nto successfully predict key migration patterns, its spatial resolution is\nconstrained by the typically sparse observations obtained from weather radars.\nAdditionally, its trainable components lack explicit incentives to adequately\npredict take-off and landing events. Both aspects limit our ability to\ninterpret model results ecologically. To address this, we propose two major\nmodifications that allow for more detailed predictions on any desired\ntessellation while providing control over the interpretability of model\ncomponents. In experiments on the U.S. weather radar network, the enhanced\nmodel effectively leverages the underlying movement model, resulting in strong\nextrapolation capabilities to unobserved locations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
