Meanwhile, most existing class\nincremental learning approaches are unsuitable for rPPG measurement. In this\npaper, we present a novel method named ADDP to tackle continual learning for\nrPPG measurement. We first employ adapter to efficiently finetune the model on\nnew tasks. Then we design domain prototypes that are more applicable to rPPG\nsignal regression than commonly used class prototypes. Based on these\nprototypes, we propose a feature augmentation strategy to consolidate the past\nknowledge and an inference simplification strategy to convert potentially\nforgotten tasks into familiar ones for the model. To evaluate ADDP and enable\nfair comparisons, we create the first continual learning protocol for rPPG\nmeasurement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod for rPPG continual learning.
