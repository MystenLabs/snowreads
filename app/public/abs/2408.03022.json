For non-rotating black strings, in the positive case, it\nwas shown in [1] that the excitation energy of a probe long string, plus its\ncontribution to the black-string background, is in harmony with single-trace\n$T\\bar T$ holography, if the $B$-field vanishes at the origin. Here, we\ninvestigate the superstring on deformed, rotating BTZ black holes, for both the\npositive and negative cases, and find that for a particular value of the\n$B$-field, the harmony with single-trace $T\\bar T$ holography persists.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
