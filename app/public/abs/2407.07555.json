It is shown that these\ntwo constructions lead to the Berglund-Hubsh-Krawitz dual orbifold groups which\ndefine mirror pairs of isomorphic models. Then we generalize our construction\nfor the orbifolds of Gepner models of superstring compactification and\nexplicitly build IIA/IIB mirror map of the space of states of the superstrings\nusing light-cone gauge.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
