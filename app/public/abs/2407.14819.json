MI penalties enable the adaptation to certain\nsignal structures via minimization, but often underestimate significant\ncomponents owing to convexity. To overcome this shortcoming, we design a\ngeneralized Moreau enhanced minimization induced (GME-MI) penalty by\nsubtracting from the MI penalty its generalized Moreau envelope. While the\nproposed GME-MI penalty is nonconvex in general, we derive an overall convexity\ncondition for the GME-MI regularized least-squares model. Moreover, we present\na proximal splitting algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a globally\noptimal solution of the GME-MI model under the overall convexity condition.\nNumerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
