Our\napproach involves expressing the associated graded of the cuspidal character\nD-module in terms of a dg module closely related to the action of the shuffle\nalgebra on the equivariant K-theory of the Hilbert scheme of points on the\nplane, thereby proving the rational master conjecture. As a corollary, we\nidentify the Hodge filtration with the inductive and algebraic filtrations on\n$\\mathrm{L}_{m/n}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
