Effective support in this area can significantly reduce\ndevelopment costs and enhance the software quality. In this paper, we introduce\nand assess the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) to evaluate the\nquality characteristics of software requirements according to the ISO 29148\nstandard. We aim to further improve the support of stakeholders engaged in\nrequirements engineering (RE). We show how an LLM can assess requirements,\nexplain its decision-making process, and examine its capacity to propose\nimproved versions of requirements. We conduct a study with software engineers\nto validate our approach. Our findings emphasize the potential of LLMs for\nimproving the quality of software requirements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
