However, usual microwave-based detection\nmethods have poor temporal and spatial resolution, and optical methods\ncompatible with room-temperature solutions have remained elusive. Here, we\nutilize pump-probe polarization spectroscopy to initialize and track electron\nspin coherence in a molecule. Designed to efficiently couple spins to light,\naqueous $K_{2}IrCl_{6}$ enables detection of few-picosecond free induction\ndecay at room temperature and micromolar concentrations. Viscosity is found to\nstrongly vary decoherence lifetimes. This work redefines the meaning of\nroom-temperature coherence by improving experimental time resolution by up to\nfive orders of magnitude. Doing so unveils a new regime of electron spin\ncoherence, opening the door to new synthetic design and applications of\nmolecular quantum bits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
