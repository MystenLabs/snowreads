We\nfocus on models of nuclear and molecular dark matter, where constituents are\nseparated by length scales larger than the inverse constituent mass, just like\nnuclei and atoms in the Standard Model. The cosmology, structure, and\ninteractions at underground experiments are described. We find that loosely\nbound composites can have a very large cross section for scattering with nuclei\nthat scales with nucleon number like $\\sim A^4$. For some couplings, these\ncomposites produce extremely soft ($\\ll$ keV) individual atomic recoils while\ndepositing a large amount of total recoil energy ($\\gg$ keV) in a single\npassage through a detector, implying an interesting new class of signatures for\nlow threshold direct detection.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IzEx893KX7gP35x9FYyWe9lHo--dzE-WnW9vyFgz2uI","pdfSize":"2752991"}
