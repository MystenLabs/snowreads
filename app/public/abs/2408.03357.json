This frequency-dependent function governs\nthe thermoacoustic stability of a combustor. The FTF measurement is therefore\nof great interest for predicting the stability of the a practical combustor\nconnected to the engine's compressor and turbine. In this study, the flame\ntransfer function of the sequential flame of an atmospheric constant pressure\nsequential combustor (CPSC) is experimentally measured. The thermal power of\nboth the first- and second-stage flames is kept constant and their ratio is\nfixed at 1:1. The effects of hydrogen blending in the first and second stage\nfuel mixture on the sequential FTF are analyzed. The FTF of the sequential\nflame is fitted with a distributed time delay (DTD) model with two pulses. The\ntrends of the model parameters obtained are consistent with the\nchemiluminescence OH* of the sequential flame.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
