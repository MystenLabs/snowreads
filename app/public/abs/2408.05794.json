Current safety\nmeasures often fail to detect subtly integrated hateful content within\n``Confounder Memes''. To address this, we introduce \\textsc{HateSieve}, a new\nframework designed to enhance the detection and segmentation of hateful\nelements in memes. \\textsc{HateSieve} features a novel Contrastive Meme\nGenerator that creates semantically paired memes, a customized triplet dataset\nfor contrastive learning, and an Image-Text Alignment module that produces\ncontext-aware embeddings for accurate meme segmentation. Empirical experiments\non the Hateful Meme Dataset show that \\textsc{HateSieve} not only surpasses\nexisting LMMs in performance with fewer trainable parameters but also offers a\nrobust mechanism for precisely identifying and isolating hateful content.\n\\textcolor{red}{Caution: Contains academic discussions of hate speech; viewer\ndiscretion advised.}\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PyGjN-n0TgpnMpsvfPrKgiERany02kYt1-CPx27fkH8","pdfSize":"18401375"}
