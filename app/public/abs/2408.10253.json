Here we point out and discuss a\nnumber of aspects of this imperfect symbolic description that might potentially\nbe misleading. Besides that, we analyze its relation to various concepts used\ncommonly to model physical systems, denoted by terms like: point, set,\ncontinuous, discrete, infinite, or local, clarifying further how our viewpoint\nis different and asking whether, in light of our main postulate, any of these\nnotions, or their opposites, if exist, are in their usual meanings suitable to\naccurately describe the natural phenomena.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
