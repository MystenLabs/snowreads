The behavior of a\n``generalized comma sequence'' depends on the base the numbers are written in,\nas well as the sequence's initial values. We provide a computational proof that\nall comma sequences in bases 3 through 19, as well as 22 and 23, are finite.\nRelying on a combinatorial conjecture, Angelini et al.~estimated that the final\nelement of a comma sequence in base $b$ should be roughly $\\exp(O(b))$. We\nprove their conjecture, but provide evidence that the correct estimate is\nactually $\\exp(O(b \\log b))$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6gtgglKIpG65lrSAdr8Oi3UjYAm5FTJVdJ_Us8a89c0","pdfSize":"439664"}
