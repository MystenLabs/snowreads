Most research in computer-assisted language learning has focused on\nfeedback through grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, rather than\nexamining more holistic feedback that may be more useful for learners. This\nholistic feedback will be referred to as grammatical error feedback (GEF). In\nthis paper, we present a novel implicit evaluation approach to GEF that\neliminates the need for manual feedback annotations. Our method adopts a\ngrammatical lineup approach where the task is to pair feedback and essay\nrepresentations from a set of possible alternatives. This matching process can\nbe performed by appropriately prompting a large language model (LLM). An\nimportant aspect of this process, explored here, is the form of the lineup,\ni.e., the selection of foils. This paper exploits this framework to examine the\nquality and need for GEC to generate feedback, as well as the system used to\ngenerate feedback, using essays from the Cambridge Learner Corpus.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2oAAU4uWww-BkM5e6syuqy4t1T9g0b5fGCjMpTvwvq8","pdfSize":"1235804"}
