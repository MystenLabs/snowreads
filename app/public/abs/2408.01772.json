Forecasting the future development\nof stock returns is an important aspect of portfolio assessment. Similar to the\nostensible arbitrariness of portfolio selection methods, it is shown that there\nis no substantial difference between the performances of ``best'' and\n``trivial'' forecasts - even under euphemistic model assumptions on the\nunderlying price dynamics. A certain significance of a predictor is found only\nin the following special case: the best linear unbiased forecast is used, the\nplanning horizon is small, and a critical relation is not satisfied.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PHAHUQrw26BIi2w_WfDMh32ZV2Gx70DjhH7aGhefb_M","pdfSize":"142153","txDigest":"6hhb6EqxchXevrSUt18TFasLATcYh32YAVDm96PtsWfX","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
