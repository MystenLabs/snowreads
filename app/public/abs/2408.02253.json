Furthermore, we introduce a novel algorithm that leverages\ncomputer vision feature detection algorithms to calculate glyph similarity for\nconstructing post-OCR synthetic data. Through experiments conducted across a\nvariety of languages, including several low-resource ones, we demonstrate that\nmodels like ByT5 can significantly reduce Character Error Rates (CER) without\nthe need for manually annotated data, and our proposed synthetic data\ngeneration method shows advantages over traditional methods, particularly in\nlow-resource languages.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6oc9dAl3T_hjVNlIv9-4aA3uwaTclaWczdSXK4937t8","pdfSize":"1896633","txDigest":"b51ezyYJFCNWGYT35nUmZrpdkvoxBa5bAh44cK9yX8y","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
