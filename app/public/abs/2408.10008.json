These include\nan investigation of including either inclusive jet data or dijet data, the\ndetailed treatment of $Z\\,p_T$ data, and the impact on the gluon PDF in\nparticular. We also very briefly summarize the determination of the strong\ncoupling via an aN$^3$LO global PDF fit, finding $\\alpha_S(M_Z^2)=0.1170\\pm\n0.0016$, and of including QED corrections in the aN$^3$LO analysis. Finally we\nconsider the preliminary finding associated with the effect of improved\nknowledge of the N$^3$LO splitting functions on the aN$^3$LO PDFs. In\nparticular we note a moderate impact on the gluon distribution, i.e. within the\nuncertainty, and a more limited impact on the gluon-gluon luminosity unless\nstrong rapidity cuts are imposed. Hence, we conclude that while details of our\naN$^3$LO PDFs will change with more precise splitting functions, only\nrelatively minor effects on predictions are likely to result.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wtHc9L2674MKwV0ZzmU_8sFb6ZimkpXa2guCgzQGHDM","pdfSize":"767932"}
