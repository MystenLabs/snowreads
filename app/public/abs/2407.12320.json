It is found that lateral pressure profile of unsaturated lipids has\ndistinct maximum in the unsaturated bond region due to enhanced excluded volume\neffect caused by the bent bond, leading to an increase of entropic repulsion\nbetween the lipid chains. Simultaneously, just away from the unsaturated bond\nsome parts of the neighbouring lipid chains have less probability to collide by\ngeometrical reasons, causing depletion of entropic repulsion relative to\nsaturated lipid chains case and resulting in the local minima of the lateral\npressure profile surrounding the maximum at the bent unsaturated bond. Lipid\nchain order parameter, lateral pressure profile, and area per lipid are\ncomputed for POPC and compared with those for DPPC lipid bilayer.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
