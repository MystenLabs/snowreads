After a labelling of the squares by $\\{1, \\dots,\nn\\}$, we can describe an STS with $n$ squares using two permutations $\\sigma,\n\\tau \\in S_n$, where $\\sigma$ encodes how the squares are glued horizontally\nand $\\tau$ encodes how the squares are glued vertically. Hence, a previously\nconsidered natural model for STSs with $n$ squares is $S_n \\times S_n$ with the\nuniform distribution. We modify this model to obtain a new one: We fix $\\alpha\n\\in [0,1]$ and let $\\mathcal{K}_\\mu$ be a conjugacy class of $S_n$ with at most\n$n^\\alpha$ cycles. Then $\\mathcal{K}_\\mu \\times S_n$ with the uniform\ndistribution is a model for STSs with restricted horizontal gluings. We deduce\nthe asymptotic (as $n$ grows) number of components, genus distribution, most\nlikely stratum and set of holonomy vectors of saddle connections for random\nSTSs in this new model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
