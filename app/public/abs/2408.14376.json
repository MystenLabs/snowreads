Here, we introduce a concept of rotating\nchiral dipoles in order to achieve unidirectional chiral scattering.\nImplementing this concept by engineering multipole excitations in plasmonic\nhelicoidal nanoparticles, we experimentally demonstrate enantio-sensitive and\nhighly-directional forward scattering of circularly polarised light. The\nintensity of this highly-directional scattering is defined by the mutual\nrelation between the handedness of the incident light and the chirality of the\nstructure. The concept of rotating chiral dipoles opens up numerous\npossibilities for engineering of scattering from chiral nanostructures and\noptical nano-antennas for the design and application of chiral light-matter\ninteraction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
