We demonstrate, however, that a large CP asymmetry can\nalready arise from Standard Model leptons. The mechanism relies on resummation\nof soft leptons at finite temperatures. The CP asymmetry, which is kinetically\nforbidden in vacuum, can be resonantly enhanced from thermally resummed leptons\nby seven orders of magnitude. Contrary to the resonance from exotic particles,\nwe show that the resonant enhancement from soft leptons is protected by\ncontrolled widths under finite-temperature perturbation theory. We quantify\nsuch CP asymmetries in leptogenesis with secluded flavor effects and comment on\nthe significance and application. The mechanism exploits the maximal role of\nleptons themselves, featuring low-scale leptogenesis, minimal model buildings\nand dark matter cogenesis.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
