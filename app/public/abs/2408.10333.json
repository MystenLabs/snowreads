Stability conditions\nderived from the Lyapunov method are expressed as linear matrix inequalities,\nallowing for optimal controller gain selection that minimizes disturbance\neffects. We employ the minimal Bergman and Tolic models to represent type 1\ndiabetes glucose-insulin dynamics, converting them into corresponding\nTakagi-Sugeno fuzzy models using the sector nonlinearity approach. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the proposed controller's effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FLTuTE5hX4s0itTUXGnBCRO4xFdYY1yIqf_N7o9h0rQ","pdfSize":"608921"}
