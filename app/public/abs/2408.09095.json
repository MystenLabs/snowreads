Although SO code snippets serve as valuable\nresources, it is important to acknowledge their imperfections, reusing\nproblematic code snippets can lead to the introduction of suboptimal or buggy\ncode into software projects. SO comments often point out weaknesses of a post\nand provide valuable insights to improve the quality of answers, while SO\ncomments are usually missed and/or ignored, leaving these problematic code\nsnippets untouched. In this work, we first investigate the task of automatic SO\nposts updating based on their associated comments. We introduce a novel\nframework, named Soup (Stack Overflow Updator for Post) for this task. Soup\naddresses two key tasks: Valid Comment-Edit Prediction (VCP) and Automatic Post\nUpdating (APU). Extensive experimental results show the promising performance\nof our model over a set of benchmarks. Moreover, we also performed an\nin-the-wild evaluation on Stack Overflow, we submitted 50 edits generated by\nour approach to Stack Overflow posts and 21 of them have been verified and\naccepted by SO maintainers, further proving the practical value of Soup.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
