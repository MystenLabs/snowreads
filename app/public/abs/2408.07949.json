The evolution of those hypersurfaces inside the cone yields a\nfully nonlinear parabolic Neumann problem. Under suitable constraints on the\nfirst and the second derivatives of the radial function $f$, we can prove the\nlong-time existence of this flow, and moreover the evolving hypersurfaces\nconverge smoothly to a piece of the round sphere.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
