While most\nof the numerical simulations are carried out by expanding relevant operators\nand wave functions on the spherical harmonic oscillator basis, alternative\none-body bases offering advantages in terms of computational efficiency have\nrecently been investigated. In particular, the so-called natural basis used in\ncombination with symmetry-conserving methods applicable to doubly closed-shell\nnuclei has proven beneficial in this respect. The present work examines the\nperformance of the natural basis in the context of symmetry-breaking many-body\ncalculations enabling the description of superfluid and deformed open-shell\nnuclei at polynomial cost with system's size. First, it is demonstrated that\nthe advantage observed for closed-shell nuclei carries over to open-shell ones.\nA detailed investigation of natural-orbital wave functions provides useful\ninsight to support this finding and to explain the superiority of the natural\nbasis over alternative ones. Second, it is shown that the use of natural\norbitals combined with importance-truncation techniques leads to an even\ngreater gain in terms of computational costs. The presents results pave the way\nfor the systematic use of natural-orbital bases in future implementations of\nnon-perturbative many-body methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
