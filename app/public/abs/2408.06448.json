The historical\nsteps leading to our current understanding of central star evolution and\nnebular formation are discussed. Recent optical imaging, X-ray, ultraviolet,\ninfrared, millimeter wave, radio observations have led to a much more complex\npicture of the structure of planetary nebulae. The optically bright regions\nhave multiple shell structures (rims, shells, crowns, and haloes), which can be\nunderstood within the interacting winds framework. However, the physical\nmechanism responsible for bipolar and multipolar structures that emerged during\nthe proto-planetary nebulae phase is yet to be identified. Our morphological\nclassifications of planetary nebulae are hampered by the effects of\nsensitivity, orientation, and field-of-view coverage, and the fraction of\nbipolar or multipolar nebulae may be much higher than commonly assumed. The\noptically bright bipolar lobes may represent low-density, ionization-bounded\ncavities carved out of a neutral envelope by collimated fast winds. Planetary\nnebulae are sites of active synthesis of complex organic compounds, suggesting\nthat planetary nebulae play a major role in the chemical enrichment of the\nGalaxy. Possible avenues of future advancement are discussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QOQ2IMc6uzx70N_eESh5l12XscbvKGTn23lShd0JrJI","pdfSize":"3874734"}
