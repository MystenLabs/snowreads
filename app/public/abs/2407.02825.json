However, there is little research on\nRepresentation learning with CGAN for causal inference. This paper proposes a\nnew method for finding representation learning functions by adopting the\nadversarial idea. We apply the pattern of CGAN and theoretically emonstrate the\nfeasibility of finding a suitable representation function in the context of two\ndistributions being balanced. The theoretical result shows that when two\ndistributions are balanced, the ideal representation function can be found and\nthus can be used to further research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
