This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both\nexperimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently\ncomplex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton\ncollisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in\nheavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding\nof their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend\nour previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a\nqualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive\njets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a\nhydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for\nmedium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases\narising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our\nresults represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of\nenergy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a\nsignificant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental\nquantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of\nthe QGP.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
