However, generating realistic and\ndiverse hypergraphs remains challenging due to their inherent complexity and\nlack of effective generative models. In this paper, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based Hypergraph Generation (HYGENE) method that addresses these\nchallenges through a progressive local expansion approach. HYGENE works on the\nbipartite representation of hypergraphs, starting with a single pair of\nconnected nodes and iteratively expanding it to form the target hypergraph. At\neach step, nodes and hyperedges are added in a localized manner using a\ndenoising diffusion process, which allows for the construction of the global\nstructure before refining local details. Our experiments demonstrated the\neffectiveness of HYGENE, proving its ability to closely mimic a variety of\nproperties in hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nattempt to employ deep learning models for hypergraph generation, and our work\naims to lay the groundwork for future research in this area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
