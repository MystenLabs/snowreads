We generalize various results on\nsuch sums of exponentials and relate them to other classes of curves present in\nthe literature. Moreover, we consider the evolution under the wave equation of\nsuch curves for the case of binomials. Interestingly, our methods provide a\nunified and systematic way of constructing curves with prescribed properties,\nsuch as number of cusps, number of intersection points or winding number.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
