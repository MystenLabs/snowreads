Additionally, HotStuff-1 incorporates\nan incentive-compatible leader rotation regime that motivates leaders to commit\nconsensus decisions promptly.\n  HotStuff-1 achieves a reduction by two network hops by sending clients early\nfinality confirmations speculatively, after one phase of the protocol. Unlike\nprevious speculation regimes, the early finality confirmation path of\nHotStuff-1 is fault-tolerant and the latency improvement does not rely on\noptimism. An important consideration for speculation regimes in general, which\nis referred to as the prefix speculation dilemma, is exposed and resolved.\n  HotStuff-1 embodies an additional mechanism, slotting, that thwarts\nreal-world delays caused by rationally-incentivized leaders. Leaders may also\nbe inclined to sabotage each other's progress. The slotting mechanism allows\nleaders to drive multiple decisions, thus mitigating both threats, while\ndynamically adapting the number of allowed decisions per leader to network\ntransmission delays.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
