Despite growing interest in\nsuch retrieval-augmented models, their fundamental properties and training are\nnot well understood. We propose a statistical framework to study such models\nwith two components: 1) a {\\em retriever} to identify the relevant information\nout of a large corpus via a data-dependent metric; and 2) a {\\em predictor}\nthat consumes the input instances along with the retrieved information to make\nthe final predictions. We present a principled method for end-to-end training\nof both components and draw connections with various training approaches in the\nliterature. Furthermore, we establish excess risk bounds for\nretrieval-augmented models while delineating the contributions of both\nretriever and predictor towards the model performance. We validate the utility\nof our proposed training methods along with the key takeaways from our\nstatistical analysis on open domain question answering task where retrieval\naugmentation is important.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
