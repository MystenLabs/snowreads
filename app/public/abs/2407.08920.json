Here we propose a new\nmethod for a general construction of optimally localized Wannier functions from\nsuch Chern bands. We do so through an optimal gauge choice of the Bloch states\nof a Chern band with the singularity placed at any desired position in momentum\nspace. We apply this method to construct the optimally localized Wannier\nfunctions for kagome lattice, and use it to identify channels of interactions\nthat are favorable to the development of fractional Chern insulators.\nImplications of the approach for the interplay between correlations and\ntopology in broader contexts are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
