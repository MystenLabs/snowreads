We show that such algebras with $q=1$ and\n$\\sigma$ not fixing~1 or~$n$ are eventually commutative in the sense that the\nequality $x_1\\cdots x_k =x_{\\tau(1)}\\cdots x_{\\tau(k)}$ holds for $k$ large\nenough and all permutations $\\tau\\in S_k$. Calling the minimal such~$k$ the\ndegree of eventual commutativity, we prove that $k$ is never more than~$2n-3,$\nand that this bound is sharp. For various natural examples, we prove that $k$\ncan be taken to be $n+1$ or $n+2$. In the case when $q\\ne1$, we establish that\nthe algebra must be nilpotent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b77mfan03JEz9pEhLqIPUcJhIrlkQisRdnY_FMdjegE","pdfSize":"180635"}
