Here, we report the nuclear magnetic resonance\ninvestigations into the low-energy spin dynamics in the $S=1/2$ spin-trimer\nantiferromagnetic chain compound Na$_2$Cu$_3$Ge$_{4-x}$Si$_{x}$O$_{12}$ ($x=0,\n0.1\\sim1.5$). In the parent compound ($x=0$), the spin-lattice relaxation rate\n(1/$T_1$) shows significantly different temperature dependence when the\nexternal magnetic field is increased above the critical field of $\\mu_0$$H_{c}$\n= 29 T. The spin excitation gap is evidenced from the thermally activated\nbehavior of $1/T_1(T)$ in the 1/3-$M$ plateau state. By substituting Ge$^{4+}$\nwith Si$^{4+}$, the critical field for the 1/3-$M$ plateau significantly\ndecreases, e.g. $\\mu_0H_{c}=17$ T in $x=1.0$ samples, which results from the\nsuppressed inter-trimer coupling $J_2$. The gapped spin excitation is confirmed\nagain above 17 T, whose size shows temperature-dependent behavior for\n$\\mu_0H\\geq25.72$ T. These observations provide further insights into the\nHaldane physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
