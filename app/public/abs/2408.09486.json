When the pump Rabi frequency was modulated at\n$\\Delta_{pa}$ with zero pump-atom detuning for various cavity-atom detunings,\nwe obtained a lasing peak at the atomic resonance and superradiant lasing peaks\nat $\\pm\\Delta_{pa}$ simultaneously while the central peak exhibiting a zero\nfrequency pulling coefficient. The linewidth of the central peak was reduced\nbeyond the gain narrowing as the mean number of atoms was increased, resulting\nin a minimum linewidth as small as a millionth of the atomic or cavity\nlinewdith. A pump carrier detuning caused asymmetric heights for the side\nsuperradiant peaks, the height difference of which can be used to lock the pump\nlaser to the atom within the linewidth of the central lasing peak. Our results\nmay lead to development of a new type of ultra-stable active optical clocks for\nfuture frequency standards when applied to proper atomic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uSUJw2H2BLZ2fftX41BLr-tKtIeAhz7kb7JldgxLzk8","pdfSize":"2482372"}
