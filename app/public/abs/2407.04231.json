The current state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethod proposes a three-stage network architecture that utilizes six GANs.\nDespite its excellent model performance, the SOTA network architecture requires\nlong training and inference times. To overcome this problem, this work\nintroduces an efficient GAN method based on the three-stage network\narchitecture that incorporates the Discrete Wavelet Transformation and\nnormalization to reduce the input image size, which in turns, decrease both\ntraining and inference times. In addition, this work presents novel generators,\ndiscriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method reduces the training time by\n10% and the inference time by 26% when compared to the SOTA method while\nmaintaining the model performance at 73.79 of Avg-Score.
