The\nmethod relies on the numerical solution of one-dimensional first-order ordinary\ndifferential equations. The solution of each equation allows to compute a\ncorresponding cross section of the two-dimensional phase, leading to the\neffective recovery of the phase surface. The unwrapping procedure can be\nperformed in each orthogonal direction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
