The inherent structure of quantum states and its\nrelation to a particular class of quantum states are used to intuitively\nclassify testing states from domains different from training states, called\n\\textit{cross-domain classification}. Using our quantum machine learning\nalgorithm, we demonstrate efficient classifications of two-qubit mixed states\ninto entangled and separable classes. For analyzing the quantumness of\ncorrelations, our model adequately classifies Bell diagonal states as zero and\nnon-zero discord states. In addition, we also extend our analysis to evaluate\nthe robustness of our model using random local unitary transformations. Our\nresults demonstrate the potential of the quantum support vector machine for\nclassifying quantum states across the multi-dimensional Hilbert space in\ncomparison to classical support vector machines and neural networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
