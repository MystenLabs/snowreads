Although\nthere are researches focused on the study of these techniques applied to IDS,\nthe state-of-the-art lacks works concentrated exclusively on the evaluation of\nthe impacts of data pre-processing actions and the optimization of the values\nof the hyperparameters of the ML algorithms in the construction of the models\nof threat identification. This article aims to present a study that fills this\nresearch gap. For that, experiments were carried out with two data sets,\ncomparing attack scenarios with variations of pre-processing techniques and\noptimization of hyperparameters. The results confirm that the proper\napplication of these techniques, in general, makes the generated classification\nmodels more robust and greatly reduces the execution times of these models'\ntraining and testing processes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
