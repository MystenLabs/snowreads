Existing FMs have struggled to establish\nsequence-structure alignment, hindering the free flow of genomic information\nbetween RNA sequences and structures. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome,\nan RNA FM trained to align RNA sequences with respect to secondary structures\nbased on structure-contextualised modelling. The alignment enables free and\nbidirectional mappings between sequences and structures by utilising the\nflexible RNA modelling paradigm that supports versatile input and output\nmodalities, i.e., sequence and/or structure as input/output. We implement RNA\ndesign and zero-shot secondary structure prediction as case studies to evaluate\nthe Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capacity of OmniGenome. Results on the EternaV2\nbenchmark show that OmniGenome solved 74% of puzzles, whereas existing FMs only\nsolved up to 3% of the puzzles due to the oversight of sequence-structure\nalignment. We leverage four comprehensive in-silico genome modelling benchmarks\nto evaluate performance across a diverse set of genome downstream tasks, where\nthe results show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on RNA\nand DNA benchmarks, even without any training on DNA genomes.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
