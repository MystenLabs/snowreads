For this, I use the Lugiato-Lefever equation.\nThe derivation of the Hamiltonian does not pretend to be mathematically\ncorrect, although it works under the assumption of plane waves propagating\nthrough the OPOs. Its objective is rather to be as close as possible to the\nHamilton formalism than to be mathematically rigorous. The approach is based on\nthe assumptions that are justified from the physical point of view and are\nimplemented experimentally. The resulting Ising Hamiltonian contains all\nnecessary terms that are connected to the appearance and evolution of phase\nsolitons.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
