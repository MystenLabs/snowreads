We consider the\nsimplest example -- electric dipole radiation of a single photon -- and show\nthat this angular momentum is attributable to zero-point oscillations in\nunexcited states of the dipole source.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
