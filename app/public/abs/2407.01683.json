Therefore, changes\nto the comoving photon distribution across the decoupling zone are encoded in\nthe emitted signal. In this paper, we study such spectral evolution occurring\nacross a pulse. We track the radiation from the deep subphotospheric regions\nall the way to the observed time-resolved signal, accounting for emission at\nvarious angles and radii. We assume a simple power-law photon spectrum\ninjection over a range of optical depths and let the photons interact with the\nlocal plasma. At high optical depths, we find that the radiation exists in one\nof three characteristic regimes, two of which exhibit a high-energy power law.\nDepending on the nature of the injection, this power law can persist to low\noptical depths and manifest itself during the rise time of the pulse with a\nspectral index $\\beta \\approx \\alpha - 1$, where $\\alpha$ is the low-energy\nspectral index. The results are given in the context of a gamma-ray burst jet\nbut are general to optically thick, relativistic outflows.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
