It has caused\nan unprecedented effect on daily life, global economy and public health. Hence\nthis disease detection has life-saving importance for both patients as well as\ndoctors. Due to limited test kits, it is also a daunting task to test every\npatient with severe respiratory problems using conventional techniques\n(RT-PCR). Thus implementing an automatic diagnosis system is urgently required\nto overcome the scarcity problem of Covid-19 test kits at hospital, health care\nsystems. The diagnostic approach is mainly classified into two\ncategories-laboratory based and Chest radiography approach. In this paper, a\nnovel approach for computerized corona virus (2019-nCoV) detection from lung\nx-ray images is presented. Here, we propose models using deep learning to show\nthe effectiveness of diagnostic systems. In the experimental result, we\nevaluate proposed models on publicly available data-set which exhibit\nsatisfactory performance and promising results compared with other previous\nexisting methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fHmvzRc9EhW2_XQpJZtzinc3f2P9aDGpmStlTODHNBY","pdfSize":"2612647"}
