Here we construct a\nQCNN that can perform phase recognition in two dimensions and correctly\nidentify the phase transition from a Toric Code phase with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological order to the paramagnetic phase. The network also\nexhibits a noise threshold up to which the topological order is recognized. Our\nwork generalizes phase recognition with QCNNs to higher spatial dimensions and\nintrinsic topological order, where exploration and characterization via\nclassical numerics become challenging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
