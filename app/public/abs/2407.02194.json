We focus on the regularization of double-real\nradiation contributions, which are typically the most computationally intensive\npart of NNLO calculations. We describe the structure of the subtraction terms\nin LASS and our approach to numerically validate them. Using arbitrary\nprecision arithmetic, we demonstrate the proper convergence of individual\nsubtraction terms, overlap removal terms, and spurious singularity\ncancellations in various singular limits. We show results for the specific case\nof three-jet production in $e^+e^-$ collisions. Our results validate the\ncorrectness of both the LASS formalism and our numerical implementation,\nsetting the stage for full NNLO calculations using this method.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
