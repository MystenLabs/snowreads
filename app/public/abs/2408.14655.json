We demonstrate a simplified approach for a superconducting flip\nchip using commercially available indium microspheres and an in-house-built\ntransfer stage for bonding two chips patterned with superconducting thin films.\nWe use a gold-passivated niobium or niobium nitride layer as an under-bump\nmetallization (UBM) layer between an aluminum-based superconducting layer and\nthe indium interconnect. At millikelvin temperatures, our flip-chip assembly\ncan transport a supercurrent with tens of milliamperes, limited by the smallest\ngeometric feature size and critical current density of the UBM layer. We also\nshow that the indium interconnect itself can carry a supercurrent exceeding\n1\\,A. Our flip-chip assembly does not require patterning and electroplating of\nindium, nor does it need a flip-chip bonder. Thus, the presented flip-chip\ndevices can be utilized in applications that require few superconducting\ninterconnects carrying large currents at millikelvin temperatures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
