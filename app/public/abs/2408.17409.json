However, the typical machine learning\n(ML) algorithms employed for this task require fixed length and ordered inputs\nthat break the natural permutation invariance in collision events. To address\nthis, a semi-supervised anomaly detection tool is presented that takes a\nvariable number of particle-level inputs and leverages a signal model to encode\nthis information into a permutation invariant, event-level representation via\nsupervised training with a Particle Flow Network (PFN). Data events are then\nencoded into this representation and given as input to an autoencoder for\nunsupervised ANomaly deTEction on particLe flOw latent sPacE (ANTELOPE),\nclassifying anomalous events based on a low-level and permutation invariant\ninput modeling. Performance of the ANTELOPE architecture is evaluated on\nsimulated samples of hadronic processes in a high energy collider experiment,\nshowing good capability to distinguish disparate models of new physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
