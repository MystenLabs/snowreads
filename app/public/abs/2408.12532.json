The particle's phase-space trajectories are\ntreated as drift-diffusion stochastic process, leading to a Fokker-Planck\nequation (FPE) for the single-particle probability distribution function. The\ndrift and diffusion coefficients are derived from the expected asymptotic\nstates via appropriate fluctuation-dissipation relations, and the resulting FPE\nis then solved numerically using a spectral eigenfunction decomposition. The\ncalculated time-dependent particle distributions are compared to Pb-Pb data\nfrom the ATLAS and ALICE collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"k60U287wJnPJyHXVwHqOyoxfWU-IzzGJCZMSsGpzMfc","pdfSize":"764406"}
