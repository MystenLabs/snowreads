We focus on theories with gravity coupled to a massless scalar via the\nGauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms. In this framework, we calculate the\nwaveforms for classical scalar radiation emitted in scattering of macroscopic\nobjects, including spin effects. To this end, we use the\nKosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, with the 5-particle amplitude for scalar\nemission in matter scattering calculated at tree level using the\nunitarity-factorization bootstrap techniques. We also discuss in detail the\ndependence of that amplitude on the contact terms of the intermediate\n4-particle scalar-graviton-matter amplitude. Finally, we discuss the conditions\nfor resolvability of classical scalar radiation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
