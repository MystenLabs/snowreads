Unlike existing algorithms, JTSCE employs a maximum length sequence\n(MLS) rather than an isolated signal as the pilot. Distinctively, JTSCE\nexplores MLS's autocorrelation properties to estimate timing offset and channel\ndelay taps. After obtaining delay taps, closed-form expressions of Doppler and\nchannel gain for each propagation path are derived. Simulation results indicate\nthat, compared to its counterpart, JTSCE achieves better bit error rate\nperformance, close to that with perfect time synchronization and channel state\ninformation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
