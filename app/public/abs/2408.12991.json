However,\ncurrent approaches often result in unsatisfactory fidelity in generating order\nflow, and their generation lacks controllability, thereby limiting their\napplication scenario. In this paper, we advocate incorporating controllability\ninto the market generation process, and propose a Diffusion Guided meta\nAgent(DiGA) model to address the problem. Specifically, we utilize a diffusion\nmodel to capture dynamics of market state represented by time-evolving\ndistribution parameters about mid-price return rate and order arrival rate, and\ndefine a meta agent with financial economic priors to generate orders from the\ncorresponding distributions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that\nour method exhibits outstanding controllability and fidelity in generation.\nFurthermore, we validate DiGA's effectiveness as generative environment for\ndownstream financial applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W5Y4QP6FtiMH2znYmGyVJEnJRxfeqbF2dQag8ZbGm6U","pdfSize":"1152195"}
