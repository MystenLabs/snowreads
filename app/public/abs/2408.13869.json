To achieve this, we extend the theory of very weak solutions for\nclassical wave equations to our nonlocal framework. This strengthened Runge\napproximation property allows us to extend the existing uniqueness results for\nCalder\\'on problems of linear and nonlinear nonlocal wave equations in our\nearlier works. Furthermore, we prove unique determination results for the\nCalder\\'on problem of nonlocal wave equations with polyhomogeneous\nnonlinearities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
