Based on the truncation method, an\nalgorithm for numerical differentiation is constructed, which is order-optimal\nboth in the sense of accuracy and in terms of the amount of involved Galerkin\ninformation. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the fact that our\napproach can be implemented successfully.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
