Notable features of such matter phases are\nmobility constraints and subextensive ground state degeneracies (GSDs). In this\npaper, we propose a BF-like theory motivated by the Godbillon-Vey invariant,\nwhich is a mathematical invariant of the foliated manifold. Our theory hosts\nsubsystem higher form symmetries which manifestly ensure the mobility\nconstraint and subextensive GSD through the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We\nalso discuss some lattice spin models which realize the same low energy\nbehaviours as the BF-like theory. Furthermore, we explore dynamical matter\ntheories which are coupled to the BF-like theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"58PVrgwmeBB5fBke1maOvVkWzy6IIz3g5iGC2G5FlRw","pdfSize":"828052"}
