The precise identification and categorization of\nhistopathological images are of paramount significance for early disease\ndetection and treatment. In the diagnostic process of pathologists, a\nmulti-tiered approach is typically employed to assess abnormalities in cell\nregions at different magnifications. However, feature extraction is often\nperformed at a single granularity, overlooking the multi-granular\ncharacteristics of cells. To address this issue, we propose the Fuzzy-guided\nMulti-granularity Deep Neural Network (FMDNN). Inspired by the multi-granular\ndiagnostic approach of pathologists, we perform feature extraction on cell\nstructures at coarse, medium, and fine granularity, enabling the model to fully\nharness the information in histopathological images. We incorporate the theory\nof fuzzy logic to address the challenge of redundant key information arising\nduring multi-granular feature extraction. Cell features are described from\ndifferent perspectives using multiple fuzzy membership functions, which are\nfused to create universal fuzzy features. A fuzzy-guided cross-attention module\nguides universal fuzzy features toward multi-granular features. We propagate\nthese features through an encoder to all patch tokens, aiming to achieve\nenhanced classification accuracy and robustness. In experiments on multiple\npublic datasets, our model exhibits a significant improvement in accuracy over\ncommonly used classification methods for histopathological image classification\nand shows commendable interpretability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
