By mapping lattice Boltzmann schemes\nto Finite Difference schemes, we facilitate rigorous consistency and stability\nanalyses. We develop kinetic boundary conditions for inflows and outflows,\nhighlighting the trade-off between accuracy and stability, which we\nsuccessfully overcome. Consistency analysis relies on modified equations,\nwhereas stability is assessed using GKS (Gustafsson, Kreiss, and Sundstr{\\\"o}m)\ntheory and -- when this approach fails on coarse meshes -- spectral and\npseudo-spectral analyses of the scheme's matrix that explain effects germane to\nlow resolutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
