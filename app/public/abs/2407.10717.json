Events are selected with a charged lepton originating from the\nprimary vertex associated with the proton-proton interaction, as well as a\nsecond charged lepton and a hadronic jet associated with a secondary vertex\nthat corresponds to the semileptonic decay of a long-lived HNL. No excess of\nevents above the standard model expectation is observed. Exclusion limits at\n95% confidence level are evaluated for HNLs that mix with electron and/or muon\nneutrinos. Limits are presented in the mass range of 1-16.5 GeV, with excluded\nsquare mixing parameter values reaching as low as 2 $\\times$ 10$^{-7}$. For\nmasses above 11 GeV, the presented limits exceed all previous results in the\nsemileptonic decay channel, and for some of the considered scenarios are the\nstrongest to date.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qhbqzW2MaxyvCCeic6f-Xv2Ev5lPxuntK-R0TVtbgSk","pdfSize":"5968958"}
