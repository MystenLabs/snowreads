Such smart factories have data packets with a mix of stringent and\nnon-stringent deadlines with varying levels of importance that need to be\ndelivered via a wireless network. However, the scheduling of packets in the\nwireless network is crucial to satisfy the deadlines. In this work, we propose\na technique of utilizing IEEE 802.11ax, popularly known as WiFi 6, for such\napplications. IEEE 802.11ax has a few unique characteristics, such as specific\nconfigurations of dividing the channels into resource units (RU) for packet\ntransmission and synchronized parallel transmissions. We model the problem of\nscheduling packets by assigning profit to each packet and then maximizing the\nsum of profits. We first show that this problem is strongly NP-Hard, and then\npropose an approximation algorithm with a 12-approximate algorithm. Our\napproximation algorithm uses a variant of local search to associate the right\nRU configuration to each packet and identify the duration of each parallel\ntransmission. Finally, we extensively simulate different scenarios to show that\nour algorithm works better than other benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
