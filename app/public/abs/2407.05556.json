We find that the\nSU($4$) singlet ground state appears in the strongly anisotropic limit, whereas\nN\\'eel and valence-bond crystal orders coexist in the nearly isotropic limit.\nBy examining the intermediate parameter region, we identify a phase transition\nbetween these phases. The nature of the phase transition is likely to be of\nfirst order, and the transition point is estimated to be around $J'/J\\approx\n0.85(5)$, where $J$ and $J'$ are the interaction strengths of intra- and\ninterplaquette bonds, respectively. We also calculate the anisotropy dependence\nof singlet correlations on a plaquette bond, which will be useful for future\nexperiments of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
