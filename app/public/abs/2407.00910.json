We prove that\nthe positivity of the Patterson-Sullivan measure of the Myrberg limit set is\nequivalent to the conservativity of the geodesic flow with respect to the\nBowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. Moreover we show that the Myrberg limit set is\na full Patterson-Sullivan measure subset of the conical limit set. These\nresults extend the classical works of P. Tukia and B. Stratmann from hyperbolic\nmanifolds to the manifolds without conjugate points.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
