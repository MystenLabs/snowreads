These excitations carry a higher pseudospin, providing a\nnatural generalization to the Weyl fermion. How do electrons beyond the\nconventional Dirac and Weyl fermions localize under disorder? In this Letter,\nwe solve the problem of localization of free fermionic excitations carrying an\narbitrary pseudospin-s. We derive exact analytical expressions for fermionic\nwavefunctions, scattering time, renormalized velocity, Cooperon, and the\nmagnetoconductivity. We discover that the gapless Cooperon mode solely depends\non the pseudospin even when Fermi surface is composed of multiple pockets,\nleading to weak localization (antilocalization) behavior for even (odd) s.\nRemarkably, we find the localization correction to scale exponentially with s,\ni.e., faster moving electrons are strongly susceptible to disorder effects.\nThis opens up intriguing possibility for Anderson localization and many-body\nlocalization in these materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-HVIIGII6F3Ums74H6hV2gCFXgGkLyhAds-bwKby6ag","pdfSize":"1952885"}
