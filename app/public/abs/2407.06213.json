This study examines the insertion of a deterministic\nnumber into a random tableau of a specified shape, focusing on the relationship\nbetween the value of the inserted number and the position of the new box\ncreated by the Schensted row insertion. Specifically, for a given tableau and a\npoint on its boundary, we consider the threshold that separates values which,\nif inserted, would result in the new box being created above the point from\nthose that would result in a new box below. We analyze a random tableau of\nfixed shape and study the corresponding random threshold value. Explicit\ncombinatorial formulas for the cumulants of this random variable are provided,\nexpressed in terms of Kerov's transition measure of the diagram. These\ncombinatorial formulas involve summing over non-crossing alternating trees. As\na first application of these results, we demonstrate that for random Young\ntableaux of prescribed large shape, the rightmost entry in the first row\nconverges in distribution to an explicit Gaussian distribution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
