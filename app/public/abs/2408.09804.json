The temporal variability of the powerful emissions of H$\\alpha$ and\nHeI profiles is found. For two-peaked emissions with ``rectangular'' profiles,\nthe intensity ratio of blue-shifted and red-shifted peaks is $V/R \\ge 1$,\nexcept one date. A decrease in the intensity of all double-peaked emissions,\nVr(emis-d), with ``rectangular'' profiles was revealed as they moved away in\ntime from the 1998 outburst. The average velocity Vr(emis-d) for all\nobservational dates varies in the range $(-50.8 \\div -55.7)\\pm 0.2$ km/s. The\nhalf-amplitude of the change (standard deviation) is equal to $\\Delta$Vr=2.5\nkm/s. The velocity for single-peaked ion emissions (SiIII, AlIII, FeIII)\ndiffers little from the values of Vr(emis-d), but the measurement accuracy for\nthese emissions is worse: the average error for different dates ranges from 0.4\nto 1.3 km/s. The systemic velocity is assumed to be Vsys=$-55.4\\pm 0.6$ km/s\naccording to the stable position of the forbidden emission [NII] 5754 A. The\nposition of single-peaked emissions [OIII] 4959 and 5007 A is also stable:\nVr[OIII]=$-54.2\\pm 0.4$ km/s. Forbidden emissions [OI] 5577, 6300, 6363, [CaII]\n7291 and 7324 A are absent from the spectra. Appearence of the emission near\n4686 A is an infrequent event, its intensity rarely exceeds the noise level.\nOnly a wide asymmetric emission with an intensity of about 16% above the local\ncontinuum was registered in the spectrum for March 9, 2015. Questions arise\nabout the use of this emission to estimate the orbital period of the star and\nabout localization of this feature in the CI Cam system. The photospheric\nabsorptions of NII, SII, and FeIII with a variable position are identified.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
