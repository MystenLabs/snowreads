To improve the\ntheoretical lower limit for neutron star birth masses, we perform 3D supernova\nsimulations for five stellar models close to the minimum mass for iron core\ncollapse. We obtain a record-low neutron star mass of $1.192\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$\nand a substantial kick of $\\mathord{\\sim} 100\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nGiven residual uncertainties in stellar evolution, a neutron star origin for\nthe $1.174\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ object remains plausible.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
