We propose several\nideas to improve the precision or speed of the estimation. Through experimental\ntests, we demonstrate that improved sampling can yield slightly better\nprecision. Moreover, additional precomputation results in faster estimations\nwith a modest increase in memory usage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s6SpV34zonjn8skUlv2QYtQQwT8QmyabTktJ2jahW80","pdfSize":"458256"}
