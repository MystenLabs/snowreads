Furthermore, low-aspect ratio wings exhibit a highly impactful tip\nvortex, which introduces strong spanwise gradients into an already complex\nflow. In this work, we explore the interaction between leading edge flow\nseparation and a strong, persistent tip vortex over a Reynolds number range of\n$600 \\leq Re \\leq 10,000$. In performing this study, we aim to bridge the\ninsight gained from existing low Reynolds number studies of separated flow on\nfinite wings ($Re \\approx 10^2$) and turbulent flows at higher Reynolds numbers\n($Re \\approx 10^4$). Our study suggests two primary effects of Reynolds number.\nFirst, we observe a break from periodicity, along with a dramatic increase in\nthe intensity and concentration of small-scale eddies, as we shift from $Re =\n600$ to $Re = 2,500$. Second, we observe that many of our flow diagnostics,\nincluding the time-averaged aerodynamic force, exhibit reduced sensitivity to\nReynolds number beyond $Re = 2,500$, an observation attributed to the\nstabilizing impact of the wing tip vortex. This latter point illustrates the\nmanner by which the tip vortex drives flow over low-aspect-ratio wings, and\nprovides insight into how our existing understanding of this flowfield may be\nadjusted for higher Reynolds number applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
