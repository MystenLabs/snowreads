Both schemes are\ndecoupled, linear, second-order in time, and the numerical implementation turns\nout to be straightforward. The first scheme solves the Navier-Stokes equations\nin a saddle point formulation, while the second one employs the artificial\ncompressibility method, leading to a fully decoupled structure with a\ntime-independent pressure update equation. In terms of computational cost, only\na sequence of independent elliptic or saddle point systems needs to be solved\nat each time step. At a theoretical level, the unique solvability and\nunconditional energy stability (with respect to a modified energy functional)\nof the proposed schemes are established. In addition, comprehensive numerical\nsimulations are performed to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the\nproposed schemes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
