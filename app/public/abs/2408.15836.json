We present Knowledge Navigator, a system\ndesigned to enhance exploratory search abilities by organizing and structuring\nthe retrieved documents from broad topical queries into a navigable, two-level\nhierarchy of named and descriptive scientific topics and subtopics. This\nstructured organization provides an overall view of the research themes in a\ndomain, while also enabling iterative search and deeper knowledge discovery\nwithin specific subtopics by allowing users to refine their focus and retrieve\nadditional relevant documents. Knowledge Navigator combines LLM capabilities\nwith cluster-based methods to enable an effective browsing method. We\ndemonstrate our approach's effectiveness through automatic and manual\nevaluations on two novel benchmarks, CLUSTREC-COVID and SCITOC. Our code,\nprompts, and benchmarks are made publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"bH4tUFCu-L7jW_59W6b71Cbl-_j-nu_-evJXSSXuIHI","pdfSize":"1302211"}
