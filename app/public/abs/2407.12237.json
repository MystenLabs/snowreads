The end-to-end\ndelay from the sub-millisecond-level to the second-level is first put forward\nfor a wide range of delay-sensitive tasks in the future sixth generation (6G)\ncommunication networks, which imposes a strict requirement on satisfying\nvarious real-time services and applications with different stringent quality of\nservice (QoS) demands. Thus, we need to find out new delay reduction framework\nto satisfy the more stringent delay requirements. In this article, a\nstate-of-the-art overview of end-to-end delay composition and delay analysis\ncombined with access protocols are elaborated. We reveal the tradeoff\nrelationship among transmission delay, queuing delay, and retransmission times\nwith the change of blocklength in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Based on\nthe tradeoff and combining the grant-free (GF) random access (RA) scheme, we\npropose the adaptive blocklength framework and investigate several effective\nalgorithms for efficiently reducing the over-the-air delay. Numerical results\nshow that our proposed framework and schemes can significantly reduce the\nover-the-air delay for URLLC.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
