The two planets are near 2:1 period\ncommensurability, resulting in significant transit timing variations (TTVs) for\nboth planets and transit duration variations (TDVs) for the inner planet. The\nTTV amplitude for TOI-1408 c is 15% of the planet's orbital period, marking the\nlargest TTV amplitude relative to the orbital period measured to date.\nPhotodynamical modeling of ground-based radial velocity (RV) observations and\ntransit light curves obtained with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\n(TESS) and ground-based facilities leads to an inner planet radius of\n$2.22\\pm0.06\\,R_\\oplus$ and mass of $7.6\\pm0.2\\,M_\\oplus$ that locates the\nplanet into the Sub-Neptune regime. The proximity to the 2:1 period\ncommensurability leads to the libration of the resonant argument of the inner\nplanet. The RV measurements support the existence of a third body with an\norbital period of several thousand days. This discovery places the system among\nthe rare systems featuring a hot Jupiter accompanied by an inner low-mass\nplanet.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
