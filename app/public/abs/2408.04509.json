We ask whether desirable\nproperties can be ensured under opacity in a robust sense. A property can be\nguaranteed under an opaque announcement if every mechanism compatible with it\nsatisfies the property. We find an impossibility result: strategy-proofness\ncannot be guaranteed under any level of opacity. In contrast, in some\nenvironments, weak Maskin monotonicity and non-bossiness can be guaranteed\nunder opacity.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gY98szp_iTPMTw13XbjRFvIMhb81udRwMBwlhHsVNz8","pdfSize":"178575"}
