Recent developments in\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence hold transformative promise for addressing\nthis longstanding problem. This work investigates the use of Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) and its internal representation to generate periodic orbits.\nWe utilize a comprehensive dataset of periodic orbits in the Circular\nRestricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) to train deep-learning architectures that\ncapture key orbital characteristics, and we set up physical evaluation metrics\nfor the generated trajectories. Through this investigation, we seek to enhance\nthe understanding of how Generative AI can improve space mission planning and\nastrodynamics research, leading to novel, data-driven approaches in the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r0d_WlzxqN4HiUhRaprGUwfYHpQjgymgqEevL_ITIbI","pdfSize":"879847"}
