The latter contains a mixture of molecules with\nmolecularly different structures.Inspired by the \"chemical space\"concept, I\nrecently reported a study of the single-molecule mixture state that combines\nmodel construction and mathematical analysis,obtaining some interesting\nresults.(Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024,25,7571.) In this preprint,a detailed\ndiscussion of the concept of \"single-molecule mixture\" has been provided.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
