The resulting pairwise interactions, combined with\nthe confining nature of motion in anti-de Sitter spacetime, are expected to\nlead to classical chaos. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the\nemergence of a chaotic classical limit on the gravity side has important\nimplications for the dual three-dimensional conformal field theory, including\nthat the spectrum of conformal primary operators at strong coupling should\nexhibit level repulsion in line with the Wigner surmise.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
