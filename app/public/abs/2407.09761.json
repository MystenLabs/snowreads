Moreover, the data are usually not in a conventional format since\nadministrative databases are created and maintained to serve non-research\npurposes and only information for people who seek health services is\naccessible. Analysis of administrative health data is thus challenging in\ngeneral. In the MHED data analyses, we are particularly concerned with (i)\nevaluating dynamic patterns and impacts with doubly-censored recurrent event\ndata, and (ii) re-calibrating estimators developed based on truncated data by\nleveraging summary statistics from the population. The findings are verified\nempirically via simulation. We have established the asymptotic properties of\nthe inference procedures. The contributions of this paper are twofold. We\npresent innovative strategies for processing doubly-censored recurrent event\ndata, and overcoming the truncation induced by the data collection. In\naddition, through exploring the pediatric MHED visit records, we provide new\ninsights into children/youths mental health changes over time.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
