We provide a sufficient and\nnecessary condition for the existence of undesirable equilibria and show that\nthe Jacobian matrix of the closed-loop system evaluated at an undesirable\nequilibrium always has a nonpositive eigenvalue. In the special case of linear\nplanar systems and ellipsoidal obstacles, we give a complete characterization\nof the dynamical properties of the corresponding closed-loop system. We show\nthat for underactuated systems, the safety filter always introduces a single\nundesirable equilibrium, which is a saddle-point. We prove that all\ntrajectories outside the global stable manifold of such equilibrium converge to\nthe origin. In the fully actuated case, we discuss how the choice of nominal\ncontroller affects the stability properties of the closed-loop system. Various\nsimulations illustrate our results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
