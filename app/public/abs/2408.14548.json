Considering DM relic to be generated via the thermal freeze-out, we check\nthe discovery prospects at future lepton colliders via mono-photon plus missing\nenergy searches. The right chiral parts of light Dirac neutrinos get\nthermalised due to their interactions with the bath as well as leptophilic DM,\nleading to enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\\rm eff}$\nwithin reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The\ninterplay of existing bounds from cosmological observations related to DM relic\nand $N_{\\rm eff}$, direct and indirect detection of DM, astrophysics and\ncollider observations leave promising discovery prospects at future electron\nand muon colliders along with complementary signatures at future CMB\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"60hX6vLpTVZeJfYqkSj5J3kA1bXU7gkrH8a0jXnmZAI","pdfSize":"3095869"}
