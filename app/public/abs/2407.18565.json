As the energy gap becomes smaller, the interband transition\nprobability becomes larger at the band edges. We found the divergence of the\nshift current response in a manner proportional to the inverse of the gap size\nwhen the system becomes a two-dimensional Weyl semimetal in the gapless limit.\nThis behavior is different from that for electric polarization, which has a\njump across the gapless case. It means that the quantitative relationship\nbetween electric polarizations and shift currents is broken in this gapless\nlimit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
