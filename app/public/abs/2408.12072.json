A\nparticularly challenging aspect of this endeavor is preservation of complex\nphysics analyses, selected for their scientific importance and the value of the\nspecific techniques developed as a part of the research. For this, we have\nchosen one of the most impactful PHENIX results, the joint study of direct\nphotons and neutral pions in high-energy d+Au collisions. To ensure\nreproducibility of this analysis going forward, we partitioned it into\nself-contained tasks and used a combination of containerization techniques,\ncode management, and robust documentation. We then leveraged REANA (the\nplatform for reproducible analysis developed at CERN) to run the required\nsoftware. We present our experience based on this example, and outline our\nfuture plans for analysis preservation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
