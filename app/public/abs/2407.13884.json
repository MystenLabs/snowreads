We apply this result to the Poisson equation $-\\Delta u =\n\\operatorname*{div} F$ with zero boundary conditions in a bounded $C^1$ domain\nto show that $u\\in BMO^{\\beta}$ when $F$ is in weak-$L^n$. Next, we consider\nthe $n$-Laplace equation \\begin{align*} -\\operatorname*{div}( |\\nabla U|^{n-2}\n\\nabla U) &= F \\text{ in } \\Omega, \\newline\n  U &=0 \\text{ on }\\partial \\Omega. \\end{align*} with $F\\in L^1(\\Omega)$ and\nshow that the classical result $u\\in BMO$ can be improved to $u\\in BMO^\\beta$.\nFinally, we consider the $n$-Laplace equation in the case when $F \\in L^1$,\n$\\operatorname*{div} F=0$ and prove that for smooth domains $\\Omega$ we have\nthe estimate \\begin{align*} \\|\\nabla U \\|_{L^n} \\mathbb \\leq C \\,\n\\|F\\|^{1/(n-1)}_{L^1}, \\end{align*} where the constant $C$ is independent of\n$F$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
