However, when\ndetecting anomalies, the representations of abnormal nodes are prone to be\naveraged by normal neighbors, making the learned anomaly representations less\ndistinguishable. To tackle this issue, we propose CAGAD -- an unsupervised\nCounterfactual data Augmentation method for Graph Anomaly Detection -- which\nintroduces a graph pointer neural network as the heterophilic node detector to\nidentify potential anomalies whose neighborhoods are normal-node-dominant. For\neach identified potential anomaly, we design a graph-specific diffusion model\nto translate a part of its neighbors, which are probably normal, into anomalous\nones. At last, we involve these translated neighbors in GNN neighborhood\naggregation to produce counterfactual representations of anomalies. Through\naggregating the translated anomalous neighbors, counterfactual representations\nbecome more distinguishable and further advocate detection performance. The\nexperimental results on four datasets demonstrate that CAGAD significantly\noutperforms strong baselines, with an average improvement of 2.35% on F1, 2.53%\non AUC-ROC, and 2.79% on AUC-PR.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
