Numerous plots show the\ndifferences in spatial and velocity distributions as well as distributions in\nkinetic energy vs. angular momentum (KE vs. LZ) space. In the latter plots,\nyoung, thin disk stars on nearly circular orbits cling to the left edge of a\nso-called solar parabola, while older objects on elliptical orbits fill the\ncentral parabolic region. Some of the young Wolf-Rayet stars violate this trend\ndue to smaller semi-major axes than the Sun or orbital eccentricities.\nDeviation of the vertex of the velocity ellipsoid is discussed as an indication\nof population and youth, with an emphasis on Ap, Bp, Am, Fm, Herbig AeBe, and\nlambda Boo stars. Both the vertex deviation and phase space distribution\nprovide useful insights.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
