First we prove that in two dimensional\nbounded domains there exists a unique global classical solution which is\nuniformly bounded in time, and then we show that if the concentration of\nchemoattractant on the boundary is sufficiently low then the solution converges\nto the positive steady state as time goes to infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
