Here, we show how reinforcement learning methods can be applied to\nsolve optimization problems in the context of radiative heat transfer. We\nillustrate their use with the optimization of the near-field radiative heat\ntransfer between multilayer hyperbolic metamaterials. Specifically, we show how\nthis problem can be formulated in the language of reinforcement learning and\ntackled with a variety of algorithms. We show that these algorithms allow us to\nfind solutions that outperform those obtained using physical intuition.\nOverall, our work shows the power and potential of reinforcement learning\nmethods for the investigation of a wide variety of problems in the context of\nradiative heat transfer and related topics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
