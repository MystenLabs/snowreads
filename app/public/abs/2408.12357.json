For\nsmall rotation rates of the drum, the lubrication film beneath the drop adopted\na steady shape, while at higher rotation rates, travelling waves propagated\nalong the drop's lower surface with roughly half the wall velocity. We here\nrationalize the physical origin of these waves. We begin with a simplified\nmodel of the lubrication flow beneath the droplet, and examine the linear\nstability of this base state to perturbations of the Tollmien--Schlichting\ntype. Our developments lead to the Orr-Sommerfeld equation (OSE), whose\neigenvalues give the growth rates and phase speeds of the perturbations. By\nconsidering wavelengths long relative to the lubrication film thickness, we\nsolve the OSE perturbatively and so deduce the wavelength and phase velocity of\nthe most unstable mode. We find satisfactory agreement between experiment and\ntheory over the parameter regime considered in the laboratory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1Ad9X7v06GwgPC5E7GH9KtzNLxnBuLzfld6tYbB0_u0","pdfSize":"5856912"}
