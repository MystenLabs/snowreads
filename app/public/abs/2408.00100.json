The stress-strength probability\nbetween X and Y is calculated explicitly when the respective scale parameters\nare equal. Two applications of the ratio distribution are discussed.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
