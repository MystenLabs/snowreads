For Drinfeld modular forms, the $\\mathbb{C}_{\\infty}$-pairing is\nprovided by the first coefficient of their $t$-expansion at infinity. For\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-valued harmonic cochains, the $\\mathbb{Z}$-pairing is given by\ntheir Fourier coefficient with respect to the trivial ideal. We prove that,\ncontrarily to classical cusp forms, both pairings in weight $2$ are not perfect\nin a quite general setting, namely for the congruence subgroup\n$\\Gamma_0(\\mathfrak{n})$ with any prime ideal $\\mathfrak{n}$ in\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q}[T]$ of degree $\\geq 5$. We show it by exhibiting a common\nelement of the Hecke algebra in the kernels of both pairings and proving that\nit is non-zero using computations with modular symbols over\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q}(T)$. Finally we present computational data on other kernel\nelements of these pairings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
