It combines control theory\ntechniques and Galerkin approximation, inspired by Hale-Raugel, to prove that\nanalyticity in time can be propagated for the nonlinear equation from a zone\nwhere linear observability holds towards the full space.For semilinear wave\nequations with Dirichlet boundary condition on a bounded domain, this implies\nthat analyticity can be propagated to the entire domain from a subset $\\omega$\nthat satisfies the geometric control condition. It also implies the unique\ncontinuation when the solution is assumed to be zero on $\\omega$. When the\nnonlinearity is assumed to be subcritical and defocusing, we also obtain\nobservability estimates in the optimal time of the geometric control\ncondition.For semilinear plate equations, similar propagation of analyticity is\nachieved by assuming the controllability of the linear Schr\\''odinger equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
