Using this framework, we provide a first-principle derivation\nof the canonical generators associated with these symmetries starting from the\nPoisson BF twistor action for self-dual gravity. We express these charges as\nsurface integrals over the celestial sphere in terms of spacetime data at null\ninfinity. The connection between twistor space and spacetime expressions at\n$\\mathscr{I}$ is achieved via an integral formula for the asymptotic Bianchi\nidentities due to Bramson and Tod. Finally, we clarify how $Lw_{1+\\infty}$\ntransformations are symmetries of gravity from a phase space perspective by\nshowing the invariance of the asymptotic Bianchi identities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
