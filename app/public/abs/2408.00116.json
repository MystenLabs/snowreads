We\nshow that, unlike the fixed time setting, in the limit of infinite time, the\nclassical and quantum capacities are characterized by efficiently computable\nproperties of the peripheral spectrum of the quantum channel. In addition, the\ncapacities are additive under tensor product, which implies in the language of\nShannon theory that the one-shot and the asymptotic i.i.d. capacities are the\nsame. We also provide an improved algorithm for computing the structure of the\nperipheral subspace of a quantum channel, which might be of independent\ninterest.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
