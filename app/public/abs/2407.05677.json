For attribute compression, however, they still\nlag behind non-learning-based methods such as the MPEG G-PCC standard. To\nbridge this gap, we propose a novel deep learning-based point cloud attribute\ncompression method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) with sparse\nconvolution layers. Our method also includes a module that adaptively selects\nthe resolution of the voxels used to voxelize the input point cloud. Sparse\nvectors are used to represent the voxelized point cloud, and sparse\nconvolutions process the sparse tensors, ensuring computational efficiency. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first application of GANs to compress\npoint cloud attributes. Our experimental results show that our method\noutperforms existing learning-based techniques and rivals the latest G-PCC test\nmodel (TMC13v23) in terms of visual quality.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
