We investigate three\ndifferent parameterizations of potential DDR violations. To bridge the gap\nbetween SGL and SNe Ia datasets, we implement an artificial neural network\n(ANN) approach to reconstruct the distance modulus of SNe Ia. Our analysis\nuniquely considers both scenarios where the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia\n($M_B$) is treated as a free parameter and where it is fixed to a\nCepheid-calibrated value. Using a sample of six SGL systems and the Pantheon+\nSNe Ia dataset, we find no statistically significant evidence for DDR\nviolations across all parameterizations. The consistency of our findings across\ndifferent parameterizations not only reinforces confidence in the standard DDR\nbut also demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
