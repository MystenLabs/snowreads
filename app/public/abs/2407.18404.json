As a matter of normalization they considered the family\n$\\mathcal{P}_n(K)$ of degree $n$ polynomials with all zeros lying in the given\nconvex, compact subset $K\\Subset {\\mathbb C}$. While Tur\\'an obtained the first\nresults for the interval $I:=[-1,1]$ and the disk $D:=\\{ z\\in {\\mathbb C}~:~\n|z|\\le 1\\}$, Er\\H{o}d extended investigations to other compact convex domains,\ntoo. The order of the optimal constant was found to be $\\sqrt{n}$ for $I$ and\n$n$ for $D$. It took until 2006 to clarify that all compact convex\n\\emph{domains} (with nonempty interior), follow the pattern of the disk, and\nadmit an order $n$ inequality.\n  For $L^q(\\partial K)$ norms with any $1\\le q <\\infty$ we obtained order $n$\nresults for various classes of domains. Further, in the generality of all\nconvex, compact domains we could show a $c n/\\log n$ lower bound together with\nan $O(n)$ upper bound for the optimal constant. Also, we conjectured that all\ncompact convex domains admit an order $n$ Tur\\'an type inequality. Here we\nprove this for all \\emph{polygonal} convex domains and any $0< q <\\infty$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
