One reason for this is the fact that most\npediatric diseases are also rare diseases (i.e., they fit the EU definition of\na rare condition, by affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 individuals), and\nindeed the majority of conditions under this umbrella heading are in fact much\nrarer, affecting fewer than 1 in 100,000. Rare pediatric diseases incur\nparticular challenges, both in terms of actually conducting clinical trials but\nalso planning trials (and indeed, stimulating the preclinical research and\nknowledge generation necessary to embark on clinical trials in the first\nplace). The pediatric regulation and orphan regulation (covering rare diseases)\nwere introduced to address the complexities in research and development of\nmedicines specifically for children and for people living with a rare disease,\nrespectively. The regulations have been reasonably effective, particularly in\nareas where adult and pediatric diseases overlap, driving the development of\nmore pediatric medicines; however, challenges still remain, often exacerbated\nby the rarity of the diseases. These include issues around trial planning, the\nneed for more innovative methodologies in smaller populations, significant\ndelays in trial start up and recruitment, recruitment issues (due to small\npopulations and the nature of the conditions), lack of endpoints, and scarce\ndata. This chapter will discuss some of the major challenges in delivering\ntrials in pediatric rare diseases while also assessing current and future\nsolutions to address these.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rx2JxYIpy3-C6_WFSDfQL5NeqUo14dlHFug___wu7DM","pdfSize":"904426"}
