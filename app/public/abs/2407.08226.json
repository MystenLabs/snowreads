Local wellposedness is known\nsince the work of Amann in the 90s, by a semi-group method. We revisit these\nresults in the context of Sobolev spaces modelled on L^2 and exemplify our\nmethod with the SKT system, showing the existence of local, non-negative,\nstrong solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
