We derive a functional\nequation for the Bartholdi zeta function $\\zeta_G(q,u)$ on a regular graph $G$\nwith respect to the bump parameter $u$. We also find an equivalence between the\nBartholdi zeta function with a specific value of $u$ and the Ihara zeta\nfunction at $u=0$. We determine bounds of the critical strip of $\\zeta_G(q,u)$\nfor a general graph. If $G$ is a $(t+1)$-regular graph, the bounds are\nsaturated and $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ and $q=(t+u)^{-1}$ are the poles at the boundaries\nof the critical strip for $u\\ne 1, -t$. When $G$ is the regular graph and the\nspectrum of the adjacency matrix satisfies a certain condition, $\\zeta_G(q,u)$\nsatisfies the so-called Riemann hypothesis. For $u \\ne 1$, $q=\\pm(1-u)^{-1}$\nare poles of $\\zeta_G(q,u)$ unless $G$ is tree. Although the order of the pole\nat $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ is $n_E-n_V+1$ if $u\\ne u_* \\equiv 1-\\frac{n_E}{n_V}$, it is\nenhanced at $u=u_*$. In particular, if the Moore-Penrose inverse of the\nincidence matrix $L^+$ and the degree vector $\\vec{d}$ satisfy the condition\n$|L^+ \\vec{d}|^2\\ne n_E$, the order of the pole at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ increases\nonly by one at $u=u_*$. The order of the pole at $q=-(1-u)^{-1}$ coincides with\nthat at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ if $G$ is bipartite and is $n_E-n_V$ otherwise.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
