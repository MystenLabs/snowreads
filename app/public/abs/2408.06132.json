We show that the geometric realisation of the nerve of\nthe transporter category of $e$-split Levi subgroups of a finite reductive\ngroup $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space\n$BG$ up to $\\ell$-completion. We suggest a generalisation of this equivalence\nto the setting of $\\mathbb{Z}_\\ell$-reflection cosets and establish a related\nfact involving the associated orbit spaces. We also establish a Dade-like\nformula for unipotent characters of $\\mathbb{Z}_\\ell$-spetses inspired by a\nquestion of Brou\\'e.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
