Then we characterized gapsets\nwhich leads to a more efficient computational approach towards numerical\nsemigroups and finally we introduce the extension of gapsets and prove that the\nsequence of the number of gapsets of size $g$ is non-decreasing as a weak\nversion of Bras-Amor\\'os's conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qIV4kXDuZZTh0KHdUgS0LRbrxHe9p8ZqnmPNuO0dlH0","pdfSize":"182643"}
