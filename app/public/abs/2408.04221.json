Signal-to-Noise diffusion models\nconstitute a diverse family covering most state-of-the-art diffusion models.\nWhile there have been several attempts to study Signal-to-Noise (S2N) diffusion\nmodels from various perspectives, there remains a need for a comprehensive\nstudy connecting different viewpoints and exploring new perspectives. In this\nstudy, we offer a comprehensive perspective on noise schedulers, examining\ntheir role through the lens of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its\nconnections to information theory. Building upon this framework, we have\ndeveloped a generalized backward equation to enhance the performance of the\ninference process.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
