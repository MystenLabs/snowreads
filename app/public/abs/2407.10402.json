Existing testing\ntools have limitations, potentially offering only single-functionality testing,\nthus failing to meet the requirements of QoS testing for edge cloud services in\nmobile satellite scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework for\nintegrating quality of service testing in satellite edge clouds. More\nprecisely, the framework can integrate changes in satellite network topology,\ncreate and manage satellite edge cloud cluster testing environments on\nheterogeneous edge devices, customize experiments for users, support deployment\nand scaling of various integrated testing tools, and publish and visualize test\nresults. Our experimental results validate the framework's ability to test key\nservice quality metrics in a satellite edge cloud cluster.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
