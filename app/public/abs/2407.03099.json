Based on our findings, we\ndefine the moduli space associated with its excursions. Subsequently, we\nutilize the framework we build to establish a discretized analog of the Riemann\nhypothesis (RH) that holds in a stronger sense from a dynamical perspective.\nThe analog is founded upon a reformulation of the RH, specifically in terms of\nestimates of L1-averages of BCZ cocycle along periodic orbits of the BCZ map.\nThe primary tool we will rely on is the generalized arithmetic sequence, which\nwe will define and discuss.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
