The LTS part\nis graded and made of two Nb3Sn Rutherford cables. Due to high sensitivity of\nHTS/LTS coils to large stresses and strains at high fields, a Stress Management\n(SM) concept combined with the cos-theta coil geometry is used. The results of\nmagnet magnetic analysis are presented and discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Oq8JCfkVP3oxbRdMcxYY3gy3fkgZQPns9Wvh9LHK5Sg","pdfSize":"861088"}
