As an archetypal example, we\nreveal the first noninvertible categorical gauge symmetry of topological orders\nin 2+1 dimensions: the Fibonacci gauge symmetry of the doubled Fibonacci\ntopological order, described by the Fibonacci fusion 2-category. Our approach\ninvolves two steps: first, establishing duality between different string-net\nmodels with Morita equivalent input fusion categories that describe the same\ntopological order; and second, constructing symmetry transformations within the\nsame string-net model when the dual models have isomorphic input fusion\ncategories, achieved by composing duality maps with isomorphisms of degrees of\nfreedom between the dual models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
