The paper will give an idea of the\nmissile detection technologies using the electro-optical sensor and the pulse\ndoppler radar. The system is made to detect the target missile. Automatic\ndetection and destruction with the help of ultrasonic sonar, a metal detector\nsensor, and a smoke detector sensor. The system is mainly based on an\nultrasonic sonar sensor. It has a transducer, a transmitter, and a receiver.\nTransducer is connected with the connected with controller. When it detects an\nobject by following the algorithm, it finds its distance and angle. It can also\nassure whether the system can destroy the object or not by using another\nalgorithm's simulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IoqKU2ki9pX-UyRuZ3fH3mrWaArzzks7HMH154fehPU","pdfSize":"3155911"}
