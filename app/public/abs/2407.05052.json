Previous research mostly ignores the correlation between\nsensors and assumes independent or known distributions. However, in practice,\nthese distributions are often correlated and difAcult to estimate. This paper\nproposes a novel moment constrained marginal distributionally robust Kalman\nAlter (MC-MDRKF) for centralized state estimation in multi-sensor systems.\nFirst, we introduce a marginal distributional uncertainty set using a\nmoment-constrained approach, which can better capture the uncertainties of\nGaussian noises compared to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based methods.\nBased on that, a minimax optimization problem is formulated to identify the\nleast favorable joint distribution and the optimal MMSE estimator thereunder.\nIt is proved that this problem can be reformulated as a convex optimization\nproblem, allowing for efficient solution Anding. Subsequently, by accounting\nfor marginal distributional uncertainty within the state space model, the\nproposed MC-MDRKF is devised in a minimax approach. Simulation result\ndemonstrates the robustness and superiority of the proposed method in a\nmulti-sensor target tracking scenario.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
