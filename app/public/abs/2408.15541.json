Key areas of focus include photonic wavefront\nsensing and imaging, photonic interferometry and nulling, advanced chip\nfabrication methods, and the integration of spectroscopy and sensing onto\nphotonic chips. The role of single-mode fibres in reducing modal noise, and the\ndevelopment of photonic integral field units (IFUs) and arrayed waveguide\ngratings (AWGs) for high-resolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be\nexamined. As part of the Sydney regional-focus issue, this review aims to\ndetail some of the current technological achievements in this field as well as\nto discuss the future trajectory of astrophotonics, underscoring its potential\nto unlock important new astronomical discoveries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
