With the long axes of the islands\nperpendicular to the chain, the system allows for three uniform metastable\nstates: (1) tilted dipoles with magnetization at an oblique angle to the chain,\n(2) transverse dipoles with magnetization perpendicular to the chain, and (3)\nalternating transverse dipoles with no net magnetization. The uniform magnetic\nfield controls their stabilities and is analyzed for its ability to cause\ntransitions among the states. The energy and frequency eigenvalues are\ndetermined for small-amplitude traveling wave deviations of the dipoles. The\nresults are summarized in a phase diagram in the field/anisotropy plane, that\nhighlights the multistable properties of this type of system.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
