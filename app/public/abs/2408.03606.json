The introduction of N results in a reduction of\ngrain size by 40% and ~10-15% increased hardness and bending strength after\nHPT. Both materials showed strain hardening and plasticity after HPT even at\nthese strength levels over 1500 MPa which is induced by the saturated\nnanocrystalline state. Annealing at intermediate temperatures of 300-500\n{\\deg}C resulted in an additional increase of hardness and strength by ~20-40%,\ncompared to the HPT deformed state. This effect was ~10 % more pronounced in\nthe nitrogen alloyed CoCrNi that also showed better thermal stability. However,\nthe increase in strength after 500 {\\deg}C annealing was accompanied by a\ndrastic loss of ductility in both materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dXNi9JA-C-U7rJywYFq4BCFry6H2-ZO3eI9oXQqdcKU","pdfSize":"2901135"}
