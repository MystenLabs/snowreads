Using BRST cohomology\nmanipulations, the tree amplitude of two massless and one massive state is\nrewritten in terms of the pure spinor superspace kinematic expression of the\nmassless four-point amplitude at the ${\\alpha^\\prime}^2$ level. A\ngeneralization relating the partial $n$-point tree amplitudes with one massive\nstate and linear combinations of the ${\\alpha^\\prime}^2$ corrections to n+1\nmassless amplitudes is found and shown to be consistent with unitarity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
