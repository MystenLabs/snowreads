These shapes include representatives of oriented simplices,\ncubes, and positive opetopes, and are stable under operations including Gray\nproducts, joins, suspensions, and duals. We exhibit a cofibrantly generated\nmodel structure on diagrammatic sets, as well as two separate Quillen\nequivalences with the classical model structure on simplicial sets. We\nconstruct explicit sets of generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations,\nand prove that the model structure is monoidal with the Gray product of\ndiagrammatic sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
