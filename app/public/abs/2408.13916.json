The possible\nappearance of logarithmic functions besides power terms in the field expansions\nat the certain angles between a resistive half-plane and the faces of the wedge\nis indicated. It is shown that in the main terms of the electric or magnetic\nfield components perpendicular to the edge, logarithmic functions appear only\nin two particular cases: when a half-plane forms a straight angle with one of\nthe faces of the wedge, or when the external angle of the conducting wedge is a\nright one. Otherwise, the main terms of all components have a purely power\ncharacter and can be determined by the Meixner method. To confirm the\nefficiency of accounting for the found field distribution law, transversal wave\nnumbers of the dominant mode of a rectangular waveguide with a resistive film\nin a diagonal plane is calculated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i80_4wJBnR3H_w48ItABze9z46jyFkYVOAJBxrOLQnc","pdfSize":"487014"}
