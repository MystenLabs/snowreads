Unlike modern communications that provide\nbit-level security, the eaves-dropping of semantic communications poses a\nsignificant risk of potentially exposing intention of legitimate user. To\naddress this challenge, a novel deep neural network (DNN) enabled secure\nsemantic communication (DeepSSC) system is developed by capitalizing on\nphysical layer security. To balance the tradeoff between security and\nreliability, a two-phase training method for DNNs is devised. Particularly,\nPhase I aims at semantic recovery of legitimate user, while Phase II attempts\nto minimize the leakage of semantic information to eavesdroppers. The loss\nfunctions of DeepSSC in Phases I and II are respectively designed according to\nShannon capacity and secure channel capacity, which are approximated with\nvariational inference. Moreover, we define the metric of secure bilingual\nevaluation understudy (S-BLEU) to assess the security of semantic\ncommunications. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that DeepSSC achieves a\nsignificant boost to semantic security particularly in high signal-to-noise\nratio regime, despite a minor degradation of reliability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
