The same feature encoding method is not used for images of\ndifferent modalities. Before the model training, the image data is\npreprocessed, and the image is enhanced by random rotation processing,\nself-square graph equalization theory algorithm, and gamma transform, which\neffectively enhances the key feature learning. Finally, the fuzzy comprehensive\nevaluation method is used to combine the results of supervised training and\nunsupervised training, which can better solve the \"most similar\" problem that\nis difficult to quantify. At present, there are many unknown oracle-bone\ninscriptions waiting for us to crack. Contacting with the glyphs can provide\nnew ideas for cracking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
