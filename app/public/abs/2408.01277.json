Specifically, we prove that for a reduced Abelian $p$-group\n$G$ such that $p^{\\omega}G$ is Hopfian (in particular, is finite), the notions\nof relative Hopficity and ordinary Hopficity do coincide. We also show that if\n$G$ is a reduced Abelian $p$-group such that $p^{\\omega}G$ is bounded and\n$G/p^{\\omega}G$ is Hopfian, then $G$ is relatively Hopfian. This allows us to\nconstruct a reduced relatively Hopfian Abelian $p$-group $G$ with $p^{\\omega}G$\nan infinite elementary group such that $G$ is {\\bf not} Hopfian. In contrast,\nfor reduced torsion-free groups, we establish that the relative and ordinary\nHopficity are equivalent. Moreover, the mixed case is explored as well, showing\nthat the structure of both relatively and weakly Hopfian groups can be quite\ncomplicated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bYis6t-fb4sx60N3vsIVUVtirmd4eqFylUU27c9GT2A","pdfSize":"301229","txDigest":"GKLCtVbTuwUqo4NWHi2wxh6qH18D427b3qRb7ieXuFAe","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
