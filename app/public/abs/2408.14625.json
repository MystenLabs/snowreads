Calibrating such models\nagainst longitudinal data from screened cohorts is challenging, especially when\nfitting non-Markovian mixture models against individual-level data. Here, we\nconsider a family of semi-Markov mixture models of cancer natural history\nintroduce an efficient data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling\nalgorithm for fitting these models to individual-level screening and cancer\ndiagnosis histories. Our fully Bayesian approach supports rigorous uncertainty\nquantification and model selection through leave-one-out cross-validation, and\nit enables the estimation of screening-related overdiagnosis rates. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using synthetic data, showing\nthat the sampling algorithm efficiently explores the joint posterior\ndistribution of model parameters and latent variables. Finally, we apply our\nmethod to data from the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and estimate\nthe extent of breast cancer overdiagnosis associated with mammography\nscreening. The sampler and model comparison method are available in the R\npackage baclava.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
