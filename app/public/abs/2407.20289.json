We characterize four collective states on the space of\ncoupling parameters of the system: complete synchronization, generalized\nsynchronization, chimera states, and incoherence. We quantify the information\nexchange between the two neuron populations in chimera states. We have found a\nwell-defined direction of the flow of information in chimera states, from the\ndesynchronized population to the synchronized one. The incoherent population\nfunctions as a driver of the coherent neuron population in a chimera state.\nThis feature is independent of the population sizes or population partitions.\nOur results yield insight into the communication mechanisms arising in brain\nprocesses such as unihemispheric sleep and epileptic seizures that have been\nassociated to chimera states.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
