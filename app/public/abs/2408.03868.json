It offers a novel solution for monitoring, indexing, and\nvisualising resources. Sources are automatically monitored and added to a\nmanually curated database, ensuring the relevance of items to intelligence\nstudies. Curated outputs are stored in a group library on Zotero, an\nopen-source reference management tool. The metadata of items in Zotero is\nenriched with OpenAlex, an open access bibliographic database. Finally, outputs\nare listed and visualised on a Streamlit app, an open-source Python framework\nfor building apps. This paper aims to explain the Intelligence Studies Network\ndatabase and provide a detailed guide on data sources and the workflow. This\nstudy demonstrates that it is possible to create a specialised academic\ndatabase by using open source tools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hzeekDcpq9Z7oi5xew62pvgXL5jQ2-LZDacQukeuzkw","pdfSize":"419759"}
