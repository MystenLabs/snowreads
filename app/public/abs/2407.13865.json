Unlike methods that vectorize matrices as predictors that result in a\nlarge number of model parameters and unstable estimation, we propose a Bayesian\nmulti-index regression method, resulting in a projection-pursuit-type estimator\nthat leverages the structure of matrix-valued predictors. We establish the\nmodel identifiability conditions and impose a sparsity-inducing prior on the\nprojection directions for sparse sampling to prevent overfitting and enhance\ninterpretability of the parameter estimates. Posterior inference is conducted\nthrough Bayesian backfitting. The performance of the proposed method is\nevaluated through simulation studies and a case study investigating the\nrelationship between brain connectivity features and cognitive scores.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
