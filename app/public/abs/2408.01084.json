Recent research has been\ndeveloped to amplify contextual knowledge over the parametric knowledge of LLM\nwith contrastive decoding approaches. While these approaches could yield\ntruthful responses when relevant context is provided, they are prone to\nvulnerabilities when faced with noisy contexts. We extend the scope of previous\nstudies to encompass noisy contexts and propose adaptive contrastive decoding\n(ACD) to leverage contextual influence effectively. ACD demonstrates\nimprovements in open-domain question answering tasks compared to baselines,\nespecially in robustness by remaining undistracted by noisy contexts in\nretrieval-augmented generation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2UZwSJW7vfcY4FwIKBJBPIT_tNBkHv8xNTF8BMB9q2Q","pdfSize":"371036","txDigest":"cRaZn7UDiCt9iTYKnnT2doxE3zmFKb3bsdWoYFvUfcd","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
