We achieve these improvements through two optimizations. First, we\nconsider a different approach for estimating the elements of the S-matrix. This\napproach is appropriate in general for 1+1D and for certain low-energy elastic\ncollisions in higher dimensions. Second, we implement our approach using a\nseries of different fault-tolerant simulation algorithms for Hamiltonians\nformulated both in the field occupation basis and field amplitude basis. Our\nalgorithms are based on either second-order Trotterization or qubitization. The\ncost of Trotterization in occupation basis scales as $\\widetilde{O}(\\lambda N^7\n|\\Omega|^3/(M^{5/2} \\epsilon^{3/2})$ where $\\lambda$ is the coupling strength,\n$N$ is the occupation cutoff $|\\Omega|$ is the volume of the spatial lattice,\n$M$ is the mass of the particles and $\\epsilon$ is the uncertainty in the\nenergy calculation used for the $S$-matrix determination. Qubitization in the\nfield basis scales as $\\widetilde{O}(|\\Omega|^2 (k^2 \\Lambda +kM^2)/\\epsilon)$\nwhere $k$ is the cutoff in the field and $\\Lambda$ is a scaled coupling\nconstant. We find in both cases that the bounds suggest physically meaningful\nsimulations can be performed using on the order of $4\\times 10^6$ physical\nqubits and $10^{12}$ $T$-gates which corresponds to roughly one day on a\nsuperconducting quantum computer with surface code and a cycle time of 100 ns,\nplacing simulation of scalar field theory within striking distance of the gate\ncounts for the best available chemistry simulation results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ux9aYLEYKN3xgE94eJbObkx3FkM9qJ1nse-WeJDyxz4","pdfSize":"3225411","objectId":"0x7a52e1035bd78c06d52db3a4cf306322aa2577a5d6a2aabc39d0f4f4318699ce","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
