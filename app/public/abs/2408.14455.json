We also show that the\nstar graph $K_{1, n-1}$ with $n\\geq 3$ has a nonsymmetric CQF for all\nlabelings. Classifying all labeled trees with a symmetric CQF remains an open\nquestion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qmzgd11c1ZuoQ1XT32PAJm813eE1hC4OdcaT1j1gl3I","pdfSize":"192205"}
