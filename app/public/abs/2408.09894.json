Findings: By integrating\nconvolutional block attention modules into a deep neural network, our model\ndemonstrates high accuracy in detecting patients with rotator cuff tears,\nachieving an average AUC of 0.889 and an accuracy of 0.831. Meaning: This study\nvalidates the efficacy of our deep learning model to accurately detect rotation\ncuff tears from radiographs, offering a viable pre-assessment or alternative to\nmore expensive imaging techniques such as MRI.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
