We found that the gas\nmetallicity is on average closely aligned with the stellar metallicity in the\ncenters of intermediate-mass galaxies. Conversely, the difference is notably\nlarger within the center of massive galaxies. It reaches about -0.18~dex on\naverage for the most massive galaxies, while for low-mass galaxies, the gas\nmetallicity exhibits a slightly lower value than the stellar metallicity.\nMoreover, the most prominent instances of a reduced gas-phase metallicity in\nrelation to stellar metallicity were observed within the centers of massive red\ngalaxies with low specific star formation rates. Because of the absence of a\ncorrelation between the integral mass fraction of neutral gas and the disparity\nbetween gas and stellar metallicity, we suggest that the diminished gas-phase\nmetallicity in the centers of massive galaxies might be attributed to the\nreplenishment of gas-depleted central regions through processes such as radial\ngas flows or accretion from the circumgalactic medium rather than gas infall\nfrom the intergalactic medium.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
