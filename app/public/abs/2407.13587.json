In this paper we focus on hadronic decays of such a scalar in\nthe regime where QCD dynamics is nonperturbative, resulting, e.g., in decays to\npairs of pions or kaons, while also allowing for scalar couplings to the SM\nfermions to deviate from the Higgs-mixed light scalar limit. Representations of\nthe corresponding form factors can be obtained using dispersive techniques,\nhowever, several sources of uncertainty affect the final results. We reexamine\nthese decays, paying special attention to the quantification of uncertainties.\nFor the light Higgs-mixed scalar scenario, we compare our results with previous\nworks. For a general set of couplings of the light scalar to Standard Model\nfields, we provide a public code, {\\tt hipsofcobra}, to compute the decay\nwidths.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
