We first define an overarching\nproblem, Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP), which uses boolean matrices\nas an alternative computation to evaluate datalog programs. We develop two\nnovel BMLP modules for bottom-up inferences on linear dyadic recursive datalog\nprograms, and show how additional modules can extend this capability to compute\nboth linear and non-linear recursive datalog programs of arity two. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that these modules outperform general-purpose and\nspecialised systems by factors of 30x and 9x, respectively, when evaluating\nlarge programs with millions of facts. This boolean matrix approach\nsignificantly enhances the efficiency of datalog querying to support logic\nprogramming techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uQ-vcc4ZBs-vVyk9wrPGMhpY0HvzH-VTglMs-qazdO4","pdfSize":"485809"}
