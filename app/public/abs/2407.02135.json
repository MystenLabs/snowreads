{"id":"2407.02135","title":"The role of the effective range in strongly-interacting few-body systems","authors":"Lucas Madeira","authorsParsed":[["Madeira","Lucas",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2024 10:28:35 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-03","timestamp":1719916115000,"abstract":"  Strongly interacting systems appear in several areas of physics and are\ncharacterized by attractive interactions that can almost, or just barely,\nloosely bind two particles. Although this definition is made at the two-body\nlevel, this gives rise to fascinating effects in larger systems, including the\nso-called Efimov physics. In this context, the zero-range theory aims to\ndescribe low-energy properties based only on the scattering length. However,\nfor a broad range of physical applications, the finite range of the\ninteractions plays an important role. In this work, I discuss some aspects of\nfinite-range effects in strongly interacting systems. I present the zero-range\nand shapeless universalities in two-body systems with applications in atomic\nand nuclear physics. I derived an analytical expression for the $s$-wave\nbound-state spectrum of the modified P\\\"oschl-Teller potential for two\nparticles in three dimensions, which is compared with the approximations to\nillustrate their usefulness. Concerning three identical bosons, I presented a\ntrimer energy scaling function that explicitly includes the effective range.\nThe implications for larger systems are briefly discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
