We analyzed the near-infrared\nhigh-resolution transmission spectrum of a hot Saturn, HD 149026 b, taken using\nCARMENES spectrograph ($\\mathcal{R}\\sim80,400$). We found evidence of H$_2$O at\nan S/N of $\\sim$4.8. We also performed grid search using a Bayesian framework\nand constrained the orbital velocity $K_\\mathrm{p}$ and rest velocity\n$V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ to $158.17^{+8.31}_{-7.90}$ $\\mathrm{km\\ s}^{-1}$ and\n$2.57^{+0.54}_{-0.57}$ $\\mathrm{km\\ s}^{-1}$, respectively. Whilst the\nretrieved $K_\\mathrm{p}$ value is consistent with theoretical prediction, the\nretrieved $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ value is highly red-shifted ($>$3-$\\sigma$). This\nmight be an indication of either anomalous atmospheric dynamics at play or an\norbit with non-zero eccentricity. Additionally, we searched for HCN but no\nsuccessful detection has been made possibly due to the relatively low S/N\ndataset. The detection of H$_2$O and subsequent abundance retrieval, coupled\nwith analysis of other species such as CO at the $K$-band, for example, might\nhelp us to get some information about the atmospheric C/O ratio and\nmetallicity, which in turn could give us some insight into the planet formation\nscenario.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
