We demonstrate the capability to generate\nfrequency-entangled photon pairs in the left and right transmission lines,\nspecifically a superposition of two photon wavepackets at different\nfrequencies. The photon frequencies are determined by the energy detuning in\neach double quantum dot and by the nonlocal superconducting pairing amplitude,\nwhich results from the tunnel coupling with the superconducting nanocontact\nplaced between the two double quantum dots. The frequency entanglement of the\ntwo photons arises from the particle-hole coherent superposition involving the\ndelocalized entangled spin singlet. We also estimate an upper bound for the\nefficiency of entangled photon-pair generation, accounting for the presence of\nnon-radiative processes such as phonon emissions. Using parameters from\ncutting-edge circuit QED devices with quantum dots, our proposal is realistic\nand could be implemented with state-of-the-art microwave nanoscale engineering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
