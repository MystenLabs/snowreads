However, the combinatorial nature behind contact planning hinders\nthe applicability of such optimization problems on hardware. In this work, we\npresent a novel approach that optimizes gait sequences and respective timings\nfor legged robots in the context of optimization-based controllers through the\nuse of sampling-based methods and supervised learning techniques. We propose to\nbootstrap the search by learning an optimal value function in order to speed-up\nthe gait planning procedure making it applicable in real-time. To validate our\nproposed method, we showcase its performance both in simulation and on hardware\nusing a 22 kg electric quadruped robot. The method is assessed on different\nterrains, under external perturbations, and in comparison to a standard control\napproach where the gait sequence is fixed a priori.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PVJBKsvL4rDCO-mYkkXAcQPyr0_vHOcJZhjpEWAHsjE","pdfSize":"5003831"}
