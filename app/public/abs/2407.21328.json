However, challenges arise from the\nintricate variations in brain appearance due to rapid early brain development,\naging, and disorders, compounded by the limited availability of\nmanually-labeled datasets. In response, we present a two-step segmentation\nframework employing Knowledge-Guided Prompt Learning (KGPL) for brain MRI.\nSpecifically, we first pre-train segmentation models on large-scale datasets\nwith sub-optimal labels, followed by the incorporation of knowledge-driven\nembeddings learned from image-text alignment into the models. The introduction\nof knowledge-wise prompts captures semantic relationships between anatomical\nvariability and biological processes, enabling models to learn structural\nfeature embeddings across diverse age groups. Experimental findings demonstrate\nthe superiority and robustness of our proposed method, particularly noticeable\nwhen employing Swin UNETR as the backbone. Our approach achieves average DSC\nvalues of 95.17% and 94.19% for brain tissue and structure segmentation,\nrespectively.
