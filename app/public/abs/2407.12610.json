We see how\nits low temperature asymptotic behavior is affected by the topology. The\ncombination of the space dimension, which here is always 1, the boundary\ncondition (free or periodic), and the spin state $S^{N-1}$, determines the\nexistence or absence of non-trivial homotopy classes in some discrete version.\nSuch non-trivial topology reflects in bottlenecks of the dynamics, creating\nmetastable states that the system exits at exponential times; while when only\none homotopy class exists the relaxation time depends polynomially on the\ntemperature. We prove in the one dimensional case that, indeed, the relaxation\ntime is a proxy to the model's topological properties via the\nexponential/polynomial dependence on the temperature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
