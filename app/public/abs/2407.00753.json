This paper introduces FLY-TTS, a new fast, lightweight\nand high-quality speech synthesis system based on VITS. Specifically, 1) We\nreplace the decoder with ConvNeXt blocks that generate Fourier spectral\ncoefficients followed by the inverse short-time Fourier transform to synthesize\nwaveforms; 2) To compress the model size, we introduce the grouped\nparameter-sharing mechanism to the text encoder and flow-based model; 3) We\nfurther employ the large pre-trained WavLM model for adversarial training to\nimprove synthesis quality. Experimental results show that our model achieves a\nreal-time factor of 0.0139 on an Intel Core i9 CPU, 8.8x faster than the\nbaseline (0.1221), with a 1.6x parameter compression. Objective and subjective\nevaluations indicate that FLY-TTS exhibits comparable speech quality to the\nstrong baseline.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
