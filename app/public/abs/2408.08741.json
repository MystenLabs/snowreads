A wealth of SIDIS data is available especially\nfrom fixed-target experiments. Here we review our calculation for the NNLO\ncorrections to the full set of polarized and unpolarized SIDIS coefficient\nfunctions and present some selected analytical expressions. Our results enable\nfor the first time a fully consistent treatment of hadron fragmentation\nprocesses in polarized and unpolarized DIS at NNLO and provide the basis for\nstudies of hadron structure, hadron fragmentation and identified particle cross\nsections at colliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
