To address these challenges, the methodology for power dispatch (PD)\nbased on traction station clusters (TSCs) in FTPSS is proposed, in which each\nTSC with a consistent structure performs independent local phase angle control.\nFirst, to simplify the PD problem of TSCs, the system is transformed into an\nequivalent model with constant topology, resulting in it can be solved by\nunivariate numerical optimization with higher computational performance. Next,\nthe calculation method of the feasible phase angle domain under strict and\nrelaxed power circulation constraints are described, respectively, which\nensures that power circulation can be either eliminated or precisely\ncontrolled. Finally, the PD method with three unique modes for uncertain train\nloads is introduced to enhance power flow flexibility: specified power\ndistribution coefficients between traction substations (TSs), constant output\npower of TSs, and maximum consumption of renewable resources within TSs. In the\nexperimental section, the performance of the TSC methodology for PD is verified\nthrough detailed train operation scenarios.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
