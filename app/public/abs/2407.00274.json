However, many students regard quantum mechanics as a\nparticularly challenging subject, in part because it is considered very\nmathematical and abstract. One potential way to help students understand and\ncontextualize unintuitive quantum ideas is to provide them opportunities to\nwork with physical apparatus demonstrating these phenomena. In order to\nunderstand how working with quantum experiments affects students' reasoning, we\nperformed think-aloud lab sessions of two pairs of students as they worked\nthrough a sequence of quantum optics experiments that demonstrated\nparticle-wave duality of photons. Analyzing the in-the-moment student thinking\nallowed us to identify the resources students activated while reasoning through\nthe experimental evidence of single-photon interference, as well as student\nideas about what parts of the experiments were quantum versus classical. This\nwork will aid instructors in helping their students construct an understanding\nof these topics from their own ideas and motivate future investigations into\nthe use of hands-on opportunities to facilitate student learning about quantum\nmechanics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
