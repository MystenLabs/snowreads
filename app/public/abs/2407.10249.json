We break away from\nthe traditional question that asks for a hopset that achieves small $|H|$ and\ninstead study its sensitivity, a new quality measure which, informally, is the\nmaximum number of times a vertex (or edge) is bypassed by an edge in $H$. The\nhighlights of our results are:\n  (i) $(\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}),0)$-hopsets on undirected graphs with $O(\\log\nn)$ sensitivity, complemented with a lower bound showing that\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ is tight up to polylogarithmic factors for any\nconstruction with polylogarithmic sensitivity.\n  (ii) $(n^{o(1)},\\varepsilon)$-hopsets on undirected graphs with $n^{o(1)}$\nsensitivity for any $\\varepsilon > 0$ that is at least inverse polylogarithmic,\ncomplemented with a lower bound on the tradeoff between $\\beta, \\varepsilon$,\nand the sensitivity.\n  (iii) $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$-shortcut sets on directed graphs with $O(\\log\nn)$ sensitivity, complemented with a lower bound showing that $\\beta =\n\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ for any construction with polylogarithmic\nsensitivity.\n  We believe hopset sensitivity is a natural measure in and of itself, and\ncould potentially find use in a diverse range of contexts. More concretely, the\nnotion of hopset sensitivity is also directly motivated by the Differentially\nPrivate All Sets Range Queries problem. Our result for $O(\\log n)$ sensitivity\n$(\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}),0)$-hopsets on undirected graphs immediately improves\nthe current best-known upper bound on utility from $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ to\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ in the pure-DP setting, which is tight up to\npolylogarithmic factors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
