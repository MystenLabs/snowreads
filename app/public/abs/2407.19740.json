DialAM-2024 is a shared task focusing on dialogical argument\nmining, which requires us to identify argumentative relations and illocutionary\nrelations among proposition nodes and locution nodes. To accomplish this, we\npropose a two-stage pipeline, which includes the Two-Step S-Node Prediction\nModel in Stage 1 and the YA-Node Prediction Model in Stage 2. We also augment\nthe training data in both stages and introduce context in Stage 2. We\nsuccessfully completed the task and achieved good results. Our team Pokemon\nranked 1st in the ARI Focused score and 4th in the Global Focused score.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
