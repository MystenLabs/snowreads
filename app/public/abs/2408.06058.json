It is shown that if, under\nthe influence of external pressure, the membrane-substrate separation drops to\nbelow 100 nm, the Casimir force makes a profound effect onthe sensor\nfunctioning. There exists the maximum value of external pressure depending on\nthe sensor parameters such that it finds itself in a state of unstable\nequilibrium. For this and larger pressures, the Casimir force leads to a\ncollapse of the sensor, which loses its functionality. For any smaller external\npressures, there exist two equilibrium positions, one of which is unstable and\nanother one is stable, at smaller and larger membrane-substrate separations,\nrespectively. The latter can be safely used for the pressure measurements.\nPossible applications of the {obtained} results in the design of micro- and\nnanoelectromechanical pressure sensors of next generations with further\ndecreased dimensions are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
