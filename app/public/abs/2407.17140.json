RT-DETRv2 builds upon the previous state-of-the-art\nreal-time detector, RT-DETR, and opens up a set of bag-of-freebies for\nflexibility and practicality, as well as optimizing the training strategy to\nachieve enhanced performance. To improve the flexibility, we suggest setting a\ndistinct number of sampling points for features at different scales in the\ndeformable attention to achieve selective multi-scale feature extraction by the\ndecoder. To enhance practicality, we propose an optional discrete sampling\noperator to replace the grid_sample operator that is specific to RT-DETR\ncompared to YOLOs. This removes the deployment constraints typically associated\nwith DETRs. For the training strategy, we propose dynamic data augmentation and\nscale-adaptive hyperparameters customization to improve performance without\nloss of speed.
