Starting from statistical and classical\nmachine learning based crime prediction methods, in recent years researchers\nhave focused on exploiting deep learning based models for crime prediction.\nDeep learning based crime prediction models use complex architectures to\ncapture the latent features in the crime data, and outperform the statistical\nand classical machine learning based crime prediction methods. However, there\nis a significant research gap in existing research on the applicability of\ndifferent models in different real-life scenarios as no longitudinal study\nexists comparing all these approaches in a unified setting. In this paper, we\nconduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of all major state-of-the-art\ndeep learning based crime prediction models. Our evaluation provides several\nkey insights on the pros and cons of these models, which enables us to select\nthe most suitable models for different application scenarios. Based on the\nfindings, we further recommend certain design practices that should be taken\ninto account while building future deep learning based crime prediction models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
