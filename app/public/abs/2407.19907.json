A novel methodology to\njointly learn CBFs and corresponding safe controllers, in simulation, inspired\nby the State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) is proposed. The CBF is used to\nobtain admissible commands from any nominal, possibly unsafe controller. An\napproach to apply the CBF inside a safety filter without the need for a\nconsistent map or position estimate is developed. Subsequently, the resulting\nreactive safety filter is deployed on a multirotor platform integrating a LiDAR\nsensor both in simulation and real-world experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
