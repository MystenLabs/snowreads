In particular, it discusses how the thermodynamics of\ndiscrete vortices in a two-dimensional (thin three-dimensional boundary) layer\ndrives the creation of ``hairpins,'' their two-dimensional rearrangement, and\nstretching of vorticity in the vertical direction inside a turbulent boundary\nlayer that leads to a tornado-like flow. Turbulence of that process is analyzed\nwith the help of the vortex filament model and its connection to the fluid flow\nequations via the Hasimoto and Madelung transforms of the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Finally, a formula for the\nnon-equilibrium entropy flux associated with the development of two-dimensional\nturbulence in the boundary layer is provided.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
