The\ncomplex interactions among multiple parties/ agents involve various abilities\nlike social reasoning, negotiation arts, and long-term strategy planning.\nPrevious AI agents surely have proved their capability of handling multi-step\ngames and larger action spaces on tasks involving multiple agents. However,\ndiplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially\nconsidering the negotiation stage required. Recently, LLM agents have shown\ntheir potential for extending the boundary of previous agents on a couple of\napplications, however, it is still not enough to handle a very long planning\nperiod in a complex multi-agent environment. Empowered with cutting-edge LLM\ntechnology, we make the first stab to explore AI's upper bound towards a\nhuman-like agent for such a highly comprehensive multi-agent mission by\ncombining three core and essential capabilities for stronger LLM-based societal\nagents: 1) strategic planner with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented\nnegotiate with social reasoning; 3) augmenting memory by self-play games to\nself-evolving without any human in the loop.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
