Thanks to the enhanced sensitivity\nof this transition to the variation of fundamental constants, we find that\npossible realisations of such an experiment deploying either single ions or\nclouds of atoms have the potential to be complementary to advanced\nvery-long-baseline terrestrial clock atom interferometers in the search for\nultra-light dark matter with scalar couplings to photons. Nuclear\ninterferometry may also offer an unparalleled window to new physics coupling to\nthe QCD sector via quarks or gluons, with a discovery reach that could enhance\nexisting and proposed experiments over a range of frequencies in the direction\nof well-motivated parameter space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
