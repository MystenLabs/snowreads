Here we construct a model of $1/f$ noise from individual\nfluctuators and determine the dephasing time $T_2^*$ as a function of qubit\nproperties. $T_2^*$ decreases with increasing magnetic field and is an order of\nmagnitude longer for out-of-plane than for in-plane fields for the same Zeeman\nenergy. $T_2^*$ shows little variation as a function of the top gate field and\nis a complex function of the dot radius. Our results should help experiments to\nenhance coherence in hole qubit architectures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
