To minimize the length of a global round in\nhierarchical federated learning with equal bandwidth allocation, we formulate a\ncombinatorial optimization problem. We design the twin sorting dynamic\nprogramming (TSDP) algorithm that obtains a globally optimal solution in\npolynomial time when there are two edge servers. In addition, we put forward\nthe TSDP-assisted algorithm for user association when there are three or more\nedge servers. Furthermore, given a user association matrix, we formulate and\nsolve a convex optimization problem for optimal wireless bandwidth allocation.\nSimulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms a number of\nalternative schemes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
