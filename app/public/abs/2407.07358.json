By applying a graph decomposition scheme to an undirected\nProbabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) built from the training dataset, our method\ngenerates node clusters encoding conditional dependence between training\nsamples. Biasing sampling towards more important clusters allows smaller\nmini-batches and training datasets, improving training speed and accuracy. We\nadditionally fuse an efficient robustness metric with residual losses to\ndetermine regions requiring additional sampling. Experiments demonstrate the\nadvantages of the proposed framework, achieving $3\\times$ faster convergence\ncompared to prior state-of-the-art sampling methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eLM_urIYAvvf_gCg04GiYO_cM5HOapCUDaHknnO6J54","pdfSize":"1359004"}
