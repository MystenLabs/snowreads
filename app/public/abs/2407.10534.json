However, conflicts arising from\ndifferent label spaces among datasets may adversely affect model performance.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically construct a unified\nlabel space across multiple datasets using graph neural networks. This enables\nsemantic segmentation models to be trained simultaneously on multiple datasets,\nresulting in performance improvements. Unlike existing methods, our approach\nfacilitates seamless training without the need for additional manual\nreannotation or taxonomy reconciliation. This significantly enhances the\nefficiency and effectiveness of multi-dataset segmentation model training. The\nresults demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other\nmulti-dataset training methods when trained on seven datasets simultaneously,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WildDash 2 benchmark.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
