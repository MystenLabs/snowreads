By studying the\nthreshold corrections to the coupling of the heterotic gauge groups, we infer\nthe existence of a strong coupling singularity for one of the perturbative\nheterotic gauge groups, which effectively yields an additional finite distance\nboundary of the classical scalar field space. In heterotic M-theory, this\nboundary maps to a domain wall solution for which the gauge coupling and the\nwarp factor on one of the Horava-Witten 9-branes diverge, thus highlighting the\ngravitational origin of the classical strong coupling singularity. The\ndivergence of the warp factor is, however, regulated once non-perturbative\neffects are taken into account, as we demonstrate by studying the instanton\ncorrections to the 5d BPS domain wall equations. This regularization implies\nthat the classical strong coupling boundary of the scalar field 4d\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ heterotic/M-theory is resolved, indicating that, at the quantum\nlevel, the field space can be extended beyond this classical boundary.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
