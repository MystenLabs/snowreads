I show that, in simple and staggered adoption designs,\nestimators from Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) can be disaggregated into dynamic\ntreatment effect estimators, comparing the lagged outcome differentials of\ntreated and synthetic controls to their pre-treatment average. Estimators\npresented in this note can be computed using the sdid_event Stata package.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
