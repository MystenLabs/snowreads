Namely, we prove that a sequence $x_n$ is uniformly distributed\nmodulo 1 if it is weakly monotonic and satisfies the conditions $\\Delta^2x_n\\to\n0,\\quad n^2\\Delta^2x_n\\to \\infty $. Our proof is straightforward and uses a\nDiophantine approximation by rational numbers, while van der Corput's approach\nis based on some estimates of exponential sums.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
