The study is restricted to canonical (nonphantom) versions of\nthe theories and scalar fields without a self-interaction potential. Only\nradial (monopole) perturbations are considered as the most likely ones to cause\nan instability. The static background solutions contain naked singularities,\nbut we formulate the boundary conditions in such a way that would preserve\ntheir meaning if a singularity is smoothed, for example, due to quantum gravity\neffects. Since the solutions of all STT under study are related by conformal\ntransformations, the stability problem for all of them reduces to the same wave\nequation, but the boundary conditions for perturbations (and sometimes the\nboundaries themselves) are different in different STT, which affects the\nstability results. The stability or instability conclusions are obtained for\ndifferent branches of the solutions in the Brans-Dicke, Barker and Schwinger\nSTT as well as for nonminimally coupled scalar fields with an arbitrary\nparameter $\\xi$ in the GR framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
