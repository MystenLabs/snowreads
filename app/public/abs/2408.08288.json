This will\nrequire thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar\nnumbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and\nmanipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit\ngate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-10]. However, the gates in these\ndemonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with\nuniversal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits.\nThis relatively slow operation will greatly extend runtimes for useful,\nlarge-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum\ncomputer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than\nshuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array\nof single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single qubit RZ\ngate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout\nof alkali-atom qubits with sub-percent loss, which boosts operational speed.\nThis technique also enables us to measure 99.73(3)% CZ fidelity with atom-loss\nevents excluded, which is a record among long lived neutral-atom qubits and\nhighlights the path to higher fidelity and error correction. Our results\nrepresent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom\nquantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
