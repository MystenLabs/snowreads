Despite progress in recent years, biologists and other domain experts\nstill require novel algorithms to handle increasingly large and complex\nreal-world datasets. These algorithms must not only achieve state-of-the-art\naccuracy, but also be optimized for efficiency, portability and\nuser-friendliness. Here, we introduce InstanSeg: a novel embedding-based\ninstance segmentation pipeline designed to identify cells and nuclei in\nmicroscopy images. Using six public cell segmentation datasets, we demonstrate\nthat InstanSeg can significantly improve accuracy when compared to the most\nwidely used alternative methods, while reducing the processing time by at least\n60%. Furthermore, InstanSeg is designed to be fully serializable as TorchScript\nand supports GPU acceleration on a range of hardware. We provide an open-source\nimplementation of InstanSeg in Python, in addition to a user-friendly,\ninteractive QuPath extension for inference written in Java.
