A first-principles non-parametric approach","authors":"Eduard Salvador-Sol\\'e and Alberto Manrique","authorsParsed":[["Salvador-Sol√©","Eduard",""],["Manrique","Alberto",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:31:34 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-29","timestamp":1724862694000,"abstract":"  The Press-Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) models of structure formation\nfail in reproducing the halo bias found in simulations, while the excursion\nset-peaks (ESP) formalism built in the peak model reproduces it only at high\nmasses and does not address in a fully satisfactory manner peak nesting and the\nmass and time of ellipsoidal collapse of triaxial peaks in the\nGaussian-smoothed density field. Here we apply the CUSP formalism fixing all\nthese issues from first principles and with no free parameters to infer the\nLagrangian local peak bias parameters, which adopt very simple analytic\nexpressions similar to those found in the PS and ES models. The predicted\nEulerian linear halo bias recovers the results of simulations. More\nspecifically, we show that the only small departure observed at intermediate\nand low masses can be due to the spurious halo splitting and grouping caused by\nthe Spherical Overdensity halo-finding algorithm used in simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
