This is a hard,\nsometimes impossible, problem, which existing methods are forced to soften by\nallowing for map distortions or multiple patches. Instead, we propose a\ngeometric relaxation of the problem: we modify the input shape until it admits\nan overlap-free unfolding. We achieve this by locally displacing vertices and\ncollapsing edges, guided by the unfolding process. We validate our algorithm\nquantitatively and qualitatively on a large dataset of complex shapes and show\nits proficiency by fabricating real shapes from paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YmXp4RwRLGBd3hIX-vdTHU6-DUYJonpmiAXqZ3mBNRs","pdfSize":"6596020"}
