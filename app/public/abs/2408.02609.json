This requires a Mellin transform\nwith respect to the energies of the scattered strings, as well as to integrate\nover the open-string worldsheet moduli space. After accomplishing the former we\nobtain celestial string integrands with remaining worldsheet integrals\n$\\Psi\\left(\\beta\\right)$, where $\\beta$ is related to the conformal scaling\ndimensions of the conformal primary operators under consideration. Employing an\nalternative approach of performing an $\\alpha'$-expansion of the open\nsuperstring amplitude first and Mellin transforming afterwards, we obtain a\nfully integrated expression, capturing the pole structure in the $\\beta$-plane.\nThe same analysis is performed at tree-level yielding similar results. We\nconclude by solving $\\Psi\\left(\\beta\\right)$ for specific values of $\\beta$,\nconsistently reproducing the results of the $\\alpha'$-expansion ansatz. In all\napproaches we find that the dependence on $\\alpha'$ reduces to that of a simple\noverall factor of $\\left(\\alpha'\\right)^{\\beta-3}$ at loop and\n$\\left(\\alpha'\\right)^{\\beta}$ at tree level, consistent with previous\nliterature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
