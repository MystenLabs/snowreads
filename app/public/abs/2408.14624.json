Mag. 80 (2007), no. 5, pp. 377--380] in which he asks whether it can\nhelp characterize countable subsets of the reals. This question is in a similar\nspirit to how the Banach-Mazur Game characterizes meager sets in an arbitrary\ntopological space.\n  In a recent paper, Will Brian and Steven Clontz prove that in Baker's game,\nPlayer II has a winning strategy if and only if the payoff set is countable.\nThey also asked if it is possible, in general linear orders, for Player II to\nhave a winning strategy on some uncountable set.\n  To this we give a positive answer and moreover construct, for every infinite\ncardinal $\\kappa$, a dense linear order of size $\\kappa$ on which Player II has\na winning strategy on all payoff sets. We finish with some future research\nquestions, further underlining the difficulty in generalizing the\ncharacterization of Brian and Clontz to linear orders.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V9zZFCKlatRoAp-oNiQXxmSFrsXxgh6jp_4G12LrsHc","pdfSize":"122752"}
