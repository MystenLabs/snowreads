This raises concerns as it entails that deep hedging can\ninclude a speculative component aimed simply at exploiting the structure of the\nrisk measure guiding the hedging optimisation problem. We test whether such\nfinding remains true in a GARCH-based market model. We observe that the\ndifference between deep hedging and delta hedging can be a statistical\narbitrage if the risk measure considered does not put sufficient relative\nweight on adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, a suitable choice of risk measure can\nprevent the deep hedging agent from including a speculative overlay within its\nhedging strategy.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
