Here we demonstrate the\nemergence of electrically tunable topological moir\\'e magnetism in twisted\nbilayers of the spin-spiral multiferroic NiI$_2$. We establish a rich phase\ndiagram featuring uniform spiral phases, a variety of $k\\pi$-skyrmion lattices,\nand nematic spin textures ordered at the moir\\'e scale. The emergence of these\nphases is driven by the local stacking and the resulting modulated frustration\nin the spin spiral stemming from the moir\\'e pattern. Notably, when the\nspin-spiral wavelength is commensurate with the moir\\'e length scale by an\ninteger $k$, multi-walled skyrmions become pinned to the moir\\'e pattern. We\nshow that the strong magnetoelectric coupling displayed by the moir\\'e\nmultiferroic allows the electric control of the $k\\pi$-skyrmion lattices by an\nout-of-plane electric field, which couples to the moir\\'e-induced electric\npolarization. While adiabatic changes in the electric field preserve the\ntopology of the spin configurations, abrupt variations can trigger transitions\nbetween different skyrmion lattice ground states. Our results establish a\nhighly tunable platform for skyrmionics based on twisted van der Waals\nmultiferroics, potentially enabling a new generation of ultrathin\ntopologically-protected spintronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
