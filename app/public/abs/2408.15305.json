It highlights the need for research to enhance the\nsemiconductor device technology portfolio and aid in high-end device\nfabrication. In this paper, we introduce sLAVA, a small-scale vision-language\nassistant tailored for semiconductor manufacturing, with a focus on electron\nmicroscopy image analysis. It addresses challenges of data scarcity and\nacquiring high-quality, expert-annotated data. We employ a teacher-student\nparadigm, using a foundational vision language model like GPT-4 as a teacher to\ncreate instruction-following multimodal data for customizing the student model,\nsLAVA, for electron microscopic image analysis tasks on consumer hardware with\nlimited budgets. Our approach allows enterprises to further fine-tune the\nproposed framework with their proprietary data securely within their own\ninfrastructure, protecting intellectual property. Rigorous experiments validate\nthat our framework surpasses traditional methods, handles data shifts, and\nenables high-throughput screening.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"U3lVcGLsa4aatFV22n27XFzJUO3YTj6R23ZM5ZA7hGY","pdfSize":"12658389"}
