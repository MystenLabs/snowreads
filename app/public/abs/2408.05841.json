Causality properties of the former are\ncharacterized by using metric-type properties of the latter. A particular\nattention is posed to the case of a cone structure associated with a\nFinsler-Kropina type metric, i.e. a field of compact and strongly convex\nindicatrices that enclose the zero vector in the closure of its bounded\ninterior at each tangent space of the manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
