We\nestablish connections and obtain transferable complexity results to several\nwell-studied problems that previously escaped classification attempts. Our\nnovel approach, utilizing logical and algebraic methods, yields an FPT versus\npNP dichotomy for arbitrary finite structures and sharper dichotomies for\nBoolean structures and first-order reducts of $(\\mathbb{N},=)$ (equality CSPs),\ntogether with many partial results for general $\\omega$-categorical structures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
