The introduction of the scalar\nfield prevents the formation of the event horizon, and when the magnetic charge\nexceeds a certain critical value, the frozen Bardeen-boson star can be obtained\nwith the frequency $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$. In this paper, we extend the\ninvestigation of the Einstein-Bardeen model with a charged scalar field and\nobtain two types of solutions: the small $q$ solution and the large $q$\nsolution. Specifically, for the small $q$ solution, we find that there exists a\nmaximum value for the charge $q$, the introduction of the charge makes it\npossible to obtain solutions for frozen stars without the frequency to be\napproached to zero. For the large $q$ solution, the charge can tend toward\ninfinity, and as $q \\rightarrow \\infty$, the large $q$ solution gradually\nbecomes the pure Bardeen solution. Similar to Ref. \\cite{Wang:2023tdz}, the\nevent horizon is not found in our results.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
