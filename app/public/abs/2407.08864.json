The \\minnlo{} method is adapted for\nthe extra scale dependence due to the Yukawa coupling renormalized in the\n$\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme. The computation has been carried out in the five\nflavour scheme (5FS) neglecting the bottom mass. Results are compared against\nfixed-order predictions at NNLO and resummed predictions at\nnext-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. We also present\npreliminary results within the four-flavour scheme (4FS) setup, reaching a new\nlevel of precision in the massive scheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
