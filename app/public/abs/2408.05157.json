The number field\n$K$ is said to be P\\'{o}lya if $Po(K)$ is trivial. Motivated by several recent\nstudies on the group $Po(K)$ when $K$ is a totally real bi-quadratic field, we\ninvestigate the same with five distinct odd primes ramifying in $K/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis extends the previous results on this problem, where the number of distinct\nramified primes was at most four.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
