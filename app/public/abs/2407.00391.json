In our prior work, we developed a\nconceptual model to understand the quantification of RTD and support its\nmanagement. In this paper, we present our perspective and the vision to apply\nthe lens of RTD to software requirements concerning veracity, i.e.,\nrequirements related to truth, trust, authenticity, and demonstrability in\nsoftware-intensive systems. Our goal is to cultivate awareness of veracity as\nan important concern and eventually support the management of RTD for software\nrequirements concerning veracity, what we term as `Veracity Debt,' through its\nquantification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
