By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering\nwith the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC)\nat the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we extract valuable insights into\nboth processes. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy\ntransfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to\nanalyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and eA scattering at the EIC,\ndemonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics\nstudies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
