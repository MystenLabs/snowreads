The\nmission envisages three spacecraft, each equipped with two lasers, on a\ntriangular constellation with 2.5 million-kilometer arm-lengths. Six\ninter-spacecraft laser links are established on a laser-transponder\nconfiguration, where five of the six lasers are offset-phase-locked to another.\nThe need to determine a suitable set of transponder offset frequencies\nprecisely, given the constraints imposed by the onboard metrology instrument\nand the orbital dynamics, poses an interesting technical challenge. In this\npaper we describe an algorithm that solves this problem via quadratic\nprogramming. The algorithm can produce concrete frequency plans for a given\norbit and transponder configuration, ensuring that all of the critical\ninterferometric signals stay within the desired frequency range throughout the\nmission lifetime, and enabling LISA to operate in science mode uninterruptedly.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
