The dataset comprises different scenarios in a\nreal network setting. This paper also surveys information related to other IoT\ndatasets along with the characteristics that make our data valuable. Many of\nthe datasets available are synthesized (simulated) or often address industrial\napplications, while the IoT dataset we present is based on likely smart home\nscenarios. Further, there are only a limited number of IoT datasets that\ncontain both normal operation and attack scenarios. A discussion of the network\nconfiguration and the steps taken to prepare this dataset are presented as we\nprepare to create replicative patterns for decoy purposes. The dataset, which\nwe refer to as IoT Flex Data, consists of four categories, namely, IoT benign\nidle, IoT benign active, IoT setup, and malicious (attack) traffic associating\nthe IoT devices with the scenarios under consideration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
