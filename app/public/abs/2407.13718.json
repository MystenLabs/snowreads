One key reason for this versatility is their high water\ncontent, which lets them dramatically change their volume and many of their\nmechanical properties -- often by orders of magnitude -- as they swell and dry\nout. Currently, we lack techniques that can precisely characterize how these\nproperties change with water content. To overcome this challenge, here we\ndevelop Gel-Freezing Osmometry (GelFrO): an extension of freezing-point\nosmometry. We show how GelFrO can measure a hydrogel's mechanical response to\ncompression and osmotic pressure, while only using small, $O(100\\mu$L$)$\nsamples. Because the technique allows measurement of properties over an\nunusually wide range of water contents, it allows us to accurately test\ntheoretical predictions. We find simple, power-law behavior for both mechanical\nresponse to compression, and osmotic pressure, while these are not\nwell-captured by classical Flory-Huggins theory. We interpret this power-law\nbehavior as a hallmark of a microscopic fractal structure of the gel's polymer\nnetwork, and propose a simple way to connect the gel's fractal dimension to its\nmechanical and osmotic properties. This connection is supported by observations\nof hydrogel microstructures using small-angle x-ray scattering. Finally, our\nresults motivate us to propose an updated constitutive model describing\nhydrogel swelling, and mechanical response.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
