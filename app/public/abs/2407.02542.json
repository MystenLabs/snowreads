The sample space of them is\nmerely a small subset of the entire space, making it challenging to train an\nefficient model. In recent years, there have been many excellent studies\nrelated to cross-domain recommendation aimed at mitigating the problem of data\nsparsity. However, few of them have simultaneously considered the adaptability\nof both sample and representation continual transfer setting to the target\ntask. To overcome the above issue, we propose a Entire space Continual and\nAdaptive Transfer learning framework called ECAT which includes two core\ncomponents: First, as for sample transfer, we propose a two-stage method that\nrealizes a coarse-to-fine process. Specifically, we perform an initial\nselection through a graph-guided method, followed by a fine-grained selection\nusing domain adaptation method. Second, we propose an adaptive knowledge\ndistillation method for continually transferring the representations from a\nmodel that is well-trained on the entire space dataset. ECAT enables full\nutilization of the entire space samples and representations under the\nsupervision of the target task, while avoiding negative migration.\nComprehensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets from Taobao show\nthat ECAT advances state-of-the-art performance on offline metrics, and brings\n+13.6% CVR and +8.6% orders for Baiyibutie, a famous mini-app of Taobao.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
