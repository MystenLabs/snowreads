We assume that the bare valley Hall current occurs in the system due\nto the presence of disorder caused by impurities and is determined by the\nvalley-selective anisotropic skew scattering. Applying the Boltzmann transport\nequation to describe the electron and hole transport in the material, we\ncalculate the renormalized VHE conductivity due to electron-electron and\nelectron-hole scattering processes, considering two regimes: (i) an $n$-doped\nmonolayer hosting a degenerate electron gas, and (ii) an intrinsic\nsemiconductor with the Boltzmann statistics of electron and hole gases. In both\nregimes, the dominant mechanism of interparticle scattering is due to particles\nresiding in different valleys. Moreover, in case (ii), in addition to direct\nscattering, electron-hole annihilation starts to play a role with the increase\nin temperature. It might even become the dominant mechanism of the Coulomb\ninteraction-mediated VHE.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
