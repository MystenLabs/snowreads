For the companion in each system, the temperature is\ntraced throughout its orbit, and radial velocities are measured. The radial\nvelocities are found to vary with the absorption features used when measuring\nthem, resulting in a lower radial velocity curve semi-amplitude measured from\nthe day side of two of the systems when compared to the night: for J1048\n($K_\\mathrm{day} = 344 \\pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\\mathrm{night} = 372 \\pm 3$ km\ns$^{-1}$) and, tentatively, for J1810 ($K_\\mathrm{day} = 448 \\pm 19$ km\ns$^{-1}$, $K_\\mathrm{night} = 491 \\pm 32$ km s$^{-1}$). With existing\ninclination constraints, this gives the neutron star (NS) and companion masses\n$M_\\mathrm{NS} = 1.50 - 2.04$ $M_\\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.32 - 0.40$ $M_\\odot$ for\nJ1048, and $M_\\mathrm{NS} > 1.7$ $M_\\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.05 - 0.08$ $M_\\odot$\nfor J1810. For J1908, we find an upper limit of $K_2 < 32$ km s$^{-1}$, which\nconstrains its mass ratio $q = M_2 / M_\\mathrm{NS} > 0.55$ and inclination $i <\n6.0^\\circ$, revealing the previously misunderstood system to be the highest\nmass ratio, lowest inclination redback yet. This raises questions for the\norigins of its substantial radio eclipses. Additionally, we find evidence of\nasymmetric heating in J1048 and J1810, and signs of metal enrichment in J1908.\nWe also explore the impact of inclination on spectroscopic temperatures, and\ndemonstrate that the temperature measured at quadrature ($\\phi = 0.25, 0.75$)\nis essentially independent of inclination, and thus can provide additional\nconstraints on photometric modelling.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
