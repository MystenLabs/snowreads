We give two polynomial-time algorithms to approximately sample from\nthe Gibbs distribution of the CREM in the high-temperature regime, based on a\nMarkov chain and a sequential sampler. The running time depends algebraically\non the desired TV distance and failure probability and exponentially in\n$(1/g')^{O(1)}$, where $g'$ is the gap to a certain inverse temperature\nthreshold; this contrasts with previous results which only attain $o(N)$\naccuracy in KL divergence. If the covariance function $A$ of the CREM is\nconcave, the algorithms work up to the critical threshold $\\beta_c$, which is\nthe static phase transition point; moreover, for certain $A$, the algorithms\nwork up to the known algorithmic threshold $\\beta_G$ proposed in Addario-Berry\nand Maillard (2020) for non-trivial sampling guarantees. Our result depends on\nquantitative bounds for the fluctuation of the partition function and a new\ncontiguity result of the ``tilted\" CREM obtained from sampling, which is of\nindependent interest. We also show that the spectral gap is exponentially small\nwith high probability, suggesting that the algebraic dependence is unavoidable\nwith a Markov chain approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
