Second, it was shown that the sink equilibria\nof a game adequately capture the limit behavior of natural game dynamics. These\ntwo results have created a need and opportunity to articulate a principled\ncomputational theory of the meaning of the game that is based on game dynamics.\nGiven any game in normal form, and any prior distribution of play, we study the\nproblem of computing the asymptotic behavior of a class of natural dynamics\ncalled the noisy replicator dynamics as a limit distribution over the sink\nequilibria of the game. When the prior distribution has pure strategy support,\nwe prove this distribution can be computed efficiently, in near-linear time to\nthe size of the best-response graph. When the distribution can be sampled --\nfor example, if it is the uniform distribution over all mixed strategy profiles\n-- we show through experiments that the limit distribution of reasonably large\ngames can be estimated quite accurately through sampling and simulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
