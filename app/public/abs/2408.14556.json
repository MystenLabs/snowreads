By requiring that the defects are topological, we find that they\ncorrespond to a non-Abelian zero-form symmetry acting on the fields as elements\nof $\\text{O}(d;\\mathbb{R}) \\times \\text{O}(d;\\mathbb{R})$, and on momentum and\nwinding charges as elements of $\\text{O}(d,d;\\mathbb{R})$. When the latter\naction is rational, we prove that it can be realized by combining gauging of\nnon-anomalous discrete subgroups of the momentum and winding $\\text{U}(1)$\nsymmetries, and elements of the $\\text{O}(d,d;\\mathbb{Z})$ duality group, such\nthat the couplings of the theory are left invariant. Generically, these defects\nmap local operators into non-genuine operators attached to lines, thus\ncorresponding to a non-invertible symmetry. We confirm our results within a\nLagrangian description of the non-invertible topological defects associated to\nthe $\\text{O}(d,d;\\mathbb{Q})$ action on charges, giving a natural explanation\nof the rationality conditions. Finally, we apply our findings to toroidal\ncompactifications of bosonic string theory. In the simplest non-trivial case,\nwe discuss the selection rules of these non-invertible symmetries, verifying\nexplicitly that they are satisfied on a worldsheet of higher genus.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
