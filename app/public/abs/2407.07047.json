Broadband spectral energy distribution reveals a new jet\nemission component similar to high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects, thereby\nimplying the soft X-ray spectrum for the synchrotron emission. Using the\nadvantage of simultaneous X-ray and VHE spectral information, as well as the\nsource being a low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object, we systematically explored\nthe extragalactic background light (EBL) spectrum by demanding that the VHE\nspectrum cannot be harder than the X-ray spectrum. We used three different\nphenomenological forms of the EBL spectral shape (power-law, parabola, and\npolynomial) motivated by current constraints on the EBL with the Bayesian Monte\nCarlo approach to infer the credible EBL range. Our study favors an almost flat\npower-law spectral shape and is consistent with previous studies. The other\nspectral forms capable of capturing curvature though result in a better\nstatistics value; the improvement is statistically insignificant given the\nadditional parameters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
