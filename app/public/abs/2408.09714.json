Our construction produces one integrable deformation for each\npair $(\\mathcal{R}, E)$, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is an antisymmetric bilinear\noperator on $\\mathfrak{g}$ obeying the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation\nand $E$ is a function of several variables. We show that every model in this\nfamily is (weakly) classically integrable by exhibiting a Lax representation\nfor its equations of motion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m25ha0hSWS5meeT8qg78VHeTGUknxeVKKCZGMD1HFLE","pdfSize":"577634"}
