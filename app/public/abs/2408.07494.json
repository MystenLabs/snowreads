QirK can answer structurally complex questions that are\nstill beyond the reach of emerging Large Language Models (LLMs). It does so\nusing a unique combination of database technology, LLMs, and semantic search\nover vector embeddings. The glue for these components is an intermediate\nrepresentation (IR). The input question is mapped to IR using LLMs, which is\nthen repaired into a valid relational database query with the aid of a semantic\nsearch on vector embeddings. This allows a practical synthesis of LLM\ncapabilities and KG reliability.\n  A short video demonstrating QirK is available at\nhttps://youtu.be/6c81BLmOZ0U.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
