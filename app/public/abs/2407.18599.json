Barker\net al. introduced the notion of $k$-universality, calling a word $k$-universal,\nif it contains all possible words of length $k$ over a given alphabet $\\Sigma$\nas a scattered factor. Kosche et al. introduced the notion of absent scattered\nfactors to categorise the words not being scattered factors of a given word.\n  In this paper, we investigate tight bounds on the possible number of absent\nscattered factors of a given length $k$ (also strictly longer than the shortest\nabsent scattered factors) among all words with the same universality extending\nthe results of Kosche et al. Specifically, given a length $k$ and universality\nindex $\\iota$, we characterize $\\iota$-universal words with both the maximal\nand minimal number of absent scattered factors of length $k$. For the lower\nbound, we provide the exact number in a closed form. For the upper bound, we\noffer efficient algorithms to compute the number based on the constructed\nwords. Moreover, by combining old results, we present an enumeration with\nconstant delay of the set of scattered factors of a fixed length in time\n$O(|\\Sigma||w|)$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"239plzOjiwK6t5BfKJpLJr8kbaY_s4fRgQYqvpwodgw","pdfSize":"594794"}
