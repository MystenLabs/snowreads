By using the fusion technique, the closed recursive\nrelations among the fused transfer matrices are obtained.

The present method provides a unified\ntreatment to investigate the Bethe ansatz solutions for both periodic and\nnon-diagonal open boundary conditions associated with exceptional Lie algebras.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QxDucbuGTgFmuN4zjZNJ6xF7NX9j_aJwAiKgyrRSYVU","pdfSize":"272350"}
