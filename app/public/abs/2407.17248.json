It is known that the system possesses a global\nbounded solution if $0<\\alpha<\\frac 4n$ when $n\\ge 4$. In the case $n\\le 3$ and\nif we consider superlinear transmission, no regularity of $w$ or $v$ can be\nderived directly. In this work, we show that if $0<\\alpha< \\min\\{\\frac\n4n,1+\\frac 2n\\}$, the solution is global and bounded via an approach based on\nthe maximal Sobolev regularity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
