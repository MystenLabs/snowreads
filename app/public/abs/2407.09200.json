At the ensemble level, two-dimensional\nspectroscopy provides insight into ultrafast femtosecond processes such as\nenergy transfer and line broadening, even beyond the Fourier limit, by\ncorrelating pump and probe spectra. Here, we combine these two techniques and\ndemonstrate 2D spectroscopy of individual molecules at room temperature using\nthe example of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) in a polymer matrix. We excite the\nmolecule in a confocal microscope with a phase-modulated train of femtosecond\npulses and detect the emitted fluorescence with single-photon counting\ndetectors. Using a phase sensitive detection scheme, we were able to measure\nthe nonlinear 2D spectra of most of the DBT molecules we studied. Our method is\napplicable to a wide range of single emitters and opens new avenues for\nunderstanding energy transfer in single quantum objects on ultrafast time\nscales.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
