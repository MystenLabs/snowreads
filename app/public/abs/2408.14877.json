Our findings are summarized as follows: (1) There is no\nsignificant correlation between flux and spectral index values among blazars\nand their subclasses FSRQs and BL Lacs. (2) The intrinsic differential\ndistributions of flux values exhibit a broken-power-law form, with parameters\nthat closely match previous findings. The intrinsic photon index distributions\nare well described by a Gaussian form for FSRQs and BL Lacs individually, while\na dual-Gaussian model provides a more appropriate fit for blazars as a whole.\n(3) Blazars contribute 34.5\\% to the extragalactic gamma-ray background and\n16.8\\% to the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background. When examined\nseparately, FSRQs and BL Lacs contribute 19.6\\% and 13\\% to the extragalactic\ngamma-ray background, respectively.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RHO-czPzv8haLs53DDbr6CONOv_DDCOxnNN-wHpQTSc","pdfSize":"3336955"}
