The symmetric colored\nmultiset Eulerian polynomials are characterized and used to prove sufficient\nconditions for a colored multiset Eulerian polynomial to be self-interlacing.\nThe latter property implies the aforementioned distributional properties as\nwell as others, including the alternatingly increasing property and\nbi-$\\gamma$-positivity. To derive these results, multivariate generalizations\nof an identity due to MacMahon are deduced. The results are applied to a pair\nof questions, both previously studied in several special cases, that are seen\nto admit more general answers when framed in the context of colored multiset\nEulerian polynomials. The first question pertains to $s$-Eulerian polynomials,\nand the second to interpretations of $\\gamma$-coefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
