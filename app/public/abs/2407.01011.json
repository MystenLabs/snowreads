Conventional serial computing frequently fails\nto meet these requirements, underscoring the necessity for high-performance\ncomputing alternatives. Parallel computing, the utilization of several\nprocessing elements simultaneously to solve computational problems, offers a\npossible answer. Various parallel computing designs, such as multi-core CPUs,\nGPUs, FPGAs, and distributed systems, provide substantial enhancements in\nprocessing capacity and efficiency. By utilizing these architectures, robotic\nsystems can attain improved performance in functionalities such as real-time\nimage processing, sensor fusion, and path planning. The transformative\npotential of parallel computing architectures in advancing robotic technology\nhas been underscored, real-life case studies of these architectures in the\nrobotics field have been discussed, and comparisons are presented. Challenges\npertaining to these architectures have been explored, and possible solutions\nhave been mentioned for further research and enhancement of the robotic\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
