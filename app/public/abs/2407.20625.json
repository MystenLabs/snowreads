In this paper, we focus on\ntwo reaction-diffusion chemotaxis models for SOC dynamics, both supporting\nchemotaxis-driven instability and exhibiting a variety of spatial patterns as\nstripes, spots and hexagons when the microbial chemotactic sensitivity is above\na critical threshold. We use symplectic techniques to numerically approximate\nchemotaxis-driven spatial patterns and explore the effectiveness of the\npiecewice dynamic mode decomposition (pDMD) to reconstruct them. Our findings\nshow that pDMD is effective at precisely recreating chemotaxis-driven spatial\npatterns, therefore broadening the range of application of the method to\nclasses of solutions different than Turing patterns. By validating its efficacy\nacross a wider range of models, this research lays the groundwork for applying\npDMD to experimental spatiotemporal data, advancing predictions crucial for\nsoil microbial ecology and agricultural sustainability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
