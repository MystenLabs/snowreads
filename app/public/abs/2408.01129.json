Recently, a novel\narchitecture named Mamba, drawing inspiration from classical state space models\n(SSMs), has emerged as a promising alternative for building foundation models,\ndelivering comparable modeling abilities to Transformers while preserving\nnear-linear scalability concerning sequence length. This has sparked an\nincreasing number of studies actively exploring Mamba's potential to achieve\nimpressive performance across diverse domains. Given such rapid evolution,\nthere is a critical need for a systematic review that consolidates existing\nMamba-empowered models, offering a comprehensive understanding of this emerging\nmodel architecture. In this survey, we therefore conduct an in-depth\ninvestigation of recent Mamba-associated studies, covering three main aspects:\nthe advancements of Mamba-based models, the techniques of adapting Mamba to\ndiverse data, and the applications where Mamba can excel. Specifically, we\nfirst review the foundational knowledge of various representative deep learning\nmodels and the details of Mamba-1&2 as preliminaries. Then, to showcase the\nsignificance of Mamba for AI, we comprehensively review the related studies\nfocusing on Mamba models' architecture design, data adaptability, and\napplications. Finally, we present a discussion of current limitations and\nexplore various promising research directions to provide deeper insights for\nfuture investigations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
