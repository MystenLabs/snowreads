We\ncompletely describe these sets of planes for pairs of orthogonal complex\nstructures. Generically, the number of such planes is finite. We compute this\nnumber for orthogonal complex structures and prove that it gives a lower bound\nfor the number of planes simultaneously stabilised by a generic pair of complex\nstructures on $V$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"hKwTySsd6MumaiItZznO4W5B3zs2E7RBJpCqRyqIGgs","pdfSize":"253148"}
