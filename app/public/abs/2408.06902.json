They are defined as ratios of generating functions for\n$P$-partitions on certain posets. We give matrix formulas for computing them,\nwhich generalize previous results in the $q=1$ case. We also show that certain\nproperties enjoyed by the $q$-rationals are also satisfied by our higher\nversions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nMVGi_-wbeiTyp4rdUoKaKVGQ5_TrjPc5GE0UD1vuWw","pdfSize":"300127"}
