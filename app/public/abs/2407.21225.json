Our\napproach involves three main stages: identifying an initial template that\napproximates the target unitary, predicting initial parameters for this\ntemplate, and refining these parameters to maximize the fidelity of the\ncircuit. We propose AI-driven approaches for the first two stages, with a deep\nlearning model that suggests initial templates and an autoencoder-like model\nthat suggests parameter values, which are refined through gradient descent to\nachieve the desired fidelity. We demonstrate the method on 2 and 3-qubit\nunitaries, showcasing promising improvements over exhaustive search and random\nparameter initialization. The results highlight the potential of AI to enhance\nthe transpiling process, supporting more efficient quantum computations on\ncurrent and future quantum hardware.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
