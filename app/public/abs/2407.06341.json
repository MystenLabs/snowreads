(2024) measured the derivative of the phase $\\phi_{\\mathrm{w}}$\nof the Galactic warp traced by classical Cepheids with respect to their age\n$\\tau$ and interpreted it as the warp precession rate\n$\\omega\\equiv\\mathrm{d}\\phi_{\\mathrm{w}}/\\mathrm{d}t=-\\mathrm{d}\\phi_{\\mathrm{w}}/\\mathrm{d}\\tau$.\nThis interpretation is unfounded: young stars follow trajectories close to\nthose of their parental gas and trace the instantaneous gas warp, not its shape\nat their time of birth: $\\phi_{\\mathrm{w}}$ should hardly depend on Cepheid\nage. We show that the measured $\\mathrm{d}\\phi_{\\mathrm{w}}/\\mathrm{d}\\tau>0$\nis consistent with an omitted-variable bias from neglecting the natural twist\n$\\mathrm{d}\\phi_{\\mathrm{w}}/\\mathrm{d}R$ of the warp and the $R$-$\\tau$\ncorrelation for Cepheids (originating from the Galactic metallicity gradient\nand the Cepheid metallicity-age correlation).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
