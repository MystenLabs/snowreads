We show how the\nalgebra can be used to identify optimal scalings of the couplings for taking\nlarge $N$ limits. The algebra identifies these limits without diagrammatic or\ncombinatorial analysis. For several models this approach leads to new limits\nyet to be explored at higher loop orders. We consider the bifundamental and\ntrifundamental models, as well as a matrix-vector model with an adjoint\nrepresentation. Among the suggested new limit theories are some which appear to\nbe less complex than general planar limits but more complex than ordinary\nvector models or melonic models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9y3reyNVMwdexGcGL0dqmsYXPcZz9SQ1v5Bst5LQUOY","pdfSize":"985067"}
