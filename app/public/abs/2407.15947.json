In this paper, we develop a parametrized\nformalism to describe deviations from general relativity in the Teukolsky\nequation, which governs linear perturbations of spinning black holes. We do\nthis by introducing a correction to the effective potential of the Teukolsky\nequation in the form of a $1/r$ expansion controlled by free parameters. The\nmethod assumes that a small deviation in the effective potential induces a\nsmall modification in the spectrum of modes and in the angular separation\nconstants. We isolate and compute the universal linear contribution to the\nquasi-normal mode frequencies and separation constants in a set of\ncoefficients, and test them against known examples in the literature (massive\nscalar field, Dudley-Finley equation and higher-derivative gravity). We make\nthe coefficients publicly available for relevant overtone, angular momentum and\nazimuthal numbers of modes and different values of the black hole spin.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
