Using only shallow ansatz circuits, these approaches are deemed\nsuitable for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. However, the\nresources required for training shallow variational quantum circuits often\nscale superpolynomially in problem size. In this study we numerically\ninvestigate what this scaling result means in practice for solving CO problems\nusing Max-Cut as a benchmark. For fixed resources, we compare the average\nperformance of training a shallow variational quantum circuit, sampling with\nreplacement, and a greedy algorithm starting from the same initial point as the\nquantum algorithm. We identify a minimum problem size for which the quantum\nalgorithm can consistently outperform sampling and, for each problem size,\ncharacterize the separation between the quantum algorithm and the greedy\nalgorithm. Furthermore, we extend the average case analysis by investigating\nthe correlation between the performance of the algorithms by instance. Our\nresults provide a step towards meaningful benchmarks of variational quantum\nalgorithms for CO problems for a realistic set of resources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
