This study focuses on the\ndecay sequence where the $T$ quark produces a charged Higgs boson ($H^+$) and a\nbottom quark, followed by the $H^+$ decay into a top and bottom quark, due to\nthe small branching ratio for $H^+ \\to \\tau\\nu$ in the studied region. Previous\nresearch\n\\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.055016}{[Phys.Rev.D109,055016]} has\nshown that the decay pathway $T \\to H^+b$ followed by $H^+ \\to tb$ is dominant\nacross a significant portion of the parameter space. We analyze the collider\nprocess $pp \\to T\\bar{T} \\to (bH^+)(\\bar{b}H^-) \\to\n(b(tb))(\\bar{b}(\\bar{t}b))$, resulting in final states enriched with bottom\nquarks. Our findings highlight this channel as a promising avenue for\ndiscovering the new top partner and charged Higgs boson, offering substantial\ndetection potential across a broad parameter space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
