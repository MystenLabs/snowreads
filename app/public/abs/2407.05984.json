However, the\ndiverse morphological characteristics and heterogeneous appearances of ovarian\ntumors pose significant challenges to automated segmentation methods. In this\npaper, we propose MBA-Net, a novel architecture that integrates the powerful\nsegmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with\ndomain-specific knowledge for accurate and robust ovarian tumor segmentation.\nMBA-Net employs a hybrid encoder architecture, where the encoder consists of a\nprior branch, which inherits the SAM encoder to capture robust segmentation\npriors, and a domain branch, specifically designed to extract domain-specific\nfeatures. The bidirectional flow of information between the two branches is\nfacilitated by the robust feature injection network (RFIN) and the domain\nknowledge integration network (DKIN), enabling MBA-Net to leverage the\ncomplementary strengths of both branches. We extensively evaluate MBA-Net on\nthe public multi-modality ovarian tumor ultrasound dataset and the in-house\nmulti-site ovarian tumor MRI dataset. Our proposed method consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art segmentation approaches. Moreover, MBA-Net\ndemonstrates superior generalization capability across different imaging\nmodalities and clinical sites.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
