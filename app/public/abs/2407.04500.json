The\nprimary objective is to uncover hidden market structures and find diversifiers\nbased on return correlations, thereby achieving a more effective risk-reducing\nportfolio allocation. We applied DynMSA to constituents of the S&P 500 and\ncompared the results to sector- and market-based benchmarks. Besides the\nconception of this algorithm, our contributions further include implementing a\nsector-based calibration for modularity optimisation and a correlation-based\ndistance function for spectral clustering. Testing revealed that DynMSA\noutperforms baseline models in intra- and inter-cluster correlation\ndifferences, particularly over medium-term correlation look-backs. It also\nidentifies stable clusters and detects regime changes due to exogenous shocks,\nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic. Portfolios constructed using our clusters showed\nhigher Sortino and Sharpe ratios, lower downside volatility, reduced maximum\ndrawdown and higher annualised returns compared to an equally weighted market\nbenchmark.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
