A novel Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) framework is designed for using this model to achieve precise control and\nguidance for this collaborative robotic system. Extensive simulations in the\nrealistic robotic simulator Gazebo demonstrate the system's readiness for\nreal-world deployment, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness. Our\nmulti-robot system overcomes the state-of-the-art single-robot approach,\nexhibiting smaller control errors during the tracking of the floating object's\nreference. Additionally, our multi-robot system demonstrates a shorter recovery\ntime from a disturbance compared to the single-robot approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
