Based on elaborately designed demon-involved control\nprotocols, such as the Szilard engine protocol, we provide experimentally\nquantitative evidence of the dissipative information, and observe tighter\nbounds of both the extracted work and the demon's efficacy than the limits\npredicted by the Sagawa-Ueda theorem. Our results substantiate a close\nconnection between the physical nature of information and nonequilibrium\nprocesses at the microscale, which help further understanding the thermodynamic\ncharacteristics of information and the optimal design of nanoscale and smaller\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7yK-uunEZiBTEW0tBDFMM1Zz9oIO835PNbcnFZKVQnI","pdfSize":"968900"}
