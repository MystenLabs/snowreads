This contribution to Loops&Legs 2024 describes the\ncalculation of the NNLO QCD corrections to nonleptonic decays of a free bottom\nquark including charm quark mass effects. In particular it outlines the\nchallenges in connection to the computation of master integrals, the\nrenormalization of the effective operators and the problems which arise from\ncalculating traces with $\\gamma_5$ in $d$ dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
