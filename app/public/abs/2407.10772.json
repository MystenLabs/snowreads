Specifically,we consider the convex hull\nof independent random vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where each vector follows a\nbeta distribution with potentially different parameters. We derive an\nexpression for the expected volume of these generalized beta--polytopes.\nAdditionally, we compute the expected value of a functional introduced by\nWieacker, which involves the distance of facets from the origin and their\nvolumes.Our results extend the findings of Kabluchko, Temesvari,and Th\\\"ale.\nKey techniques used in the proofs include the Blaschke--Petkantschin formula,\nKubota's formula, and projections of beta distributed random vectors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
