The problem is\nfirst addressed assuming that the original system model is known, and later\nassuming that the model is unknown but historical data satisfying a certain\nassumption are available. In both cases, fundamental concepts in behavior\ntheory, as the projection of a behavior, the inclusion of a behavior in another\none, and the use of kernel and image representations, provide quite powerful\ntools to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an\nunknown-input observer (UIO), as well as algorithms to design one of them, if\nit exists.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
