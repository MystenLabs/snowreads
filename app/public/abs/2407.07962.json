This process is studied for a black hole merger in\nthe limit of infinite mass ratio, for which constructing the event horizon\nreduces to finding a null hypersurface that asymptotes to a Rindler horizon in\nthe Kerr spacetime. Geometrical properties of the creases on this horizon are\ndetermined and the results are compared with the predictions of an exact local\ndescription of the event horizon in a generic merger. The crease set is shown\nto have finite area. A recently proposed expression for the gravitational\nentropy of a crease is shown to diverge at the instant of merger. Caustics on\n(and off) the event horizon are determined by exploiting the correspondence\nwith the problem of gravitational lensing by a Kerr black hole. Caustics form\nan \"astroid tube\" in spacetime, two edges of which lie on the event horizon of\nthe merger. Perturbative expressions for the location of this tube are\npresented, extending previous work to much higher perturbative order.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
