We discuss a class of such\noperators acting on bounded domains, focusing on those with integrable kernels\nhaving compact support. Notably, we make no explicit symmetry assumptions on\nthe kernel and discuss some implications of this decision. We establish a\nnonlocal-to-local convergence result, showing that these operators coincide\nwith the classical derivative as the nonlocality vanishes. We also provide a\nnew integration by parts result, a characterization of the compactness of these\nnonlocal operators, an implication for the nonlocal Poincar\\'e inequality, and\na variety of examples. This work establishes several key results needed to\nanalyze nonlocal variational problems, given in Part II. We hope that this\npaper can serve as a relatively gentle introduction to the field of nonlocal\nmodeling.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
