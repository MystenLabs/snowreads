The method consists of two steps: visual perception and path planning.\nThe visual perception part uses ORBSLAM3 enhanced with optical flow to estimate\nthe car's poses and extract rich texture information from the scene. In the\npath planning phase, we employ a method combining a control Lyapunov function\nand control barrier function in the form of quadratic program (CLF-CBF-QP)\ntogether with an obstacle shape reconstruction process (SRP) to plan safe and\nstable trajectories. To validate the performance and robustness of the proposed\nmethod, simulation experiments were conducted with a car in various complex\nindoor environments using the Gazebo simulation environment. Our method can\neffectively avoid obstacles in the scenes. The proposed algorithm outperforms\nbenchmark algorithms in achieving more stable and shorter trajectories across\nmultiple simulated scenes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"yy79jfZOlSzSzxqDdRfmnnOCFWwXcHQtfPyIPSnzVRw","pdfSize":"10962918"}
