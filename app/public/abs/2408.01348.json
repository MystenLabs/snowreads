Using the Igusa stack, we\nconstruct a sheaf on $\\mathrm{Bun}_G$ that controls the cohomology of the\ncorresponding Shimura variety. We use this sheaf and the spectral action of\nFargues-Scholze to prove a compatibility between the cohomology of Shimura\nvarieties of Hodge type and the semisimple local Langlands correspondence of\nFargues-Scholze, generalizing the Eichler-Shimura relation of Blasius-Rogawski\nto arbitrary level at $p$. When the given Shimura variety is proper, we show\nmoreover that the sheaf is perverse, which allows us to prove new torsion\nvanishing results for the cohomology of Shimura varieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0pOJoH3ez5uwfeQ6D6jKQxYVBQCw-YPcqeS4QJ-XIlM","pdfSize":"1471719","txDigest":"88zyBSxAD6kZohES1ehZhKSDNh1DJPqbM5371BP247eM","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
