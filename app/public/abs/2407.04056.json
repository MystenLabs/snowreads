It\nrequires UAVs to navigate through various obstacles and complex backgrounds.\nExisting collision avoidance navigation methods based on deep reinforcement\nlearning show promising performance but suffer from poor generalization\nabilities, resulting in performance degradation in unseen environments. To\naddress this issue, we investigate the cause of weak generalization ability in\nDRL and propose a novel causal feature selection module. This module can be\nintegrated into the policy network and effectively filters out non-causal\nfactors in representations, thereby reducing the influence of spurious\ncorrelations between non-causal factors and action predictions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve robust navigation\nperformance and effective collision avoidance especially in scenarios with\nunseen backgrounds and obstacles, which significantly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
