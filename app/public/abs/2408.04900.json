We develop our method Rational Speech\nActs for Cross-Cultural Communication (RSA+C3) to resolve cross-cultural\ndifferences in common ground. To measure the success of our method, we study\nRSA+C3 in the collaborative referential game of Codenames Duet and show that\nour method successfully improves collaboration between simulated players of\ndifferent cultures. Our contributions are threefold: (1) creating Codenames\nplayers using contrastive learning of an embedding space and LLM prompting that\nare aligned with human patterns of play, (2) studying culturally induced\ndifferences in common ground reflected in our trained models, and (3)\ndemonstrating that our method RSA+C3 can ease cross-cultural communication in\ngameplay by inferring sociocultural context from interaction. Our code is\npublicly available at github.com/icwhite/codenames.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
