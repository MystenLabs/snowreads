This paper\nstudies a class of spatial sensing problems, notably direction of arrival (DoA)\nestimation using multisensor arrays, from a novel subspace coding perspective.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate how a canonical (passive) sensing model can be\nmapped into a subspace coding problem, with the sensing operation defining a\nunique structure for the subspace codewords. We introduce the concept of\nsensing subspace codes following this structure, and show how these codes can\nbe controlled by judiciously designing the sensor array geometry. We further\npresent a construction of sensing subspace codes leveraging a certain class of\nGolomb rulers that achieve near-optimal minimum codeword distance. These\ndesigns inspire novel noise-robust sparse array geometries achieving high\nangular resolution. We also prove that codes corresponding to conventional\nuniform linear arrays are suboptimal in this regard. This work is the first to\nestablish connections between subspace coding and spatial sensing, with the aim\nof leveraging insights and methodologies in one field to tackle challenging\nproblems in the other.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
