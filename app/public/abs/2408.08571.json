Traditionally, BPS approaches\nemploy a control-flow-first perspective by enriching a process model with\nsimulation parameters. Although such approaches can mimic the behavior of\ncentrally orchestrated processes, such as those supported by workflow systems,\ncurrent control-flow-first approaches cannot faithfully capture the dynamics of\nreal-world processes that involve distinct resource behavior and decentralized\ndecision-making. Recognizing this issue, this paper introduces AgentSimulator,\na resource-first BPS approach that discovers a multi-agent system from an event\nlog, modeling distinct resource behaviors and interaction patterns to simulate\nthe underlying process. Our experiments show that AgentSimulator achieves\nstate-of-the-art simulation accuracy with significantly lower computation times\nthan existing approaches while providing high interpretability and adaptability\nto different types of process-execution scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
