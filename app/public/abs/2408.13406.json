We\nutilize the AutoGen framework to facilitate communication among agents,\nevaluating different configurations based on the success rates from 40 random\nruns for each setup. The study focuses on developing a flexible automation\nframework for applying the Finite Element Method (FEM) to solve linear elastic\nproblems. Our findings emphasize the importance of optimizing agent roles and\nclearly defining their responsibilities, rather than merely increasing the\nnumber of agents. Effective collaboration among agents is shown to be crucial\nfor addressing general FEM challenges. This research demonstrates the potential\nof LLM multi-agent systems to enhance computational automation in simulation\nmethodologies, paving the way for future advancements in engineering and\nartificial intelligence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
