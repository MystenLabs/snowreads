However, MLCG models currently require large\namounts of data from reference atomistic molecular dynamics or substantial\ncomputation for training. Denoising score matching -- the technology behind the\nwidely popular diffusion models -- has simultaneously emerged as a\nmachine-learning framework for creating samples from noise. Models in the first\ncategory are often trained using atomistic forces, while those in the second\ncategory extract the data distribution by reverting noise-based corruption. We\nunify these approaches to improve the training of MLCG force-fields, reducing\ndata requirements by a factor of 100 while maintaining advantages typical to\nforce-based parameterization. The methods are demonstrated on proteins Trp-Cage\nand NTL9 and published as open-source code.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
