First, by using the splitting\ntechniques and the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, the compactness of\nPalais-Smale sequence of the above problem at higher energy level is\nestablished. Then, exploiting barycentric function methods, Brouwer degree and\nminimax principle, we obtain a solution $(u,\\la)$ with $u>0$ in $\\R^{N}$ and\n$\\la<0$ when $\\R^{N}\\setminus\\Omega$ is contained in a small ball. Moreover, we\ngive a similar result if we remove the restriction on $\\Omega$ and assume $a>0$\nsmall enough. Last, with the symmetric assumption on $\\Omega$, we use genus\ntheory to consider infinite many solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rjbBT_CspZfkpt_1UpKEXnk5TMtyiLdznFKfDbq93uU","pdfSize":"290343"}
