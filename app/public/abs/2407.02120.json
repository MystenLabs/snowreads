In this\nwork, we advance this resource theory, considering free operations to be\nnoncontextual wirings (NCW). We show that all such wirings form a convex set.\nWhen restricted to Bell scenarios, we show that such wirings are not equivalent\nto local operations assisted by a common source of classical shared randomness\n(LOSR). The set of all NCW operations contains LOSR, but is strictly larger. We\nalso prove several elementary facts about how different resources can be\nconverted via NCW. As a concrete example, we show that there are pairs of\nbehaviors that cannot be converted one into the other using NCW. Since resource\nconversion mathematically induces a pre-order over the set of all behaviors,\nour results reveal the intricate ordering induced by NCW in scenarios beyond\nBell scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
