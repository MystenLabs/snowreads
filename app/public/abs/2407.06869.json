In other words, the set of all\ntwenty-four 4-point permutations is quasirandom-forcing. Moreover, it is known\nthat there exist sets of eight 4-point permutations that are also\nquasirandom-forcing. Breaking the barrier of linear dependency of perturbation\ngradients, we show that every quasirandom-forcing set of 4-point permutations\nmust have cardinality at least five.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
