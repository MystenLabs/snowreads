We calculate the lattice\nGreen's function in a finite-size cluster and then map it to the continuum real\nspace, which allows for a direct comparison with scanning-tunneling-microscopy\nmeasurements on the local density of states. Our simulations successfully\nreproduce experimental data, including the characteristic stripe- and\nladder-shaped structures observed in cuprate systems. Moreover, our results\nestablish a connection between previous numerical findings on stripe-ordered\nground states and experimental observations, thereby providing new insights\ninto doped Mott insulators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"faSnC8GwmxmsxsjHpPdrhrjZifConQZFaBfCL5_4gBo","pdfSize":"2077309"}
