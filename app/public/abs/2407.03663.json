In this study,\nwe introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised\nneural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic\nimaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data\nacquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed\nphotoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space,\nviewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective\nis to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a\nfully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding.\nBy simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and\nthe actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous\nmodel. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image\nreconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for\nphotoacoustic image reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
