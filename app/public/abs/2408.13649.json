According to the characteristics of\nthe family, the marginal distributions of the Markov random fields are all\nPoisson with the same mean, and are untied from the strength or structure of\ntheir built-in dependence. This key feature is uncommon for Markov random\nfields and most convenient for applications purposes. The specific properties\nof this new family confer a straightforward sampling procedure and analytic\nexpressions for the joint probability mass function and the joint probability\ngenerating function of the vector of counting random variables, thus granting\ncomputational methods that scale well to vectors of high dimension. We study\nthe distribution of the sum of random variables constituting a Markov random\nfield from the proposed family, analyze a random variable's individual\ncontribution to that sum through expected allocations, and establish stochastic\norderings to assess a wide understanding of their behavior.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
