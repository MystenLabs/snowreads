In this paper, we show that the risk-averse\n{\\em total reward criterion}, under the Entropic Risk Measure (ERM) and\nEntropic Value at Risk (EVaR) risk measures, can be optimized by a stationary\npolicy, making it simple to analyze, interpret, and deploy. We propose\nexponential value iteration, policy iteration, and linear programming to\ncompute optimal policies. In comparison with prior work, our results only\nrequire the relatively mild condition of transient MDPs and allow for {\\em\nboth} positive and negative rewards. Our results indicate that the total reward\ncriterion may be preferable to the discounted criterion in a broad range of\nrisk-averse reinforcement learning domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FfR9c8q7vATIX8tRuXlgw43_P3OA5pEOWCwg4hWuMhg","pdfSize":"442195"}
