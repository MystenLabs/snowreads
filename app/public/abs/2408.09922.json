Landau-Zener Rabi oscillation (LZRO), which arises from\na quantum two-level system swept repeatedly across the avoided crossing point\nin the time domain, has been suggested for widespread use in manipulating\nquantum states. Cold atom is one of the most prominent platforms for quantum\ncomputing and precision measurement. However, LZRO has never been observed in\ncold atoms due to its stringent requirements. By compensating for the linear\ndrift of the clock laser and optimizing experimental parameters, we\nsuccessfully measured LZRO on the strontium atomic optical clock platform under\nboth fast and slow passage limits within $4$ to $6$ driving periods. Compared\nto previous results on other platforms, the duration of the plateau is $10^4$\ntimes longer in the optical lattice clock. The experimental data also suggest\nthat destructive Landau-Zener interference can effectively suppress dephasing\neffects in the optical lattice clock, paving the way for manipulating quantum\nstates against various environmental effects in cold atomic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"O1Bq0ZUuCkPqaxDxnKUPfiANtHkk5xcTspQOY412s8I","pdfSize":"1446242"}
