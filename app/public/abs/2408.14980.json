Fuzzy Message\nDetection (FMD) is a privacy-preserving protocol where an untrusted server\nperforms message anonymously filtering for its clients. To prevent the server\nfrom linking the sender and the receiver, the latter can set how much cover\ntraffic they should download along with genuine messages. This could cause\nunwanted messages to appear on the user's end, thereby creating a need to\nbalance one's bandwidth cost with the desired level of unlinkability. Previous\nwork showed that FMD is not viable with selfish users. In this paper, we model\nand analyze FMD using the tools of empirical game theory and show that the\nsystem needs at least a few altruistic users to operate properly. Utilizing\nreal-world communication datasets, we characterize the emerging equilibria,\nquantify the impact of different types and levels of altruism, and assess the\nefficiency of potential outcomes versus socially optimal allocations. Moreover,\ntaking a mechanism design approach, we show how the betweenness centrality (BC)\nmeasure can be utilized to achieve the social optimum.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
