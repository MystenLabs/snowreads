This connection is not only a\ncoincidence rooted in hyperbolic geometry; it also reflects an additional\ncorrespondence between two distinct theories: mutual information and the\ngeometric BV master equation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
