Building on insights\nfrom nuclear physics, we extract the form of quark three-body interactions and\ndemonstrate that these terms are crucial for extending the quark model fit of\nthe meson spectrum to include baryons using the same parameter set. We then\ndiscuss the implications of our findings for exotic configurations involving\nmore than three quarks, such as the $T_{cc}$ and $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$. We find\nthat the quark three-body interactions provide additional repulsion on the\norder of 10 MeV for the compact configurations of both the $T_{cc}$ and\n$\\chi_{c1}(3872)$. This result, combined with previous calculations, strongly\nsuggests that these tetraquark states are molecular rather than compact states.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oz70tOHybEEyYPv-OiMCOUFSED35ueeksIQmm5TrVOA","pdfSize":"370909"}
