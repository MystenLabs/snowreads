The unit-disk graph $G = (V, E)$\nhas vertex set $V$ and an edge $e_{uv} \\in E$ between vertices $u, v \\in V$ if\nthe Euclidean distance between $u$ and $v$ is at most 1. The weight of each\nedge $e_{uv}$ is the Euclidean distance between $u$ and $v$. Given $V$ and a\nsource point $s\\in V$, we consider the problem of computing shortest paths in\n$G$ from $s$ to all other vertices. The previously best algorithm for this\nproblem runs in $O(n \\log^2 n)$ time [Wang and Xue, SoCG'19]. The problem has\nan $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ lower bound under the algebraic decision tree model. In\nthis paper, we present an improved algorithm of $O(n \\log^2 n / \\log \\log n)$\ntime (under the standard real RAM model). Furthermore, we show that the problem\ncan be solved using $O(n\\log n)$ comparisons under the algebraic decision tree\nmodel, matching the $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ lower bound.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
