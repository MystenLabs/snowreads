Unlike\ngeneral images, where assessing the quality and alignment with text\ndescriptions is trivial, establishing such a relation in a clinical setting\nproves challenging. This work investigates various strategies to evaluate the\nclinical significance of synthetic polyp images of different pathologies. We\nfurther explore if a relation could be established between qualitative results\nand their clinical relevance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
