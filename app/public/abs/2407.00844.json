In this study, we optimize the quantum coherence of a\nnonresonantly excited exciton-polariton condensate of long living polaritons by\nminimizing the condensate's interaction with the surrounding reservoir of\nexcitons and free carriers. By combining experimental phase space data with a\ndisplaced thermal state model, we observe how quantum coherence builds up as\nthe system is driven above the condensation threshold. Our findings demonstrate\nthat a spatial separation between the condensate and the reservoir enhances the\nstate's maximum quantum coherence directly beyond the threshold. These insights\npave the way for integrating polariton systems into hybrid quantum devices and\nadvancing applications in quantum technologies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
