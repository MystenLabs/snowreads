This\npublic dataset facilitates an in-depth examination of brainwave patterns within\nmusical contexts, providing a robust foundation for studying brain network\ntopology during emotional processing. Leveraging the MEEG dataset, we introduce\nthe Attention-based Temporal Learner with Dynamic Graph Neural Network\n(AT-DGNN), a novel framework for EEG-based emotion recognition. This model\ncombines an attention mechanism with a dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) to\ncapture intricate EEG dynamics. The AT-DGNN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance with an accuracy of 83.74% in arousal recognition and 86.01% in\nvalence recognition, outperforming existing SOTA methods. Comparative analysis\nwith traditional datasets, such as DEAP, further validates the model's\neffectiveness and underscores the potency of music as an emotional stimulus.\nThis study advances graph-based learning methodology in brain-computer\ninterfaces (BCI), significantly improving the accuracy of EEG-based emotion\nrecognition. The MEEG dataset and source code are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/xmh1011/AT-DGNN.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
