It can\neffectively transform multi-view images into explicit 3D Gaussian\nrepresentations through efficient training, and achieve real-time rendering of\nnovel views. This survey aims to analyze existing 3DGS-related works from\nmultiple intersecting perspectives, including related tasks, technologies,\nchallenges, and opportunities. The primary objective is to provide newcomers\nwith a rapid understanding of the field and to assist researchers in\nmethodically organizing existing technologies and challenges. Specifically, we\ndelve into the optimization, application, and extension of 3DGS, categorizing\nthem based on their focuses or motivations. Additionally, we summarize and\nclassify nine types of technical modules and corresponding improvements\nidentified in existing works. Based on these analyses, we further examine the\ncommon challenges and technologies across various tasks, proposing potential\nresearch opportunities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5QiCb9tXrmtPwhAQokQw_HNGRtlbe5A20AgeH-AS6fc","pdfSize":"2793339"}
