Manually\nverifying every claim is highly challenging, underscoring the need for an\nautomated fact-checking system. This paper presents our system designed to\naddress this issue. We utilize the Averitec dataset to assess the veracity of\nclaims. In addition to veracity prediction, our system provides supporting\nevidence, which is extracted from the dataset. We develop a Retrieve and\nGenerate (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant evidence sentences from a knowledge\nbase, which are then inputted along with the claim into a large language model\n(LLM) for classification. We also evaluate the few-shot In-Context Learning\n(ICL) capabilities of multiple LLMs. Our system achieves an 'Averitec' score of\n0.33, which is a 22% absolute improvement over the baseline.
