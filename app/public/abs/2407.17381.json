TIM is a NASA-funded balloon-borne experiment designed to probe\nthe peak of the star formation in the Universe. It employs two spectroscopic\nbands, each equipped with a focal plane of four $\\sim\\,$900-pixel, KID-based\narray chips. Measurements of an 864-pixel TIM array shows 791 resonators in a\n0.5$\\,$GHz bandwidth. We discuss challenges with resonator calibration caused\nby this high multiplexing density. We robustly identify the physical positions\nof 788 (99.6$\\,$%) detectors using a custom LED-based identification scheme.\nUsing this information we show that cosmic ray events occur at a rate of\n2.1$\\,\\mathrm{events/min/cm^2}$ in our array. 66$\\,$% of the events affect a\nsingle pixel, and another 33$\\,$% affect $<\\,$5 KIDs per event spread over a\n0.66$\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$ region (2 pixel pitches in radius). We observe a total\ncosmic ray dead fraction of 0.0011$\\,$%, and predict that the maximum possible\nin-flight dead fraction is $\\sim\\,$0.165$\\,$%, which demonstrates our design\nwill be robust against these high-energy events.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"69COSGeA2VyxuEhJPTuw4mYcSumkuFXBfWMjadxbGrw","pdfSize":"1223418"}
