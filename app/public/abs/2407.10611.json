In the\nmodel, we propose the Expectation Supply-Demand Game (ESDG), construct the\nconsumer purchasing decision-making process with feedback and analyse the\nstability of the system under different feedback factors. We processes the data\nof the model in numerical simulation through Min-Max normalisation and predicts\nthe development of NEVs. The results show that: (1) An evolutionary\nstabilisation strategy (ESS) emerges in the evolutionary game model with the\nintroduction of feedback. (2) The Min-Max normalisation method is conducive to\nthe accuracy of the model. (3) Excessive advertising and marketing may cause\nconsumer boredom. (4) The establishment of an appropriate battery compensation\nand replacement insurance is conducive to the development of NEVs. (5) The\nproduction and sales ratio of China's NEVs is predicted to reach 37.2\\% and\n36.9\\% respectively in 2024.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
