In this\npaper, we first study cyberattacks (e.g., flooding of transactions, brute pass)\nin blockchain networks and then propose an efficient collaborative cyberattack\ndetection model to protect blockchain networks. Specifically, we deploy a\nblockchain network in our laboratory to build a new dataset including both\nnormal and attack traffic data. The main aim of this dataset is to generate\nactual attack data from different nodes in the blockchain network that can be\nused to train and test blockchain attack detection models. We then propose a\nreal-time collaborative learning model that enables nodes in the network to\nshare learning knowledge without disclosing their private data, thereby\nsignificantly enhancing system performance for the whole network. The extensive\nsimulation and real-time experimental results show that our proposed detection\nmodel can detect attacks in the blockchain network with an accuracy of up to\n97%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
