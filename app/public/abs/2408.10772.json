In this setup, quotients are determined directly by equivalence\nrelations, as ideals are not applicable for monoids, leading to a new approach\nto factorization theory. To this end, tangible factorization into irreducibles\nis obtained through fiber contractions and their hierarchy. Fiber contractions\nalso provide different quotient structures, associated with covers and types of\nsplitting covers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
