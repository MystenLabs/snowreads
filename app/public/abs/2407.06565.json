Similar to the solutions\nconstructed in \\cite{ABC2}, we first find a special steady solution of ideal\nMHD equations whose linear unstability was proved in \\cite{Lin}. It is possible\nto perturb the unstable scenario of ideal MHD to 3D viscous and resistive MHD\nequations, which can be regarded as the first unstable \"background\" solution.\nOur perturbation argument is based on the spectral theoretic approach\n\\cite{Kato}. The second solution we would construct is a trajectory on the\nunstable manifold associated to the unstable steady solution. It is worth\nnoting that these solutions live precisely on the borderline of the known\nwell-posedness theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
