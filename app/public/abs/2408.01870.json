For example,\nthis is true if $\\mathcal P$ is one of the following properties:\nzero-dimensionality, countable-dimensionality or strong\ncountable-dimensionality.\n  Also, we consider other properties $\\mathcal P$: of being a scattered, or a\nstrongly $\\sigma$-scattered space, or being a $\\Delta_1$-space (see [17]). Our\nresults strengthen and extend several results from [6], [13], [17].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
