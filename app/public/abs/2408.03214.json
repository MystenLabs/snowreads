Recently, some of results proved for the\nWeak Chebyshev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in the case of real Banach spaces were\nextended to the case of complex Banach spaces. In this paper\n  we extend some of known in the real case results for other than WCGA greedy\nalgorithms to the case of complex Banach spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
