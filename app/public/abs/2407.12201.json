On the other hand, when\napplying conventional control methods to realize dynamic tasks with the\nflexible body, there are two difficulties: accurate modeling of the flexible\nbody and the derivation of intermediate postures to achieve the tasks.\nLearning-based methods are considered to be more effective than accurate\nmodeling, but they require explicit intermediate postures. To solve these two\ndifficulties at the same time, we developed a real-time task control method\nwith a deep recurrent neural network named Dynamic Task Execution Network\n(DTXNET), which acquires the relationship among the control command, robot\nstate including image information, and task state. Once the network is trained,\nonly the target event and its timing are needed to realize a given task. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we applied it to the task of\nWadaiko (traditional Japanese drum) drumming as an example, and verified the\nbest configuration of DTXNET.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
