However, due to high dimensionality and nonlinear interaction\nembedded in large-scale complex systems like urban traffic, it remains\nchallenging to identify hidden high-risky states from huge system state space\nwhere over 99% of possible system states are not yet visited in empirical data.\nBased on maximum entropy model, we infer the underlying interaction network\nfrom complicated dynamical processes of urban traffic, and construct system\nenergy landscape. In this way, we can locate hidden high-risky states that have\nnever been observed from real data. These states can serve as risk signals with\nhigh probability of entering hazardous minima in energy landscape, which lead\nto huge recovery cost. Our finding might provide insights for complex system\nrisk management.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
