Most previous methods explore a single noise source,\nrecovering corrupt node embedding by reliable structures bias or developing\nstructure learning with reliable node features. However, the noises and attacks\nmay come from both structures and features in graphs, making the graph\ndenoising a dilemma and challenging problem. In this paper, we develop a\nunified graph denoising (UGD) framework to unravel the deadlock between\nstructure and feature denoising. Specifically, a high-order neighborhood\nproximity evaluation method is proposed to recognize noisy edges, considering\nfeatures may be perturbed simultaneously. Moreover, we propose to refine noisy\nfeatures with reconstruction based on a graph auto-encoder. An iterative\nupdating algorithm is further designed to optimize the framework and acquire a\nclean graph, thus enabling robust graph learning for downstream tasks. Our UGD\nframework is self-supervised and can be easily implemented as a plug-and-play\nmodule. We carry out extensive experiments, which proves the effectiveness and\nadvantages of our method.
