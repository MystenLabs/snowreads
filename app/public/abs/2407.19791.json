Using binomial expansions\ninstead of Taylor series, this new definition bridges locally analytic vectors\nin characteristic $0$ and $p$.\n  Our main theorem shows that under certain conditions, the map $W \\mapsto\nW^{\\mathrm{la}}$ acts as a descent, and the derived locally analytic vectors\n$\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{la}}^i(W)$ vanish for $i \\geq 1$. This result extends\nTheorem C of \\cite{Po24}, providing new tools for propagating information about\nlocally analytic vectors from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$.\n  We provide three applications: a new proof of Berger-Rozensztajn's main\nresult using characteristic $0$ methods, the introduction of an integral\nmultivariable ring $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}_{\\mathrm{LT}}^{\\dagger,\\mathrm{la}}$\nin the Lubin-Tate setting, and a novel interpretation of the classical Cohen\nring ${\\mathbf{A}}_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$ from the theory of\n$(\\varphi,\\Gamma)$-modules in terms of locally analytic vectors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
