We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an\naxial magnetic field of ~ 10T, the ballistic conductance at low carrier\ndensities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find\nthat this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved but can be even\nenhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive\nmagnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero\nenergy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved\ngraphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive\nphenomena.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
