We also consider the mesh with\nand without shape regularity. For shape regular mesh, finite element method for\nnonlocal diffusion model is asymptotic preserving and the error is\n$O(h^k+\\delta)$. For shape irregular mesh, the error becomes\n$O(\\frac{h^{k+1}}{\\delta}+\\delta)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
