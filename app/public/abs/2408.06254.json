However, existing $V_{min}$ prediction methods often overlook\nvarious sources of variations in both training and deployment phases. Notably,\nthe neglect of wafer zone-to-zone (intra-wafer) variations and wafer-to-wafer\n(inter-wafer) variations, compounded by process variations, diminishes the\naccuracy, data efficiency, and reliability of $V_{min}$ predictors. To address\nthis gap, we introduce a novel data-efficient $V_{min}$ prediction flow, termed\nrestricted bias alignment (RBA), which incorporates a novel variation alignment\ntechnique. Our approach concurrently estimates inter- and intra-wafer\nvariations. Furthermore, we propose utilizing class probe data to model\ninter-wafer variations for the first time. We empirically demonstrate RBA's\neffectiveness and data efficiency on an industrial 16nm automotive chip\ndataset.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
