Given the emergent nature of these representations,\nsonifications, and physicalizations lack formalized conventions (e.g., design\nspace, vocabulary) that can introduce challenges for audiences to interpret the\nintended data encoding. To address this challenge, this work focuses on how\nannotations can be more tightly integrated into the design process of creating\nsonifications and physicalizations. In an exploratory study with 13 designers,\nwe explore how visualization annotation techniques can be adapted to sonic and\nphysical modalities. Our work highlights how annotations for sonification and\nphysicalizations are inseparable from their data encodings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
