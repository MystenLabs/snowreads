The defect\nconcentrations either strictly follow or can be closely approximated by\nArrhenius functions with parameters predicted by the model. The model is\ngeneral and applicable to other carbides, nitrides, borides, or similar\nchemical compounds. Implications of this work for understanding the diffusion\nmechanisms in TaC and HfC are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
