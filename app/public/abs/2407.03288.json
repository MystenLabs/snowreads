We prove analytic\nand geometric characterizations of those domains with the aid of the spherical\nmetric and the hyperbolic metric. We also study the relation of our definition\nto the definition of classical bounded H\\\"{o}lder domains. It turns out that\nunbounded H\\\"older domains form a natural class of domains for the study of the\nHardy number (which determines the Hardy spaces to which the corresponding\nRiemann mapping belongs to). As an application of our characterizations, we\nprove a sharp bound for the Hardy number of an unbounded H\\\"{o}lder domain.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
