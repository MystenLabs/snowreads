In order to do so, we investigate the response of\nlong-range systems to diverse external drivings, emphasizing their robustness\nagainst dynamic excitation in comparison to generic local systems. This\nphenomenon is demonstrated through the study of the quantum work statistics,\nrevealing insights into energy transfer efficiency and dynamical quantum\ncriticality. Our results demonstrate the benefits of including a long-range\ninteracting medium for quantum thermodynamics application, highlighting the\npotential to optimize finite-time quantum thermal cycles. Thanks to the\neffective dimension approach our findings can be drawn in full generality and,\nthen, specified to different experimentally relevant scenarios.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
