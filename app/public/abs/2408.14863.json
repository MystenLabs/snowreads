The phase behavior of the confined\nblock copolymers is regulated by the degree of confinement and the selectivity\nof the homopolymers, resulting in a rich variety of novel structures. When the\nC homopolymers are neutral to the A- and B-blocks, stacked lamellae (SL) are\nformed where the number of layers increases with the droplet volume, resulting\nin a morphological transition sequence from Janus particle to square SL. When\nthe C homopolymers are strongly selective to the B-blocks, a series of\nnon-lamellar morphologies, including onion-, hamburger-, cross-, ring-, and\ncookie-like structures, are observed. A detailed free energy analysis reveals a\nfirst-order reversible transformation between SL and onion-like (OL) structures\nwhen the selectivity of the homopolymers is changed. Our results provide a\ncomprehensive understanding of how various factors, such as the copolymer\nconcentration, homopolymer chain length, degree of confinement, homopolymer\nselectivity, affect the self-assembled structures of diblock copolymers under\nsoft 3D confinement.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
