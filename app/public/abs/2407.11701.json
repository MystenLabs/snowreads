Examining historical\ndepictions of olfactory scenes can offer valuable insights into the role of\nsmells in history. We show that a transfer-learning approach using weakly\nlabeled training data can remarkably improve the classification of fragrant\nspaces and, more generally, artistic scene depictions. We fine-tune\nPlaces365-pre-trained models by querying two cultural heritage data sources and\nusing the search terms as supervision signal. The models are evaluated on two\nmanually corrected test splits. This work lays a foundation for further\nexploration of fragrant spaces recognition and artistic scene classification.\nAll images and labels are released as the ArtPlaces dataset at\nhttps://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11584328.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YaIlF-BAe4wjJzRK5Ay2jsjxiVStb31K-ym-mbH57h4","pdfSize":"13743190"}
