We show\nthat the largest deflections, which can be measured by weak gravitational\nlensing, are in a region displaced from the center of mass. This result can be\nextended to more general distributions of matter. This displacement, observed\nin galaxies and colliding galaxy clusters, may be therefore explained without\ndark matter, within general relativity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
