By estimating the density of new samples, both methods are able to find\nnormality scores. The methods can be seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end\narchitecture and optimized using gradient-based optimization techniques. To\nevaluate their performance, extensive experiments were conducted on various\nbenchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that both versions of the method\ncan achieve comparable or superior performance when compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods. Notably, the shallow approach performs better on\ndatasets with fewer dimensions, while the autoencoder-based approach shows\nimproved performance on datasets with higher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Quantum Physics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
