Researchers have developed surrogate\nsolvers for predicting electric fields to alleviate the computational issues.\nHowever, existing surrogate solvers are limited to performing inference at\nfixed simulation conditions and require retraining for different conditions. To\naddress this, we propose Wave Interpolation Neural Operator (WINO), a novel\nsurrogate solver enabling simulation condition interpolation across a\ncontinuous spectrum of broadband wavelengths. WINO introduces the Fourier Group\nConvolution Shuffling operator and a new conditioning method to efficiently\npredict electric fields from both trained and untrained wavelength data,\nachieving significant improvements in parameter efficiency and spectral\ninterpolation performance. Our model demonstrates approximately 100 times\nfaster performance than traditional finite-difference frequency-domain\nsimulations. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art model, we achieve a 74%\nreduction in parameters and 80.5% improvements in prediction accuracy for\nuntrained wavelengths, and 13.2% improvements for trained wavelengths.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
