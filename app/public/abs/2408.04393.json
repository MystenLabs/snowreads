The\n\\textit{interval coloring impropriety} of $G$, denoted by $\\mu_{int}(G)$, is\nthe smallest value $k$ such that $G$ has an improper interval edge coloring\nwhere at most $k$ edges of $G$ with a common endpoint have the same color.\n  The purpose of this note is to communicate solutions to two previous\nquestions on interval coloring impropriety, mainly regarding planar graphs.\nFirst, we prove $\\mu_{int}(G) \\leq 2$ for every outerplanar graph $G$. This\nconfirms the conjecture by Casselgren and Petrosyan in the affirmative.\nSecondly, we prove that for each $k\\geq 2$, the interval coloring impropriety\nof $k$-trees is unbounded. This refutes the conjecture by Carr, Cho, Crawford,\nIr\\v{s}i\\v{c}, Pai and Robinson.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
