In particular, we classify even order algebraically\ntrivial non symplectic automorphisms, with or without trivial discriminant\naction. In the case of nontrivial discriminant actions, we show that such\nautomorphisms exist only for finitely many known deformation types and orders.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
