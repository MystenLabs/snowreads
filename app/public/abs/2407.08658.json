The aim is to enhance human-machine interaction by\nenabling intuitive voice control of drone actions. The pipelines developed\ninclude: (1) a traditional Speech-to-Text (STT) followed by a Large Language\nModel (LLM) approach, (2) a direct voice-to-function mapping model, and (3) a\nSiamese neural network-based system. Each pipeline was evaluated based on\ninference time, accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility. Detailed methodologies,\ndataset preparation, and evaluation metrics are provided, offering a\ncomprehensive analysis of each pipeline's strengths and applicability across\ndifferent scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
