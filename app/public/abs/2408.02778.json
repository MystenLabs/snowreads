These circuits have many favorable properties, including a\ntunable amount of non-Clifford resources and a deterministic output, and\nmoreover do not belong to any class of quantum circuits which is known to be\nefficiently simulable. We show that this family of circuits can in fact be\nsimulated in polynomial time via symbolic path integrals. We do so by endowing\nsymbolic sums with a confluent rewriting system and show that this rewriting\nsystem suffices to reduce the circuit's path integral to the hidden shift in\npolynomial-time. We hence resolve an open conjecture about the efficient\nsimulability of this class of circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
