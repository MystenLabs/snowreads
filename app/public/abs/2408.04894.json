The theorem is known to be generalized to $2n \\times 2n$\nreal symmetric positive semidefinite matrices whose kernels are symplectic\nsubspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, in which case, some of the diagonal entries of\n$D$ are allowed to be zero. In this paper, we further generalize Williamson's\ntheorem to $2n \\times 2n$ real symmetric matrices by allowing the diagonal\nelements of $D$ to be any real numbers, and thus extending the notion of\nsymplectic eigenvalues to real symmetric matrices. Also, we provide an explicit\ndescription of symplectic eigenvalues, construct symplectic matrices achieving\nWilliamson's theorem type decomposition, and establish perturbation bounds on\nsymplectic eigenvalues for a class of $2n \\times 2n$ real symmetric matrices\ndenoted by $\\operatorname{EigSpSm}(2n)$. The set $\\operatorname{EigSpSm}(2n)$\ncontains $2n \\times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite whose kernels are\nsymplectic subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. Our perturbation bounds on\nsymplectic eigenvalues for $\\operatorname{EigSpSm}(2n)$ generalize known\nperturbation bounds on symplectic eigenvalues of positive definite matrices\ngiven by Bhatia and Jain \\textit{[J.
