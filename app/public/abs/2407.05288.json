To address these problems, this study proposes a spatio-temporal\nmodel that incorporates skewness while maintaining mean and variance, by\napplying the flexible subclass of the closed skew-normal distribution. An\nefficient sampling method is introduced, leveraging the autoregressive\nrepresentation of the model. Additionally, the model's symmetry concerning\nspatial order is demonstrated, and Mardia's skewness and kurtosis are derived,\nshowing independence from the mean and variance. Simulation studies compare the\nestimation performance of the proposed model with that of the Gaussian model.\nThe result confirms its superiority in high skewness and low observation noise\nscenarios. The identification of Cobb-Douglas production functions across US\nstates is examined as an application to real data, revealing that the proposed\nmodel excels in both goodness-of-fit and predictive performance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
