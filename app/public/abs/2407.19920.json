In\nGrothendieck's anabelian letter to Faltings, he conjectured that sending a\n$k$-scheme to its \\'{e}tale topos defines a fully faithful functor from the\nlocalization of the category of finite type $k$-schemes at the universal\nhomeomorphisms to a category of topoi. We prove Grothendieck's conjecture for\ninfinite fields of arbitrary characteristic. In characteristic $0$, this shows\nthat seminormal finite type $k$-schemes can be reconstructed from their\n\\'{e}tale topoi, generalizing work of Voevodsky. In positive characteristic,\nthis shows that perfections of finite type $k$-schemes can be reconstructed\nfrom their \\'{e}tale topoi.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
