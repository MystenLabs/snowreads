As corollaries we deduce (using a criterion of\nClemens-Griffiths) that $X$, as well as the general smooth quartic $3$-fold, is\nirrational. These corollaries were known: Iskovskih-Manin \\cite{IM} proved that\nevery smooth quartic $3$-fold is irrational. However, the method of proof here\nis different than that of \\cite{IM} and is significantly simpler.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
