They are the topological consequences of Dirac points.\nSuperconducting states from Dirac semimetals can inherit the Dirac points to\nform nodal Dirac superconducting states, raising a question of whether there\nexists a topological superconducting bulk-hinge correspondence similar to DSMs.\nIn this work, we discuss the nodal superconducting states from half-filled DSMs\nrespecting non-magnetic (Type-II) Shubnikov space group (SSG) $P6/mmm1'$. We\nfind that the BdG Dirac points can lead to higher-order topological Dirac\nsuperconducting (HOTDSC) states instead of the expected higher-order\nMajorana-arc (HOMA) states. The HOTDSC states can be regarded as a crossing\nbetween the HOFAs in normal states and the BdG shadow states. We demonstrate\nthat HOTDSC states can be indicated by relative topologies of BdG Dirac points\nby utilizing the theory of magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"llvcqW78LnIsVmlstHWwPHg5Ow3pGJfyfi5llOR3fxc","pdfSize":"1764142"}
