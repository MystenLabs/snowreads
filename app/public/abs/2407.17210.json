The result is an\ninfinite lattice for most sets, while only a few initial sets of points perform\na finite lattice. By giving an adequate notion of the configuration of points,\nwe identify which sets in the plane define a finite convex hull lattice: four\nregular families and one sporadic configuration. We explore configurations in\nthe space and higher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WCUh0peelaqmdlf7EsO5j7JnFTH4hAzq-bqp0GC0Nrc","pdfSize":"825762"}
