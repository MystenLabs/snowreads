However, current\napproximations to the Hellings-Downs curve for subluminal gravitational wave\npropagation, say $v<1$, diverge at small angular pulsar separation. In this\npaper, we find that the ORF for the $v<1$ case is sensitive to finite distance\neffects. First, we show that finite distance effects introduce an effective\ncut-off in the spherical harmonics decomposition at $\\ell\\sim \\sqrt{1-v^2} \\,\nkL$, where $\\ell$ is the multipole number, $k$ the wavenumber of the\ngravitational wave and $L$ the distance to the pulsars. Then, we find that the\noverlap reduction function in the small angle limit approaches a value given by\n$\\pi kL\\,v^2\\,(1-v^2)^2$ times a normalization factor, exactly matching the\nvalue for the autocorrelation recently derived. Although we focus on the $v<1$\ncase, our formulation is valid for any value of $v$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
