Taking the puzzling chiral nucleus $^{106}$Ag as an\nexample, the experimental energies of the observed nearly degenerate bands are\nwell reproduced without any free parameters beyond the well-defined density\nfunctional. A novel chiral mode in soft triaxial nuclei is newly revealed from\nthe microscopic dynamics of the total angular momentum. This opens a new\nresearch area for the study of chirality, particularly in relation to soft\nnuclear shapes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NEuWgBhXAQRX9-ewDlS1Fzcw_ZGElw7OuDGWunvF_c0","pdfSize":"732099"}
