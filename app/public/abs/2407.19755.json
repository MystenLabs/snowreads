With an external magnetic field applied,\naxion DM generates an oscillating electric field which causes the excitation of\nthe qubit; such an excitation can be regarded as a signal of the axion DM. We\nprovide a theoretical consideration of the excitation process of the qubits\ntaking into account the effects of the shielding cavity surrounding the qubits\nand estimate the signal rate for the axion DM detection. We also discuss the\nenhancement of the DM signal by using cavity resonance and entangled quantum\nsensors realized by a quantum circuit. Combining these two effects, we can\nreach the parameter region suggested by QCD axion models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ALiV4KHj0xtl7mNu5VHVKU0wpyDLSyHJbKAqL3I5Tco","pdfSize":"629572"}
