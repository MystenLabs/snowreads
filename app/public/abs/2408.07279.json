Our proposed layout automation process leverages a\ntemplate-and-grid-based layout generation framework to create process-portable\nlayout generators tailored for various custom circuits, including standard\ncells and high-speed mixed-signal circuits. However, rather than directly\ndescribing the layout generators in traditional programming language, we\nutilize natural language using LLMs to make the layout generation process more\nintuitive and efficient. This approach also supports interactive modifications\nof the layout generator code, enhancing customization capabilities. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our LLM-based layout generation method across\nseveral custom circuit examples, such as logic standard cells, a serializer and\na strong arm latch, including their completeness in terms of Design Rule Check\n(DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) test, and post-layout performance for\nhigh-speed circuits. Our experimental results indicate that LLMs can generate a\ndiverse range of circuit layouts with substantial customization options.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
