The Ising model involves an asymptotic boundary condition with\nspins pointing opposite to the magnetic field. The topological constraint\nenforces a single domain wall between the spins of opposite direction, with the\ntopology of a circle. The resolvent of JT gravity is related to the free energy\nof this Ising model, and the classical limit of JT gravity corresponds to the\nIsing low-temperature limit. We study this Ising model through a Monte Carlo\napproach and a mean-field approximation. For finite truncations of the infinite\nhyperbolic lattice, the map between both theories is only valid in a regime in\nwhich the domain wall has a finite size. For the extremal cases of large\npositive or negative coupling, the domain wall either shrinks to zero or\ntouches the boundary of the lattice. This behavior is confirmed by the\nmean-field analysis. We expect that our results may be used as a starting point\nfor establishing a holographic matrix model duality for discretized gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
