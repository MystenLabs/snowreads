In this regard, High\nAltitude Platforms (HAPs) have drawn great attention in recent years due to\ntheir unique characteristics such as high coverage, long operational\ndurability, and ad-hoc movement. However, for the active usage of HAPs, channel\nmodels for their various usage scenarios must be well-defined, especially in\nthose cases where the sophisticated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\ntechniques, such as beamforming, are utilized to increase the data rate.\nTherefore, in this study, an air-to-air (A2A) three dimensional (3D)\ngeometrical channel model is proposed to characterize the beamforming\ncapabilities of non-stationary HAP networks operating at millimeter wave\n(mmWave) frequency band. In this regard, the 3D geometry of the two HAPs in the\nair is analyzed, and the effect of Doppler due to the movement of HAPs is\ninterrogated as well as its effect on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The\nfinal outputs of this study show that the proposed A2A channel model is\napplicable to characterize the future sixth generation (6G) HAP networks when\nthe mmWave is used to utilize beamforming with a large number of antennas.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
