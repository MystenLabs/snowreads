This mode will comprise three\nclassical Lyot coronagraphs with different occulting spot sizes, one vector\napodized phase plate, and two sparse aperture masks. One critical aspect of\nthese modes lies in their sensitivity to aberrations, requiring careful\nintegration of non common path aberrations, as well as turbulent adaptive\noptics (AO) residuals. Besides, they will be operated following a specific\nobserving strategy based on pupil tracking mode. For these reasons, we have\ndeveloped the MICADO SimulaTor for HIgh Contrast (MISTHIC) pipeline to simulate\nrealistic image cubes and derive the expected performance of these modes.\nSeveral sources of aberrations can be included: turbulent AO residuals, but\nalso static or rotating aberrations, amplitude aberrations, simple Zernike\nscreens... Including MICADO's specific features, such as the absence of\natmospheric dispersion prior to the coronagraphic focal plane mask, our intent\nis to make this pipeline available to the community. This tool can be used to\nprepare scientific observations with the high contrast mode of MICADO, by\npredicting the performance to be expected within the most realistic\nassumptions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
