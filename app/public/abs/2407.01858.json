In this paper, we present the results of our\nstudy on the energetic ion composition of magnetic switchback events using\nstatistical methods with the aim of obtaining new insights into the underlying\nphysics. In doing so, we find consistent differences in arrival times of the\npeak flux of different energetic ion species in magnetic switchbacks which are\nindicative of switchback formed remotely in the solar corona and propagated\noutwards in the solar wind. We also find that while the data does not directly\ncontradict a linear interchange reconnection model nor the flux rope driven\ninterchange reconnection model, the structure of the plasma within the\nswitchbacks themselves is reminiscent of reconnection produced plasmoids.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
