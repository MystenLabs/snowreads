In this paper, we\npropose a general family of methods to detect all such sets for the first time\nin the literature, with no parametric assumptions on the outcome models and\nwith flexible parametric and semiparametric assumptions on the predictor within\nthe treatment groups; the latter induces desired sample-level accuracy. We show\nthat the collection of sufficient adjustment sets can uniquely facilitate\nmultiple types of studies in causal inference, including sharpening the\nestimation of average causal effect and recovering fundamental connections\nbetween the outcome and the treatment hidden in the dependence structure of the\npredictor. These findings are illustrated by simulation studies and a real data\nexample at the end.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
