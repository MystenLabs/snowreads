More specifically, when $X$ is a finite set we provide\nterminal embeddings that are locally $\\frac{1}{2}$-H\\\"{o}lder almost\neverywhere, and when $X$ is infinite with positive reach we give terminal\nembeddings that are locally $\\frac{1}{4}$-H\\\"{o}lder everywhere sufficiently\nclose to $X$ (i.e., within all tubes around $X$ of radius less than $X$'s\nreach). When $X$ is a compact $d$-dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^N$, an\napplication of our main results provides terminal embeddings into\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d)$-dimensional space that are locally H\\\"{o}lder\neverywhere sufficiently close to the manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
