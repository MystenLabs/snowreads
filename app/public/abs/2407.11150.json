We review the\nframework of extended relativity (ER) in Clifford spaces (C-spaces),\nsummarizing some of its concepts, methods and results. We also discuss likely\nlinks of this approach with other relativities (OR), beyond GR and SM theories,\nrecent ideas from emergent spacetime (ES) and quantum entanglement (QE), in\nsearch for quantum gravity (QG) and unification (U). Finally, we explore and\nexpose the need to go even beyond ER, and the challenges it poses, from both\nexperimental and theoretical sides.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cfxGxCm95Dw2Tm76ciPyWgvkvFGnTyzX_P9zYDKYPiY","pdfSize":"1316425"}
