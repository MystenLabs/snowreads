Experimental data related to this question are\navailable from trials in which FP programs increase access to FP. While program\nassignment is unconfounded, FP uptake and subsequent empowerment may share\ncommon causes. We use principal stratification to estimate the causal effect of\nan intermediate FP outcome on a primary outcome of interest, among women\naffected by a FP program. Within strata defined by the potential reaction to\nthe program, FP uptake is unconfounded. To minimize the need for parametric\nassumptions, we propose to use Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for\nmodeling stratum membership and outcomes of interest. We refer to the combined\napproach as Prince BART. We evaluate Prince BART through a simulation study and\nuse it to assess the causal effect of modern contraceptive use on employment in\nsix cities in Nigeria, based on quasi-experimental data from a FP program trial\nduring the first half of the 2010s. We show that findings differ between Prince\nBART and alternative modeling approaches based on parametric assumptions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
