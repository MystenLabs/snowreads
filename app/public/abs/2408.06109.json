Spectral Granger causality (SGC) is a prediction-based measure\ncharacterizing directed information flow at specific oscillatory frequencies.\nHowever, traditional vector autoregressive (VAR) approaches are insufficient to\nassess SGC when time series have mixed frequencies (MF) or are coupled by\nnonlinearity. Here we propose a time-frequency canonical correlation analysis\napproach (\"MF-TFCCA\") to assess the strength and driving frequency of spectral\ninformation flow. We validate the approach with intensive computer simulations\non MF time series under various interaction conditions and assess statistical\nsignificance of the estimate with surrogate data. We further apply MF-TFCCA to\nreal-life finance, climate and neuroscience data. Our analysis framework\nprovides an exploratory and computationally efficient approach to quantify\ndirected information flow between MF time series in the presence of complex and\nnonlinear interactions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
