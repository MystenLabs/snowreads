The current approach is based on manual\ncomparison done by forensic experts. In this article, we present our approach\nto acquire, formalise, and specify expert knowledge to improve the current\nprocess. For modelling the underlying knowledge we use an ontology coupled with\nlogical rules. The different steps of our approach are designed to be reused in\nother application domains. The results obtained are explainable making them\nusable by experts in different fields.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
