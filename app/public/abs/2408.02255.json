In particular, the self couplings of the\nHiggs boson, and its couplings with gauge bosons, are still to be fully\ndetermined. We consider electroweak corrections to the process $H\\rightarrow\n\\nu_e\\bar{\\nu}_e\\nu_\\mu\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$. The corrections depend on the $HHH$ and\n$ZZHH$ couplings. We investigate this dependence in $\\kappa$-framework. We find\nthat the width depends on $HHH$ coupling significantly. The dependence on\n$ZZHH$ coupling is only marginal. We also discuss the dependence on $ZZWW$\ncoupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
