Under rather natural assumptions we demonstrate\nthat, even in the presence of poloidal magnetic fluctuations, it is possible to\ndeal with a reduced model for the turbulence dynamics. This model relies on a\nsingle equation for the electric potential, from which all the physical\nturbulent properties can be calculated. The main result of the present analysis\nconcerns the existence of a specific Fourier branch for the dynamics which\ndemonstrate the attractive character of the two-dimensional turbulence with\nrespect to non-axisymmetric fluctuations. The peculiar nature of this\ninstability, affecting the non-axially symmetric modes, is discussed in some\ndetail, by recovering two different physical regimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U7qu7DMQ3NNup7upEPPeMdkTSyNZ_MvBLQ9q0iu-1LE","pdfSize":"462070"}
