We\nuse baryon number density and its susceptibilities to calculate the expansion\ncoefficients in the $T'$-expansion scheme with and without the Stefan-Boltzmann\nlimit correction. Our methodology involves comparing truncation orders to exact\nsolutions to assess the scheme's accuracy. We utilize Ideal, Excluded Volume,\nand van der Waals formulations of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model at low\ntemperatures, and the Cluster Expansion Model at higher temperatures. Our\nfindings indicate that the $T'$-expansion scheme offers superior convergence\nproperties near and above the chiral crossover temperature, where the\nchiral-criticality-inspired scaling $(\\partial/ \\partial T)_{\\mu_B} \\sim\n(\\partial^2/\\partial \\mu_B^2)_T$ holds. However, it shows limited improvement\nin the HRG models, indicating that it may not be the most suitable choice for\ndescribing the hadronic phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yogZsdVEeAbm4jthEvLCbBzeTviNZSs_rOV9OJ0mRZA","pdfSize":"2977638"}
