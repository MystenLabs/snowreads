These procedures\nrequire accurate mathematical models of not only the catheter and tendons but\nalso their interactions with surrounding tissue and vasculature in order to\ncontrol the robot path and interaction. This paper presents a mechanical model\nof a tendon-driven robotic catheter system based on Cosserat rods and\nintegrated with a stable, implicit Euler scheme. We implement the Cosserat rod\nas a model for a simple catheter centerline and validate its physical accuracy\nagainst a large deformation analytical model and experimental data. The\ncatheter model is then supplemented by adding a second Cosserat rod to model a\nsingle tendon, using penalty forces to define the constraints of the\ntendon-catheter system. All the model parameters are defined by the catheter\nproperties established by the design. The combined model is validated against\nexperimental data to confirm its physical accuracy. This model represents a new\ncontribution to the field of robotic catheter modeling in which both the\ntendons and catheter are modeled by mechanical Cosserat rods and\nfully-validated against experimental data in the case of the single rod system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
