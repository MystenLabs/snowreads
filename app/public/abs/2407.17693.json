We identify the fundamental acoustic modes in\nthe crystal samples structures as well as characterise their loss properties\nand non-linear effects at both room and cryogenic temperatures. We compare\nthese results to similar resonators made from quartz and conclude that lithium\nniobate may be suitable for certain experiments due to its low-loss and strong\npiezoelectric coupling. Additionally, we provide evidence for the reduction of\ncrystal lattice defect sites by thermal annealing. We report exceptional\nquality factors for bulk acoustic modes in lithium niobate, with a maximum\nrecorded quality factor of 8.9 million with a corresponding quality factor\n$\\times$ frequency product of 3.8 $\\times 10^{14}$ Hz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
