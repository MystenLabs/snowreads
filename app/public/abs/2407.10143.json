It is used to give\nstrong lower bounds on the Waring decomposition of polynomials (called Waring\nrank). This naturally leads to an interesting open question: does this measure\nessentially characterize the Waring rank of any polynomial?\n  The well-studied model of Read-once Oblivious ABPs (ROABPs for short) lends\nitself to an interesting hierarchy of 'sub-models': Any-Order-ROABPs (ARO),\nCommutative ROABPs, and Diagonal ROABPs. It follows from previous works that\nfor any polynomial, a bound on its Waring rank implies an analogous bound on\nits Diagonal ROABP complexity (called the duality trick), and a bound on its\ndimension of partial derivatives implies an analogous bound on its 'ARO\ncomplexity': ROABP complexity in any order (Nisan, 1991). Our work strengthens\nthe latter connection by showing that a bound on the dimension of partial\nderivatives in fact implies a bound on the commutative ROABP complexity. Thus,\nwe improve our understanding of partial derivatives and move a step closer\ntowards answering the above question.\n  Our proof builds on the work of Ramya and Tengse (2022) to show that the\ncommutative-ROABP-width of any homogeneous polynomial is at most the dimension\nof its partial derivatives. The technique itself is a generalization of the\nproof of the duality trick due to Saxena (2008).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
