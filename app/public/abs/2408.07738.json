We propose and study a flexible class of discrete-time parametric\nsurvival models that handle the censoring problem through joint modeling of the\ninterval-censored secondary event, the outcome, and the censoring mechanism. We\napply this model to the research question that motivated the methodology,\nestimating the effect of HIV status on all-cause mortality in a prospective\ncohort study in South Africa.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
