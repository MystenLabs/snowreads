The General\nLake Model (GLM), a one-dimensional process-based model, has been widely used\nfor this purpose, but, similar to many process-based simulation models, it:\nrequires a large number of input variables, many of which are stochastic;\npresents challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ); and can exhibit model\nbias. To address these issues, we propose a Gaussian process (GP)\nsurrogate-based forecasting approach that efficiently handles large,\nhigh-dimensional data and accounts for input-dependent variability and\nsystematic GLM bias. We validate the proposed approach and compare it with\nother forecasting methods, including a climatological model and raw GLM\nsimulations. Our results demonstrate that our bias-corrected GP surrogate\n(GPBC) can outperform competing approaches in terms of forecast accuracy and UQ\nup to two weeks into the future.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"E5YYQIkPEZIayS8sHa_5vDvJ0qilWi_4apka39nDwno","pdfSize":"6008817"}
