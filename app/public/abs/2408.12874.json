Directed hypergraphs are useful in many applications, including the study\nof chemical reactions or relational databases. We provide asymptotic formulae\nfor the number of directed hypergraphs with given in-degree sequence,\nout-degree sequence, and the head and tail sizes of all directed hyperedges\nspecified. Our formulae hold when none of the following parameters are too\nlarge: the maximum out-degree, the maximum in-degree, the maximum head size and\nthe maximum tail size. If one of the four parameter sequences is near-regular,\nfor example if each directed hyperedge has a tail of roughly the same size,\nthen our formula is obtained using a simple argument based on existing\nasymptotic enumeration results for sparse bipartite graphs with given degree\nsequences. We also establish the same formula without the regularity assumption\nbut with a larger relative error term, using a martingale argument.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1xcgN5HfbRSD3Q62IyTm5eSyGEio40SRuq4ZNV3_y6Y","pdfSize":"302830"}
