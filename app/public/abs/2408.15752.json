We propose that the\nbulk carriers of this holographic timelike entanglement entropy are\nboundary-anchored extremal surfaces probing analytic continuation of\nholographic spacetimes into complex coordinates. This proposal not only\nprovides a geometric interpretation of all the known cases obtained by direct\nanalytic continuation of closed-form expressions of holographic entanglement\nentropy of a strip subregion but crucially also opens a window to study\nholographic timelike entanglement entropy in full generality. We initialize the\ninvestigation of complex extremal surfaces anchored on a timelike strip at the\nboundary of anti-de Sitter black branes. We find multiple complex extremal\nsurfaces and discuss possible principles singling out the physical\ncontribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
