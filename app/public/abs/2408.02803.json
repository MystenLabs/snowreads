However, many VTO tools fail to consider the crucial relationship\nbetween a garment's size and the user's body size, often employing a\none-size-fits-all approach when visualizing a clothing item. This results in\npoor size recommendations and purchase decisions leading to increased return\nrates. To address this limitation, we introduce SiCo, an online VTO system,\nwhere users can upload images of themselves and visualize how different sizes\nof clothing would look on their body to help make better-informed purchase\ndecisions. Our user study shows SiCo's superiority over baseline VTO. The\nresults indicate that our approach significantly enhances user ability to gauge\nthe appearance of outfits on their bodies and boosts their confidence in\nselecting clothing sizes that match desired goals. Based on our evaluation, we\nbelieve our VTO design has the potential to reduce return rates and enhance the\nonline clothes shopping experience.
