The method provides an efficient way of realizing\nunconventional topological spin textures by optimizing the interaction\nparameters. In order to demonstrate its usefulness, we show that the tuning of\nthe long-range exchange interactions can give rise to a square skyrmion crystal\neven without factors that have been previously identified as prerequisites for\nits stabilization, such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, multi-spin\ninteraction, and bond-dependent magnetic anisotropy. Moreover, we elucidate the\nessence for the emergence of the square skyrmion crystal by classifying the\nparameter sets we get by the method. Since the present framework by adopting\nmachine learning techniques can be universally applied to any magnetic system\nirrespective of lattice structures, it serves as the efficient construction of\nan effective spin model and the understanding of the stabilization mechanisms\nfor unconventional topological spin orders.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
