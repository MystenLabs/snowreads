Traditional learning-based models often suffer from performance\ndegradation when encountering unseen traffic patterns due to a lack of\ncontinual learning capabilities. This paper proposes a novel car-following\nmodel based on continual learning that addresses this limitation. Our framework\nincorporates Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS)\ntechniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable the model to learn\nincrementally from new traffic data streams. We evaluate the performance of the\nproposed model on the Waymo and Lyft datasets which encompass various traffic\nscenarios. The results demonstrate that the continual learning techniques\nsignificantly outperform the baseline model, achieving 0\\% collision rates\nacross all traffic conditions. This research contributes to the advancement of\nautonomous driving technology by fostering the development of more robust and\nadaptable car-following models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
