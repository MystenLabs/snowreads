We introduce a number of techniques built on different\ngeometric properties of the varieties of interest. Our main result is a simple\ncharacterization of the linear preservers of secant varieties of Segre\nvarieties in many cases, including $\\sigma_r((\\mathbb{P}^{n-1})^{\\times k})$\nfor all $r \\leq n^{\\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor}$. We also characterize the linear\npreservers of several other sets of tensors, including subspace varieties, the\nvariety of slice rank one tensors, symmetric tensors of bounded Waring rank,\nthe variety of biseparable tensors, and hyperdeterminantal surfaces.\nComputational techniques and applications in quantum information theory are\ndiscussed. We provide geometric proofs for several previously known results on\nlinear preservers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
