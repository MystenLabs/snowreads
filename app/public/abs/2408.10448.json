Specifically, we show that the complete\nsymmetric directed graph $K^*_n$ admits a decomposition into spanning\nsubdigraphs comprised of two vertex-disjoint directed cycles of length $t_1$\nand $t_2$, respectively, where $t_1\\in \\{4,6\\}$, $t_2$ is even, and\n$t_1+t_2\\geqslant 14$. In conjunction with recent results of Kadri and\n\\v{S}ajna, this gives a complete solution to the directed Oberwolfach problem\nwith two tables of different lengths.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
