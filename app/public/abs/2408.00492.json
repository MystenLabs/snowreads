Cantarella, J. Parsley, J. Geom. Phys. 60:1127 (2010)] Cantarella and\nParsley introduced the notion of submanifold helicity. In the present paper we\ninvestigate properties of surface helicity and in particular answer two open\nquestions posed in the aforementioned work: (i) We give a precise\nmathematically rigorous physical interpretation of surface helicity in terms of\nlinking of distinct field lines. (ii) We prove that surface helicity is\nnon-trivial if and only if the underlying surface has non-trivial topology\n(i.e. at least one hole).\n  We then focus on toroidal surfaces which are of relevance in plasma physics\nand express surface helicity in terms of average poloidal and toroidal windings\nof the individual field lines of the underlying vector field which enables us\nto provide a connection between surface helicity and rotational transform.\nFurther, we show how some of our results may be utilised in the context of coil\ndesigns for plasma fusion confinement devices in order to obtain coil\nconfigurations of particular \"simple\" shape.\n  Lastly, we consider the problem of optimising surface helicity among toroidal\nsurfaces of fixed area and show that toroidal surfaces admitting a symmetry\nconstitute global minimisers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
