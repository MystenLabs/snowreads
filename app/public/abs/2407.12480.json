Although the estimation of critical temperatures has become more\nreliable and reproducible, that of critical exponents raises concerns about the\nmethod's reliability. Therefore, we propose a more reliable and reproducible\napproach using Gaussian process regression. In addition, the present approach\nintroduces statistical errors through the bootstrap method by combining them\nusing the extrapolation method. Our estimation for the two-dimensional Ising\nmodel yielded $\\beta = 0.12504(6)$, $\\gamma = 1.7505(10)$, and $\\nu =\n1.0003(6)$, consistent with the exact values. The value $z = 2.1669(9)$ is\nreliable because of the high accuracy of these exponents. We also obtained the\ncritical exponents for the three-dimensional Ising model and found that they\nare close to those reported in a previous study. Thus, for systems undergoing\nsecond-order transitions, our approach improves the accuracy, reliability, and\nreproducibility of the NER analysis. Because the proposed approach requires the\nrelaxation of some observables from Monte Carlo simulations, its simplicity\nimparts it with significant potential.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
