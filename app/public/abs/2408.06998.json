In\nparticular, given a suitable \"sufficiently incompressible\" curve\n$\\gamma\\subset\\Sigma$, we show (without appealing to Geometrization) that $M$\nis hyperbolic and we compute the length of $\\gamma$ in terms of the projection\ncoefficients of the disk sets, up to a uniform multiplicative error.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
