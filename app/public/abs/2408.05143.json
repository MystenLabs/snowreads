Furthermore, the\ninternal variables evolution is described by a set of linear differential\nequations which involves many time scales. In this context, the use of a\nspace-time PGD approximation is proposed here to boost their resolution, where\nthe temporal functions are constructed following a multi-scale strategy along\nwith the Partition of Unity method, in order to catch each dynamic efficiently.\nThe feasibility and the robustness of the method are discussed in the case of a\npolymer in a non-equilibrium state under cyclic loading.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
