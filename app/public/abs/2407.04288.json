We obtain gradient estimates using two\ndifferent methods. First, we utilize the equivalence between viscosity\nsolutions and Barron--Jensen solutions to study the properties of the\ninf-convolution. Second, we examine the Lie equation to understand how initial\ngradients propagate along its solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
