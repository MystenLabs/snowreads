Less obvious is that agricultural shipments\nmight be delayed, or that sound proofing material sales might decrease. The\nability to extract such causal knowledge is important, but it is also important\nto distinguish between cause-effect pairs that are known and those that are\nlikely to be unknown, or rare. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method\nfor extracting rare causal knowledge from Japanese financial statement\nsummaries produced by companies. Our method consists of three steps. First, it\nextracts sentences that include causal knowledge from the summaries using a\nmachine learning method based on an extended language ontology. Second, it\nobtains causal knowledge from the extracted sentences using syntactic patterns.\nFinally, it extracts the rarest causal knowledge from the knowledge it has\nobtained.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ty7D1gfMRVLLhvIVuwfghMaopGQS4dN9GsnIHRP7eRY","pdfSize":"859248","txDigest":"DCwg25UPe4w39BCix4nHnWqKYsCGKMJ44qR1RMG3ufgg","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
