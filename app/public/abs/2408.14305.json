We conducted a formative study involving interviews with 4\nDivision I professional soccer coaches, 4 professional players, 2 college club\ncoaches, and 2 college club players, as well as a survey among 17 Division I\nplayers. The study identified key requirements for tactical communication\ntools, including the need for rapid communication, minimal disruption to game\nflow, reduced cognitive load, clear visualization for all players, and enhanced\nauditory clarity. Based on these insights, we propose a potential solution - a\nMobile Augmented Reality (AR) system designed to address these challenges by\nproviding real-time, intuitive tactical visualization and communication. The\nsystem aims to improve strategic planning and execution, thereby enhancing team\nperformance and cohesion. This work represents a significant step towards\nintegrating XR technologies into sports coaching, offering a modern and\npractical solution for real-time tactical communication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IIecZrKmUl3S5tSK1tcrKU77vY2XW1y4TaD8ve-CHIY","pdfSize":"336202"}
