In contrast to the metric formulation, here\nthe Chern-Simons term affects also the background evolution. We approximately\nsolve for the connection, insert it back into the action, and reduce the order\nof the equations to obtain an effective theory in the gradient approximation.\nWe consider three cases: when the connection is unconstrained, and when\nnon-metricity or torsion is put to zero. In the first two cases, the inflaton\nkinetic term is modified with a term proportional to the square of the\npotential. For polynomial potentials dominated by the highest power of the\nfield, the Chern-Simons term solves the problem that higher order corrections\nspoil the flatness of the potential. For Higgs inflation, the tensor-to-scalar\nratio can as large as the current observational bound, and the non-minimal\ncoupling to the Ricci scalar can be as small as in the metric case. The\nPalatini contribution cures the known instability of the tensor modes due the\nChern-Simons term in the metric formulation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zNmx6nJMr6t_yLKzHDwYRdp9FtVBjO5Z8u1vf_dMV3k","pdfSize":"527367"}
