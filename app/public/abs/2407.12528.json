The task, known as the problem of\nidentification, asks to estimate the parameters of the model from a combination\nof assumptions on the graphical structure of the model and observational data,\nrepresented as a non-causal covariance matrix. In this paper, we give a new\nsound and complete algorithm for generic identification which runs in\npolynomial space. By standard simulation results, this algorithm has\nexponential running time which vastly improves the state-of-the-art double\nexponential time method using a Gr\\\"obner basis approach. The paper also\npresents evidence that parameter identification is computationally hard in\ngeneral. In particular, we prove, that the task asking whether, for a given\nfeasible correlation matrix, there are exactly one or two or more parameter\nsets explaining the observed matrix, is hard for $\\forall R$, the co-class of\nthe existential theory of the reals. In particular, this problem is\n$coNP$-hard. To our best knowledge, this is the first hardness result for some\nnotion of identifiability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
