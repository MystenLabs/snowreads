The\nrecent rapid uptake of building information models (BIM) in the construction\nindustry has created more opportunities for automated compliance checking\n(ACC). BIM enables sharing of digital building design data that can be used for\ncompliance checking with legal requirements, which are conventionally conveyed\nin natural language and not intended for machine processing. Creating a\ncomputable representation of legal requirements suitable for ACC is complex,\ncostly, and time-consuming. Large language models (LLMs) such as the generative\npre-trained transformers (GPT), GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, powering OpenAI's ChatGPT,\ncan generate logically coherent text and source code responding to user\nprompts. This capability could be used to automate the conversion of building\nregulations into a semantic and computable representation. This paper evaluates\nthe performance of LLMs in translating building regulations into LegalRuleML in\na few-shot learning setup. By providing GPT-3.5 with only a few example\ntranslations, it can learn the basic structure of the format. Using a system\nprompt, we further specify the LegalRuleML representation and explore the\nexistence of expert domain knowledge in the model. Such domain knowledge might\nbe ingrained in GPT-3.5 through the broad pre-training but needs to be brought\nforth by careful contextualisation. Finally, we investigate whether strategies\nsuch as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency could apply to this use\ncase. As LLMs become more sophisticated, the increased common sense, logical\ncoherence, and means to domain adaptation can significantly support ACC,\nleading to more efficient and effective checking processes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
