However, their applicability to threat\ndetection problems remains unclear. This paper examines the feasibility of\nemploying LLMs as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), despite their\nhigh computational requirements, primarily for the sake of explainability.\nFurthermore, considerable resources have been invested in developing LLMs, and\nthey may offer utility for NIDS. Current state-of-the-art NIDS rely on\nartificial benchmarking datasets, resulting in skewed performance when applied\nto real-world networking environments. Therefore, we compare the GPT-4 and\nLLama3 models against traditional architectures and transformer-based models to\nassess their ability to detect malicious NetFlows without depending on\nartificially skewed datasets, but solely on their vast pre-trained acquired\nknowledge. Our results reveal that, although LLMs struggle with precise attack\ndetection, they hold significant potential for a path towards explainable NIDS.\nOur preliminary exploration shows that LLMs are unfit for the detection of\nMalicious NetFlows. Most promisingly, however, these exhibit significant\npotential as complementary agents in NIDS, particularly in providing\nexplanations and aiding in threat response when integrated with Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) and function calling capabilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
