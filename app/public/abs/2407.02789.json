We also derive higher order trace formulas for\nmaximal dissipative operators under relaxed assumptions and new simplified\ntrace formulas for unitary and resolvent comparable self-adjoint operators. The\nrespective spectral shift measures are absolutely continuous and, in the case\nof contractions, the class of admissible functions includes functions whose\nhigher order derivatives belong to the Wiener class. Both aforementioned\nproperties are new in the mentioned generality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
