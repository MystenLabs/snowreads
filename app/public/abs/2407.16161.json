Nevertheless, occurrence time may\nnot be the only relevant factor, other contextual data, termed covariates, may\nalso impact the event evolution. Incorporating such covariates into the model\nis beneficial, while distinguishing their relevance to the event dynamics is of\ngreat practical significance. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based\ncovariate temporal point process (TransFeat-TPP) model to improve the\ninterpretability of deep covariate-TPPs while maintaining powerful\nexpressiveness. TransFeat-TPP can effectively model complex relationships\nbetween events and covariates, and provide enhanced interpretability by\ndiscerning the importance of various covariates. Experimental results on\nsynthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and\nconsistently interpretable feature importance when compared to existing deep\ncovariate-TPPs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
