Recently, diffusion models have been further applied and show their\nstrong abilities in planning tasks, leading to a significant growth in related\npublications since 2023. To help researchers better understand the field and\npromote the development of the field, we conduct a systematic literature review\nof recent advancements in the application of diffusion models for planning.\nSpecifically, this paper categorizes and discusses the current literature from\nthe following perspectives: (i) relevant datasets and benchmarks used for\nevaluating diffusion modelbased planning; (ii) fundamental studies that address\naspects such as sampling efficiency; (iii) skill-centric and condition-guided\nplanning for enhancing adaptability; (iv) safety and uncertainty managing\nmechanism for enhancing safety and robustness; and (v) domain-specific\napplication such as autonomous driving. Finally, given the above literature\nreview, we further discuss the challenges and future directions in this field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
