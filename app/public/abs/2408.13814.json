It begins by establishing the existence and\nuniqueness of the evolution operator for a class of non-autonomous homogeneous\nsystems. Using the Schauder fixed point theorem and the theory of linear\nevolution systems, we delve into the existence of mild solutions for a class of\nnon-autonomous conformable fractional semi-linear systems. Additionally, the\npaper addresses the exact null controllability of abstract systems. We present\nan example to demonstrate the efficiency of the results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
