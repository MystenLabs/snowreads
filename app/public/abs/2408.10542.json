However, there is currently no\nfactor model tailored to effectively analyze high-dimensional count responses\nwith corresponding covariates across multiple studies, such as the single-cell\nsequencing dataset from a case-control study. In this paper, we introduce\nfactor models designed to jointly analyze multiple studies by extracting\nstudy-shared and specified factors. Our factor models account for heterogeneous\nnoises and overdispersion among counts with augmented covariates. We propose an\nefficient and speedy variational estimation procedure for estimating model\nparameters, along with a novel criterion for selecting the optimal number of\nfactors and the rank of regression coefficient matrix. The consistency and\nasymptotic normality of estimators are systematically investigated by\nconnecting variational likelihood and profile M-estimation. Extensive\nsimulations and an analysis of a single-cell sequencing dataset are conducted\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-study Poisson factor\nmodel.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ee7bPa_98gUuhtUUw3vPWot_kn_ZIdZ1-OrbGW5Qscc","pdfSize":"2987632"}
