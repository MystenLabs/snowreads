In particular, we give an explicit\nconstruction of an infinite family of commutative rings such that the telescope\nconjecture fails and which generalise an example of Keller. As a consequence,\nwe deduce that the Krull dimension of the Balmer spectrum and the Krull\ndimension of the smashing spectrum can differ arbitrarily for rigidly-compactly\ngenerated tensor-triangulated categories.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
