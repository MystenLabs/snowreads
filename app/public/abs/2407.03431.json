We explore a general dual\nrepresentation for the composition between risk measures and utilities. We\nstudy the properties of the optimization problem as a convex and monotone map\nper se. We also derive results for optimality and indifference pricing\nconditions. We also explore particular examples inside our setup.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
