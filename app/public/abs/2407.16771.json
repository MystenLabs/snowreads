ORCA ignores static obstacles until an\nagent gets too close to an obstacle, and the agent will get stuck if the\nobstacle intercepts an agent's path toward the goal. To address this challenge,\nTopology-Guided ORCA constructs a graph to represent the topology of the\ntraversable region of the environment. We use a path planner to plan a path of\nwaypoints that connects each agent's start and goal positions. The waypoints\nare used as a sequence of goals to guide ORCA. The experiments of crowd\nsimulation in constrained environments show that our method outperforms ORCA in\nterms of generating smooth and natural motions of multiple agents in\nconstrained environments, which indicates great potential of Topology-Guided\nORCA for serving as an effective simulator for training constrained social\nnavigation policies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
