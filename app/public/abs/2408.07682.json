A direct\navenue to determine their nature is to study the (imaginary part of the)\nself-energy at low energies. Here we present a novel method to extract this low\n$\\omega$ self-energy from experimentally derived spectral functions. The method\nseems suited for implementation with high quality angle resolved photoemission\ndata. It is based on a helpful Theorem proposed here, which assures us that the\nmethod has minimal (or vanishing) error at the lowest energies. We provide\nnumerical examples showing that a few popular model systems yield\ndistinguishably different low energy self-energies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wb4_zSA2pk87NMC4ULuzDUIr5OL9TapnHzi6YddF86I","pdfSize":"1210910"}
