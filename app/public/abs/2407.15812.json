In\nthe amplitude-phase representation, a generalized dynamic rescaling formulation\nis introduced, with modulation parameters capturing the spatial translation and\nrotation symmetries of the equation and novel additional modulation parameters\nperturbing the scaling symmetry. This new formulation provides enough degrees\nof freedom to impose normalization conditions on the rescaled solution,\ncompletely eliminating the unstable and neutrally stable modes of the\nlinearized operator around the blowup profile. It enables us to establish the\nfull stability of the blowup by enforcing vanishing conditions via the choice\nof normalization and using weighted energy estimates, without relying on a\ntopological argument or a spectrum analysis. The log correction for the blowup\nrate is captured by the energy estimates and refined estimates of the\nmodulation parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OIL3Q-DUeW0F1mY-9HjPRYVBFMszMEUQq647Io9TlrQ","pdfSize":"591148","objectId":"0x78657c73cb311c5f2f7dc985282e9ed5e14fe9e0cda0426d5d698b738583216e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
