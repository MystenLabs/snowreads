Here, we study swimming motility of the soil\nbacterium Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) in polysaccharide matrices formed by\ndifferent concentrations of agar. P. putida cells display intermittent\nrun-motility in the gel, where run times are exponentially distributed and\nintermittently occurring dwell times follow a waiting-time distribution with a\npower-law decay. An analysis of the turn angle distribution suggests that both,\nflagella mediated turning as well as mechanical trapping in the agar matrix\nplay a role in the overall swimming pattern. Based on the experimentally\nobserved motility pattern and measured waiting-time distributions, we propose a\nminimal active particle model which correctly describes the observed time\ndependence of the mean square displacement of the bacterial swimmers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
