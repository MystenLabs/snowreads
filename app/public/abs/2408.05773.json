We then\nexplore various rule mining methodologies, categorized into three groups:\ninductive logic programming, path sampling and generalization, and linear\nprogramming. Following this, we delve into neurosymbolic methods, covering\ntopics such as the integration of deep learning with rules, the use of\nembeddings for rule learning, and the application of large language models in\nrule learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u7rvgC6DUCSEGpOm4qTvSUm9Z5NaZgSLctglv42y_bY","pdfSize":"295265"}
