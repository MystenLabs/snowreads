Data-driven approaches that succeed\nin manipulation tasks require large amounts of data and expert demonstrations,\ntypically from humans. Existing manipulation planners are restricted to\nspecific systems and often depend on specialized algorithms for using\ndemonstration. Therefore, we introduce a flexible motion planner tailored to\ndexterous and whole-body manipulation tasks. Our planner creates readily usable\ndemonstrations for reinforcement learning algorithms, eliminating the need for\nadditional training pipeline complexities. With this approach, we can\nefficiently learn policies for complex manipulation tasks, where traditional\nreinforcement learning alone only makes little progress. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that learned policies are transferable to real robotic systems for\nsolving complex dexterous manipulation tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
