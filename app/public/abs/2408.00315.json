However, we find\nDiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for\nadversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent\ntrade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality.\nAdditionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is\nquestionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a\nnovel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs\na reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean\nexamples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion\nmodels. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various\nscenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism,\noffering significant promise for practical applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
