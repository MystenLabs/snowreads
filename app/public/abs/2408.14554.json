Host-based cryptojacking,\nwhere malicious actors exploit victims systems to mine cryptocurrency without\ntheir knowledge, is on the rise. Regular cryptojacking is relatively well-known\nand well-studied threat, however, recently attackers started switching to GPU\ncryptojacking, which promises greater profits due to high GPU hash rates and\nlower detection chance. Additionally, GPU cryptojackers can easily propagate\nusing, for example, modified graphic card drivers. This article considers\nquestion of GPU cryptojacking detection. First, we discuss brief history and\ndefinition of GPU cryptojacking as well as previous attempts to design a\ndetection technique for such threats. We also propose complex exposure\nmechanism based on GPU load by an application and graphic card RAM consumption,\nwhich can be used to detect both browser-based and host-based cryptojacking\nsamples. Then we design a prototype decision tree detection program based on\nour technique. It was tested in a controlled virtual machine environment with\n80% successful detection rate against selected set of GPU cryptojacking samples\nand 20% false positive rate against selected number of legitimate GPU-heavy\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pq8k6wDd93o9S45ew8b8D3_hJ0-jkE7YTVOYnKnynB0","pdfSize":"308496"}
