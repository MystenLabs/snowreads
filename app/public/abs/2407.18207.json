However, geometric\nproperties of spherical images pose a major challenge for models and metrics\ndesigned for ordinary 2D images. Here, we show that direct application of\nFr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) is insufficient for quantifying geometric\nfidelity in spherical images. We introduce two quantitative metrics accounting\nfor geometric constraints, namely Omnidirectional FID (OmniFID) and\nDiscontinuity Score (DS). OmniFID is an extension of FID tailored to\nadditionally capture field-of-view requirements of the spherical format by\nleveraging cubemap projections. DS is a kernel-based seam alignment score of\ncontinuity across borders of 2D representations of spherical images. In\nexperiments, OmniFID and DS quantify geometry fidelity issues that are\nundetected by FID.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
