We construct asymptotic\nsolutions to the Cauchy problem for such equation within the formalism of\nsemiclassical approximation based on the Maslov complex germ method. Our\nsolutions are localized in a neighbourhood of few points for every given time,\ni.e. form some spatial pattern. The localization points move over trajectories\nthat are associated with the dynamics of semiclassical quasiparticles. The\nCauchy problem for the original NLSE is reduced to the system of ODEs and\nauxiliary linear equations. The semiclassical nonlinear evolution operator is\nderived for the NLSE. The general formalism is applied to the specific\none-dimensional NLSE with a periodic trap potential, dipole-dipole interaction,\nand phenomenological damping. It is shown that the long-range interactions in\nsuch model, which are considered through the interaction of quasiparticles in\nour approach, can lead to drastic changes in the behaviour of our asymptotic\nsolutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
