From the physical point of view, according to the\nKramers-Kronig relations, absorption and dispersion become two sides of the\nsame coin. Due to the simplicity of the assumptions underlying them, the\nrelations are a cornerstone of physics. The rigorous mathematical proof was\ncarried out by Titchmarsh in 1937 and just requires the transfer function to be\nsquare-integrable ($L^2$), or equivalently that the impulse response of the\nsystem at hand has a finite energy. Titchmarsh's proof is definitely not easy,\nthus leading to crucial steps that are often overlooked by instructors and,\noccasionally, prompting some authors to attempt shaky shortcuts. Here we share\na rigorous mathematical proof that relies on the Laplace formalism and requires\na slightly stronger assumption on the transfer function, namely its being\nLebesgue-integrable ($L^1$). While the result is not as general as Titchmarsh's\nproof, its enhanced simplicity makes a deeper knowledge of the mathematical\naspects of the Kramers-Kronig relations more accessible to the audience of\nphysicists.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"UAb3Jz2uKP576JS34Jixk_zuR9HS6Kmn8s6nSTBxqmA","pdfSize":"145179"}
