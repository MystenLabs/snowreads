Conventional street network data and\nanalysis tools often lead to significant overcounting of these measures. This\nstudy investigates the causes of such overcounting and proposes remedies. It\nintroduces algorithms to streamline urban street network models through edge\nsimplification and node consolidation, which enhance computational efficiency\nand improve accuracy in network measures like intersection counts, street\nsegment lengths, and node degrees. The algorithms are validated and subjected\nto a global empirical assessment to evaluate the extent of count bias. These\nfindings highlight the prevalence of this bias and underscore the necessity for\nbetter methods to mitigate inaccuracies in intersection representation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
