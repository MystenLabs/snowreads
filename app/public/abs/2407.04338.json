Quantum repeaters provides an efficient\nmethod to generate entanglement between distant nodes. However, it is difficult\nto extend quantum repeater protocols to high-dimensional quantum states in\nexisting experiments. Here we develop a series of scheme for generating\nhigh-dimensional entangled states via quantum walks with multiple coins or\nsingle coin by quantum repeaters, including $d$-dimensional Bell states,\nmulti-particle high dimensional GHZ states etc.. Furthermore, we give\nentanglement distribution schemes on arbitrary quantum networks according to\nthe above theoretical framework. As applications, we construct quantum fractal\nnetworks and multiparty quantum secret sharing protocols based on\n$d$-dimensional GHZ states. In the end, we give the experiment implementing of\nvarious 2-party or 3-party entanglement generation schemes based on repeaters.\nOur work can serve as a building block for constructing larger and more complex\nquantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
