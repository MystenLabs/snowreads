The abundance of PBH DM has been\nconstrained strictly by many observations.In this work, with the radio\nobservations of Fornax and Segue I, we constrain the abundance of PBH in dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies through the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) effect of\nHawking radiation electrons. By selecting optimal sources, we obtain the\nconstraints on the fraction of PBH DM down to $\\sim10^{-3}$ for Segue I and\n$\\sim10^{-5}$ for Fornax at asteroidal mass. We also predict that, with 100\nhours of future observation by the Square Kilometer Array, the SSC approach\ncould place constraints comparable to the current strictest results for PBHs of\n$<5\\times10^{15}\\,{\\rm g}$. Better projected constraints can be obtained by\nincluding the inverse Compton scattering on cosmic microwave background\nphotons.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
