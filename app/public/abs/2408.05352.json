Importantly, the time-varying waveform-selective\nmetasurfaces reported thus far were mostly able to change their electric\nproperties but not their magnetic properties; this severely limited the design\nrange of their corresponding wave impedances and refractive indices and thus\nhindered the development of potential applications in antennas, sensors,\nimagers, signal processing, and wireless communications. In this study, passive\ntime-varying waveform-selective metasurfaces were found to attain magnetic\nproperty control by introducing an additional circuit-loaded layer that\ngenerated an artificial magnetic dipole moment; this magnetic moment only\noccurred during the designed pulse duration in the time domain. Our proposed\nconcept and structures were validated numerically and experimentally; thus, our\nresults could be used to address electromagnetic and related issues sharing the\nsame frequency component via the variation of the pulse width as an additional\ndegree of freedom.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
