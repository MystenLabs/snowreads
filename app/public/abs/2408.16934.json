We review these algorithms, emphasising\ntheir common Monte Carlo structure within a new modular framework. This\nframework allows us to directly compare these algorithms by calculating upper\nbounds on the minimum number of samples needed for convergence. By recombining\nthe different modules, we create a new quantum algorithm with an\nexponentially-improved dependence in the sample complexity. We run classical\nsimulations to verify convergence within the theoretical bounds and observe the\npredicted exponential separation, even though empirical convergence occurs\nsubstantially earlier than the conservative theoretical bounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
