New energy levels were found using the\nobserved wavelengths measured accurate to a few parts in $10^8$ in Fourier\ntransform spectra and to a few parts in $10^7$ in grating spectra. Atomic\nstructure and transition probability calculations of Nd III were made using the\nCowan codes by adjusting energy parameters to fit all known Nd III levels.\nNd-rich stellar spectra were also used to evaluate the new calculations. In\ntotal, 355 transitions were classified from observed spectra involving 116\npreviously experimentally unknown energy levels of the 4f$^3$7s, 4f$^3$6d, and\n4f$^3$5f configurations of Nd III, all reported here for the first time. One\nnewly identified level of the 4f$^3$5d configuration is also reported. Typical\nlevel energy uncertainties are 0.01 cm$^{-1}$ for the 4f$^3$7s and 4f$^3$6d\nlevels and 0.3 cm$^{-1}$ for the 4f$^3$5f levels. In addition, calculated\nenergy levels up to 130,936 cm$^{-1}$ are presented, including eigenvector\ncomposition and calculated level lifetimes. Calculated transition probabilities\nand wavelengths between 1900-50,000 {\\AA} are also presented. Using newly\nestablished levels of the 4f$^3$7s configuration and the recently established\nlevels of the 4f$^3$6s configuration, the ionisation energy of Nd III was\nestimated at $178,090\\pm330$ cm$^{-1}$, doubling the accuracy of the previously\npublished value.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
