A generalized Magnus' formula\napproximates $G$ as $\\sum_{\\gamma\\ge 0} c_\\gamma F^{\\frac{e-\\gamma}{d}}$ for\nsome complex numbers $c_\\gamma$. We develop an approach to the two-dimensional\nJacobian conjecture, aiming to minimize the use of terms corresponding to\n$\\gamma>0$. As an initial step in this approach, we define and study the inner\npolynomials of $F$ and $G$. The main result of this paper shows that the\nnortheastern vertex of the Newton polygon of each inner polynomial is located\nwithin a specific region. As applications of this result, we introduce several\nconjectures and prove some of them for special cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JUNhB5NPmfhDc_plCN9dVbc3hJfXkkbSh-cqxn0IEBI","pdfSize":"490662"}
