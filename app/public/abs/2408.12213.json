{"id":"2408.12213","title":"Variation of sunspot groups' polarity separation during their evolution","authors":"Judit Murak\\\"ozy","authorsParsed":[["Murak√∂zy","Judit",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2024 08:42:41 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-23","timestamp":1724316161000,"abstract":"  During the emergence of sunspot groups the footpoints of their leading and\nfollowing parts move apart. This diverging motion results in the stretching of\nthe active regions, which continues during the decay phase. The aim of the\npresent work is to study the separation distance variations during the active\nregion evolution on a large statistical sample. Altogether more than 2000\nindividual sunspot groups were taken into account. The investigation is mainly\nbased on data of the SoHO/MDI - Debrecen Sunspot Data (SDD) catalog which\ncovers the time span 1996-2010, practically the whole solar cycle 23. For check\nof the possible cyclical variation the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) is\nused which contains data for solar cycles 20-24. The separation distance is\ncalculated between the leading and following centers of mass and starts to\nincrease after the emergence and shows a plateau around the peak flux. The\npolarity separation reaches its maximum in the decay phase and then starts to\ndecrease in the cases of the largest and medium size groups, but continues its\nincrease in the case of the smallest groups. This decrease is caused by the\neastward motion of the leading part, while the following part continues its\nbackward motion. The separation distance is size dependent, i. e., the larger\nthe sunspot group the greater its extent. Cycle and cycle phase dependencies as\nwell as hemispheric connection can also be observed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RwnAOoq0ksE59RE2kxsRFo7QGi9zBWHHLT3r_KYYXHA","pdfSize":"8737611"}
