As the\nplanar set becomes more regular (i.e., the Hausdorff and packing dimension\nbecome closer), our lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the pinned\ndistance set improves. Additionally, we prove the existence of small universal\nsets for pinned distances. In particular, we show that, if a Borel set\n$X\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2$ is weakly regular ($\\dim_H(X) = \\dim_P(X)$), and\n$\\dim_H(X) > 1$, then\n  \\begin{equation*}\n  \\sup\\limits_{x\\in X}\\dim_H(\\Delta_x Y) = \\min\\{\\dim_H(Y), 1\\}\n  \\end{equation*}\n  for every Borel set $Y\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2$. Furthermore, if $X$ is also\ncompact and Alfors-David regular, then for every Borel set\n$Y\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2$, there exists some $x\\in X$ such that\n  \\begin{equation*}\n  \\dim_H(\\Delta_x Y) = \\min\\{\\dim_H(Y), 1\\}.\n  \\end{equation*}\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
