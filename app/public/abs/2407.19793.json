This work\nproves that determining if a graph admits an NBC is NP-complete. We present a\ngenetic algorithm to solve this problem, which we implemented and compared\nagainst exact and randomized algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QjR2NkEfCTCj5vNWblsGbTgpMbAW7dp2L6RlCWbX_jU","pdfSize":"500626"}
