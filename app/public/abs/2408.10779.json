The model captures primitive properties of\nmodern wireless MAC protocols. In this model, Newport [PODC '14] proves that it\nis impossible to achieve deterministic consensus when nodes may crash.\nSubsequently, Newport and Robinson [DISC '18] present randomized consensus\nalgorithms that terminate with O(n3 log n) expected broadcasts in a system of n\nnodes. We are not aware of any results on other fault-tolerant distributed\ntasks in this model.\n  We first study the computability aspect of the abstract MAC layer. We present\na wait-free algorithm that implements an atomic register. Furthermore, we show\nthat in general, k-set consensus is impossible. Second, we aim to minimize\nstorage complexity. Existing algorithms require {\\Omega}(n log n) bits. We\npropose four wait-free consensus algorithms that only need constant storage\ncomplexity. (Two approximate consensus and two randomized binary consensus\nalgorithms.) One randomized algorithm terminates with O(n log n) expected\nbroadcasts. All our consensus algorithms are anonymous, meaning that at the\nalgorithm level, nodes do not need to have a unique identifier.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
