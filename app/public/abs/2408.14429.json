This type of\nlocomotion, called burst-and-coast, is often associated with an energetic\nadvantage. In this work, we investigate the intermittent locomotion inspired by\nfish locomotion but applied to a propeller. The energy consumption of\nburst-and-coast cycles is measured and compared to the continuous rotation\nregime. We show that a substantial drag contrast between the active and passive\nphases of the motion, as observed in fish, is critical for energy savings. Such\na contrast can be obtained using a folding propeller that passively opens and\ncloses as the propeller starts and stops rotating. For this reconfigurable\npropeller, intermittent propulsion is found to be energetically advantageous,\nsaving up to 24\\% of the energy required to cruise at a given speed. Using an\nanalytical model, we show that intermittent motion is more efficient than\ncontinuous motion when the drag reduction in the coast phase exceeds 65\\%. For\nfish-like locomotion, this threshold seems to be closer to 30\\%. A formal\nanalogy allows us to explain the difference between propeller propulsion and\nfish locomotion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
