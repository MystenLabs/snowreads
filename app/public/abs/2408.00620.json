They are developing rapidly due to their\nremarkable ability to comprehend multimodal information and their inherent\npowerful cognitive and reasoning capabilities. Among MLLMs, vision language\nmodels (VLM) stand out for their ability to understand vision information.\nHowever, the scaling trend of VLMs under the current mainstream paradigm has\nnot been extensively studied. Whether we can achieve better performance by\ntraining even larger models is still unclear. To address this issue, we\nconducted experiments on the pretraining stage of MLLMs. We conduct our\nexperiment using different encoder sizes and large language model (LLM) sizes.\nOur findings indicate that merely increasing the size of encoders does not\nnecessarily enhance the performance of VLMs. Moreover, we analyzed the effects\nof LLM backbone parameter size and data quality on the pretraining outcomes.\nAdditionally, we explored the differences in scaling laws between LLMs and\nVLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
