Our model considers spin-down with a\nforce-free magnetosphere and the decay of the magnetic field strength and its\ninclination angle. The simulated pulsar population is fit to a large\nobservation sample that covers the majority of radio surveys using the Markov\nChain Monte Carlo technique. We compare the distributions of four major\nobservables: spin period (P), spin down rate($\\dot{P}$), dispersion measure,\nand radio flux density using accurate high-dimensional Kolmogoro-Smirnov\nstatistics. We test two B-field decay scenarios, an exponential model motivated\nby ohmic dissipation and a power-law model motivated by the Hall effect. The\nformer clearly provides a better fit, and it can successfully reproduce the\nobserved pulsar distributions with a decay timescale of $8.3_{-3.0}^{+3.9}$\nMyr. The result suggests that significant B-field decay in aged pulsars and\nohmic dissipation could be the dominant process.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
