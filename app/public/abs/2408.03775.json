Many efforts have focused on the pumping of\npolar optical phonons from optical methods but with limited success, as only\nswitching between specific phases has been achieved so far. Additionally, the\ncorrelation between optical pulse characteristics and the resulting phase\nremains poorly understood. Here, we propose an alternative approach and\ndemonstrate the deterministic and dynamical tailoring of polar topologies using\ninstead acoustic phonon pumping. Our second-principles simulations reveal that\nby pumping specific longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons, various\ntopological textures can be induced in materials like BaTiO$_\\mathrm{3}$ or\nPbTiO$_\\mathrm{3}$. This method leverages the strong coupling between\npolarization and strain in these materials, enabling predictable and dynamical\ncontrol of polar patterns. Our findings open up an alternative possibility for\nthe manipulation of polar textures, inaugurating a promising research\ndirection.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hZFVg9nULTsYCgtw6oS0GiAh1s8t9Ri82NBn9C2NJiY","pdfSize":"4058533"}
