Inspired by magnetic poetry, which was originally designed to help\novercome writer's block, the device allows participants to compose short poetic\ntexts from a limited vocabulary by physically placing words on the device's\nsurface. Upon composing the text, the system employs a large language model\n(LLM) to generate a response, displayed on an e-ink screen. We explored various\nstrategies for internally sequencing prompts to foster creative thinking,\nincluding analogy, allegorical interpretations, and ideation. We installed the\ndevice in our research laboratory for two weeks and held a focus group at the\nconclusion to evaluate the design. The design choice to limit interactions with\nthe LLM to poetic text, coupled with the tactile experience of assembling the\npoem, fostered a deeper and more enjoyable engagement with the LLM compared to\ntraditional chatbot or screen-based interactions. This approach gives users the\nopportunity to reflect on the AI-generated responses in a manner conducive to\ncreative thought.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
