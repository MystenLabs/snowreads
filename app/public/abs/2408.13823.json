Although indoor and outdoor positioning techniques have been well\nstudied separately, positioning performance in the intermediate period of\nchanging the positioning environment is still challenging. This paper proposed\na digital twin-aided positioning correction method for seamless positioning\nfocusing on improving the receiver's outdoor positioning performance in urban\nareas, where the change of the positioning environment usually happens. The\nproposed algorithm will simulate the positioning solution for virtual receivers\nin a grid-based digital twin. Based on the simulated positioning solutions, a\nstatistical model will be used to study the positioning characteristics and\ngenerate a correction information database for real receivers to improve their\npositioning performance. This algorithm has a low computation load on the\nreceiver side and does not require a specially designed antenna, making it\nimplementable for small-sized devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
