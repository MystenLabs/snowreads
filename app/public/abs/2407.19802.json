The main goal is to minimize the required computational effort for\nhyperparameter optimization while enhancing the prediction accuracy. Utilizing\na robust design of experiment framework, the structure of an ANN model is\noptimized. This essentially is the identification of a combination of\nhyperparameters that yields an optimal predictive accuracy with the fewest\nalgorithmic runs, thereby achieving a significant reduction of the required\ncomputational effort. Our findings demonstrate that the Taguchi method not only\nstreamlines the hyperparameter tuning process but also could substantially\nimprove the algorithm's performance. These results underscore the potential of\nthe Taguchi method as a powerful tool for optimizing machine learning\nalgorithms, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are\nlimited. The implications of this study are far-reaching, offering insights for\nfuture research in the optimization of different algorithms for improved\naccuracies and computational efficiencies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
