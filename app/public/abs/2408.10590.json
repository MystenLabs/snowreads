This is especially\nchallenging for life science imaging, where the sample, rather than the\ninstrument, still determines the resolution limit. Here, we explore whether we\nhave to accept this or can progress further in this area. To do this, we use\nnumerical simulations to see how much information we can obtain from a weak\nphase object at different electron doses. Starting from a model with four phase\nvalues, we compare Zernike phase contrast with measuring diffracted intensity\nunder multiple random phase illuminations to solve the inverse problem. Our\nsimulations have shown that diffraction-based methods perform better than the\nZernike method, as we have found and addressed a normalization issue that, in\nsome other studies, led to an overly optimistic representation of the Zernike\nsetup. We further validated this using more realistic 2D objects and found that\nrandom phase illuminated diffraction can be up to five times more efficient\nthan an ideal Zernike implementation. These findings suggest that\ndiffraction-based methods could be a promising approach for imaging\nbeam-sensitive materials and that current low-dose imaging methods are not yet\nat the quantum limit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WYQVAhGZ5c5KLCasL-Kiz0QPKEfugtx-23o4rCThYoM","pdfSize":"4914468"}
