The oldest among them is Rig-Veda which has ten Mandalas, each\ncomposed separately. In this paper, we look at deciphering plausible pointers\nto the internal chronology of the Mandalas, by focusing on Gods and Goddesses\nworshiped in different Mandalas. We apply text analysis to the Mandalas using\nClustering Techniques based on Cosine Similarity. Then we represent the\nassociation of deities with Mandalas using a grid-based Social Network that is\namenable to chronological analysis and demonstrates the benefits of using\nSocial Network Analysis for the problem at hand. Further, we analyze references\nto rivers to arrive at additional correlations. The approach used can be\ndeployed generically to analyze other kinds of references and mentions and\narrive at more substantive inferences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
