Given a family of curves $C$ on $X$, we study how the Harder-Narasimhan\nfiltration of $\\mathcal{E}|_{C}$ changes as we vary $C$ in our family.\nHeuristically we expect that the locus where the slopes in the\nHarder-Narasimhan filtration jump by $\\mu$ should have codimension which\ndepends linearly on $\\mu$. We identify the geometric properties which determine\nwhether or not this expected behavior holds. We then apply our results to study\nrank $2$ bundles on $\\mathbb{P}^{2}$ and to study singular loci of moduli\nspaces of curves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
