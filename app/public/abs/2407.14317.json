In this model, the study of currents\nand their fluctuations has attracted a lot of attention. In finite systems of\narbitrary dimension, both the integrated current through a bond (or a fixed\nsurface), and its fluctuations, grow linearly with time. Conversely, for\ninfinite systems, the integrated current displays different behaviours with\ntime, depending on the geometry of the lattice. For instance, in 1D the\nintegrated current fluctuations are known to grow sublinearly with time, as\n$\\sqrt{t}$. Here we study the fluctuations of the integrated current through a\ngiven lattice bond beyond the 1D case by considering a SEP on\nhigher-dimensional lattices, and on a comb lattice which describes an\nintermediate situation between 1D and 2D. We show that the different behaviours\nof the current originate from qualitatively and quantitatively different\ncurrent-density correlations in the systems, which we compute explicitly.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
