Nonetheless, the capabilities of\non-device LLMs are intrinsically constrained by the limited capacity of edge\ndevices compared to the much more powerful cloud centers. To bridge the gap\nbetween cloud-based and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a\nviable solution to this problem by provisioning AI capabilities within the edge\nof mobile networks with improved privacy and latency relative to cloud\ncomputing. MEI sits between on-device AI and cloud-based AI, featuring wireless\ncommunications and more powerful computing resources than end devices. This\narticle provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We first\ncover the preliminaries of LLMs, starting with LLMs and MEI, followed by\nresource-efficient LLM techniques. We then illustrate several killer\napplications to demonstrate the need for deploying LLMs at the network edge and\npresent an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM). Subsequently, we\ndelve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching\nand delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify\nfuture research opportunities. We aim to inspire researchers in the field to\nleverage mobile edge computing to facilitate LLM deployment in close proximity\nto users, thereby unleashing the potential of LLMs across various privacy- and\ndelay-sensitive applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
