Holographic duality provides a systematic framework for\nsimulating the decaying $(3+1)$-dimensional quantum turbulence by numerically\nsolving the dual Abelian-Higgs theory in a $(4+1)$-dimensional black hole\nbackground. We reveal that different types of total vortex line length $L$\ndecay behaviors emerge depending on the initial vortex line density, ranging\nfrom $L\\sim t^{-1.5}$ to $L\\sim t^{-1}$, similar to the experimental\nobservation of $^3$He in Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 035301 (2006). Additionally, by\nmeasuring the energy flux at the black hole horizon, we determine that the\nenergy dissipation rate $dE/dt$ is proportional to the square of the total\nvortex line length, consistent with the vortex line decay equation proposed by\nW. F. Vinen and also the experimental measurement in Nature Physics 7, 473-476\n(2011). We also observe two other characteristics of quantum turbulence: 1) The\nKolmogorov $-5/3$ scaling spectrum appears in regions where the total vortex\nline length decay law is clear and the vortex line density is sufficiently\nhigh, while it is less evident in diluted cases; 2) Unlike classical\nturbulence, the universal power law of superfluid velocity distribution at\nlarge speed persists throughout the entire decay process in both types of\ndecay.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
