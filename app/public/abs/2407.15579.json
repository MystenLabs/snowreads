Additionally, we\nestablish a (quantitative) central limit theorem in the critical case and a\nstrong law of large numbers for the \"$W$-norm\" of the uniform distribution on\n$\\mathbb{B}^{(n,V)}$. Our techniques also enable us to derive a precise formula\nfor the thin-shell concentration of uniformly distributed random vectors in\nhigh-dimensional Orlicz balls. In our approach we establish an\nEdgeworth-expansion using methods from harmonic analysis together with an\nexponential change of measure argument.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qKrg4Fp0KinAhVs6vggRmHlgKp04VewXxwmddKLcK_4","pdfSize":"319162"}
