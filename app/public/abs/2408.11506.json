Several\nconcentrations of MoS2 are studied and dispersed in a viscoelastic fluid. The\nlubrication effects are present in the ink when the MoS2 concentration is\nhigher than 0.10% w/w. The dielectric properties show the impossibility of a\npositive electrorheological effect for all MoS2-inks studied. The formation of\nvortices and electromigration of MoS2 particles occur under the influence of an\nexternal electric field. These two phenomena affect the rheological behavior of\nMoS2-inks under shear flow condition. Relatively to the extensional rheology\nexperiments, the particle migration and the vortex formation promote anisotropy\non the rheological properties of the inks which affects the relaxation time,\nthe formation of beads-on-a-string and the uniaxial elongational flow condition\nis no longer valid. When the electric field strength is 1.5 kV/mm, the\nformation of Taylor's cone is observed and independent of MoS2 concentration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
