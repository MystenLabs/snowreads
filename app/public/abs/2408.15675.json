This quantification formalizes the idea that\nsome risk measures are ``more risk-averse'' than others. I construct the\nfunctional using two axioms: a normalization on the space of CVaRs and a\nlinearity axiom. I present two formulas for the functional and discuss several\nproperties and interpretations.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
