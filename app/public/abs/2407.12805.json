Existing methods tackle action recognition\nand dark enhancement separately, limiting the potential for end-to-end learning\nof spatiotemporal representations for video action classification. This paper\nintroduces Dark Transformer, a novel video transformer-based approach for\naction recognition in low-light environments. Dark Transformer leverages\nspatiotemporal self-attention mechanisms in cross-domain settings to enhance\ncross-domain action recognition. By extending video transformers to learn\ncross-domain knowledge, Dark Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance\non benchmark action recognition datasets, including InFAR, XD145, and ARID. The\nproposed approach demonstrates significant promise in addressing the challenges\nof action recognition in adverse lighting conditions, offering practical\nimplications for real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n3PjYChiM3kbf33stBnTTJA6GiEX8q45Sju38t4v_bI","pdfSize":"7722773"}
