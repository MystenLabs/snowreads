We find\nthat typical experimental criteria used to identify $b$ jets in this process\naffect QCD corrections to the decay, making it necessary to account for them in\nthe proper description of this process. Indeed, if corrections to the\nproduction and decay are combined, the fiducial cross section of the weak boson\nfusion process $p p \\to H(\\to b \\bar{b}) j j$ is reduced by about $40\\%$\nrelative to leading-order predictions, compared to just about $8\\%$ if only\ncorrections to the production process are considered. We investigate the origin\nof these large corrections through next-to-next-to-leading-order and conclude\nthat they appear because a number of independent moderately-large effects\nconspire to significantly reduce the fiducial cross section for this process.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
