Using the probability integral transform, we first generalize Neal's\nshrinkage algorithm, standardizing the procedure to an automatic and universal\nstarting point: the unit interval. This enables the introduction of approximate\n(pseudo-) targets through importance reweighting, a technique that has\npopularized elliptical slice sampling. Reasonably accurate pseudo-targets can\nboost sampler efficiency by requiring fewer rejections and by reducing target\nskewness. This strategy is effective when a natural, possibly crude,\napproximation to the target exists. Alternatively, obtaining a marginal\npseudo-target from initial samples provides an intuitive and automatic tuning\nprocedure. We consider two metrics for evaluating the quality of approximation;\neach can be used as a criterion to find an optimal pseudo-target or as an\ninterpretable diagnostic. We examine performance of the proposed sampler\nrelative to other popular, easily implemented MCMC samplers on standard targets\nin isolation, and as steps within a Gibbs sampler in a Bayesian modeling\ncontext. We extend the transformation method to multivariate slice samplers and\ndemonstrate with a constrained state-space model for which a readily available\nforward-backward algorithm provides the target approximation.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
