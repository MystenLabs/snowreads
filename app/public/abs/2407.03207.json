The precision of these experiments\nis determined by the accuracy of estimating the neutron loss rate. In material\nUCN traps the main source of neutron losses is the absorption by trap walls. In\nthis paper we analyze the standard methods and their approximations for the\ncalculation of UCN absorption rate by the walls of material traps. We emphasize\nthe approximations used both in the standard analytical formulas and in the\nnumerical Monte-Carlo simulations. For the two simplest trap geometries,\nrectangular and cylindrical, we obtain precise analytical formulas for this\nabsorption rate and compare them with the standard estimation methods. The\ndifference turned out to be considerable and especially important for the size\nextrapolation procedure, always used in the standard estimates of UCN losses.\nOur results may partially resolve the puzzling four-second discrepancy between\nthe magnetic and material-trap measurements of neutron lifetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
