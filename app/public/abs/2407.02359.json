Our approach overcomes the known obstacles to transferring\nfunctional inequalities using transport maps in discrete settings, and allows\nus to deduce a number of functional inequalities for ultra-log-concave\nmeasures. In particular, we provide the currently best known constant in\nmodified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for ultra-log-concave measures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
