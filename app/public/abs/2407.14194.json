These methods act\nas black boxes, selecting features in high--dimensional data sets as to provide\naccurate classifiers in terms of prediction when new data are fed into the\nsystem. In supervised machine learning, predictors are generally ranked by\nimportance based on their contribution to the final prediction. Global\nSensitivity Analysis is primarily used in mathematical modelling to investigate\nthe effect of the uncertainties of the input variables on the output. We apply\nit here as a novel way to rank the input features by their importance to the\nexplainability of the data generating process, shedding light on how the\nresponse is determined by the dependence structure of its predictors. A\nsimulation study shows that our proposal can be used to explore what advances\ncan be achieved either in terms of efficiency, explanatory ability, or simply\nby way of confirming existing results.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
