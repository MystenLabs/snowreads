We call such a distribution a projective Wishart\ndistribution. We show that projective Wishart distributions have strong links\nwith the affine-invariant geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices in\nthe real case or Hermitian positive definite matrices in the complex case.\nFirst, the Fr{\\'e}chet mean of a projective Wishart distribution is the\ncovariance parameter, up to a scaling factor, of the corresponding Wishart\ndistribution. Second, in the case of 2 by 2 matrices, the densities have simple\nexpressions in term of the affine-invariant distance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
