I show that there is a unique way\nto embed these finite symmetries consistently, and that the gauge groups of the\nStandard Model are then uniquely determined. The model is automatically chiral,\nand the generation symmetry acts as a rotation in a real 2-space, so that the\nspinors for three generations have only twice as many degrees of freedom in\ntotal as the spinors for a single generation. In fact, two distinct generation\nsymmetries arise from the restriction to the Standard Model, related by the CKM\nand/or PMNS matrices. It therefore appears that these two matrices are not\nindependent. I further speculate on the implications for quantum gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
