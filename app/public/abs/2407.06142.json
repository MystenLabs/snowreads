For delay-sensitive applications, link\ndelays can have a direct impact on service quality. These delays can fluctuate\ndrastically over time due to various factors such as network congestion,\nchanging traffic conditions, cyberattacks, component failures, and natural\ndisasters. Thus, it is crucial to efficiently harden the edge network to\nmitigate link delay variation as well as ensure a stable and improved user\nexperience. To this end, we propose a novel robust model for optimal edge\nnetwork hardening, considering the link delay uncertainty. Departing from the\nexisting literature that treats uncertainties as exogenous, our model\nincorporates an endogenous uncertainty set to properly capture the impact of\nhardening and workload allocation decisions on link delays. However, the\nendogenous set introduces additional complexity to the problem due to the\ninterdependence between decisions and uncertainties. We present two efficient\nmethods to transform the problem into a solvable form. Extensive numerical\nresults are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
