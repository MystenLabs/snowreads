However, these rich-resource inputs may not always be available,\nlimiting the applicability of these methods in general scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose Rich-resource Prior Depth estimator (RPrDepth), which only\nrequires single input image during the inference phase but can still produce\nhighly accurate depth estimations comparable to rich resource based methods.\nSpecifically, we treat rich-resource data as prior information and extract\nfeatures from it as reference features in an offline manner. When estimating\nthe depth for a single-image image, we search for similar pixels from the\nrich-resource features and use them as prior information to estimate the depth.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our model outperform other single-image\nmodel and can achieve comparable or even better performance than models with\nrich-resource inputs, only using low-resolution single-image input.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ic-Pu_1O_kZbes25N5aNl2MI3fvmuKhqVc2LpZFp1Pg","pdfSize":"5818857"}
