Our main\nresults will be a family of pointwise decay estimates and a full range family\nStrichartz estimates for the flow. The proof relies on the use of a\nrelativistic Hankel transform, which allows for an explicit representation of\nthe propagator in terms of the generalized eigenfunctions of the operator.\nThese results represent the natural continuation of earlier research on\nevolution equations associated to operators with magnetic fields with strong\nsingularities (see \\cite{DF, FFFP, FZZ} where the Schr\\\"odinger and the wave\nequations were studied). Indeed, we recall the fact that the Aharonov--Bohm\nfield represents a perturbation which is critical with respect to the scaling:\nthis fact, as it is well known, makes the analysis particularly challenging.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
