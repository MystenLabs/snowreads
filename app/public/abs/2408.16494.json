We propose an equivalent circuit model (ECM) to capture\nthe thermal and electrical battery behavior. Furthermore, we assess the need\nfor a battery thermal management system (BTMS) by determining heat generation\nat the cell level and optimize BTMS design to minimize energy consumption over\na predefined flight regime. The proposed baseline battery design includes a\n304-kWh battery system with BTMS, ensuring failure redundancy through two\nparallel switched battery banks. Simulation results explore the theoretical\nflight range without BTMS and reveal advantages in increasing battery capacity\nunder specific conditions. Optimization efforts focus on BTMS design,\nhighlighting the superior performance of water cooling over air cooling.\nHowever, the addition of a 9.9 kW water-cooled BTMS results in a 16.5% weight\nincrease (387 kg) compared to no BTMS, reducing the simulated range of the\naircraft from 480 km to 410 km. Lastly, we address a heating-induced thermal\nrunaway scenario, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed battery design\nin preventing thermal runaway.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
