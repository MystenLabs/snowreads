This paper introduces a novel approach that\nintegrates user digital twins-a dynamic digital representation of a user's\npreferences and behaviors-with traditional video streaming systems. We explore\nthe potential of this integration to dynamically adjust video preferences and\noptimize transcoding processes according to real-time data. The methodology\nleverages advanced machine learning algorithms to continuously update the\nuser's digital twin, which in turn informs the transcoding service to adapt\nvideo parameters for optimal quality and minimal buffering. Experimental\nresults show that our approach not only improves the personalization of content\ndelivery but also significantly enhances the overall efficiency of video\nstreaming services by reducing bandwidth usage and improving video playback\nquality. The implications of such advancements suggest a shift towards more\nadaptive, user-centric multimedia services, potentially transforming how video\ncontent is consumed and delivered.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
