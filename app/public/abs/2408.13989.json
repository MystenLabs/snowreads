As an application, we characterize two dimensional ball\nquotients as the only Stein spaces with smooth finite type boundary and locally\nrational Bergman kernel. A key ingredient in the proof of the degree estimate\nis a new localization result for the Bergman kernel of a pseudoconvex, finite\ntype domain in a complex manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
