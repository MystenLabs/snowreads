With continuous wavelet transform\ntechniques, we define the pressure spectra, or density-weighted velocity power\nspectra, as well as the spectral ratios, for both turbulent and thermal\nmotions. We find that the magnitude of the turbulent pressure spectrum grows\nslightly from $z=4$ to $2$ and increases significantly from $z=2$ to $1$ at\nlarge scales, suggesting progressive turbulence injection into the cosmic\nfluid, whereas from $z=1$ to $0$, the spectrum remains nearly constant,\nindicating that turbulence may be balanced by energy transfer and dissipation.\nThe magnitude of the turbulent pressure spectra also increases with\nenvironmental density, with the highest density regions showing a turbulent\npressure up to six times that of thermal pressure. We also explore the\ndynamical effects of turbulence and thermal motions, discovering that while\nthermal pressure provides support against structure collapse, turbulent\npressure almost counteracts this support, challenging the common belief that\nturbulent pressure supports gas against overcooling.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
