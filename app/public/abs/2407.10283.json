Many user queries contain quantities and\ncannot be resolved without understanding their semantics, e.g., ``car that\ncosts less than $10k''. Yet, modern search engines apply the same ranking\nmechanisms for both words and quantities, overlooking magnitude and unit\ninformation. In this paper, we introduce two quantity-aware ranking techniques\ndesigned to rank both the quantity and textual content either jointly or\nindependently. These techniques incorporate quantity information in available\nretrieval systems and can address queries with numerical conditions equal,\ngreater than, and less than. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmodels, we introduce two novel quantity-aware benchmark datasets in the domains\nof finance and medicine and compare our method against various lexical and\nneural models.
