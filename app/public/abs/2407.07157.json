The working cycle of the\nbattery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of\nsubsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a\ncharger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible\nbecause the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection\nstroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase\ncoherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can\nbe exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while\nproviding finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and\nfeasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery.\nFurthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum\nmachines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results\nstrongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be\nsuccessfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
