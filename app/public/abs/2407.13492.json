In this context, we introduce an open-source\nend-to-end framework designed to construct knowledge around specific diseases\ndirectly from raw text. To facilitate research in disease-related knowledge\ndiscovery, we create two annotated datasets focused on Rett syndrome and\nAlzheimer's disease, enabling the identification of semantic relations between\nbiomedical entities. Extensive benchmarking explores various ways to represent\nrelations and entity representations, offering insights into optimal modeling\nstrategies for semantic relation detection and highlighting language models'\ncompetence in knowledge discovery. We also conduct probing experiments using\ndifferent layer representations and attention scores to explore transformers'\nability to capture semantic relations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
