A novel energy function optimization-based\nframework is proposed to generate prediction trajectories. Firstly, a new\nenergy function is designed for easier optimization. Secondly, an online\noptimization pipeline for calculating parameters and agents' velocities is\ndeveloped. In this pipeline, we first design an efficient group division method\nbased on Frechet distance to classify agents online. Then the strategy on\ndecoupling the optimization of velocities and critical parameters in the energy\nfunction is developed, where the the slap swarm algorithm and gradient descent\nalgorithms are integrated to solve the optimization problems more efficiently.\nThirdly, we propose a similarity-based resample evaluation algorithm to predict\nagents' optimal goals, defined as the target-moving headings of agents, which\neffectively extracts hidden information in observed states and avoids learning\nagents' destinations via the training dataset in advance. Experiments and\ncomparison studies verify the advantages of the proposed method in terms of\nprediction accuracy and speed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
