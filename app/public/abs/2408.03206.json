Our purpose\nis to provide a simple, step-by-step review on how to build and implement such\na geometric model to describe the propagation of a classical wave satisfying\nFermat's and Huygens' principles in an anisotropic and rheonomic\n(time-dependent) medium. The model is based on identifying the individual wave\ntrajectories as lightlike pregeodesics of a specific Lorentz-Finsler metric,\nwhich obey a simple ODE system and can therefore be easily computed in real\ntime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
