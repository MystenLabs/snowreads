The origins of these laws, their empirical\nvalidity, and the insights they provide into underlying systems have been\nsubjects of scientific inquiry for centuries. This monograph provides an\nunifying approach to the study of statistical laws, critically evaluating their\nrole in the theoretical understanding of complex systems and the different\ndata-analysis methods used to evaluate them. Through a historical review and a\nunified analysis, we uncover that the persistent controversies on the validity\nof statistical laws are predominantly rooted not in novel empirical findings\nbut in the discordance among data-analysis techniques, mechanistic models, and\nthe interpretations of statistical laws. Starting with simple examples and\nprogressing to more advanced time-series and statistical methods, this\nmonograph and its accompanying repository provide comprehensive material for\nresearchers interested in analyzing data, testing and comparing different laws,\nand interpreting results in both existing and new datasets.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
