This unitary lattice calculation is conducted using the domain\nwall fermion discretization scheme, a fine lattice spacing of approximately\n0.08 fm, and physical values for light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel\nis determined analyzing the ratios of pion quasi-TMD wave functions\n(quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) perturbative accuracy.\nThanks to the absence of Wilson-lines, the Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF\ndemonstrates a remarkably slower decay of signals with increasing quark\nseparations. This allows us to access the non-perturbative CS kernel up to\ntransverse separations of 1 fm. For small transverse separations, our results\nagree well with perturbative predictions. At larger transverse separations, our\nnon-perturbative CS kernel clearly favors certain global fits.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
