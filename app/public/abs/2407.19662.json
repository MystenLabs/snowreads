Home automation systems automate these\ninteractions. IoT events are crucial to these systems' decision-making but are\noften unreliable. Security vulnerabilities allow attackers to impersonate\nevents. Using statistical machine learning, IoT event fingerprints from\ndeployed sensors have been used to detect spoofed events. Multivariate temporal\ndata from these sensors has structural and temporal properties that statistical\nmachine learning cannot learn. These schemes' accuracy depends on the knowledge\nbase; the larger, the more accurate. However, the lack of huge datasets with\nenough samples of each IoT event in the nascent field of IoT can be a\nbottleneck. In this work, we deployed advanced machine learning to detect\nevent-spoofing assaults. The temporal nature of sensor data lets us discover\nimportant patterns with fewer events. Our rigorous investigation of a publicly\navailable real-world dataset indicates that our time-series-based solution\ntechnique learns temporal features from sensor data faster than earlier work,\neven with a 100- or 500-fold smaller training sample, making it a realistic IoT\nsolution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"S7lgKOxRmv8N26lOqdYIjAGOYXqsGFLZSsjHW26LD-A","pdfSize":"869153"}
