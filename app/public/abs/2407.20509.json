We represent this\ninterpolant as a Mellin transform of a function $G(q_1,\\ldots,q_r;w)$ and,\nusing this expression, give the analytic continuation. Further, the harmonic\nproduct relations for $\\Psi$ and $G$ are established via relevant Hopf algebra\nstructures, and some properties of the function $G$ are provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
