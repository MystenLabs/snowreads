Attempts to\nincrease the number of retrieved chunked documents and thereby enlarge the\ncontext related to the query can significantly complicate the processing and\ndecrease the performance of a Large Language Model (LLM) when generating\nresponses to queries. It is well known that a large set of documents retrieved\nfrom a database in response to a query may contain irrelevant information,\nwhich often leads to hallucinations in the resulting answers. Our goal is to\nselect the most semantically relevant documents, treating the discarded ones as\noutliers. We propose and evaluate several methods for identifying outliers by\ncreating features that utilize the distances of embedding vectors, retrieved\nfrom the vector database, to both the centroid and the query vectors. The\nmethods were evaluated by comparing the similarities of the retrieved LLM\nresponses to ground-truth answers obtained using the OpenAI GPT-4o model. It\nwas found that the greatest improvements were achieved with increasing\ncomplexity of the questions and answers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
