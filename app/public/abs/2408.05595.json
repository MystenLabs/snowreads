In this work, we introduce\nAdaCUR, an efficient algorithm for computing a low-rank approximation of\nparameter-dependent matrices via CUR decomposition. The key idea for this\nalgorithm is that for nearby parameter values, the column and row indices for\nthe CUR decomposition can often be reused. AdaCUR is rank-adaptive, certifiable\nand has complexity that compares favourably against existing methods. A faster\nalgorithm which we call FastAdaCUR that prioritizes speed over accuracy is also\ngiven, which is rank-adaptive and has complexity which is at most linear in the\nnumber of rows or columns, but without certification.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
