By analyzing both weak and strong coupling\nregimes, we uncover the impact of environmental interactions on quantum\nthermodynamic quantities, including specific heat capacity, internal energy,\nand entropy. Further, the ergotropy and entropy production are computed. We\nalso explore the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which sets an upper bound\non the signal-to-noise ratio.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
