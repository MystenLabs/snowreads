We use gauge\ninvariant formalism for the massive higher spin fields and, as it common in\nsuch cases, we face an ambiguity related with the possible field redefinitions\ndue to the presence of Stueckelberg fields. From one hand, we show how this\nambiguity can be used as one more way to classify possible cubic vertices. We\nalso note that all these field redefinitions do not change the part of the\nLagrangian which appears in the unitary gauge (where all Stueckelberg fields\nare set to zero) so we still have some important independent results. From the\nother hand, we show how using the so-called unfolded formalism one can fix\nthese ambiguities and obtain consistent deformations for all massive field\ngauge invariant curvatures which is the most important step in the\nFradkin-Vasiliev formalism. Unfortunately, this works for the massive fields\nonly so the way to construct deformations for the massless field curvatures is\nstill has to be found.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
