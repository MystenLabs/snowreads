Understanding humor is an important\nNLP challenge, with many applications to human-computer interactions. In this\nwork we explore humor in the context of Cards Against Humanity -- a party game\nwhere players complete fill-in-the-blank statements using cards that can be\noffensive or politically incorrect. We introduce a novel dataset of 300,000\nonline games of Cards Against Humanity, including 785K unique jokes, analyze it\nand provide insights. We trained machine learning models to predict the winning\njoke per game, achieving performance twice as good (20\\%) as random, even\nwithout any user information. On the more difficult task of judging novel\ncards, we see the models' ability to generalize is moderate. Interestingly, we\nfind that our models are primarily focused on punchline card, with the context\nhaving little impact. Analyzing feature importance, we observe that short,\ncrude, juvenile punchlines tend to win.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/General Literature"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","pdfSize":"335054","blobId":"1VQylG81Yt-wAxgsQDNElzssH2KbG_fnkcRvBIXJqH0","objectId":"0x186145da1ad4f5e00965a4026f7904925f9ce97f7f2460ca637f248f3b5c31c1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
