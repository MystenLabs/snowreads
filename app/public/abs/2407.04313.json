First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for\nthis equation. Then, we prove that under the condition where the functions f\nand g are sufficiently \"small\", the equation admits a solution that exhibits\nthe same character of recurrence as f and g. The discussion is further extended\nto the asymptotic stability of these Poisson stable solutions. Finally, we\ninclude an example to validate our results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
