Let $q_B(G)$ denote the smallest\nnumber of colors needed for a B-coloring of $G$. Motivated by earlier papers on\nB-colorings, here we consider $q_B(G)$ for planar and outerplanar graphs in\nterms of the maximum degree $\\Delta = \\Delta(G)$. We prove that $q_B(G)\\le\n2\\Delta+8$ for planar graphs, $q_B(G)\\le 2\\Delta$ for bipartite planar graphs\nand $q_B(G)\\le \\Delta+1$ for outerplanar graphs with $\\Delta \\ge 4$. We\nconjecture that, for $\\Delta$ sufficiently large, $q_B(G)\\le 2\\Delta(G)$ for\nplanar $G$ and $q_B(G)\\le \\Delta(G)$ for outerplanar $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
