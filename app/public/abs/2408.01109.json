During the 1980s, Janos Makowsky made a number of contributions to the\nstudy of data dependencies; in particular, he was the first researcher to\ncharacterize data dependencies in terms of their structural properties. The\ngoal of this article is to first present an overview of Makowsky's work on\ncharacterizing certain classes of data dependencies and then discuss recent\ndevelopments concerning characterizations of broader classes of data\ndependencies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
