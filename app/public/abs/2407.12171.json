In this\npaper, we prove that provided $n$ is sufficiently large, for any\n$\\mathcal{F}\\subset \\binom{[n]}{k}$ with $|\\mathcal{F}|=m$,\n$\\omega(\\mathcal{F})$ is maximized by the family consisting of the first $m$\nsets in the lexicographical ordering on $\\binom{[n]}{k}$. Compared to the\nmaximum number of adjacent pairs in families, determined by Das, Gan and\nSudakov in 2016, $\\omega(\\mathcal{F})$ distinguishes the contributions of\nintersections of different sizes. Then our results is an extension of Ahlswede\nand Katona's results in 1978, which determine the maximum number of adjacent\nedges in graphs. Besides, since\n$\\omega(\\mathcal{F})=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sum_{x\\in [n]}|\\{F\\in \\mathcal{F}:x\\in\nF\\}|^2-km\\right)$ for $k$-uniform family with size $m$, our results also give a\nsharp upper bound of the sum of squares of degrees in a hypergraph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
