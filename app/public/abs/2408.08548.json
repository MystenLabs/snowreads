The Floquet operator and the effective Floquet Hamiltonian,\nwhich encapsulate the stroboscopic features of the driven system, capture both\nspectral and localization properties of the $0$- and $\\pi$-modes but sometimes\nfail to provide complete topological characterization, especially when $0$- and\n$\\pi$-modes coexist. In this work, we utilize the spectral localizer, a\npowerful local probe that can provide numerically efficient, spatially local,\nand energy-resolved topological characterization. In particular, we apply the\nspectral localizer to the effective Floquet Hamiltonian for driven one- and\ntwo-dimensional topological systems with no or limited symmetries and are able\nto assign topological invariants, or local markers, that characterize the $0$-\nand the $\\pi$-boundary modes individually and unambiguously. Due to the spatial\nresolution, we also demonstrate that the extracted topological invariants are\nsuitable for studying driven disordered systems and can even capture\ndisorder-induced phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z6mBN4mJVxuTWtOAZV5rLZHFZ1kV_43w8V5W_efSRAs","pdfSize":"1774517"}
