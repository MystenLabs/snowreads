When we additionally average in\ntime, further improvements can be obtained. Next, we apply multilinear\nrefinements to show low regularity local well-posedness for nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equations. For the cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation the\napproach yields the sharp local well-posedness result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
