As 6G technology\nheralds a new era with significantly enhanced capabilities including higher\nbandwidths, lower latencies, and increased connection densities, it is poised\nto fundamentally transform video streaming services. This study explores the\nintegration of these technological advancements to optimize video streaming\nprocesses, ensuring seamless service delivery and superior Quality of\nExperience (QoE) for users. We propose novel buffer management strategies that\nleverage the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication features of 6G\nnetworks to mitigate issues related to video streaming such as rebuffering and\nquality fluctuations. Additionally, we examine how insights into viewing\nbehaviors can inform adaptive streaming algorithms, allowing for real-time\nadjustments that align with user preferences and viewing conditions. The\nimplications of our findings are demonstrated through rigorous simulation\nstudies, which validate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions across\ndiverse scenarios. This research not only highlights the challenges faced in\ndeploying adaptive streaming solutions over 6G but also outlines future\ndirections for research and development in this fast-evolving field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
