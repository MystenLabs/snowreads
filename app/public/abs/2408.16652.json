Various preconditioning techniques have been explored\nto improve its efficiency. One issue that arises when implementing these\npreconditioning techniques is the need to solve two linear systems per\niterative step. In this paper, to tackle this issue, among others, a modified\nLSMR method (MLSMR), in which only one linear system per iterative step needs\nto be solved instead of two, is introduced, and then it is integrated with the\nidea of flexible GMRES to yield a flexible MLSMR method (FMLSMR). Numerical\nexamples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed FMLSMR\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
