Two levels of description are coupled: in a single area,\npairwise neuron interactions for the exchange of membrane potential are\nstatistically described; among different areas, a graph description of the\nbrain network topology is included. Equilibria of the kinetic and macroscopic\nsettings are determined and numerical simulations of the system dynamics are\nperformed with the aim of studying the influence of the network heterogeneities\non the membrane potential propagation and synchronization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
