We\nalso introduce time-dependent $G$-Chaplygin systems with affine constraints,\nwhich are natural objects for the invariant formulation of nonholonomic systems\nwith symmetries. As far as the author is aware, the Hamiltonization problem for\ntime-dependent constraints has not yet been studied. As a first step in this\ndirection, we consider a rolling without sliding of a balanced disc of radius\n$r$ over a vertical circle of variable radius $R(t)$. We modify the Chaplygin\nmultiplier method and prove that the reduced system becomes the usual\nLagrangian system with respect to the new time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
