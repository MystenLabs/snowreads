By the combination of two recent works,\nthe new framework allows for the flexible incorporation of different\nestablished hyperelastic finite strain material formulations into anisotropic\ndamage whilst ensuring mesh-independent results by employing a generic set of\nmicromorphic gradient-extensions. First, the anisotropic damage model,\ngenerally satisfying the damage growth criterion, is investigated for the\nspecific choice of a Neo-Hookean material on a single element. Next, the model\nis applied with different gradient-extensions in structural simulations of an\nasymmetrically notched specimen to identify an efficient choice in the form of\na volumetric-deviatoric regularization. Thereafter, the universal framework,\nwhich is without loss of generality here specified for a Neo-Hookean material\nwith a volumetric-deviatoric gradient-extension, successfully serves for the\ncomplex simulation of a pressure loaded rotor blade.\n  After acceptance of the manuscript, we make the codes of the material\nsubroutines accessible to the public at\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11171630.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
