Exotic support vector machines employ unconventional techniques such\nas genetic algorithms and boosting. Physics-informed support vector machines\nintegrate the physics dynamics of a given high-energy physics process in a\nstraightforward manner. The goal is to efficiently distinguish signal and\nbackground events in high-energy physics collision data. To test our\nalgorithms, we perform computational experiments with simulated Drell-Yan\nevents in proton-proton collisions. Our results highlight the superiority of\nthe physics-informed support vector machines, emphasizing their potential in\nhigh-energy physics and promoting the inclusion of physics information in\nmachine learning algorithms for future research.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
