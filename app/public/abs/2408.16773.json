Thus, early detection of traffic\nincidents is crucial for road users from safety perspectives with a potential\nto reduce the risk of secondary crashes. The wide availability of GPS devices\nnow-a-days gives an opportunity of tracking and recording vehicle trajectories.\nThe objective of this study is to use vehicle trajectory data for advance\nreal-time detection of traffic incidents on highways using machine\nlearning-based algorithms. The study uses three days of unevenly sequenced\nvehicle trajectory data and traffic incident data on I-10, one of the most\ncrash-prone highways in Louisiana. Vehicle trajectories are converted to\ntrajectories based on virtual detector locations to maintain spatial uniformity\nas well as to generate historical traffic data for machine learning algorithms.\nTrips matched with traffic incidents on the way are separated and along with\nother trips with similar spatial attributes are used to build a database for\nmodeling. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression,\nRandom Forest, Extreme Gradient Boost, and Artificial Neural Network models are\nused to detect a trajectory that is likely to face an incident in the\ndownstream road section. Results suggest that the Random Forest model achieves\nthe best performance for predicting an incident with reasonable recall value\nand discrimination capability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OQAAZSZCKMJrkH3_V5QvZ_FHoS6GWDeWEirZ8xo58vQ","pdfSize":"1068736"}
