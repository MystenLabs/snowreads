The modified Hawking temperature\nof VBdS black holes is calculated by using tortoise coordinate transformation,\nFeynman prescription and WKB approximation. By considering cosmological\nconstant as a thermodynamic pressure in the extended phase space, we construct\nMaxwell's equal-area law in LIV and study the phase transitions of VBdS black\nhole in P-v, P-V and T-S plane. The LIV increases the length of liquid-gas\ncoexistence region. The thermodynamic quantities such as entropy, heat\ncapacity, Helmholtz free energy, Internal energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free\nenergy of VBdS black hole are discussed. These quantities tend to increase\nunder LIV. The stability of black hole is also discussed in the presence of\nLIV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
