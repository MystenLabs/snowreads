These concerns are gathered together\nunder the name ``veracity\".\n  In the work for this paper we were originally motivated by the requirement\naround organic certification in the wine industry in New Zealand, but veracity\narises in many different situations and our formalisation shows how formal\nmethods can give insights into many such practical problems.\n  One activity for formal methods involves taking informal processes and\nformalising them and subsequently building tools to support this formalisation\nand therefore the original processes too, and the work reported here is an\nexample of that.\n  Here, then, we explore the idea of veracity in this spirit, give highlights\nof the development of a logic for it and show how that logic can be implemented\nin Coq, both for proof support and automation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4uaejvUdLaj-lp72OACishjzaf3_BZCh-fhDY6ZRcW8","pdfSize":"264158"}
