We study a two-orbital Hubbard model featuring\nthe so-called holon-doublon low-energy excitations in the Mott insulating\nnarrow band in the orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP). We employ an improved\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) technique to calculate the spectral\nfunctions at zero temperature. We show that the holon-doublon bound state is\nnot the sole component of the low-energy excitations. Instead, it should be a\nbound state composed of a Kondo-like state in the wide band and a doublon in\nthe narrow band, named inter-band Kondo-like (IBK) bound states. Notably, as\nthe bandwidths of the two bands approach each other, we find anomalous IBK\nbound-state excitations in the metallic {\\em wide} band.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
