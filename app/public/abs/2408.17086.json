They are critical for understanding protein function\nand provide optimal enhanced sampling of protein conformational changes and\nstates. Since the pioneering works in the late 1990s, identifying the correct\nand objectively provable RCs has been a central topic in molecular biophysics\nand chemical physics. This review summarizes the major advances in identifying\nRCs over the past 25 years, focusing on methods aimed at finding RCs that meet\nthe rigorous committor criterion, widely accepted as the true RCs. Importantly,\nthe newly developed physics-based energy flow theory and generalized work\nfunctional method provide a general and rigorous approach for identifying true\nRCs, revealing their physical nature as the optimal channels of energy flow in\nbiomolecules.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
