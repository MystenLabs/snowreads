The size and emerin\noccupancy of these nanodomains change with applied mechanical stress as well as\nunder emerin mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy\n(EDMD). Through a combination of theory and experiment we show here that a\nsimple reaction-diffusion model explains the self-assembly of emerin\nnanodomains. Our model yields quantitative agreement with experimental\nobservations on the size and occupancy of emerin nanodomains for wild-type\nemerin and EDMD-associated mutations of emerin, with and without applied\nforces, and allows successful prediction of emerin diffusion coefficients from\nobservations on the overall properties of emerin nanodomains. Our results\nprovide a physical understanding of EDMD-associated defects in emerin\norganization in terms of changes in key reaction and diffusion properties of\nemerin and its nuclear binding partners.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Quantitative Biology/Subcellular Processes"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
