The accuracies of optimal piecewise-analytic and spectral\nrepresentations are evaluated for equations of state having first- or\nsecond-order phase transitions with a wide range of discontinuity sizes. These\nresults suggest that the piecewise-analytic representations of these non-smooth\nequations of state are convergent, while the spectral representations are not.\nNevertheless, the lower-order (2 <= N_parms <= 7) spectral representations are\nfound to be more accurate than the piecewise-analytic representations with the\nsame number of parameters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
