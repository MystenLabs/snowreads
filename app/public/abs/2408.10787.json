By integrating textual descriptions, we enhance this\nprocess, providing better context and accuracy. The MDETR model significantly\nadvances this by combining image and text data for more versatile object\ndetection and classification. However, MDETR's complexity and high\ncomputational demands hinder its practical use. In this paper, we introduce\nLightweight MDETR (LightMDETR), an optimized MDETR variant designed for\nimproved computational efficiency while maintaining robust multimodal\ncapabilities. Our approach involves freezing the MDETR backbone and training a\nsole component, the Deep Fusion Encoder (DFE), to represent image and text\nmodalities. A learnable context vector enables the DFE to switch between these\nmodalities. Evaluation on datasets like RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg\ndemonstrates that LightMDETR achieves superior precision and accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
