This class of\noperators includes the well-known Laplacian and the square Cheng-Yau operator.\nFor the Laplacian case, our estimate coincides with that obtained by D. Chen,\nT. Zheng, and H. Yang, which is the best possible in terms of the order of the\neigenvalues. For pinched Cartan-Hadamard manifolds the estimates were made in\nparticular cases of this operator.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
