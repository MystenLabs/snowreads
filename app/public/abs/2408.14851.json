As a new paradigm of\nRSs, session-based recommendation (SR) specializes in users' short-term\npreference capture and aims to provide a more dynamic and timely recommendation\nbased on the ongoing interacted actions. In this survey, we will give a\ncomprehensive overview of the recent works on SR. First, we clarify the\ndefinitions of various SR tasks and introduce the characteristics of\nsession-based recommendation against other recommendation tasks. Then, we\nsummarize the existing methods in two categories: sequential neural network\nbased methods and graph neural network (GNN) based methods. The standard\nframeworks and technical are also introduced. Finally, we discuss the\nchallenges of SR and new research directions in this area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
