Therefore, we suggest a video key frame\nextraction algorithm based on shot segmentation using Von Neumann entropy. The\nsegmentation of shots is achieved through the computation of Von Neumann\nentropy of the similarity matrix among frames within the video sequence. The\ninitial frame of each shot is selected as key frames, which combines the\ntemporal sequence information of frames. The experimental results show the\nextracted key frames can fully and accurately represent the original video\ncontent while minimizing the number of repeated frames.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
