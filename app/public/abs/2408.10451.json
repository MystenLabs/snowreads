We have used a Ti:Sapphire (MIRA 900F) laser\nthat can be easily switched from CW to pulsed mode of operation, so there is no\nchange in the experimental conditions in the two cases. We have measured the\ndifference in the trap strength in both cases by fitting the power spectrum\ncurve with Lorentzian. As it turns out, trapping with pulsed tweezers seems to\nbe more effective for the smaller particles and as the particle size is\nincreased both CW and pulsed tweezers appear to be equally effective at lower\naverage laser powers but as the power is increased pulsed tweezers do a better\njob at stable trapping.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
