Traditional measurement techniques are subjective,\ntime-consuming, and do not directly measure physical impairment. This study\nintroduces objective metrics derived from eye-tracking analytics to address\nthese limitations.\n  We employed a head-mounted display to present 20 subjects with smooth pursuit\nperformance, horizontal saccade, and simple reaction time tasks. Individual and\ngroup performance was compared before and after cannabis use. Results\ndemonstrated significant changes in oculomotor control post-cannabis\nconsumption, with smooth pursuit performance showing the most substantial\nsignal.\n  The objective eye-tracking data was used to develop supervised learning\nmodels, achieving a classification accuracy of 89% for distinguishing between\nsober and impaired states when normalized against baseline measures.\nEye-tracking is the optimal candidate for a portable, rapid, and objective tool\nfor assessing cannabis impairment, offering significant improvements over\ncurrent subjective and indirect methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GkCAzr7kW0Ga621SPks_MOYW5hc2NEIUjhbYIGaiVu8","pdfSize":"1095264"}
