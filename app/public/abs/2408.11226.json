Quantum Fourier Transformation (QFT) sits at the heart of\nmany of these applications. Existing work leverages SAT solver or heuristics to\ngenerate a hardware-compliant circuit for QFT by inserting SWAP gates to remap\nlogical qubits to physical qubits. However, they might face problems such as\nlong compilation time due to the huge search space for SAT solver or suboptimal\noutcome in terms of the number of cycles to finish all gate operations. In this\npaper, we propose a domain-specific hardware mapping approach for QFT. We unify\nour insight of relaxed ordering and unit exploration in QFT to search for a\nqubit mapping solution with the help of program synthesis tools. Our method is\nthe first one that guarantees linear-depth QFT circuits for Google Sycamore,\nIBM heavy-hex, and the lattice surgery, with respect to the number of qubits.\nCompared with state-of-the-art approaches, our method can save up to 53% in\nSWAP gate and 92% in depth.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
