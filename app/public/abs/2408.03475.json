A relevant but rarely explored and more\nchallenging question is whether LLMs can detect and explain time series\nanomalies, a critical task across various real-world applications. In this\npaper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs, specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA3,\nin detecting and explaining anomalies in time series. Our studies reveal that:\n1) LLMs cannot be directly used for time series anomaly detection. 2) By\ndesigning prompt strategies such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought\nprompting, GPT-4 can detect time series anomalies with results competitive to\nbaseline methods. 3) We propose a synthesized dataset to automatically generate\ntime series anomalies with corresponding explanations. By applying instruction\nfine-tuning on this dataset, LLaMA3 demonstrates improved performance in time\nseries anomaly detection tasks. In summary, our exploration shows the promising\npotential of LLMs as time series anomaly detectors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
