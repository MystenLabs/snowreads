We\nderive the background and perturbation equations of motion from the action. We\nalso derive the no-ghost and Laplacian instability conditions for tensor modes\nand scalar mode propagation. Then we study the evolution of the matter\nperturbation in the quasi-static approximation. We find that the gravitational\ncouplings to the baryonic and cold dark matter over density are modified in\nthis theory. We introduce a concrete model of the free function in the theory\nand study the background and linear perturbation dynamics. We then use the\ngenetic algorithm to test the model. We compare the $H(z)$ function of the\nmodel and the $H(z)$ curve predicted by the genetic algorithm, using the $H(z)$\ndata. For the perturbation sector we compute the $f\\sigma_{8}$ observable for\nthe model and compare it with the predicted function from the genetic algorithm\nfrom the $f\\sigma_{8}$ data.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
