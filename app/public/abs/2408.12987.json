So far, it was only known that\nsolutions are H\\\"older continuous up to the boundary, and establishing their\noptimal regularity has remained an open problem in the field. Our proof is\nbased on a delicate higher order Campanato-type iteration at the boundary,\nwhich we develop in the context of nonlocal equations and which is quite\ndifferent from the local theory.\n  As an application of our results, we establish sharp two-sided Green\nfunctions estimates in $C^{1,\\alpha}$ domains for the same class of operators.\nPreviously, this was only known under additional structural assumptions on the\ncoefficients and in more regular domains.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
