While we expect gravitational waves (GWs) from compact\nbinary coalescences to also experience lensing, the phenomenology of highly\nmagnified GWs has not been fully exploited. In this letter, we fill this gap\nand explore the observational signatures of these highly magnified GWs. We find\nthat these signatures are robust against modeling details and can be used as\nsmoking-gun evidence to confirm the detection of lensing of GWs without any\nelectromagnetic observation. Additionally, diffraction becomes important in\nsome cases, which limits the maximum possible magnification and gives waveform\nsignatures of lensing that can only be observed by GW detectors. Even with\ncurrent-generation observatories, we are already sensitive to these highly\nmagnified GWs and can use them to probe the high-redshift Universe beyond the\nusual horizon.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
