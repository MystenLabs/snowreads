In other words, they are defined by a permutation $\\pi$ on\n$n$ elements, such that $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if an only if $u<v$ but\n$\\pi(u)>\\pi(v)$. We consider the problem of computing the distances in such a\ngraph in the setting of informative labeling schemes.\n  The goal of such a scheme is to assign a short bitstring $\\ell(u)$ to every\nvertex $u$, such that the distance between $u$ and $v$ can be computed using\nonly $\\ell(u)$ and $\\ell(v)$, and no further knowledge about the whole graph\n(other than that it is a permutation graph). This elegantly captures the\nintuition that we would like our data structure to be distributed, and often\nleads to interesting combinatorial challenges while trying to obtain lower and\nupper bounds that match up to the lower-order terms.\n  For distance labeling of permutation graphs on $n$ vertices, Katz, Katz, and\nPeleg [STACS 2000] showed how to construct labels consisting of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{2} n)$ bits. Later, Bazzaro and Gavoille [Discret. Math.\n309(11)] obtained an asymptotically optimal bounds by showing how to construct\nlabels consisting of $9\\log{n}+\\mathcal{O}(1)$ bits, and proving that\n$3\\log{n}-\\mathcal{O}(\\log{\\log{n}})$ bits are necessary. This however leaves a\nquite large gap between the known lower and upper bounds. We close this gap by\nshowing how to construct labels consisting of $3\\log{n}+\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\log\nn)$ bits.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
