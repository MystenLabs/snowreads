An extension $L/K$ is weakly\ntotally ramified if the residue extension is purely inseparable. We prove that\nelliptic curves over $K$ and dynamical systems on $\\mathbb{P}^1_K$ achieve\nsemistable reduction over a separable weakly totally ramified extension of $K$.\nThe key ingredient is a refinement of a result of Ax on the approximation of\nroots of univariate polynomials by elements that generate $p$-extensions. All\nof our arguments are constructive.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
