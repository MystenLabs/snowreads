In alkaline Rydberg molecules, bound\nvibrational states exist even when these potential wells are disrupted by level\nrepulsion from the steep butterfly potential energy curve induced by a\nscattering shape resonance. The binding in this case is attributed to quantum\nreflection. However, the rapidly varying regions of the potential energy\nlandscape where quantum reflection occurs often coincide with regions where\nnon-adiabatic coupling becomes significant. By comparing the molecular states\ncalculated within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where quantum reflection\nis the only binding mechanism, with those obtained from the full set of coupled\nchannel equations, we can assess the effects of non-adiabatic coupling on\nvibrational energies and lifetimes. Our findings show that these couplings can\nstabilize the molecule by providing an additional barrier which protects the\nvibrational states from predissociation and non-radiative transitions. There\ncan also be extreme cases where non-adiabatic coupling completely dominates the\nbinding and the molecular lifetimes saturate at the atomic Rydberg lifetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
