We propose\nand validate a generic DNS approach: Diffuse-Resistance-Domain (DRD). It\novercomes the above challenges by employing Onsager's principle to formulate\ndynamic models and combining traditional diffuse-interface models for\nfluid-fluid interfacial dynamics with a novel implementation of complex\nfluid-solid interfacial conditions via smooth interpolations of\ndynamic-resistance coefficients across interfaces. After careful validation by\nbenchmark simulations, we simulated three challenging mFSI problems taken from\ndifferent fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
