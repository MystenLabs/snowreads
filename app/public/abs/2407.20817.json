The Transformer model, a leading method for load prediction, faces\nchallenges modeling historical data due to variables like weather, events,\nfestivals, and data volatility. To tackle this, the cloud model's fuzzy feature\nis utilized to manage uncertainties effectively. Presenting an innovative\napproach, the Cloud Model Improved Transformer (CMIT) method integrates the\nTransformer model with the cloud model utilizing the particle swarm\noptimization algorithm, with the aim of achieving robust and precise power load\npredictions. Through comparative experiments conducted on 31 real datasets\nwithin a power network cluster, it is demonstrated that CMIT significantly\nsurpasses the Transformer model in terms of prediction accuracy, thereby\nhighlighting its effectiveness in enhancing forecasting capabilities within the\npower network cluster sector.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
