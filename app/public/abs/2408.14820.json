We study\ntrinomial $x^h+x+1$ over GF(2), which has the maximum number of consecutive\nzero coefficients and leads to efficient implementation. Existing results\ntypically deal with finite values of $h$ and rely on computer computation\nmethods for finding the periods. In contrast, here we derive closed-form\nexpressions for the periods of this trinomial for infinite sets of $h$ values.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
