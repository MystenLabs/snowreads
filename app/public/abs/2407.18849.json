Nonnegative matrix factorization provides an efficient\nframework for identifying communities in static networks but fall short in\ndepicting temporal variations in community affiliations. To solve this problem,\nthis paper proposes a Modularity maximization-incorporated Nonnegative Tensor\nRESCAL Decomposition (MNTD) model for dynamic community detection. This method\nserves two primary functions: a) Nonnegative tensor RESCAL decomposition\nextracts latent community structures in different time slots, highlighting the\npersistence and transformation of communities; and b) Incorporating an initial\ncommunity structure into the modularity maximization algorithm, facilitating\nmore precise community segmentations. Comparative analysis of real-world\ndatasets shows that the MNTD is superior to state-of-the-art dynamic community\ndetection methods in the accuracy of community detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
