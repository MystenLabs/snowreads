The\nstudy is carried out both in the weak field limit and in the strong field\nlimit. We analytically deduced the expansions for light deflection in the two\nlimits and, from them, we determined the observables in order to provide\nelements so that observational tools are able to identify these solutions. We\nmodel possible gravitational scenarios in order to verify the possible\ngravitational characteristics of the solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
