Based on\nlarge-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations and unrestricted\nHartree-Fock mean-field analysis, we identify itinerant ferromagnetic phases in\nthe intermediate-$U$ Hubbard model with finite doping and reveal the kinetic\nmechanisms assisted by geometric frustration. Notably, we find that the\ndoublon-singlon exchange process among other microscopic charge hoppings solely\ndrives the fully polarized ferromagnetism for geometrically frustrated\ntriangular lattice. Additionally, we establish the whole magnetic phase diagram\nand illustrate itinerant ferromagnetism within a finite range of electron\ndoping for finite on-site Coulomb repulsion. The comparison of local spin\ncorrelations with recent cold-atom experiments is also discussed. Our work\nenhances the understanding of ferromagnetism mechanisms at intermediate\ncoupling strength and finite doping concentrations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
