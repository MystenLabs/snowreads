However, the delineation of small lesions, critical for stroke\ndiagnosis, remains a challenge. In this study, we propose two straightforward\nyet powerful approaches that can be seamlessly integrated into a variety of\nnetworks: Multi-Size Labeling (MSL) and Distance-Based Labeling (DBL), with the\naim of enhancing the segmentation accuracy of small lesions. MSL divides lesion\nmasks into various categories based on lesion volume while DBL emphasizes the\nlesion boundaries. Experimental evaluations on the Anatomical Tracings of\nLesions After Stroke (ATLAS) v2.0 dataset showcase that an ensemble of MSL and\nDBL achieves consistently better or equal performance on recall (3.6% and\n3.7%), F1 (2.4% and 1.5%), and Dice scores (1.3% and 0.0%) compared to the\ntop-1 winner of the 2022 MICCAI ATLAS Challenge on both the subset only\ncontaining small lesions and the entire dataset, respectively. Notably, on the\nmini-lesion subset, a single MSL model surpasses the previous best ensemble\nstrategy, with enhancements of 1.0% and 0.3% on F1 and Dice scores,\nrespectively.
