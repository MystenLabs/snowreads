However, the task of selecting the most suitable\nforecasting method for a given dataset is a complex task due to the diversity\nof data patterns and characteristics. This research aims to address this\nchallenge by proposing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and ranking\ntime series forecasting methods across a wide range of datasets. This study\ninvestigates the comparative performance of many methods from two prominent\ntime series forecasting frameworks, AutoGluon-Timeseries, and sktime to shed\nlight on their applicability in different real-world scenarios. This research\ncontributes to the field of time series forecasting by providing a robust\nbenchmarking methodology and facilitating informed decision-making when\nchoosing forecasting methods for achieving optimal prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
