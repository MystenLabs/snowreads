Following our previous theoretical framework based on quantum kinetic\ntheory, we consider three different scenarios: $\\Lambda$ equilibrium, $s$ quark\nequilibrium, and iso-thermal equilibrium scenarios. We have computed the second\nFourier sine coefficients of spin polarization along the beam direction,\ndenoted as $\\left\\langle P_{z} \\sin 2(\\phi_{p} - \\Psi_{2}) \\right\\rangle$, with\n$\\phi_{p} - \\Psi_{2}$ being the azimuthal angle relative to the second-order\nevent plane $\\Psi_{2}$, as functions of multiplicity, transverse momentum and\npseudo-rapidity in the three scenarios. Additionally, we have also computed the\nspin polarization along the beam direction, $P_{z}$, as a function of the\nazimuthal angle. We find that the spin polarization induced by thermal\nvorticity always provides an opposite contribution compared to the\nshear-induced polarization in p+Pb collisions. The total spin polarization\ncomputed by the current hydrodynamic model disagrees with the data measured by\nLHC-CMS experiments. Our findings imply that other non-flow effects may play a\ncrucial role in p+Pb collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
