In recent years,\ninverse problem methods, especially the inverse matrix method, have shown\nbetter handling of QCD sum rules. This work continues to develop the inverse\nmatrix method. Considering that the narrow-width approximation may still be a\ngood approximation, we separate the contribution of the ground state from the\nspectral density. Then follow the general steps of the inverse matrix method to\nextract physical quantities such as decay constants that we are sometimes more\ninterested in.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
