Consequently, all periods\nare exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the\ncontact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic\nflows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators,\nLotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and\nsome geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic\noscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct\ncalculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum\nof semiclassical Shr\\\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical\nanalogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
