The two-photon absorption\ncoefficient enhanced by the metamaterial structure was 424 cm/GW, which is\n1.2x10^3 times higher than that of Si. Using this metamaterial waveguide-based\nnonlinear optical activation function, we achieved a high inference accuracy of\n98.36% in the handwritten character recognition task, comparable to that\nobtained with the ReLU function as the activation function. Therefore, our\napproach can contribute to the realization of more power-efficient and compact\nall-optical neural networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
