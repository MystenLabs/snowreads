As a consequence, we prove the Boone--Higman\nConjecture for all Baumslag--Solitar groups and for all free(finite\nrank)-by-cyclic groups, solving it in two cases that have been raised\nexplicitly by Belk, Bleak, Matucci and Zaremsky. We also illustrate that our\nmethod has applications beyond these cases and can for instance be used to\nprove the Boone--Higman Conjecture for the Leary--Minasyan groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
