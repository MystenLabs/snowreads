We show that a sample based approximation of this model\nconverges under suitable sufficient conditions. We also show that upper and\nlower bounds on the optimal value of the model can be estimated statistically.\nSpecific ambiguity sets are discussed as examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
