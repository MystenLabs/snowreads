Based on an analysis of its local\nenvironments we design a binary system of 8- and 5-patch particles that in\nsimulations assembles into a 3-dimensional octagonal quasicrystal. The local\nstructure is subtly different from the original ideal quasicrystal possessing a\nnarrower coordination-number distribution; in fact, the 8-patch particles are\nnot needed and a one-component system of the 5-patch particles assembles into\nan essentially identical octagonal quasicrystal. We also consider a\none-component system of the 8-patch particles; this assembles into a cluster\nwith a number of crystalline domains, but which, because of the coherent\nboundaries between the crystallites, has approximate eight-fold order. We\nenvisage that these systems could be realized using DNA origami or protein\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NLVv6Cbn2Nyk616EZO5ZMudDLZwfP_-Ei_AhLC4ezzk","pdfSize":"48306651"}
