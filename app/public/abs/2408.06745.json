Such Chevalley groups are defined over a commutative\nring $ R $, and the root groups of the resulting $ H_3 $-grading are\ncoordinatised by $ R \\times R $. We show that every $ H_3 $-graded group arises\nas the folding of a $ D_6 $-graded group, or in other words, that it is\ncoordinatised by $ R \\times R $ for some commutative ring $ R $.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
