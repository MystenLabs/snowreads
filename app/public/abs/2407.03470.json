However, by their nature, these embeddings contain\nidentifiable information which raises privacy concerns. In this work, we aim to\nanonymize embeddings while preserving the diagnostic utility for dementia\ndetection. Previous studies rely on adversarial learning and models trained on\nthe target attribute and struggle in limited-resource settings. We propose a\nnovel approach that leverages domain knowledge to disentangle prosody features\nrelevant to dementia from speaker embeddings without relying on a dementia\nclassifier. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in\npreserving speaker privacy (speaker recognition F1-score .01%) while\nmaintaining high dementia detection score F1-score of 74% on the ADReSS\ndataset. Our results are also on par with a more constrained\nclassifier-dependent system on ADReSSo (.01% and .66%), and have no impact on\nsynthesized speech naturalness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uI5UZntv7LMahRrz5lZvrFRiWxwM-KXQD5FsVst-LZE","pdfSize":"266572"}
