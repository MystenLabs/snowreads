Given\n$d\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and constants $0<c<1, \\varepsilon>0$, we show that if every\nsubset $S\\subseteq V(G)$ of size exactly $\\frac{c|V(G)|}{d}$ satisfies\n$|N(S)|\\ge d|S|$ and $p=\\frac{1+\\varepsilon}{d}$, then the probability that\n$G_p$ does not contain a cycle of length $\\Omega(\\varepsilon^2c^2|V(G)|)$ is\nexponentially small in $|V(G)|$. As an intermediate step, we also show that\ngiven $k,d\\in \\mathbb{N}$ and a constant $\\varepsilon>0$, if every subset\n$S\\subseteq V(G)$ of size exactly $k$ satisfies $|N(S)|\\ge kd$ and\n$p=\\frac{1+\\varepsilon}{d}$, then the probability that $G_p$ does not contain a\npath of length $\\Omega(\\varepsilon^2 kd)$ is exponentially small.
