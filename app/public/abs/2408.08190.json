They can predict solutions of PDEs with\ndifferent initial and boundary conditions, as well as different input\nfunctions. The recently proposed Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO) utilizes the\ntime-frequency localization of wavelets to capture spatial manifolds\neffectively. While WNO has shown promise as an operator learning method, it\nonly parameterizes neural network weights under higher-order wavelet\nfactorization. This approach avoids noise interference but may result in\ninsufficient extraction of high-frequency features from the data. In this\nstudy, we propose a new network architecture called U-WNO. It incorporates the\nU-Net path and residual shortcut into the wavelet layer to enhance the\nextraction of high-frequency features and improve the learning of spatial\nmanifolds. Additionally, we introduce the Adaptive Activation Function into the\nwavelet layer to address the spectral bias of the neural network. The\neffectiveness of U-WNO is demonstrated through numerical experiments on various\nproblems, including the Burgers equation, Darcy flow, Navier-Stokes equation,\nAllen-Cahn equation, Non-homogeneous Poisson equation, and Wave advection\nequation. This study also includes a comparative analysis of existing operator\nlearning frameworks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
