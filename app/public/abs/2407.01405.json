As people were compelled to limit their physical interactions and stay\nat home, they turned to online social platforms to alleviate feelings of\nloneliness. Ego networks represent how people organize their relationships due\nto human cognitive constraints that impose limits on meaningful interactions\namong people. Physical contacts were disrupted during the lockdown, causing\nsocialization to shift entirely online, leading to a shift in socialization\ninto online platforms. Our research aimed to investigate the impact of lockdown\nmeasures on online ego network structures potentially caused by the increase of\ncognitive expenses in online social networks. In particular, we examined a\nlarge Twitter dataset of users, covering 7 years of their activities. We found\nthat during the lockdown, there was an increase in network sizes and a richer\nstructure in social circles, with relationships becoming more intimate.\nMoreover, we observe that, after the lockdown measures were relaxed, these\nfeatures returned to their pre-lockdown values.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
