This inclusion\nalso improves jet shape ratio at small angle and jet fragmentation function\nratios of leading charged hadrons. The MARTINI framework is then aimed at a\nstudy of the leading order, next-to-leading-order, and non perturbative\ncollision kernels. Sizable differences in the modification of jet substructure\nobservables, i.e., jet shape and fragmentation functions are observed. Such\ndifferences are caused by the difference in the radiation rates of relatively\nsoft gluons that survive in the evolution in medium.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
