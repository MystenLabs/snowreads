A\nbijection $f:V(G)\\cup E(G)\\to \\{1,2,\\ldots,p+q\\}$ is called a local antimagic\ntotal labeling of $G$ if for any two adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$, we have\n$w(u)\\ne w(v)$, where $w(u) = f(u) + \\sum_{e\\in E(u)} f(e)$ and $E(u)$ is the\nset of incident edge(s) of $u$. The local antimagic total chromatic number,\ndenoted $\\chi_{lat}(G)$, is the minimum number of distinct weights over local\nantimagic total labeling of $G$. In this paper, we provide a correct proof and\nexact local antimagic total chromatic number of path and spider graphs given in\n[Local vertex antimagic total coloring of path graph and amalgamation of path,\n{\\it CGANT J. Maths Appln.} {\\bf 5(1)} 2024, DOI:10.25037/cgantjma.v5i1.109].\nFurther, we determined the local antimagic total chromatic number of spider\ngraph with each leg of length at most 2. We also showed the existence of\nunicyclic and bicyclic graphs with local antimagic total chromatic number 3.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
