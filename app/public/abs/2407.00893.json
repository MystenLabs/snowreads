For a class of power nonlinear\nsub-diffusion models with variable coefficients, we prove that their solutions\nhave Mittag-Leffler stability when the source functions satisfy natural decay\nassumptions. That is the solutions have the decay rate\n$\\|u(t)\\|_{L^{s}(\\Omega)}=O\\left( t^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)/\\gamma} \\right)$ as\n$t\\rightarrow\\infty$, where $\\alpha$, $\\gamma$ are positive constants,\n$\\beta\\in(-\\alpha,\\infty)$ and $s\\in (1,\\infty)$. Then we develop the structure\npreserving algorithm for this type of model. For the complete\nmonotonicity-preserving ($\\mathcal{CM}$-preserving) schemes developed by Li and\nWang (Commun. Math. Sci., 19(5):1301-1336, 2021), we prove that they satisfy\nthe discrete comparison principle for time fractional differential equations\nwith variable coefficients. Then, by carefully constructing the fine the\ndiscrete supsolution and subsolution, we obtain the long time optimal decay\nrate of the numerical solution $\\|u_{n}\\|_{L^{s}(\\Omega)}=O\\left(\nt_n^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)/\\gamma} \\right)$ as $t_{n}\\rightarrow\\infty$, which is\nfully agree with the theoretical solution. Finally, we validated the analysis\nresults through numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"grTkQR5HwCxfa5eKGC0BlGgOUgPhoo3UiSzGyFruRV8","pdfSize":"490873","objectId":"0x3846efb704c3f6d580d66cc23aa9327ec2bec9ac7707c4d370f65345f217d370","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
