Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory provides an important link between\nexperimental properties of non-s wave superconductors and the more general\nFermi-liquid theory. The multiple superconducting phases of UPt$_3$ provide an\nideal example of the role that is played by the GL theory for non-s wave\nsuperconductors. The difference between non-s wave superconductivity and\nconventional anisotropic superconductivity is illustrated here by the unique\neffects that impurities are predicted to have on the properties of non-s wave\nsuperconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
