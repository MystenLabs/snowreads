Starting from\nthirty-four statistically weighted interactions derived from chiral effective\nfield theory, we apply the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization\ngroup to calculate nuclear matrix elements in four key experimental isotopes.\nComparing with the $^1S_0$-channel phase shifts given from each interaction, in\nall cases we observe a strong correlation for scattering energies above 75 MeV.\nFurthermore, a global sensitivity analysis, enabled by newly developed\nmachine-learning emulators, confirms that the nuclear matrix elements of the\ndecay depend primarily on the $C_{1S0}$ low-energy constant, which is\nassociated with the phase shifts in that partial wave. These results provide\nthe first clear correlation between $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay nuclear matrix\nelements and a measured observable and will therefore serve as a crucial\ncomponent in ongoing and future refinements of ab initio uncertainty estimates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
