Existing implicit methods usually\nproduce superior smooth and watertight meshes due to the isosurface extraction\nalgorithms~(e.g., Marching Cubes). However, these methods become memory and\ncomputationally intensive with increasing resolution. Explicit methods are more\nefficient by directly forming the face from points. Nevertheless, the challenge\nof selecting appropriate faces from enormous candidates often leads to\nundesirable faces and holes. Moreover, the reconstruction performance of both\napproaches tends to degrade when the point cloud gets sparse. To this end, we\npropose MEsh Reconstruction via edGE~(MergeNet), which converts mesh\nreconstruction into local connectivity prediction problems. Specifically,\nMergeNet learns to extract the features of candidate edges and regress their\ndistances to the underlying surface. Consequently, the predicted distance is\nutilized to filter out edges that lay on surfaces. Finally, the meshes are\nreconstructed by refining the triangulations formed by these edges. Extensive\nexperiments on synthetic and real-scanned datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof MergeNet to SoTA explicit methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
