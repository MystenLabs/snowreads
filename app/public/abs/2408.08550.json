Our target problem is a safety problem on string\ndiagrams of OTs, which requires proving or disproving that the minimum\ntransportation cost in a given string diagram of OTs is above a given\nthreshold. We reduce the safety problem on a string diagram of OTs to that on a\nmonolithic OT by composing cost matrices. Our novel reduction exploits an\nalgebraic structure of cost matrices equipped with two compositions: a\nsequential composition and a parallel composition. We provide a novel algorithm\nfor the safety problem on string diagrams of OTs by our reduction, and we\ndemonstrate its efficiency and performance advantage through experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
