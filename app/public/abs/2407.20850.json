A degeneracy between the longest-living quasinormal\nmode and the first overtone is found for $(M\\mu)_c \\simeq 0.3704981$ and\n$(a/M)_c\\simeq 0.9994660$. We show that the longest-living mode and the first\novertone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around\nthe point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric\nphase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a\nthermodynamic analogy.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
