Here, we use RC to predict highly\nstochastic dynamics of cell shapes. We find that RC is able to predict the\nsteady state climate from very limited data. Furthermore, the RC learns the\ntimescale of transients from only four observations. We find that these\ncapabilities of the RC to act as a dynamic twin allows us to also infer\nimportant statistics of cell shape dynamics of unobserved conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
