In the case when $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ is a\nMaass lift of a specific Poincar\\'e series, we establish a connection with the\nstandard $L-$function attached to $F$. What is more, we find explicit choices\nof orthogonal groups, for which we obtain a clear$-$cut Euler product\nexpression for this Dirichlet series. Our considerations recover a classical\nresult for Siegel modular forms, first introduced by Kohnen and Skoruppa, but\nalso provide a range of new examples, which can be related to other kinds of\nmodular forms, such as paramodular, hermitian and quaternionic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
