Current\nmonitoring technologies for detecting underwater litter face limitations in\nsurvey efficiency, cost, and environmental conditions, highlighting the need\nfor efficient, consumer-grade technologies for automatic detection. This\nresearch introduces the Aerial-Aquatic Speedy Scanner (AASS) combined with\nSuper-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) and an improved YOLOv8 detection network.\nAASS enhances data acquisition efficiency over traditional methods, capturing\nhigh-quality images that accurately identify underwater waste. SRR improves\nimage-resolution by mitigating motion blur and insufficient resolution, thereby\nenhancing detection tasks. Specifically, the RCAN model achieved the highest\nmean average precision (mAP) of 78.6% for detection accuracy on reconstructed\nimages among the tested SRR models. With a magnification factor of 4, the SRR\ntest set shows an improved mAP compared to the conventional bicubic set. These\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting\nunderwater litter.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
