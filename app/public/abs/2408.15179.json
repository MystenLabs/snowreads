These models host symmetry-protected topological phases,\ncharacterized by edge modes with vanishing single-particle energy in the\nthermodynamic limit. The same fact prevents the standard VQE algorithm from\nconverging to the correct ground state for finite chains, since it is\nquasi-degenerate in energy with other many-body states. Notably, this\nquasi-degeneracy cannot be removed by small perturbations, as in typical spin\nsystems. We address this issue by imposing appropriate constraints on the VQE\nevolution and constructing appropriate variational circuits, to restrict the\nprobed portion of the Hilbert space along the same evolution. These constraints\nstem from both general properties of the topological phases and of the studied\nHamiltonians. In this way, the improved VQE algorithm achieves an accurate\nconvergence to the exact ground states in each phase. The present approach\npromises large applicability, also to realistic systems and possibly with\ndifferent topology, thanks to the very high fidelity achieved also on systems\nwith a relatively high number of qubits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
