We rigorously prove the\nconvergence of this algorithm. Furthermore, we leverage deep learning to\ninitialize the conjugate gradient method, resulting in a deep unrolling network\nwith theoretical guarantees. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed algorithm surpasses existing methods, particularly excelling\nin fewer scanned views and complex noise conditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
