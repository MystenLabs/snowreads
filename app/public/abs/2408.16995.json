{"id":"2408.16995","title":"Characterizing User Platforms for Video Streaming in Broadband Networks","authors":"Yifan Wang, Minzhao Lyu, Vijay Sivaraman","authorsParsed":[["Wang","Yifan",""],["Lyu","Minzhao",""],["Sivaraman","Vijay",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 03:57:44 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-09-02","timestamp":1724990264000,"abstract":"  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) bear the brunt of being the first port of\ncall for poor video streaming experience. ISPs can benefit from knowing the\nuser's device type (e.g., Android, iOS) and software agent (e.g., native app,\nChrome) to troubleshoot platform-specific issues, plan capacity and create\ncustom bundles. Unfortunately, encryption and NAT have limited ISPs' visibility\ninto user platforms across video streaming providers. We develop a methodology\nto identify user platforms for video streams from four popular providers,\nnamely YouTube, Netflix, Disney, and Amazon, by analyzing network traffic in\nreal-time. First, we study the anatomy of the connection establishment process\nto show how TCP/QUIC and TLS handshakes vary across user platforms. We then\ndevelop a classification pipeline that uses 62 attributes extracted from the\nhandshake messages to determine the user device and software agent of video\nflows with over 96% accuracy. Our method is evaluated and deployed in a large\ncampus network (mimicking a residential broadband network) serving users\nincluding dormitory residents. Analysis of 100+ million video streams over a\nfour-month period reveals insights into the mix of user platforms across the\nvideo providers, variations in bandwidth consumption across operating systems\nand browsers, and differences in peak hours of usage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
