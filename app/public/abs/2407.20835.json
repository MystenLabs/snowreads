The limit behavior of the height functions\nat the co-existence line was known to be exotic in the sense that the\nfirst-order limit theorem (when divided by $n$) has a random limit. Here, we\nshow that with a random centering and then divided by $\\sqrt n$, the\nsecond-order limit of the height functions is a (random) mixture of two\nindependent Brownian motions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
