While product search is\nuseful for shoppers to find the actual products meeting their requirements in\nthe catalog, information seeking systems can be utilized to answer any\nquestions they may have to refine those requirements. The recent success of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) has opened up an opportunity to bridge the gap\nbetween the two tasks to help customers achieve their goals quickly and\neffectively by integrating conversational QA within product search. In this\npaper, we propose to recommend users Question-Answer (Q&A) pairs that are\nrelevant to their product search and can help them make a purchase decision. We\ndiscuss the different aspects of the problem including the requirements and\ncharacteristics of the Q&A pairs, their generation, and the optimization of the\nQ&A recommendation task. We highlight the challenges, open problems, and\nsuggested solutions to encourage future research in this emerging area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
