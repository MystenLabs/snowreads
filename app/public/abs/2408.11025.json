We present an algorithm that combines classical shadow\ntomography with physical constraints on the two-electron reduced density matrix\n(2-RDM) to treat excited states. The method reduces the number of measurements\nof the many-electron 2-RDM on quantum computers by (i) approximating the\nquantum state through a random sampling technique called shadow tomography and\n(ii) ensuring that the 2-RDM represents an $N$-electron system through imposing\n$N$-representability constraints by semidefinite programming. This generalizes\nrecent work on the $N$-representability-enhanced shadow tomography of\nground-state 2-RDMs. We compute excited-state energies and 2-RDMs of the H$_4$\nchain and analyze the critical points along the photoexcited reaction pathway\nfrom gauche-1,3-butadiene to bicyclobutane via a conical intersection. The\nresults show that the generalized shadow tomography retains critical\nmultireference correlation effects while significantly reducing the number of\nrequired measurements, offering a promising avenue for the efficient treatment\nof electronically excited states on quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
