This design draws an\nanalogy to the real-valued non-volume-preserving (real NVP) method used in\nnormalizing flow techniques. Utilizing this neural network type allows for\nlearning tasks on unknown Hamiltonian systems without breaking the inherent\nsymplectic structure of the phase space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R6IY2OGLP0gl1N81a_d1bBVTsVrZpQe2pW1c5PajSho","pdfSize":"877951"}
