However, it has also raised some safety concerns\nregarding data protection, as videos can be more easily annotated, even without\nauthorization. This paper introduces Video Watermarking, a novel technique to\nprotect videos from unauthorized annotations by such video-based LLMs,\nespecially concerning the video content and description, in response to\nspecific queries. By imperceptibly embedding watermarks into key video frames\nwith multi-modal flow-based losses, our method preserves the viewing experience\nwhile preventing misuse by video-based LLMs. Extensive experiments show that\nVideo Watermarking significantly reduces the comprehensibility of videos with\nvarious video-based LLMs, demonstrating both stealth and robustness. In\nessence, our method provides a solution for securing video content, ensuring\nits integrity and confidentiality in the face of evolving video-based LLMs\ntechnologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
