Given $k \\geq\n1$, we develop a model for unital $k$-restricted $\\infty$-operads, which are\nvariants of $\\infty$-operads which has only $(\\leq k)$-arity morphisms, as\ncomplete Segal presheaves on closed $k$-dendroidal trees, which are closed\ntrees build from corollas with valences $\\leq k$. Furthermore, we prove that\nthe restriction functors from unital $\\infty$-operads to unital $k$-restricted\n$\\infty$-operads admit fully faithful left and right adjoints by showing that\nthe left and right Kan extensions preserve complete Segal objects. Varying $k$,\nthe left and right adjoints give a filtration and a co-filtration for any\nunital $\\infty$-operads by $k$-restricted $\\infty$-operads.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
