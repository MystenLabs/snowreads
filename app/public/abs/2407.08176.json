Mirroring the concept of software crisis, the\nincreasing complexity of FMs making FM crisis a tangible concern in the coming\ndecade, appealing for new theories and methodologies from the field of software\nengineering. In this paper, we outline our vision of introducing Foundation\nModel (FM) engineering, a strategic response to the anticipated FM crisis with\nprincipled engineering methodologies. FM engineering aims to mitigate potential\nissues in FM development and application through the introduction of\ndeclarative, automated, and unified programming interfaces for both data and\nmodel management, reducing the complexities involved in working with FMs by\nproviding a more structured and intuitive process for developers. Through the\nestablishment of FM engineering, we aim to provide a robust, automated, and\nextensible framework that addresses the imminent challenges, and discovering\nnew research opportunities for the software engineering field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
