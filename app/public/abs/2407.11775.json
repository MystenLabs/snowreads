Limited by the heat load of cabling and the massive\ncost of electronics, such an architecture is not viable for millions of qubits\nrequired for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Monolithic integration of the\ncontrol electronics and the qubits provides a promising solution, which,\nhowever, requires a coherent cryogenic microwave pulse generator that is\ncompatible with superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we report such a signal\nsource driven by digital-like signals, generating pulsed microwave emission\nwith well-controlled phase, intensity, and frequency directly at millikelvin\ntemperatures. We showcase high-fidelity readout of superconducting qubits with\nthe microwave pulse generator. The device demonstrated here has a small\nfootprint, negligible heat load, great flexibility to operate, and is fully\ncompatible with today's superconducting quantum circuits, thus providing an\nenabling technology for large-scale superconducting quantum computers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
