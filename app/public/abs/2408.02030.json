Manipulation of the crystal symmetry\nand hence the nontrivial topological states would serve as a fertile ground to\nexplore exotic topological properties. Combining experimental and theoretical\ninvestigations, we demonstrate herein the flexible switch of nontrivial\ntopological states in the single phase of kagome magnet GdMn6Ge6. The intrinsic\nanomalous Hall effect caused by distinct Berry curvatures along different\ncrystallographic directions is realized through selectively breaking the mirror\nsymmetries in these directions by external magnetic field, which is fully\nsupported by the first-principles calculations. Our results set an explicit\nexample demonstrating the strong correlation between structure symmetry and\nnontrivial topological states, as well as the switchable topological properties\nin a single magnetic topological phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
