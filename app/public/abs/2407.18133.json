Here we investigate the vapor\ndeposition of a class of tetrahedral materials (including silicon and water)\nvia molecular dynamics simulations of the generalized Stillinger-Weber\npotential. By changing a single parameter that controls the local\ntetrahedrality, we show that the emergence of ultrastable behavior is\ncorrelated with an increase in the fragility of the model. At the same time,\nwhile the mobility of the surface compared to the bulk shows only slight\nchanges at low temperature, with increasing the tetrahedrality, it displays a\nsignificant enhancement towards the glass transition temperature. Our results\npoint towards a strong connection between bulk dynamics, surface dynamics and\nglass-ultrastability ability in this class of materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
