The algorithm also approximates the solution to the related semi-linear\nparabolic partial differential equation (PDE) obtained through the well-known\nFeynman-Kac representation. For the sake of enriching the algorithm with\nhigh-order convergence a weighted approximation of the solution is computed and\nappropriate conditions on the parameters of the method are inferred. With the\nchallenge of tackling problems in high dimensions we propose suitable\nprojections of the solution and efficient parallelizations of the algorithm\ntaking advantage of powerful many-core processors such as graphics processing\nunits (GPUs).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
