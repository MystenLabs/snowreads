Specifically, we\ndevise a battery model capturing voltage dynamics, temperature and lifetime\ndegradation solely using data from manufacturer datasheets, and jointly\noptimize the capacity distribution between the two batteries and the power\nsplit, for a given drive cycle and HESS topology. The results show that the\nlowest energy consumption is obtained with a hybrid solution consisting of a\nNCA-NMC combination, since this provides the best trade-off between efficiency\nand added weight.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"7o3y3d2y9l9mEOwrDd2OfMvaxqPR6RMLXg4HSVpdhYk","pdfSize":"921866"}
