We then use a lower-dimensional EFT description to show\nthat any dS solution has a universal tachyon and no parametric control. The\nsimplest AdS solutions are also perturbatively unstable. We extend the no-go\ntheorems to slow-roll acceleration and test various swampland conjectures in\nour non-supersymmetric string setup. The question of numerically controlled,\nunstable dS is left open.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZMw5wWNTYTImibymqflsCG-Q2IYjfzYuNFhfD9jpfJk","pdfSize":"538880"}
