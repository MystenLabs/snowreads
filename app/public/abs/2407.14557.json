Skiagraphy projects 3D objects onto 2D surfaces to display\ngeometric properties. Traditional shading of tori involves extensive manual\ncalculations and multiple projections, leading to high complexity and\ninaccuracies. The proposed method simplifies this by focusing on the elevation\nview, eliminating the need for multiple projections and complex math. Utilizing\ndescriptive geometry, it reduces labor and complexity. Accuracy was validated\nthrough comparisons with SketchUp-generated shading and various torus\nconfigurations. This technique streamlines shading toroidal shapes while\nmaintaining the artistic value of traditional illustration. Additionally, it\nhas potential applications in 3D model generation from architectural shade\ncasts, contributing to the evolving field of architectural visualization and\nrepresentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_ISSS1kVHXBNNmcFqKJajIC20Uh0ZmAgmOqGmlyqQd4","pdfSize":"1288267","objectId":"0x428fe8e9ae6afee8635c458d4a52ba17b6d1f10cbfc1bec0a2deed74ff0a96a9","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
