A way to address digital media bias is to detect and\nindicate it automatically through machine-learning methods. However, such\ndetection is limited due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable training data.\nHuman-in-the-loop-based feedback mechanisms have proven an effective way to\nfacilitate the data-gathering process. Therefore, we introduce and test\nfeedback mechanisms for the media bias domain, which we then implement on\nNewsUnfold, a news-reading web application to collect reader feedback on\nmachine-generated bias highlights within online news articles. Our approach\naugments dataset quality by significantly increasing inter-annotator agreement\nby 26.31% and improving classifier performance by 2.49%. As the first\nhuman-in-the-loop application for media bias, the feedback mechanism shows that\na user-centric approach to media bias data collection can return reliable data\nwhile being scalable and evaluated as easy to use. NewsUnfold demonstrates that\nfeedback mechanisms are a promising strategy to reduce data collection expenses\nand continuously update datasets to changes in context.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
