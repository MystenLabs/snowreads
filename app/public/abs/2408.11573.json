Many different regularization approaches have been\nproposed to improve numerical results and provide unique results. This work\npresents a novel approach for reconstructing the epicardial potential from body\nsurface potential maps based on a space-time total variation-type\nregularization using finite elements, where a first-order primal-dual algorithm\nsolves the underlying convex optimization problem. In several numerical\nexperiments, the superior performance of this method and the benefit of\nspace-time regularization for the reconstruction of epicardial potential on\ntwo-dimensional torso data and a three-dimensional rabbit heart compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods are demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KzltX39C483_589phQ8n77WiXC-3ICxQSkWsMNlEtOY","pdfSize":"16876232"}
