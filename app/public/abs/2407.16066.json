Traditional DeePC methods use pre-collected\ninput/output (I/O) data to construct Hankel matrices for online predictive\ncontrol. However, in systems with evolving dynamics or insufficient\npre-collected data, incorporating real-time data into the DeePC framework\nbecomes crucial to enhance control performance. This paper proposes an online\nDeePC framework for time-varying systems (i.e., systems with evolving\ndynamics), enabling the algorithm to update the Hankel matrix online by adding\nreal-time informative signals. By exploiting the minimum non-zero singular\nvalue of the Hankel matrix, the developed online DeePC selectively integrates\ninformative data and effectively captures evolving system dynamics.\nAdditionally, a numerical singular value decomposition technique is introduced\nto reduce the computational complexity for updating a reduced-order Hankel\nmatrix. Simulation results on two cases, a linear time-varying system and the\nvehicle anti-rollover control, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nonline reduced-order DeePC framework.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
