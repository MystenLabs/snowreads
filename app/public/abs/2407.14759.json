Although conventional techniques are\ncrucial in managing signal flow to prevent signal interference to sensitive\nreceiver components, they have some drawbacks, such as limited isolation, low\nswitching speed, complex circuitry, bulkiness, and high cost. This work\npresents a smart, miniaturized, nonlinear TR switch capable of operating over a\nwide frequency range (0.8 - 1.3 GHz), making it suitable for IoT frequency\nbands. The switch achieves high isolation, low insertion loss, and intelligent\ntransitions between transmitter and receiver without requiring external control\nor bias pins.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
