A\nseparate theorem relates the assumption on the cone to the existence of minimal\nelements in certain subsets of the dual cone. Three special cases are derived\nas examples. The first one, where the positive cone is the set of positive\nsemi-definite matrices, reduces to standard linear quadratic control. The\nsecond one, where the positive cone is a polyhedron, reduces to a recent result\non optimal control of positive systems. The third special case corresponds to\nlinear quadratic control with additional structure, such as spatial invariance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
