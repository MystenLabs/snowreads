Since then, frame theory has become a fundamental\nand widely applicable tool across diverse branches of Mathematics, Physics, and\nEngineering Sciences. Driven by the extensive applications of model space\nframes in dynamical sampling, the study delves into an exploration of frames\nand their properties within the model space and RKHS. Moreover, the study\nsystematically investigates the intrinsic features of model space frames and\nits reproducing counterparts, thoroughly examining and analyzing various\ncharacterizations of the same. Furthermore, several examples are provided to\nvalidate the results, demonstrating the practical applicability and correctness\nof the theoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
