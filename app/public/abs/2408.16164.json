Let $E$ be an elliptic curve with CM by\n$\\mathcal{O}_{K,f}$, such that $E$ is defined by a model over\n$\\mathbb{Q}(j_{K,f})$, where $j_{K,f}=j(E)$. It has been shown by the author\nand Lozano-Robledo that\n$\\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(j_{K,f},E[N])/\\mathbb{Q}(j_{K,f}))$ is only\nabelian for $N=2,3$, and $4$. Let $p$ be a prime and let $n\\geq 1$ be an\ninteger. In this article, we bound the commutator subgroups of\n$\\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(E[p^n])/\\mathbb{Q})$ and classify the maximal\nabelian extensions contained in $\\mathbb{Q}(E[p^n])/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
