{"id":"2407.12536","title":"An Efficient TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol with VC Certificate Type","authors":"Leonardo Perugini, Andrea Vesco","authorsParsed":[["Perugini","Leonardo",""],["Vesco","Andrea",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 13:18:16 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-18","timestamp":1721222296000,"abstract":"  The paper presents a step forward in the design and implementation of a\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) handshake protocol that enables the use of\nVerifiable Credential (VC) while maintaining full compliance with RFC-8446 and\npreserving all the security features of TLS 1.3. The improvement over our\nprevious work lies in the handshake design, which now only uses messages\nalready defined for TLS 1.3. The design has an incredibly positive impact on\nthe implementation, as we made minimal changes to the OpenSSL library and\nrelied mostly on a novel external provider to handle VC and Decentralized\nIDentifier related operations. The experimental results prove the feasibility\nof the design and show comparable performance to the original solution based on\nPKI and X.509 certificates. These results pave the way for the adoption of\nSelf-Sovereign Identity in large-scale IoT systems, with a clear benefit in\nterms of reducing the cost of identity management.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
