In particular, given access to a time-series of discretely observed\nlog-returns and the associated maximum over the observation period, we develop\na stochastic model which models the true log-returns and maximum via a L\\'evy\nprocess and the data as a measurement error there-of. The main technical\ndifficulty of trying to infer this model, for instance Bayesian parameter\nestimation, is that the joint transition density of the return and maximum is\nseldom known, nor can it be simulated exactly. Based upon the novel stick\nbreaking representation of [12] we provide an approximation of the model. We\ndevelop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to sample from the Bayesian\nposterior of the approximated posterior and then extend this to a multilevel\nMCMC method which can reduce the computational cost to approximate posterior\nexpectations, relative to ordinary MCMC. We implement our methodology on\nseveral applications including for real data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
