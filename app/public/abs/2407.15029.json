Here, we show that this system can harbor both\nferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders and that these magnetic\norders can be controlled in two different ways by either varying the Mn-Mn\ndistance while keeping the Bi2Te3/MnBi2Te4 ratio constant or vice versa. We\nachieve this by creating atomically engineered sandwich structures composed of\nBi2Te3 and MnBi2Te4 layers. We show that the AFM order is exclusively\ndetermined by the Mn-Mn distance whereas the FM order depends only on the\noverall Bi2Te3/MnBi2Te4 ratio regardless of the distance between the MnBi2Te4\nlayers. Our results shed light on the origins of the AFM and FM orders and\nprovide insights into how to manipulate magnetic orders not only for the\nMnBi2Te4-Bi2Te3 system but also for other magneto-topological materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
