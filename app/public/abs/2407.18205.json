We show that\nthe generating function enumerating GSAWs on a half-infinite strip of finite\nheight is rational, and we give a procedure to construct a combinatorial finite\nstate machine that allows one to compute this generating function. We then\nmodify this procedure to compute generating functions for GSAWs under two\nprobabilistic models. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the\nexpected length and displacement for GSAWs on the quarter plane, half plane,\nfull plane, and half-infinite strips of bounded height for which we cannot\ncompute the generating function. Finally, we prove that the generating\nfunctions for Greek key tours (GSAWs on a finite grid that visit every vertex)\non a half-infinite strip of fixed height are also rational, allowing us to\nresolve several conjectures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
