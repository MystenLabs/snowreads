The stationary solutions that we analyze\ninclude both fully saturated and partially unsaturated atmospheres in both\nunconditionally and conditionally unstable cases. We find that all of the\nsolutions we consider are linearly unstable via exchange of stability when\nsufficiently driven. The critical Rayleigh numbers vary by over an order of\nmagnitude between unconditionally unstable and conditionally unstable\natmospheres. The unsaturated atmospheres are notable for the presence of linear\ngravity wave-like oscillations even in unstable conditions. We study their\neigenfunction structure and find that the buoyancy and moisture perturbations\nare anticorrelated in $z$, such that regions of negative buoyancy have positive\nmoisture content. We suggest that these features in unsaturated atmospheres may\nexplain the phenomenon of gravity wave shedding by moist convective plumes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
