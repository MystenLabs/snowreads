However, these signals are\noften contaminated by various types of noise at different intensities,\nsignificantly interfering with downstream tasks. Therefore, denoising ECG\nsignals and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio is crucial for cardiovascular\nmonitoring. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method that combines a\none-dimensional convolutional layer with transformer architecture for denoising\nECG signals. The convolutional layer processes the ECG signal by various\nkernel/patch sizes and generates an embedding called multi-scale patch\nembedding. The embedding then is used as the input of a transformer network and\nenhances the capability of the transformer for denoising the ECG signal.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
