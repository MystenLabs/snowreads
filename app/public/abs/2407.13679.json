The company leveraged this framework to\nbuild custom applications for advanced computer vision tasks, such as\nidentifying potential health issues in pet videos and images, and validating AI\noutcomes with pre-built veterinary diagnoses. The Media Insights Engine\nprovides a modular and extensible solution that enabled Petco to quickly build\nmachine learning applications for media workloads. By utilizing this framework,\nPetco was able to accelerate their project development, improve the efficiency\nof their pet health analysis, and ultimately reduce the time to first diagnosis\nfor pet health issues. This paper discusses the challenges of pet health\nanalysis using media, the benefits of using the Media Insights Engine, and the\narchitecture of Petco's custom applications built using this framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
