In this\nwork we explore a one-parameter extension of this constraint formulated in\nterms of the monotonicity properties of R\\'enyi entropies. We focus on black\nhole mergers in asymptotically AdS space and determine new restrictions which\nthese R\\'enyi second laws impose on the final state. We evaluate the entropic\ninequalities starting from the thermodynamic ensembles description of black\nhole geometries, and find that for many situations they set more stringent\nbounds than those imposed by the area increase theorem.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
