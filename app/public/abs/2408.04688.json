However,\nnormalized stress can be misleading when used to compare the outputs of two or\nmore algorithms, as it is sensitive to the size of the drawing compared to the\ngraph-theoretic distances used. Uniformly scaling a layout will change the\nvalue of stress despite not meaningfully changing the drawing. In fact, the\nchange in stress values can be so significant that a clearly better layout can\nappear to have a worse stress score than a random layout. In this paper, we\nstudy different variants for calculating stress used in the literature (raw\nstress, normalized stress, etc.) and show that many of them are affected by\nthis problem, which threatens the validity of experiments that compare the\nquality of one algorithm to that of another. We then experimentally justify one\nof the stress calculation variants, scale-normalized stress, as one that fairly\ncompares drawing outputs regardless of their size. We also describe an\nefficient computation for scale-normalized stress and provide an open source\nimplementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
