In this article, we\nexplore the transformative potential of GAI in next-generation Wi-Fi networks,\nexploiting its advanced capabilities to address key challenges and improve\noverall network performance. We begin by reviewing the development of major\nWi-Fi generations and illustrating the challenges that future Wi-Fi networks\nmay encounter. We then introduce typical GAI models and detail their potential\ncapabilities in Wi-Fi network optimization, performance enhancement, and other\napplications. Furthermore, we present a case study wherein we propose a\nretrieval-augmented LLM (RA-LLM)-enabled Wi-Fi design framework that aids in\nproblem formulation, which is subsequently solved using a generative diffusion\nmodel (GDM)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize\nvarious network parameters. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed algorithm in high-density deployment scenarios. Finally, we\nprovide some potential future research directions for GAI-assisted Wi-Fi\nnetworks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
