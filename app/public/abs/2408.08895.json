{"id":"2408.08895","title":"ServerFi: A New Symbiotic Relationship Between Games and Players","authors":"Pavun Shetty","authorsParsed":[["Shetty","Pavun",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2024 12:32:07 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-20","timestamp":1723206727000,"abstract":"  Blockchain-based games have introduced novel economic models that blend\ntraditional gaming with decentralized ownership and financial incentives,\nleading to the rapid emergence of the GameFi sector. However, despite their\ninnovative appeal, these games face significant challenges, particularly in\nterms of market stability, player retention, and the sustainability of token\nvalue. This paper explores the evolution of blockchain games and identifies key\nshortcomings in current tokenomics models using entropy increase theory. We\npropose two new models - ServerFi, which emphasizes Privatization through Asset\nSynthesis, and a model focused on Continuous Rewards for High-Retention\nPlayers. These models are formalized into mathematical frameworks and validated\nthrough group behavior simulation experiments. Our findings indicate that the\nServerFi is particularly effective in maintaining player engagement and\nensuring the long-term viability of the gaming ecosystem, offering a promising\ndirection for future blockchain game development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
