The\nnumerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh\naverages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to\nparametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and\nthe validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains\nthe intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex\nadmissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed\ncombination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces\nmeaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
