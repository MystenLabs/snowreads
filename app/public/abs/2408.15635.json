After building the\nproblem's operator setting and showing that the governing operator is\nnonselfadjoint with a purely discrete spectrum, we derive an asymptotic\napproximation of its spectrum. In doing so, we also prove that the addition of\nenergy harvesting can be viewed as a weak perturbation of the underlying beam\ndynamics, in the sense that no piezoelectric parameters appear in the spectral\napproximation's first two orders of magnitude. We conclude by outlining future\nwork based on numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
