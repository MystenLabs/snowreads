Many existing A/B testing solutions assume a\nfully observable experimental environment that satisfies the Markov condition,\nwhich often does not hold in practice. This paper studies the optimal design\nfor A/B testing in partially observable environments. We introduce a controlled\n(vector) autoregressive moving average model to capture partial observability.\nWe introduce a small signal asymptotic framework to simplify the analysis of\nasymptotic mean squared errors of average treatment effect estimators under\nvarious designs. We develop two algorithms to estimate the optimal design: one\nutilizing constrained optimization and the other employing reinforcement\nlearning. We demonstrate the superior performance of our designs using a\ndispatch simulator and two real datasets from a ride-sharing company.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
