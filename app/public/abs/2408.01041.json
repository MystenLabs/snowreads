The encoded-fusion is an entangled measurement devised to\nenhance the fusion success probability in the presence of losses and errors\nbased on a quantum error-correcting code. We apply an encoded-fusion scheme,\nwhich can be performed with linear optics and active feedforwards to implement\nthe generalized Shor code, to construct a fault-tolerant network configuration\nin a three-dimensional Raussendorf-Harrington-Goyal lattice based on the\nsurface code. Numerical simulations show that our scheme allows us to achieve\nup to 10 times higher loss thresholds than nonencoded fusion approaches with\nlimited numbers of photons used in fusion. Our scheme paves an efficient route\ntoward fault-tolerant quantum computing with finite-sized entangled resource\nstates and linear optics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ee0sTY4T3aOU-NORflLxTCyLdnbBxhKrvsqEM548zzg","pdfSize":"6085416"}
