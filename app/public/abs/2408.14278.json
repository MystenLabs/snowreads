We obtain the optimal quantitative error estimates independent of the\nspectral gaps for an asymptotic expansion, with two leading terms, of Dirichlet\neigenvalues. We also establish the convergence rates for the corresponding\neigenfunctions. Our approach uses a known reduction to a degenerate elliptic\neigenvalue problem for which a quantitative analysis is carried out.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
