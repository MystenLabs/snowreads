We investigated\nCoSb3's structural stability up to 70 GPa using single crystal X-ray\ndiffraction and high-resolution X-ray scattering, including Bragg Coherent\nDiffraction Imaging. We examined the material in three pressure transmitting\nmedia (PTMs), exploring how PTMs and nonhydrostatic stresses affect CoSb3.\nNotably, the 'self-insertion' transition may reduce or even make\ncompressibility negative. Additionally, we report a previously unknown phase\ntransformation from cubic Im-3 to trigonal R-3 above 40 GPa and discuss the\nphases' distinctive behaviors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
