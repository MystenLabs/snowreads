When they\nare within their superconducting transition region, small temperature\nfluctuations - like the energy deposited by single photons - lead to large\nresistance variations. These variations can be measured using Superconducting\nQuantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). This technology is planned to be used as\na single-photon detector for later runs of the ALPS II experiment, a\nlight-shining-through-walls experiment at DESY Hamburg, searching for\nAxion-Like Particles (ALPs), which are possible Dark Matter (DM) candidates.\nDue to the very low dark count rates in our setup, our TES system might be\nviable for direct DM searches at sub-MeV masses through electron-scattering of\nDM in the superconducting chip, as well. Simulations concerning background\nrejection and calibration methods demonstrate the needed sub-eV sensitivity\nalready.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ee1AGFCHulEr1sGgf8culijukysPBBxK0hM-08sk0U0","pdfSize":"407685"}
