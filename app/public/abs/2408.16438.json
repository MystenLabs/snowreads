At the same time, it can\nalso suppress the differential rotation of the convection zone, or even force\nthe formation of active longitudes at certain phases fixed to the orbit. V815\nHer is a four-star system consisting of two close binaries orbiting each other,\none of which contains an active G-type main-sequence star. Therefore, the\nsystem offers an excellent opportunity to investigate the influence of\ngravitational effects on solar-type magnetic activity using different methods.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
