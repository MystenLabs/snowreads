The role of electron screening in\nion dynamics and energetics is examined through ion and gas temperatures, mean\nsquared displacement of ions, ion coupling parameter, and radial distribution\nfunction of the system by implementing both Coulomb and Yukawa potentials for\nionic interactions. It is found that electron screening in the Yukawa potential\nlimits the disorder-induced heating (DIH) mechanism and the coupling strength\nof the ions significantly for strongly ionized plasmas (ionization fraction,\n$\\chi_i$ $\\ge 10^{-3}$). Whereas, the ions show a prominent sub-diffusive\nbehavior for the Coulomb potential that is associated with the DIH mechanism.\nDIH is explained using a simplified model based on energy conservation.\nMoreover, the screening effect affects the separation distance and arrangement\nof the ion-neutral pairs for all the values of $\\chi_i$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fn1PBW7pQ0CnrVXyrRgylGrE_roNHUcgRTE2DRRXL3g","pdfSize":"1107626"}
