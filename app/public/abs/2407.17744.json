To\nbe specific, we propose a framework that effectively balances Complementarity\nand Consistency information in Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (CoCo-IMC).\nSpecifically, we design a dual network of delayed activation, which achieves a\nbalance of complementarity and consistency among different views. The delayed\nactivation could enriches the complementarity information that was ignored\nduring consistency learning. Then, we recover the incomplete information and\nenhance the consistency learning by minimizing the conditional entropy and\nmaximizing the mutual information across different views. This could be the\nfirst theoretical attempt to incorporate delayed activation into incomplete\ndata recovery and the balance of complementarity and consistency. We have\nproved the effectiveness of CoCo-IMC in extensive comparative experiments with\n12 state-of-the-art baselines on four publicly available datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
