This treatment is founded\nupon Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics for partially degenerate\nfluids, does not apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and is\ncomputationally tractable, capable of modelling dynamics over ionic timescales\nat electronic time resolution. Bohm SPH is also capable of modelling\nnon-Gaussian electron wavefunctions. We present an overview of our methodology,\nvalidation tests of the single particle case including the hydrogen 1s\nwavefunction, and comparisons to simulations of a warm dense hydrogen system\nperformed with wave packet molecular dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3iPicMm2nIJhsRqXbVVnSq5NO6-E1En3773yysQqxek","pdfSize":"2835094"}
