R. Stanley further conjectured that $L(m, n)$\nadmits a symmetric chain order. We show that the order structure on $L(m, n)$\nis equivalent to a natural ordering on the lattice points of a dilated\n$n$-simplex, which in turn corresponds to a weight diagram for the root system\nof type $A_n$. Lindstr{\\\" o}m's symmetric chain decompositions for $L(3, n)$\nare described completely through pictures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
