Effective monitoring of different\ntree species is essential to understanding and improving the health and\nbiodiversity of forests. In this work, we address the challenge of tree species\nidentification by performing semantic segmentation of trees using an aerial\nimage dataset spanning over a year. We compare models trained on single images\nversus those trained on time series to assess the impact of tree phenology on\nsegmentation performances. We also introduce a simple convolutional block for\nextracting spatio-temporal features from image time series, enabling the use of\npopular pretrained backbones and methods. We leverage the hierarchical\nstructure of tree species taxonomy by incorporating a custom loss function that\nrefines predictions at three levels: species, genus, and higher-level taxa. Our\nfindings demonstrate the superiority of our methodology in exploiting the time\nseries modality and confirm that enriching labels using taxonomic information\nimproves the semantic segmentation performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
