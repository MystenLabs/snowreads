This new bound enables\na stabilization-free a posteriori control for the energy error. Following the\nrecent studies for the bi-dimensional case, we investigate the case of\ntetrahedral elements with aligned edges and faces. We believe that the AVEMs\ncan be an efficient strategy to address the mesh conforming requirements of\nstandard three-dimensional Adaptive Finite Element Methods (AFEMs), which\ntypically extend the refinement procedure to non-marked mesh cells. Indeed,\nnumerical tests on the Fichera corner shape domain show that this method can\nreduce the number of three-dimensional cells generated in the refinement\nprocess by about 30% with compared to standard AFEMs, for a given error\nthreshold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"muooB3Z-icRl70yXkbweZ1QAge-DprA1doieKZI4lTY","pdfSize":"1270186","objectId":"0x707848d30d29f4fbf26933d25cf604af39ca6056b4764fca3b029663957d4376","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
