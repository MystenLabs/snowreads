However, when the stress increases, an additional cost is incorporated\nthat increases the cost of the life test. In this context, an adaptive SSSPALT\nis considered where the stress is increased after a certain time if the number\nof failures up to that point is less than a pre-specified number of failures.\nWe consider determination of Bayesian reliability acceptance sampling plans\n(BSP) through adaptive SSSALT conducted under Type I censoring. The BSP under\nadaptive SSSPALT is called BSPAA. The Bayes decision function and Bayes risk\nare obtained for the general loss function. Optimal BSPAAs are obtained for the\nquadratic loss function by minimizing Bayes risk. An algorithm is provided for\ncomputation of optimum BSPAA. Comparisons between the proposed BSPAA and the\nconventional BSP through non-accelerated life test (CBSP) and conventional BSP\nthrough SSSPALT (CBSPA) are carried out.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
