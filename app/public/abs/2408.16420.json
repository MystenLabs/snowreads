Here, we introduce a physical model\nfor object stability and propose a novel trajectory planning approach for\nnon-prehensile transportation along arbitrary straight lines in 3D space.\nValidation with a 7-DoF Franka Panda robot confirms improved transportation\nspeed via tray rotation integration while ensuring object stability and robot\nmotion constraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"geLd5nW0dQCJun1yEJYEtZYm4klArtjQT5550GSmKTk","pdfSize":"2100685"}
