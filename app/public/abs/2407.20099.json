Previous research\nempirically shows that SNNs with Poisson coding are more robust than Artificial\nNeural Networks (ANNs) on small-scale datasets. However, it is still unclear in\ntheory how the adversarial robustness of SNNs is derived, and whether SNNs can\nstill maintain its adversarial robustness advantage on large-scale dataset\ntasks. This work theoretically demonstrates that SNN's inherent adversarial\nrobustness stems from its Poisson coding. We reveal the conceptual equivalence\nof Poisson coding and randomized smoothing in defense strategies, and analyze\nin depth the trade-off between accuracy and adversarial robustness in SNNs via\nthe proposed Randomized Smoothing Coding (RSC) method. Experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed RSC-SNNs show remarkable adversarial robustness, surpassing\nANNs and achieving state-of-the-art robustness results on large-scale dataset\nImageNet.
