Yet, how species have memory, retrieve them and maintain\ncontinuity are the fundamental questions. Most of the phenomenon can only be\nhypothesised by researchers and validating them through experiments is a big\nchallenge. Taking brain as an ideal intelligent machine and modelling it opens\nnew dimensions for computational algorithm. This paper presents a hypothesis to\nresemble memory creation in cerebral cortex. The regions of cerebral cortex are\nimplicit to be specific for specific function and constitute neural field that\nis single dimension and have vector form. The neural field throughout cortex\nconnects with each other to form a network. These networks associate with\nsurvival instincts, emotions and rewards to constitute a memory of the exposed\nenvironment or say learning. Graphical tool NURBS with multidimensional control\npoints are implicitly used in representing these networks as a set of cubic\nequations. Learning through data is a primary block of intelligent system, the\npaper attempts to convert the data in lower dimension patterns rather than\nexisting absolute form for real time intelligent systems.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jGROBCyizj-_R2LVUqEvh7OKZVVp1dxjby_qFwRgUSc","pdfSize":"219593"}
