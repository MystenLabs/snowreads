Power oscillation modes, which\nare key to the stability of the grid, are traditionally studied numerically\nwith the conventional view-point of two regimes of extended (inter-area) or\nlocalized (intra-area) modes. In this article we introduce an analogy based on\nstochastic quantum models and demonstrate its applicability to power systems.\nWe show from simple models that at low frequency the mean free path induced by\ndisorder is inversely cubic in the frequency. This stems from the\nCourant-Fisher-Weyl theorem, which predicts a strong protection of the lowest\nfrequency modes from disorder. As a consequence a power oscillation, induced by\nsome local disruption of the grid, can propagate in a ballistic, diffusive or\nlocalised regime. In contrast with the conventional view-point, the existence\nof these three regimes is confirmed in a realistic model of the European power\ngrid.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
