Using\nnon-linear processes to modify speech utterances, Malacopula enhances the\neffectiveness of spoofing attacks. The model comprises parallel branches of\npolynomial functions followed by linear time-invariant filters. The adversarial\noptimisation procedure acts to minimise the cosine distance between speaker\nembeddings extracted from spoofed and bona fide utterances. Experiments,\nperformed using three recent ASV systems and the ASVspoof 2019 dataset, show\nthat Malacopula increases vulnerabilities by a substantial margin. However,\nspeech quality is reduced and attacks can be detected effectively under\ncontrolled conditions. The findings emphasise the need to identify new\nvulnerabilities and design defences to protect ASV systems from adversarial\nattacks in the wild.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d2s6X4uXmsxMQe-ZyOj3fAZOSU1Vm3Xv_NWSBOxqWqI","pdfSize":"1550090"}
