This is relevant\nfor security applications, for instance, as different crowd configurations can\ndetermine the time people spend in environments trying to evacuate them. In\nthis work, we extend WebCrowds, an authoring tool for crowd simulation, to\nallow users to build scenarios and evaluate them through a set of metrics. The\naim is to provide a quantitative metric that can, based on simulation data,\nselect the best crowd configuration in a certain environment. We conduct\nexperiments to validate our proposed metric in multiple crowd simulation\nscenarios and perform a comparison with another metric found in the literature.\nThe results show that experts in the domain of crowd scenarios agree with our\nproposed quantitative metric.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
