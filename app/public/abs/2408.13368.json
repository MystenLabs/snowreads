Such\nquasiparticles open up new directions in modulating the ubiquitous Casimir\nforce. Here by utilizing the generalized Born-Huang hydrodynamics model, three\ntypes of phonons in piezoelectrics are studied: longitudinal optical phonon,\ntransverse optical phonon and phonon polariton. The phonon-electromagnetic\ncoupling results in a complex set of Fresnel reflection matrices which prevents\nthe utilization of the standard Lifshitz approach for calculating Casimir\nforces in the imaginary frequency domain. Our calculations are based on an\napproach within real frequency and finite temperatures, through which various\nregimes of the Casimir interaction are examined. Our study shows that\npiezoelectrics emerge as a set of materials where this ubiquitous force can be\ncontrolled via phonon properties for the first time. The Casimir interaction\nappears as a suitable means to distinguish between different types of surface\nphonon polaritons associated with different structural piezoelectric polytypes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"23L02BPH4FjxzH0yAAY2Nul1gBwY-vn4mPBIZeZ3gb8","pdfSize":"9364438"}
