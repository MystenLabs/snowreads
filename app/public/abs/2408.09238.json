{"id":"2408.09238","title":"Silent Orbits and Cancellations in the Wave Trace","authors":"Illya Koval, Amir Vig","authorsParsed":[["Koval","Illya",""],["Vig","Amir",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2024 16:14:04 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-20","timestamp":1723911244000,"abstract":"  This paper shows that the wave trace of a bounded and strictly convex planar\ndomain may be arbitrarily smooth in a neighborhood of some point in the length\nspectrum. In other words, the Poisson relation, which asserts that the singular\nsupport of the wave trace is contained in the closure of $\\pm$ the length\nspectrum, can almost be made into a strict inclusion. To do so, we construct\nlarge families of domains for which there exist multiple periodic billiard\norbits having the same length but different Maslov indices. Using the\nmicrolocal Balian-Bloch-Zelditch parametrix for wave invariants developed in\nour previous paper, we solve a large system of equations for the boundary\ncurvature jets, which leads to the required cancellations. We call such\nperiodic orbits silent, since they are undetectable from the ostensibly audible\nwave trace. Such cancellations show that there are potential limitations in\nusing the wave trace for inverse spectral problems and more fundamentally, that\nthe Laplace spectrum and length spectrum are inherently different mathematical\nobjects, at least insofar as the wave trace is concerned.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
