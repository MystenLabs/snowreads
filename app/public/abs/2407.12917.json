We investigate the\nfar-infrared polarization spectrum of a realistic simulated high-mass star\nforming cloud under various models of grain alignment and emission. We find\nthat neither a homogeneous grain alignment model nor a grain alignment model\nthat includes collisional dealignment is able to produce the falling spectrum\nseen in observations. On the other hand, we find that a grain alignment model\nwith grain alignment efficiency dependent on local temperature is capable of\nproducing a falling spectrum that is in qualitative agreement with observations\nof OMC-1. For the model most in agreement with OMC-1, we find no correlation\nbetween temperature and the slope of the polarization spectrum. However, we do\nfind a positive correlation between column density and the slope of the\npolarization spectrum. We suggest this latter correlation to be the result of\nwavelength-dependent polarization by absorption.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
