We consider the standard map of the kicked\nrotor and verify that regions of stickiness survive in the strong chaotic\nregime of the closed classical map. By scanning the system's phase space with a\nleak, we analyze how stickiness affects the degree of localization of the\nstates of the quantum system. We find an excellent correspondence between the\nclassical dwell time and finite-time Lyapunov exponents with the quantum dwell\ntime and Wehrl entropy of the quantum states. Our approach suggests that\nknowledge of the structure of the classically chaotic trajectories can be used\nto determine where to place the leak to enhance or decrease the degree of\ndelocalization of the quantum states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
