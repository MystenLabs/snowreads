We discuss here how a strong symmetry in\nconjunction with a nonequilibrium phase transition allows to devise a protocol\nfor measuring collective many-body observables. To demonstrate this idea we\nconsider a collective spin system whose constituents are governed by a\ndissipative dynamics that conserves the total angular momentum. We show that by\ncontinuously monitoring the system output the value of the total angular\nmomentum can be inferred directly from the time-integrated emission signal,\nwithout the need of repeated projective measurements or reinitializations of\nthe spins. This may offer a route towards the measurement of collective\nproperties in qubit ensembles, with applications in quantum tomography, quantum\ncomputation and quantum metrology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
