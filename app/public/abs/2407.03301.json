These super-Macdonald polynomials are polynomials of extended set of\nvariables: usual $p_k$ variables are accompanied by anti-commuting Grassmann\nvariables $\\theta_k$. Starting from recently defined super-Schur polynomials\nand exploiting orthogonality relations with triangular decompositions we are\nable to fully determine super-Macdonald polynomials. These new polynomials have\nsimilar properties to canonical Macdonald polynomials -- they respect two\ndifferent orderings in the set of (super)-Young diagrams simultaneously.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
