Extensive\ninvestigations have been invoked focusing on the zero-magnetic-field phase\ndiagram at the magic twist angle around $\\theta=1.1\\degree$, which has been\nindicated to be an exclusive regime for exhibiting flat band with the interplay\nof strong electronic correlation and untrivial topology in the experiment so\nfar. In contrast, electronic bands in non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene\nhost dominant electronic kinetic energy compared to Coulomb interaction. By\nquenching the kinetic energy and enhancing Coulomb exchange interactions by\nmeans of an applied perpendicular magnetic field, here we unveil gapped flat\nHofstadter subbands at large magnetic flux that yield correlated insulating\nstates in minimally twisted bilayer graphene at $\\theta=0.41\\degree$. These\nstates appear with isospin symmetry breaking due to strong Coulomb\ninteractions. Our work provides a platform for studying the phase transition of\nthe strongly correlated Hofstadter spectrum.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
