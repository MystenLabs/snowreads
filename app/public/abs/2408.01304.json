We also exhibit a brief\nanalysis of how they would perform under different quantum topological\nsettings. The techniques examined are recursion and v-chain, as they are the\nmost commonly used techniques in the most popular quantum computing libraries,\nQiskit. The target audience of this paper is people who do not have intricate\nmathematical or physics knowledge related to quantum computing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HrZzW9iBjcp5f_BAIA681mQNmJ70G5vCCQomHTZ7lik","pdfSize":"7642992"}
