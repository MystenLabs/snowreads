It is assumed that\nthe relative degree of the plant is known, the regressor linearly depends on\nthe state vector and may have a nonlinear relationship with the output signal.\nThe proposed solution consists of three steps. Initially, an unknown input\nstate observer is synthesized. This observer, however, necessitates the\nmeasurement of output derivatives equal to the plant's relative degree. To\nrelax this limitation, an alternative representation of the observer is\nintroduced. Further, based on this observer, the unknown parameters and\ndisturbances are reconstructed using an autoregression model and the dynamic\nregressor extension and mixing (DREM) approach. This approach allows the\nestimates to be obtained in a finite time. Finally, based on these estimates,\nan observer has been constructed that does not require measurements of the\noutput derivatives. The effectiveness and efficiency of this solution are\ndemonstrated through a computer simulation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
