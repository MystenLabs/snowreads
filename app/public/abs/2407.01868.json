The method first constructs new component series\nwhich are linear combinations of the original series. Forecasts are then\ngenerated for both the original and component series. Finally, the full vector\nof forecasts is projected onto a linear subspace where the constraints implied\nby the combination weights hold. It is proven that the trace of the forecast\nerror variance is non-increasing with the number of components, and mild\nconditions are established for which it is strictly decreasing. It is also\nshown that the proposed method achieves maximum forecast error variance\nreduction among linear projection methods. The theoretical results are\nvalidated through simulations and two empirical applications based on\nAustralian tourism and FRED-MD data. Notably, using FLAP with Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) to construct the new series leads to substantial\nforecast error variance reduction.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
