DL-opt\nintegrates (i) a nested fixed point (NFXP) formulation of the optimization\nproblem, (ii) automatic implicit differentiation to enhance gradient descent\nfor solving unilateral optimal policies, and (iii) a best-response dynamics\napproach for finding Nash equilibria. Utilizing DL-opt, we solve for\nnon-cooperative tariffs and industrial subsidies across 7 economies and 44\nsectors, incorporating sectoral external economies of scale. Our quantitative\nanalysis reveals significant sectoral heterogeneity in Nash policies: Nash\nindustrial subsidies increase with scale elasticities, whereas Nash tariffs\ndecrease with trade elasticities. Moreover, we show that global dual\ncompetition, involving both tariffs and industrial subsidies, results in lower\ntariffs and higher welfare outcomes compared to a global tariff war. These\nfindings highlight the importance of considering sectoral heterogeneity and\npolicy combinations in understanding global economic competition.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
