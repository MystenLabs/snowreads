We show that the model with a slightly violated\nparity generates symmetric Schr{\\\"o}dinger cat states of the oscillator, which\nsuddenly perish in a spontaneous unitary process similar to the\nmeasurement-induced wave-function collapse. The effect is sufficiently robust\nto be tested experimentally, e.g., with trapped ions, macroscopic mechanical\noscillators or superconducting circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
