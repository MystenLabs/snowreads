Recently, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) is proposed, which is a\nfoundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and\nvideos. SAM 2 builds a data engine, which improves model and data via user\ninteraction, to collect the largest video segmentation dataset to date. SAM 2\nis a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video\nprocessing, which trained on the date provides strong performance across a wide\nrange of tasks. In this work, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of SAM 2 on\nthe more challenging VOS datasets MOSE and LVOS. Without fine-tuning on the\ntraining set, SAM 2 achieved 75.79 J&F on the test set and ranked 4th place for\n6th LSVOS Challenge VOS Track.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
