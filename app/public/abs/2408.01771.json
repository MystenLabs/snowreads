Among other things, we have proved an\nanalogue of N\\\"akki's theorem on the positivity of the $p$-module of families\nof paths joining a pair of continua in the given domain. The geometry of\ndomains with a strongly accessible boundary in the sense of the $p$-modulus of\nfamilies of paths was also studied. We show that domains with a $p$-strongly\naccessible boundary with respect to a $p$-modulus, $p>n-1,$ are are finitely\nconnected at their boundary. The mentioned result generalizes N\\\"akki's result,\nwhich was proved for uniform domains in the case of a conformal modulus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
