We study its enumerative properties and prove that it\nundergoes a phase transition. We give the distribution of the size of the\nlargest $2$-connected blocks in the three regimes (subcritical, critical and\nsupercritical) and further establish that the scaling limit is the Brownian\nContinuum Random Tree in the critical and supercritical regimes, with\nrespective rescalings $\\sqrt{n/\\log(n)}$ and $\\sqrt{n}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
