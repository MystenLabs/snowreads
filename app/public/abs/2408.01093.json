In an attempt to facilitate researchers in\nboth FMs and AD areas, this paper proposes a framework that combines two\nwell-known tools, namely CommonRoad and UPPAAL. On the one hand, CommonRoad can\nbe enhanced by the rigorous semantics of models in UPPAAL, which enables a\nsystematic and comprehensive understanding of the AD system's behaviour and\nthus strengthens the safety of the system. On the other hand, controllers\nsynthesised by UPPAAL can be visualised by CommonRoad in real-world road\nnetworks, which facilitates AD vehicle designers greatly adopting formal models\nin system design. In this framework, we provide automatic model conversions\nbetween CommonRoad and UPPAAL. Therefore, users only need to program in Python\nand the framework takes care of the formal models, learning, and verification\nin the backend. We perform experiments to demonstrate the applicability of our\nframework in various AD scenarios, discuss the advantages of solving motion\nplanning in our framework, and show the scalability limit and possible\nsolutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
