They generalize phylogenetic trees since\nfor example, unlike trees, they permit lineages to combine. Recently, there has\nbeen rising interest in semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are mixed\ngraphs in which certain lineage combination events are represented by directed\nedges coming together, whereas the remaining edges are left undirected. One\nreason to consider such networks is that it can be difficult to root a network\nusing real data. In this paper, we consider the problem of when a semi-directed\nphylogenetic network is defined or encoded by the smaller networks that it\ninduces on the $4$-leaf subsets of its leaf set. These smaller networks are\ncalled quarnets. We prove that semi-directed binary level-$2$ phylogenetic\nnetworks are encoded by their quarnets, but that this is not the case for\nlevel-$3$. In addition, we prove that the so-called blob tree of a\nsemi-directed binary network, a tree that gives the coarse-grained structure of\nthe network, is always encoded by the quarnets of the network.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
