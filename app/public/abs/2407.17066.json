In the realm\nof classical fields and nonlinear systems, extensive research has been\nconducted on their solitary and soliton solutions. In the conducted studies,\ntypically two $\\phi^4$ systems, or two sine-Gordon systems, have been coupled.\nThe sine-Gordon system exhibits diverse solutions, all well-behaved, with its\nsoliton solutions fully understood. On the other hand, the $\\phi^4$ system,\nwhich is significant in field theory, has solitary solutions, but these\nsolutions are not solitonic. For example, from a pair of kink and antikink, we\ncannot construct a bound state; or that after a collision, these two solutions\ndo not revert to their initial status and become disrupted. In this study, we\ncouple a $\\phi^4$ system with a sine-Gordon system to impart stability from the\nsine-Gordon system to the $\\phi^4$ system. We have demonstrated that for a\ncoupled $\\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon system, this expectation is somewhat met.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RjA7RMHB9pgDqK2yxA00Z1O8aNRFJauyMP2t3PUadFk","pdfSize":"1733005","objectId":"0x0bd362eb50f35df0a71c7e51c3a6be5f373068a7f8820ab9a2e5973491ef6084","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
