The flow belongs to the family of\nHermitian curvature flows introduced by Streets and Tian and it was considered\nby Lee in order to study compact Hermitian manifolds with almost negative Chern\nbisectional curvature. We show a regularity result on compact complex\nparallelizable manifolds and we prove that Chern-flat metrics are dynamically\nstable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
