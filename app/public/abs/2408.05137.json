An ansatz for the projectors is constructed making\nuse of its symmetry properties via an orbit partition formula. The graphical\napproach allows to identify and enumerate the orbits in each case. For the case\nwithout spinor indices we find a 1 to 1 correspondence between orbits and\ninteger partitions describing the cycle structure of certain bi-chord graphs.\nThis leads to compact combinatorial formulae for the projector ansatz. With\nspinor indices the graph-structure becomes more involved, but the method is\nequally applicable. Our spinor reduction formulae are based on the\nantisymmetric basis of $\\gamma$ matrices, and make use of their orthogonality\nproperty. We also provide a new compact formula to pass into the antisymmetric\nbasis. We compute projectors for vacuum tensor Feynman integrals with up to 32\nLorentz indices and up to 4 spinor indices. We discuss how to employ the\nprojectors in problems with external momenta.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QzhvM8FkQTf1L-XqaXO1uADaZfbaZWLhm3rTSx0scuA","pdfSize":"568202"}
