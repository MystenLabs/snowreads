Due to limited I/O bandwidth and\navailable storage space, there is the necessity to reduce scientific data of\nhigh performance computing applications. Error-bounded lossy compression has\nbeen proven to be an effective approach tackling the trade-off between accuracy\nand storage space. Within this work, we are exploring and discussing\nerror-bounded lossy compression solely based on adaptive mesh refinement\ntechniques. This compression technique is not only easily integrated into\nexisting adaptive mesh refinement applications but also suits as a general\nlossy compression approach for arbitrary data in form of multi-dimensional\narrays, irrespective of the data type. Moreover, these techniques permit the\nexclusion of regions of interest and even allows for nested error domains\nduring the compression. The described data compression technique is presented\nexemplary on ERA5 data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
