Using Kronecker\nproduct polynomial expansions, we convert the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial\ndifferential equations for the energy functions into a series of algebraic\nequations for the coefficients of the energy functions. We derive the specific\ntensor structure that arises from the Kronecker product representation and\nanalyze the computational complexity to efficiently solve these equations. The\nconvergence and scalability of the proposed energy function computation\napproach is demonstrated on a nonlinear reaction-diffusion model with cubic\ndrift nonlinearity, for which we compute degree 3 energy function\napproximations in $n=1023$ dimensions and degree 4 energy function\napproximations in $n=127$ dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
