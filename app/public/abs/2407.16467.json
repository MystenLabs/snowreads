At the same time,\nthey introduce new security challenges in the area of hardware attacks, the\nmost prominent being side-channel analysis (SCA). It was shown that SCA can\nrecover model parameters with a high accuracy, posing a threat to entities that\nwish to keep their models confidential. In this paper, we explore the\nsusceptibility of quantized models implemented in OpenVINO, an embedded\nframework for deploying neural networks on embedded and Edge devices. We show\nthat it is possible to recover model parameters with high precision, allowing\nthe recovered model to perform very close to the original one. Our experiments\non GoogleNet v1 show only a 1% difference in the Top 1 and a 0.64% difference\nin the Top 5 accuracies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XlQW-4vWmVvOnjoQNEsiXRMIhl3TXcMC8ENr03f_Hu8","pdfSize":"460249"}
