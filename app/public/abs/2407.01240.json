For $g$\nsufficiently large, the self-shrinker $\\Sigma_g$ has two graphical\nasymptotically conical ends and the sequence $\\Sigma_g$ converges on compact\nsubsets to a plane with multiplicity two as $g\\to\\infty$.\nAngenent-Chopp-Ilmanen conjectured the existence of such self-shrinkers in 1995\nbased on numerical experiments. Using these surfaces as initial conditions for\nlarge $g$, we obtain examples of mean curvature flows in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with\nsmooth initial non-compact data that evolve non-uniquely after their first\nsingular time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
