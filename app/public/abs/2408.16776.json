To address this, we introduce\nthe idea of online behavior modification, a paradigm in which users have\ncontrol over behavior features of a robot in real time as it autonomously\ncompletes a task using an RL-trained policy. To show the value of this\nuser-centered formulation for human-robot interaction, we present a behavior\ndiversity based algorithm, Adjustable Control Of RL Dynamics (ACORD), and\ndemonstrate its applicability to online behavior modification in simulation and\na user study. In the study (n=23) users adjust the style of paintings as a\nrobot traces a shape autonomously. We compare ACORD to RL and Shared Autonomy\n(SA), and show ACORD affords user-preferred levels of control and expression,\ncomparable to SA, but with the potential for autonomous execution and\nrobustness of RL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
