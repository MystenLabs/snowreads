This paper\nexplores the application of LLMs in negotiation transcript analysis by the\nVanderbilt AI Negotiation Lab. Starting in September 2022, we applied multiple\nstrategies using LLMs from zero shot learning to fine tuning models to\nin-context learning). The final strategy we developed is explained, along with\nhow to access and use the model. This study provides a sense of both the\nopportunities and roadblocks for the implementation of LLMs in real life\napplications and offers a model for how LLMs can be applied to coding in other\nfields.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
