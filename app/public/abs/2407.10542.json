In this work, we tackle this\nproblem by establishing local correspondences between point clouds of part\nshapes in both coarse- and fine-levels. To this end, we introduce Proxy Match\nTransform (PMT), an approximate high-order feature transform layer that enables\nreliable matching between mating surfaces of parts while incurring low costs in\nmemory and computation. Building upon PMT, we introduce a new framework, dubbed\nProxy Match TransformeR (PMTR), for the geometric assembly task. We evaluate\nthe proposed PMTR on the large-scale 3D geometric shape assembly benchmark\ndataset of Breaking Bad and demonstrate its superior performance and efficiency\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.
