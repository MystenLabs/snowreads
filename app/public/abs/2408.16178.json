It features high Li content, low density, low\neffective atomic number, and emission in red-NIR region. These characteristics\nmake it an interesting candidate for long distance neutron detection in harsh\nenviroments e. g. decomisioning of nuclear powerplants. The absorption spectrum\nis thoroughly investigated in the scope of Tanabe-Sugano diagram. Luminescence\nmechanism in the undoped Li$_2$MnCl$_4$ is studied in depth. Doping by\nEu$^{2+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ is introduced as a trial to improve the scintillation\nefficiency. We show in the Eu$^{2+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ doped Li$_2$MnCl$_4$ that\nluminescence mechanism involves energy transfer from the dopants to Mn$^{2+}$,\nand propose the local lattice distortion around the dopant and a possible\ncharge compensation mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
