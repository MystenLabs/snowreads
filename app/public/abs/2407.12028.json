Still, accurate segmentation presents many\nchallenges, including (a) the noisy nature of the Automatic Speech Recognition\n(ASR) software typically used to obtain the transcripts, (b) the lack of\ndiverse labeled data and (c) the difficulty in pin-pointing the ground-truth\nnumber of segments. In this work we present TreeSeg, an approach that combines\noff-the-shelf embedding models with divisive clustering, to generate\nhierarchical, structured segmentations of transcripts in the form of binary\ntrees. Our approach is robust to noise and can handle large transcripts\nefficiently. We evaluate TreeSeg on the ICSI and AMI corpora, demonstrating\nthat it outperforms all baselines. Finally, we introduce TinyRec, a small-scale\ncorpus of manually annotated transcripts, obtained from self-recorded video\nsessions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
