First, we prove the existence/nonexistence\nof ground states. Subsequently, we establish the scattering versus blowup below\nthe ground-state energy threshold. Our methodology hinges on Tao's scattering\ncriterion and Dodson-Murphy's Virial/Morawetz inequalities.\n  An intriguing aspect of our study is the absence of scaling invariance within\nthe equation, attributed to the interplay of competing nonlinearities.\nMoreover, the presence of singular weights serves as a barrier to translation\ninvariance in the spatial variable, adding more complexity to the analysis.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the inaugural exploration\nof the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with a leading-order\nfocusing energy critical nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
