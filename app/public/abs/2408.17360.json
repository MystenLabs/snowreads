Previous\nstudies have long suggested that non-reciprocity tends to destroy glassiness.\nHere, we show that this is not always the case using a bipartite spherical\nSherrington-Kirpatrick model that describes the antagonistic coupling between\ntwo identical complex agents modeled as macroscopic spin glasses. Our dynamical\nmean field theory calculations reveal an exceptional-point mediated transition\nfrom a static disorder phase to an oscillating amorphous phase as well as\nnon-reciprocal aging with slow dynamics and oscillations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
