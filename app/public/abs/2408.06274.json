However, the scenarios\nwhere the receiver is moving, are not addressed by recent studies. This paper\ntackles the angle of arrival (AOA) 3D-localization problem for multiple sparse\nsignal sources with a moving receiver having limited antennas, potentially\noutnumbered by the sources. First, an energy detector algorithm is proposed to\nexploit the sparsity of the signal to eliminate the noisy samples of the\nsignals. Subsequently, elevation and azimuth AOAs of sources are roughly\nestimated using two dimensional multiple signal classification (2D-MUSIC)\nmethod. Next, an algorithm is proposed to refine and estimate the elevation and\nazimuth AOAs more accurately. To this end, we propose a sparse recovery\nalgorithm to exploit the sparsity feature of the signals. Then, we propose a\nphase smoothing algorithm to refine the estimations in the output of sparse\nrecovery algorithm. Finally, K-SVD algorithm is employed to find the accurate\nelevation and azimuth AOAs of sources. For localization, a new multi-source\n3D-localization algorithm is proposed to estimate the positions of sources in a\nsequence of time windows. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
