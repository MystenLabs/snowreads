This\nstudy investigates the spread of power outages during hurricanes by analyzing\nthe correlation between the network of critical infrastructure and outage\npropagation. We leveraged datasets from Hurricanemapping.com, the North\nAmerican Energy Resilience Model Interdependency Analysis (NAERM-IA), and\nhistorical power outage data from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)'s\nEAGLE-I system. Our analysis reveals a consistent positive correlation between\nthe extent of critical infrastructure components accessible within a certain\nnumber of steps (k-hop distance) from initial impact areas and the occurrence\nof power outages in broader regions. This insight suggests that understanding\nthe interconnectedness among critical infrastructure elements is key to\nidentifying areas indirectly affected by extreme weather events.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
