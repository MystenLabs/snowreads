However, these\napproaches can only achieve angle-dependent secure transmission. This paper\npresents an AN-aided decomposed and distributed directional modulation (D3M)\nscheme for secure wireless communications, which takes advantage of the spatial\nsignatures to achieve an extra range-dimension security apart from the angles.\nLeveraging decomposed and distributed structure, each of modulated signal is\nrepresented by mutually orthogonal in-phase and quadrature branches, which are\ntransmitted by two distributed transmitters to enhance PLS. In particular, we\nfirst aim to minimize transmit message power by integrated design of the\ntransmit beamformers, subject to prescribed received signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) for the legitimate user (LU) and no inter-branch interference. This\nguarantees reliable and accurate transmission for the LU with the minimum\ntransmit message power. Considering the leakage power on the sidelobes, AN is\nsuperimposed on the messages to try to mask the confidential information\ntransmission. Simulation results demonstrate the security enhancement of our\nproposed D3M system.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
