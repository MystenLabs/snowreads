The\noriginal concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has\nbeen implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to\nextend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a\nThouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of\ncoupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the\nsystem, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and\ngenerate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of\nexcitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within\nthe Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band\nexperience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the\nbands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band\ninversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our\nnumerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from\nexciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven\ntopological phases of matter.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
