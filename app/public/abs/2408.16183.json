The\nmajority of CLQs have been found dimming as \"turn-off\" CLQs because most\nselection methods start from samples of spectroscopically-confirmed quasars. We\npresent here a sample of 82 spectroscopically confirmed \"turn-on\" CLQs, 70 of\nwhich are newly identified. The turn-on CLQs are selected from\nspectroscopically classified galaxies with subsequent significant and dramatic\nvariability in both the optical and mid-infrared bands, indicating a mechanism\nof changing accretion rate of the supermassive black holes rather than variable\nobscuration. Based on their bright state Eddington ratios, turn-on CLQs are\nassociated with lower accretion rates compared to turn-off CLQs or typical SDSS\nquasars with similar redshift and magnitude distributions, even though turn-on\nCLQs have lower black hole masses. Most turn-on CLQs reside in host galaxies\nthat follow local relations between the central black hole mass and host galaxy\nproperties, such as stellar mass and velocity dispersion. However, their host\ngalaxies have higher mass than normal inactive galaxies, with star formation\nrates more similar to hosts of Type 2 AGN than to the overall galaxy\npopulation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
