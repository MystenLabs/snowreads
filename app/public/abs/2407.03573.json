Measurement of tissue oxygen concentration can be challenging, but\nrecent advancements using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) in\nthree-dimensional positron emission tomography (PET) scans have shown promise\nfor hypoxia detection. In this work, a novel method for estimating the\northopositronium lifetime in PALS is presented. This method is analytical and\nuses moments of the time-difference histogram from photon arrival times. For\nsufficient statistical power, the method produces monotonic, stable estimates.\nFor cases with a lower number of photon counts, the method was characterized\nand solutions are presented to correct for bias and estimation variability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
