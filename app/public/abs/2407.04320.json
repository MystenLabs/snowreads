When all\nreaction rates are constant, the equations are the following:\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dv}{dt} & =-vw+v\\sum_{j=2}^{\\infty}c_{j}, \\qquad\n\\frac{dw}{dt} =vw-w\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}c_{j}, \\\\ \\frac{dc_{j}}{dt} &\n=J_{j-1}-J_{j}\\ \\ ,\\ \\ j\\geq1\\ \\ ,\\ \\ \\ J_{j}=wc_{j}-vc_{j+1}\\ \\ ,\\ \\ j\\geq1\\ \\\n,\\ J_{0}=0, \\end{align*} where $v$ and $w$ are two distinct unit species, and\n$c_i$ represents the concentration of clusters containing $i$ units.\n  We study in detail the mechanisms leading to such oscillations and\ncharacterise the different phases of the dynamics, from the initial\nhigh-amplitude oscillations to the progressive damping leading to the\nconvergence towards the unique positive stationary solution. We give\nquantitative approximations for the main quantities of interest: period of the\noscillations, size of the damping (corresponding to a loss of energy), number\nof oscillations characterising each phase. We illustrate these results by\nnumerical simulation, in line with the theoretical results, and provide\nnumerical methods to solve the system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
