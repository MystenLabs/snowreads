We investigate\nGW polarization constraints using a model-independent parametrized\npost-Einsteinian framework with space- and ground-based detectors. Evaluating\nLISA, Taiji, TianQin, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and Einstein Telescope (ET), we\nanalyze their capabilities and network performance. Taiji provides the best\nconstraints among space-based detectors, with LISA outperforming TianQin. Among\nground-based detectors, LIGO excels in vector modes, while ET offers the most\ncomprehensive constraints. In network scenarios, LISA+TJm performs best, and ET\nsurpasses second-generation detector combinations. Multiband observations\nalleviate scalar mode degeneracies, significantly enhancing ground-based\ndetector performance. Combined space- and ground-based observations yield\nrobust constraints on GW polarization, advancing tests of deviations from\ngeneral relativity. Our findings highlight the potential of future GW missions\nto refine our understanding of gravitational physics through precise\npolarization measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
