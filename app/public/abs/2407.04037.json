Unsurprisingly, this\nproblem is undecidable even for very restricted classes of reductions. This\nleads to the question: Is there a natural, expressive class of reductions for\nwhich the validation problem can be attacked algorithmically? We answer this\nquestion positively by introducing an easy-to-use graphical specification\nmechanism for computational reductions, called cookbook reductions. We show\nthat cookbook reductions are sufficiently expressive to cover many classical\ngraph reductions and expressive enough so that SAT remains NP-complete (in the\npresence of a linear order). Surprisingly, the validation problem is decidable\nfor natural and expressive subclasses of cookbook reductions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
