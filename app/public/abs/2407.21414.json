This\nwork investigates post-hoc correction of ASR transcripts with LLMs. To avoid\nintroducing errors into likely accurate transcripts, we propose a range of\nconfidence-based filtering methods. Our results indicate that this can improve\nthe performance of less competitive ASR systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
