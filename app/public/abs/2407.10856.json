This review examines the transformative role\nof such generative methods. First, a variety of physics-inspired GMs, including\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Score-based Diffusion Models\n(SDMs), and Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGMs and PFGM++), are revisited,\nwith an emphasis on their accuracy, robustness as well as acceleration. Then,\nmajor applications of physics-inspired GMs in medical imaging are presented,\ncomprising image reconstruction, image generation, and image analysis. Finally,\nfuture research directions are brainstormed, including unification of\nphysics-inspired GMs, integration with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and\npotential novel applications of GMs. Since the development of generative\nmethods has been rapid, this review will hopefully give peers and learners a\ntimely snapshot of this new family of physics-driven generative models and help\ncapitalize their enormous potential for medical imaging.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
