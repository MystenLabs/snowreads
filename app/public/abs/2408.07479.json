While the\nstudy of this phenomenon is garnering focus in recent years, the available\nresources are still relatively scarce, often focusing on different forms or\nmanifestations of biases. The aim of our work is twofold: 1) gather\npublicly-available datasets and determine how to better combine them to\neffectively train models in the task of hate speech detection and\nclassification; 2) analyse the main issues with these datasets, such as\nscarcity, skewed resources, and reliance on non-persistent data. We discuss\nthese issues in tandem with the development of our experiments, in which we\nshow that the combinations of different datasets greatly impact the models'\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6RdKeahPOsPTnrE7Eqj24pTOLqnuzZeDtzL9ngHRbGM","pdfSize":"357634"}
