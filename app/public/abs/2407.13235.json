This feature is commonly described in the context\nof quantum mechanics and using the corresponding formalism and techniques.\nAlthough few attempts at a quantum field-theoretical description of a minimal\nlength has been proposed, they are rather the exception and there is no general\nagreement on the correct one. Here, using the quantum-mechanical model as a\nguidance, we propose a first-principle definition of a quantum field theory\nincluding a minimal length. Specifically, we propose a two-step procedure, by\nfirst describing the quantum-mechanical models as a classical field theory and\nsubsequently quantizing it. We are thus able to provide a foundation for\nfurther exploration of the implications of a minimal length in quantum field\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
