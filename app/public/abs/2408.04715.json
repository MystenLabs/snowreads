Our approach transfers small regions of the\nBEC into a different hyperfine state, and tracks their displacement ultimately\nyielding the velocity field. This allows us to quantify turbulence in the same\nway as conventional in fluid dynamics in terms of velocity-velocity correlation\nfunctions called velocity structure functions that obey a Kolmogorov scaling\nlaw. Furthermore the velocity increments show a clear fat-tail non-Gaussian\ndistribution that results from intermittency corrections to the initial \"K41\"\nKolmogorov theory. Our observations are fully consistent with the later \"KO62\"\ndescription. These results are validated by a 2D dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii\nsimulation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
