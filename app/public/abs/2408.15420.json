We publish the largest public dataset of over \\$900 million in\nransomware payments -- several times larger than any existing public dataset.\nWe then leverage this expanded dataset to present an analysis focused on\nunderstanding the activities of ransomware groups over time. This provides\nunique insights into ransomware behavior and a corpus for future study of\nransomware cybercriminal activity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lri_sVOQ4E81bX_bjbfFdkoxYpzfFgxuUhNOd16IJUY","pdfSize":"863576"}
