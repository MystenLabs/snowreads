We show that the complex trajectories arises as a\nconsequence of using the Bargmann-Segal (complex wave) representation of the\nbath. In particular, we construct a reproducing kernel Hilbert space for the\nbath auto-correlation and realize the space of complex trajectories as a\nHilbert subspace. The reproducing kernel naturally arises from a feature space\nwhere the underlying feature space is the one-particle Hilbert space of the\nbath quanta. We exploit this to derive the unravelling of the open quantum\nsystem dynamics and show equivalence to the equation of Di{\\'o}si and Strunz.\nWe also give an explicit expression for the reduced dynamics of a two-level\nsystem coupled to the bath via a Jaynes-Cummings interaction and show that this\ndoes indeed correspond to an exact solution of the Di{\\'o}si-Strunz equation.\nFinally, we discuss the physical interpretation of the complex trajectories and\nshow that they are intrinsically unobservable.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
