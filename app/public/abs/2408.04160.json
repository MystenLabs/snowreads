In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the\nspins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the\nlocal operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields\nthe ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM\ninteractions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
