The\nFierz identity and the mean-field approximation transform our model into an\nAnderson-like model that is stabilized by a scalar-type s-d interaction term.\nNumerical minimization of the thermodynamic potential shows that the Kondo\ncondensation forms when the temperature is low, and the s-d coupling is strong.\nThe formation of the Kondo condensation at zero temperature turns out to give a\nfirst-order quantum phase transition. Though these results are very suggestive\nand consistent with previous large-N studies, they work only when the\nmean-field theory is justified in strong coupling, as usual. We build a\nholographic model as an effective mean-field theory for the Kondo lattice with\nstrong coupling, by considering interacting two-flavor spinors, one in standard\nquantization and the other one in the mixed quantization, both them coupled\nwith scalar orders representing the Kondo condensation. Our model realizes the\nextended Fermi surface as well as the large fermion mass of heavy fermion\nphysics in the strong coupling regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
