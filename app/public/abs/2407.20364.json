However, complex tasks often imply unfeasible\nenergy and computational power consumption. Quantum computation might lower\nsuch requirements, although it is unclear whether enhancements are reachable by\ncurrent technologies. Here, we demonstrate a kernel method on a photonic\nintegrated processor to perform a binary classification. We show that our\nprotocol outperforms state-of-the-art kernel methods including gaussian and\nneural tangent kernels, exploiting quantum interference, and brings a smaller\nimprovement also by single photon coherence. Our scheme does not require\nentangling gates and can modify the system dimension through additional modes\nand injected photons. This result opens to more efficient algorithms and to\nformulating tasks where quantum effects improve standard methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3siXaJ8hf4E-AKWGVOtvyojhCmAe1ZLTUHdF2jiVujw","pdfSize":"1541043"}
