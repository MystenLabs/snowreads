These results lead to refinements of\nHardy's inequality obtained by adding remainder terms involving \\(L^p\\) norms.\nWe use techniques that avoid symmetric rearrangement argument, simplifying the\nanalysis of these inequalities in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean contexts.\nSpecifically, this method applies to a variety of settings, such as the\nHeisenberg group, various Carnot groups and operators expressed as sums of\nsquares of vector fields. Significant examples include the Heisenberg-Greiner\noperator and the Baouendi-Grushin operator.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
