DB provides a set of four\nparameters that characterize both incoherent and coherent errors in the\nsingle-qubit gate set. Furthermore, DB reveals asymmetries in gate performance\ninduced by strong relaxation errors ($T_1$). We experimentally demonstrate DB\nusing a superconducting transmon qubit and support these results with a simple\nanalytical model and master equation simulations. Our findings uncover critical\nerrors missed by conventional RB and point to strategies to mitigate these\nerrors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
