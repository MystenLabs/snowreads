Specifically, we study the logistic growth\nmodel, which provides insights into population dynamics under resource\nlimitations. Unlike exponential growth, the logistic model incorporates the\nconcept of carrying capacity, thus offering a more realistic depiction of\nbiological populations as they near environmental limits. We aim to study the\nimpact of individual-level incentives driving behavioral responses in a dynamic\nenvironment. Specifically, explore the coupled dynamics between population\ndensity and individuals' foraging times. Our results yield insights into the\neffects of population size on individuals' optimal foraging efforts, which\nimpacts the population's size.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
