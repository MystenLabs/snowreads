Accurately and efficiently managing uncertainty in estimated\nstates is key to robust robotic operation. However, nonlinearities in robotic\nplatforms pose significant challenges that require advanced estimation\ntechniques. Gaussian variational inference (GVI) offers an optimization\nperspective on the estimation problem, providing analytically tractable\nsolutions and efficiencies derived from the geometry of Gaussian space. We\npropose a Sequential Gaussian Variational Inference (S-GVI) method to address\nnonlinearity and provide efficient sequential inference processes. Our approach\nintegrates sequential Bayesian principles into the GVI framework, which are\naddressed using statistical approximations and gradient updates on the\ninformation geometry. Validations through simulations and real-world\nexperiments demonstrate significant improvements in state estimation over the\nMaximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
