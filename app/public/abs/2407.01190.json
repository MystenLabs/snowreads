The relative GH shift\ncalculated from this phase shows a strong resonant enhancement at a particular\nincident neutron wavevector, which is due to a waveguiding effect in one of the\nmagnetic layers. Calculations based on the observed phase difference between\nthe neutron states indicate a propagation distance along the waveguide layer of\n0.65 mm for the spin-down state, which we identify with the magnitude of the\ngiant GH shift. The existence of a physical GH shift is confirmed by the\nobservation of neutron absorption in the waveguide layer. We propose ways in\nwhich our experimental method may be exploited for neutron quantum-enhanced\nsensing of thin magnetic layers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
