To\napply this principle to the design of morphing devices, we introduce the\nconcept of Degrade to Function (DtF). This concept aims to create eco-friendly\nand self-contained morphing devices that operate through a sequence of\nenvironmentally-triggered degradations. We explore its design considerations\nand implementation techniques by identifying environmental conditions and\ndegradation types that can be exploited, evaluating potential materials capable\nof controlled degradation, suggesting designs for structures that can leverage\ndegradation to achieve various transformations and functions, and developing\nsequential control approaches that integrate degradation triggers. To\ndemonstrate the viability and versatility of this design strategy, we showcase\nseveral application examples across a range of environmental conditions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
