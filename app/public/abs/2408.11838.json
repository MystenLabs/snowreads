Here, we described a combination of CAP and nanoparticles (ZrO2 NPs\n(zirconium oxide nanoparticle) and 3Y-TZP NPs (3% mol Yttria Tetragonal\nZirconia Polycrystal Nanoparticle)) for lung cancer therapy. We found that ZrO2\nNPs caused obvious damage to the inside of the lung cancer cells. CAP and ZrO2\nNPs mainly affected the mitochondria function, leading to a decrease in\nmitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, and causing endoplasmic\nreticulum stress and cell nucleus internal DNA damage, etc. CAP combined with\nZrO2 NPs (CAP@ZrO2) induced lung cancer cell apoptosis by activating the\nTGF-\\b{eta} pathway. CAP@ZrO2 offers a new therapy for the clinical treatment\nof lung cancer.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
