GAMR\naims to assist developers in identifying and resolving gameplay issues\neffectively. It features reconstructed gameplay sessions, heatmaps for data\nvisualization, a comprehensive annotation system, and advanced tracking for\nhands, camera, input, and audio, providing in-depth insights for nuanced game\nanalysis.\n  To evaluate GAMR's effectiveness, we conducted an experimental study with\ngame development students across two game genres: action-adventure and\nfirst-person shooter (FPS). The participants used GAMR and provided feedback on\nits utility. The results showed a significant positive impact of GAMR in both\ngenres, particularly in action-adventure games. This study demonstrates GAMR's\neffectiveness in MR game development and suggests its potential to influence\nfuture MR game analytics, addressing the specific needs of developers in this\nevolving area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4TeG_tSdlq5aGbvwY6hQYsug00cprnwdtFZq2hpF-pc","pdfSize":"4833173"}
