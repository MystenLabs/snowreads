Forbes\nfirst applies multiple obfuscating transformations with random parameters to an\nimage to remove the identity information distinguishable by humans. Then, it\noptimizes the parameters to make the transformed image decipherable by machines\nbased on the backpropagation refinement scheme. Finally, it renders an\nobfuscated image by applying the transformations with the optimized parameters.\nExperimental results on various datasets demonstrate that Forbes achieves both\nhuman indecipherability and machine decipherability excellently.
