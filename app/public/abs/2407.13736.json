In this article, we consider the\nCarleson's problem for the Schr\\\"odinger equation with radial initial data on\nDamek-Ricci spaces and obtain the sharp bound up to the endpoint $\\alpha \\ge\n1/4$, which agrees with the classical Euclidean case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bj5vk08xjJmoWNKhywXmekm5Xz18ocFJoFoo6MyaaTo","pdfSize":"274373"}
