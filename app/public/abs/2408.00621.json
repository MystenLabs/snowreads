In this paper, we explore the unique idea of\ncrowdsourcing passing-by vehicles to augment computing of the ego vehicle. The\nchallenges lie in the high dynamics of passing-by vehicles, time-correlated\ntask computation, and the stringent requirement of computing reliability for\nindividual user tasks. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem to\nminimize the end-to-end latency by optimizing the task assignment and resource\nallocation of user tasks. To address the complex problem, we propose a new\nalgorithm (named CAVE) with multiple key designs. We build an end-to-end\nnetwork and compute simulator and conduct extensive simulation to evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
