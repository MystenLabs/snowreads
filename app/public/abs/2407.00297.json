Recently, researchers have proposed some\nsegmentation methods, such as atlas-based and deep learning-based methods.\nHowever, since the facial nerve is a tubular organ with a diameter of only\n1.0-1.5mm, it is challenging to locate and segment the facial nerve in CT\nscans. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware dualstream network\n(UADSN). UADSN consists of a 2D segmentation stream and a 3D segmentation\nstream. Predictions from two streams are used to identify uncertain regions,\nand a consistency loss is employed to supervise the segmentation of these\nregions. In addition, we introduce channel squeeze & spatial excitation modules\ninto the skip connections of U-shaped networks to extract meaningful spatial\ninformation. In order to consider topologypreservation, a clDice loss is\nintroduced into the supervised loss function. Experimental results on the\nfacial nerve dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of UADSN and our submodules.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
