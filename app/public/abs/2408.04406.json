Our results\nextend randomized techniques developed in control and optimization for a\nconstant target to the case where the target is changing. We derive a novel\nbound on the number of samples that are required to construct a probably\napproximately correct (PAC) estimate of the target. Furthermore, when the\nmoving target is a convex polytope, we provide a constructive method of\ngenerating the PAC estimate using a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The\nproposed method is demonstrated on an application to autonomous emergency\nbraking.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
