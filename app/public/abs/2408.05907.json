To\nexpand their application scope, we provide, to our best knowledge, the first\ninvestigation of nonlinear conversion processes in periodically poled TFLN\nwaveguides at cryogenic condition. Through systematic experimental\ncharacterization, we find that the periodically poled TFLN waveguide maintains\nconsistent conversion efficiencies at both cryogenic and room temperatures for\nboth classical second-harmonic generation and quantum photon-pair generation\nprocesses, demonstrating the significant potential of TFLN wavelength\nconversion devices for cryogenic applications. This breakthrough will foster\nfuture scalable quantum photonic systems and optical interfacing among\ndifferent cryogenic platforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
