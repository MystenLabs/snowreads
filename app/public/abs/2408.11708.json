We find an intrinsic quantitative\ncharacterisation of this number: it is the dimension over $\\mathbb{Q}$ of the\nvector space generated by the logarithms of all the common ratios of infinite\ngeometric sequences in the gap length set, minus 1. With this concept, we\npresent a lower bound on the cardinality of generating IFS (with or without\nseparation conditions) in terms of the gap lengths of a dust-like set. We also\nestablish analogous result for dust-like graph-directed attractors on complete\nmetric spaces. This is a new application of the ratio analysis method and the\ngap sequence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
