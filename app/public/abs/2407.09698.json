This task is particularly\nchallenging in the online setting where various types of changes can occur,\nincluding shifts in both the marginal and joint distributions of the data. This\npaper tackles these challenges by sequentially tracking correlation matrices on\nthe Riemannian geometry, where the geodesic distances accurately capture the\ndevelopment of correlations. We propose Rio-CPD, a non-parametric\ncorrelation-aware online change point detection framework that combines the\nRiemannian geometry of the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices and\nthe cumulative sum statistic (CUSUM) for detecting change points. Rio-CPD\nenhances CUSUM by computing the geodesic distance from present observations to\nthe Fr\\'echet mean of previous observations. With careful choice of metrics\nequipped to the Riemannian geometry, Rio-CPD is simple and computationally\nefficient. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that Rio-CPD outperforms existing methods in detection accuracy and\nefficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ibE5qLtUCp8qnseBmjX6vIJoUBAm9ZuPmTnEjMN9rFM","pdfSize":"888045"}
