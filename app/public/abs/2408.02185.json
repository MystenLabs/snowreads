Our model posits that an EEG signal comprises short,\nshift-invariant waves, referred to as atoms. We design a decomposer as an\nartificial neural network aimed at estimating these atoms and detecting their\ntime shifts and amplitude modulations within the input signal. The efficacy of\nour method was validated across various scenarios in brain--computer interfaces\nand neuroscience, demonstrating enhanced performance. Additionally,\ncross-dataset validation indicates the feasibility of a pre-trained model,\nenabling a plug-and-play signal decomposition module.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
