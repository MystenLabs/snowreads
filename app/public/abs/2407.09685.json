However, they suffer from slow inference speed. We present a method\nto accelerate inference in autoregressive SMILES generators through speculative\ndecoding by copying query string subsequences into target strings in the right\nplaces. We apply our method to the molecular transformer implemented in Pytorch\nLightning and achieve over 3X faster inference in reaction prediction and\nsingle-step retrosynthesis, with no loss in accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DzSp6WK8-rDrUIPraMVteJZiXQX9n_cn-OehS8CIvbI","pdfSize":"5426877"}
