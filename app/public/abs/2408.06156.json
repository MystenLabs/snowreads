Most of the descriptors\nresulting from these efforts are ultimately based on the spatial configurations\nof particles, atoms, or molecules within these systems. Noteworthy examples\ninclude symmetry functions and the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP)\ndescriptors, which have significantly advanced the performance of predictive\nmachine learning models for both condensed matter and small molecules. However,\nwhile graph-based descriptors are frequently employed in machine learning\nmodels to predict the functional properties of small molecules, their\napplication in the context of condensed matter has been limited. In this paper,\nwe put forward a number of graph-based descriptors (such as node centrality and\nclustering coefficients) traditionally utilised in network science, as\nalternative representations for condensed matter systems. We apply this\ngraph-based formalism to investigate the dynamical properties and phase\ntransitions of the prototypical Lennard-Jones system. We find that our\ngraph-based formalism outperforms symmetry function descriptors in predicting\nthe dynamical properties and phase transitions of this system. These results\ndemonstrate the broad applicability of graph-based features in representing\ncondensed matter systems, paving the way for exciting advancements in the field\nof condensed matter through the integration of network science concepts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
