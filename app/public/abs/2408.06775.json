MRFM has the potential to enable\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with near-atomic spatial resolution, opening\nup exciting possibilities in solid state and biological research. In many\ncases, the spin-mechanics coupling in MRFM is engineered with the help of\nperiodic radio-frequency pulses. In this paper, we report that such pulses can\nresult in unwanted parametric amplification of the mechanical vibrations,\ncausing misinterpretation of the measured signal. We show how the parametric\neffect can be cancelled by auxiliary radio-frequency pulses or by appropriate\npost-correction after careful calibration. Future MRFM measurements may even\nmake use of the parametric amplification to reduce the impact of amplifier\nnoise\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cwEq55LUmCN0XxQW9sqdeocb5QAk3Q8LsqYDm4Bi3SE","pdfSize":"2276080"}
