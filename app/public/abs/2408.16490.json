Like the\nspin-splitting of electronic bands, the magnon bands in altermagnets are\npredicted to exhibit alternating chiral splitting. In this work, by performing\ninelastic neutron scattering on $\\alpha$-MnTe, we directly verified the chiral\nsplitting in altermagnetic magnon dispersions. The lifted degeneracy of\nchirality is further explained by a symmetric-exchange origin. In addition, the\n$g$-wave magnetism was identified in MnTe.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
