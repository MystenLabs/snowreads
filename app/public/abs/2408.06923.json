We similarly introduce $k$-skeletal parking functions which are\nequinumerous with the spanning trees on $n+1$ vertices for each $k$, and\nspecialize to classical parking functions for $k=n-1$. The preceding\nconstructions are generalized to paths lying in a trapezoid with base $c > 0$\nand southeastern diagonal of slope $1/m$; $c$ and $m$ need not be integers. We\ngive bijections among these families when $k$ varies with $m$ and $c$ fixed.\nOur constructions are motivated by chip firing and have connections to\ncombinatorial representation theory and tropical geometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
