The infidelity of the best recovery is\nupper-bounded by the conditional mutual information (CMI). In this work, we\nstudy the infidelity of the rotated Petz map on several physically-relevant\nlong-range entangled quantum states. Specifically, we study three classes of\nquantum phases: (i) steady states of measurement-induced phase transitions,\n(ii) critical ground state under local measurements, and (iii) chiral states\nunder local measurements. We find that the average Petz map infidelity sharply\ndistinguishes the three classes: (i) and (ii) are distinguished by the scaling\nof the infidelity with CMI and (iii) is characterized by an asymmetry of the\ninfidelity with the rotation parameter. We also study Petz map recovery for\ntopological order and find an operational interpretation of the topological\nentanglement entropy. Our result indicates that the Petz map fidelity is a\nuseful diagnostic of quantum phases of matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
