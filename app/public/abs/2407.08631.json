Using this model, we find that the interplay\nbetween membrane tension and multibody interactions results in a collective\nattraction of oppositely curved inclusions tending to form antiferromagnetic\nstructures with a square lattice. This attraction can produce a phase\nseparation between curved and non-curved proteins, resulting in the clustering\nof curved proteins. We also show that the many-body repulsion between identical\ncurved proteins is enhanced by membrane tension. This can lead to the\ndissolution of clusters stabilized by short-range forces when the tension is\nincreased. These new phenomena are biologically relevant and could be\ninvestigated experimentally\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
