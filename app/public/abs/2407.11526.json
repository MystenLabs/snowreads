We give obstructions to the existence of such structures on\ncompact complex manifolds. We provide several families of compact complex\nmanifolds which admit both $(n-1)$-symplectic structures and special Hermitian\nmetrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
