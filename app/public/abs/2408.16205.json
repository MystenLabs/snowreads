A theoretical description using second quantization is elegant\nbut abstract. In contrast, this paper describes a simple model of two-particle\ninterference using a one-dimensional delta potential well as a beam splitter.\nThe conditions for the HOM effect are derived from the perspective of wave\npacket evolution. Furthermore, the interference processes of bosons, fermions\nand distinguishable particles are demonstrated and compared in detail. The\nmethod presented here is concrete, easy to visualize, and can help students to\nbetter understand the effects arising from the exchange symmetry of wave\nfunctions. The main results can be animated for classroom teaching or developed\ninto an undergraduate seminar topic.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
