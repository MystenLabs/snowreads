In dynamical\npercolation, every edge in $G$ refreshes its status at rate $\\mu>0$, and\nfollowing the refresh, each edge is open independently with probability $p$.\nThe random walk traverses $G$ only along open edges, moving at rate $1$. In the\ncritical regime $p=p_c$, we prove that the speed of the random walk is at most\n$O(\\sqrt{\\mu \\log(1/\\mu)})$, provided that $\\mu \\le e^{-1}$. In the\nsupercritical regime $p>p_c$, we prove that the speed on $G$ is of order 1\n(uniformly in $\\mu)$, while in the subcritical regime $p<p_c$, the speed is of\norder $\\mu\\wedge 1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
