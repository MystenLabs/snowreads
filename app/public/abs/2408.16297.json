They alternately select unplayed vertices\nof $G$. The goal of Dominator is to form a dominating set with the set of\nvertices selected by him while that of Staller is to prevent this from\nhappening. In this paper MBD game critical graphs are introduced. Their\nexistence is established and critical graphs are characterized for most of the\ncases in which the first player can win the game in one or two moves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YGJDAOyg_ITCXOiXo0eaNYALgfOI3_74krdnmuaozwI","pdfSize":"180786"}
