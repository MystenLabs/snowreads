These $q$-matroids are motivated by coding theory as the\nrepresentable $q$-matroids are the ones that stem from rank-metric codes. In\nthis note, we establish a $q$-analogue of Nelson's theorem in matroid theory by\nproving that asymptotically almost all $q$-matroids are not representable. This\nanswers a question about representable $q$-matroids by Jurrius and Pellikaan\nstrongly in the negative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
