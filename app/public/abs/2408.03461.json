In this context, it is\ncritical that the network barycenter inherits the topological structure of the\nnetworks in the training dataset. The metric - which measures the proximity\nbetween networks - controls the structural properties of the barycenter. This\nwork is significant because it provides for the first time analytical estimates\nof the sample Fr\\'echet mean for the stochastic blockmodel, which is at the\ncutting edge of rigorous probabilistic analysis of random networks. We show\nthat the mean network computed with the Hamming distance is unable to capture\nthe topology of the networks in the training sample, whereas the mean network\ncomputed using the effective resistance distance recovers the correct\npartitions and associated edge density. From a practical standpoint, our work\ninforms the choice of metrics in the context where the sample Fr\\'echet mean\nnetwork is used to characterise the topology of networks for network-valued\nmachine learning\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
