The governing equations\ndescribing nonlinear interactions among ZFZS and DAWs are derived, with the\ncontribution of DAWs self-beating and radial modulation accounted for on the\nsame footing. The obtained equations are then used to derive the nonlinear\ndispersion relation, which is then applied to investigate ZFZS generation in\nseveral scenarios. In particular, it is found that, the condition for zonal\nflow excitation by kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) could be sensitive to plasma\nparameters, and more detailed investigation is needed to understand KBM\nnonlinear saturation, crucial for bulk plasma transport in future reactors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"VEZ7nqxff7oPDP2ifZeDQ6myCaGexwJZabfksk5ECuI","pdfSize":"259481","txDigest":"8gcNy5h5Lk4D4wMw5uK8cYSmiHqgyctX8sQax3UPCNe3","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
