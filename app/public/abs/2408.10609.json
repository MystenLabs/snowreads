Our framework, PerturBench, includes a user-friendly\nplatform, diverse datasets, metrics for fair model comparison, and detailed\nperformance analysis. Extensive evaluations of published and baseline models\nreveal limitations like mode or posterior collapse, and underscore the\nimportance of rank metrics that assess the ordering of perturbations alongside\ntraditional measures like RMSE. Our findings show that simple models can\noutperform more complex approaches. This benchmarking exercise sets new\nstandards for model evaluation, supports robust model development, and advances\nthe potential of these models to use high-throughput and high-content genetic\nand chemical screens for disease target discovery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
