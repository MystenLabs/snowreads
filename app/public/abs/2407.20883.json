In this study, we introduce Piano Cover Generation\n(PiCoGen), a two-stage approach for automatic cover song generation that\ntranscribes the melody line and chord progression of a song given its audio\nrecording, and then uses the resulting lead sheet as the condition to generate\na piano cover in the symbolic domain. This approach is advantageous in that it\ndoes not required paired data of covers and their original songs for training.\nCompared to an existing approach that demands such paired data, our evaluation\nshows that PiCoGen demonstrates competitive or even superior performance across\nsongs of different musical genres.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
