Often, the main objective is to transfer the\ninput identity to that of a target speaker without changing its linguistic\ncontent. While current work provides high-fidelity solutions they rarely focus\non model simplicity, high-sampling rate environments or stream-ability. By\nincorporating speech representation learning into a generative timbre transfer\nmodel, traditionally created for musical purposes, we investigate the realm of\nvoice conversion generated directly in the time domain at high sampling rates.\nMore specifically, we guide the latent space of a baseline model towards\nlinguistically relevant representations and condition it on external speaker\ninformation. Through objective and subjective assessments, we demonstrate that\nthe proposed solution can attain levels of naturalness, quality, and\nintelligibility comparable to those of a state-of-the-art solution for seen\nspeakers, while significantly decreasing inference time. However, despite the\npresence of target speaker characteristics in the converted output, the actual\nsimilarity to unseen speakers remains a challenge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qKnwPyxYFj4L7nqYV747h-fSwnxcaCOC9TmW8X333ws","pdfSize":"734481"}
