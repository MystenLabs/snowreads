Here, we report resonant and non-resonant x-ray diffraction\ndata indicating a four-unit-cell periodic superstructure related to oxygen\nvacancy ordering in La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ films with doping levels from\nthe underdoped ($x = 0.15$) to the extremely overdoped ($x = 0.50$) regime.\nWhereas the lattice superstructure is temperature independent up to 300 K, a\nstrongly temperature dependent electronic charge density wave (CDW) is observed\nin the underdoped and slightly overdoped regimes ($x\\leq0.20$). The\nperiodicity, in-plane and out-of-plane correlation lengths of the CDW are\nlocked in by the lattice superstructure. Our results highlight the necessity to\nconsider lattice and electronic energetics on equal footing in the\nhigh-temperature oxygen-disordered phase to explain oxygen ordering phenomena\nin complex oxides.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
