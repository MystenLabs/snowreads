While OWL2Vec* has emerged as a powerful technique for ontology\nembedding, it currently lacks a mechanism to tailor the embedding to the\nontology alignment task. OWL2Vec4OA incorporates edge confidence values from\nseed mappings to guide the random walk strategy. We present the theoretical\nfoundations, implementation details, and experimental evaluation of our\nproposed extension, demonstrating its potential effectiveness for ontology\nalignment tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zcz7aSoG00BMLLPZe8JDsdAIopdIN2TJy3yhkYVfSkU","pdfSize":"858149"}
