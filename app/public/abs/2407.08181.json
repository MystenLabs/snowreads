This challenging problem,\nalthough sometimes ignored and even imperceptible, can easily create\ndiscrepancies in calculated shot gathers, which will then lead to wrong\nresiduals that must be migrated back to the gradients, hence jeopardizing the\ninverted tomograms. In practice, any shot gather may correspond to its own\nsource even if some of them can be transformed alike after data processing. To\nresolve this problem, we propose a collocated inversion of sources and early\narrival waveforms with the two submodules executing alternatively. Not only can\nthis method produce a decent wavelet that approaches the true source or an\nequivalent source, but more importantly, it can also invert for credible\nbackground velocity models with the optimized sources. Part of the cycle\nskipping problems can also be mitigated because it avoids the trial and error\nexperiments on various sources. Numerical tests upon a series of different\nconditions validate the effectiveness of this method. Restrictions on initial\nsources or starting velocity models will be relaxed with this method, and it\ncan be extended to any other applications for engineering or exploration\npurposes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
