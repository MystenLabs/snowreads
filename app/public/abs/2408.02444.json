Compared with vision-aided and LiDAR-aided\nINS, radar-aided INS could achieve better performance in adverse weather\nconditions since the radar utilizes low-frequency measuring signals with less\nattenuation effect in atmospheric gases and rain. For such a radar-aided INS,\naccurate spatiotemporal transformation is a fundamental prerequisite to\nachieving optimal information fusion. In this work, we present RIs-Calib: a\nspatiotemporal calibrator for multiple 3D radars and IMUs based on\ncontinuous-time estimation, which enables accurate spatiotemporal calibration\nand does not require any additional artificial infrastructure or prior\nknowledge. Our approach starts with a rigorous and robust procedure for state\ninitialization, followed by batch optimizations, where all parameters can be\nrefined to global optimal states steadily. We validate and evaluate RIs-Calib\non both simulated and real-world experiments, and the results demonstrate that\nRIs-Calib is capable of accurate and consistent calibration. We open-source our\nimplementations at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/RIs-Calib) to benefit the\nresearch community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
