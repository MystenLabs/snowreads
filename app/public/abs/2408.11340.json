Simulation results are presented which suggest that the\nfollower adopting satisfaction generally increases leader utility. This\nimportant new result is proven for the case where leader strategies to commit\nto are restricted to be deterministic (pure strategies). The paper then\naddresses the application of regret based algorithms to the Stackelberg\nproblem. Although it is known that the follower adopts a no-regret position in\na Stackelberg solution, this is not generally the case for the leader. The\nreport examines the convergence behaviour of unconditional and conditional\nregret matching (RM) algorithms in the Stackelberg setting. The paper shows\nthat, in the examples considered, that these algorithms either converge to any\npure Nash equilibria for the simultaneous move game, or to some mixed\nstrategies which do not have the \"no-regret\" property. In one case, convergence\nof the conditional RM algorithm over both players to a solution \"close\" to the\nStackelberg case was observed. The paper argues that further research in this\narea, in particular when applied in the satisfaction setting could be fruitful.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
