However,\nconventional wheeled designs, with their limited degrees of freedom and\nconstraints in robot configuration, struggle to simultaneously achieve\nstability, passability, and agility due to varying footprint needs. This paper\nproposes a novel robot drive model inspired by human movements, termed as the\nOmni Differential Drive (ODD). The ODD model innovatively utilizes a lateral\ndifferential drive to adjust wheel spacing without adding additional actuators\nto the existing omnidirectional drive. This approach enables wheeled robots to\nachieve both simultaneous reconfiguration and omnidirectional mobility. To\nvalidate the feasibility of the ODD model, a functional prototype was\ndeveloped, followed by comprehensive kinematic analyses. Control systems for\nself-balancing and motion control were designed and implemented. Experimental\nvalidations confirmed the feasibility of the ODD mechanism and the\neffectiveness of the control strategies. The results underline the potential of\nthis innovative drive system to enhance the mobility and adaptability of\nrobotic platforms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
