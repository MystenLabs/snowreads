The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival functions of the\nimmune therapy and the control often suggested the presence of the lag-time\nuntil the immune therapy began to act. It implies the use of hazard ratio under\nthe proportional hazards assumption would not be appealing, and many\nalternatives have been investigated such as the restricted mean survival time.\nIn addition to such overall summary of the treatment contrast, the lag-time is\nalso an important feature of the treatment effect. Identical survival functions\nup to the lag-time implies patients who are likely to die before the lag-time\nwould not benefit the treatment and identifying such patients would be very\nimportant. We propose the semiparametric piecewise accelerated failure time\nmodel and its inference procedure based on the semiparametric maximum\nlikelihood method. It provides not only an overall treatment summary, but also\na framework to identify patients who have less benefit from the immune-therapy\nin a unified way. Numerical experiments confirm that each parameter can be\nestimated with minimal bias. Through a real data analysis, we illustrate the\nevaluation of the effect of immune-oncology therapy and the characterization of\ncovariates in which patients are unlikely to receive the benefit of treatment.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
