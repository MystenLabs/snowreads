Let $c \\in [0.5, 1]$ denote the\nmaximum fraction of satisfiable equations. In this paper we construct a curve\n$s (c)$ such that it is NP-hard to find a solution satisfying at least a\nfraction $s$ of equations. This curve either matches or improves all of the\npreviously known inapproximability NP-hardness results for Max-2Lin(2). In\nparticular, we show that if $c \\geqslant 0.9232$ then $\\frac{1 - s (c)}{1 - c}\n> 1.48969$, which improves the NP-hardness inapproximability constant for the\nmin deletion version of Max-2Lin(2). Our work complements the work of O'Donnell\nand Wu that studied the same question assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.\n  Similar to earlier inapproximability results for Max-2Lin(2), we use a gadget\nreduction from the $(2^k - 1)$-ary Hadamard predicate. Previous works used $k$\nranging from $2$ to $4$. Our main result is a procedure for taking a gadget for\nsome fixed $k$, and use it as a building block to construct better and better\ngadgets as $k$ tends to infinity. Our method can be used to boost the result of\nboth smaller gadgets created by hand $(k = 3)$ or larger gadgets constructed\nusing a computer $(k = 4)$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BeNPZ4U0QIreeakQYx2_R8CD-7x9ekMuDbugTomOsu0","pdfSize":"722754"}
