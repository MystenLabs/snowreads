The atoms\nspontaneously form a spin-pattern above a critical driving strength that sets a\nthreshold and is determined by the cavity parameters, the initial temperature,\nand the transition frequency of the atomic spin. Remarkably, we find that\ninhomogeneous Doppler broadening facilitates the onset of\nspin-self-organization. In particular, the threshold is non-monotonic when\nincreasing the spin transition frequency and reaches a minimum when the Doppler\nbroadening is of similar magnitude. This feature emerges due to Doppler-induced\nresonances. Above the threshold, we find cooperative dynamics of spin, spatial,\nand momentum degrees of freedom leading to density modulations, fast reduction\nof kinetic energy, and the emergence of non-thermal states. More broadly, our\nwork demonstrates how broadening can facilitate strong light-matter\ninteractions in many-body systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Os3L657olL8wTVx_70zFHcCgoZSsWCmEwpiwQoWkFU8","pdfSize":"6468036"}
