Although there are only a few studies on the\nseasonal variation are available in the literature, the impact of ICME on 557.7\nnm dayglow emission has not been investigated so far. Using the instruments\naboard ExoMars-TGO and MAVEN spacecrafts, we show that the primary emission\npeak (75-80 km) remains unaffected during the ICME event compared to\nquiet-times. However, a noticeable enhancement has been observed in the\nbrightness of secondary emission peak (110-120 km) and the upper altitude\nregion (140-180 km). The enhancement is attributed to the increased solar\nelectrons and X-ray fluxes, augmenting the electron-impact process and causing\nthe enhancement in the brightness. These analyses have an implication to\ncomprehend the role of intense solar transients like ICME on the Martian\ndayglow emissions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Nsu4lyDIlbr6cDV4IzF0Fy58dWOQNeDCjLF9XTBw7bY","pdfSize":"804208"}
