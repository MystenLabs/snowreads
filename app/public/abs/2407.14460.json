Searching for anisotropies in this signal is key to determining\nits origin, and in particular to distinguish possible astrophysical from\ncosmological sources. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of current and\nfuture pulsar timing arrays to such anisotropies using the full covariance\nmatrix of pulsar timing delays. While current day pulsar timing arrays can only\nset mildly informative constraints on the dipole and quadrupole, we show that\npercent level accuracy for several low multipoles can be achieved in the near\nfuture. Moreover, we demonstrate that anisotropies in the gravitational wave\nbackground and the Hellings-Downs angular correlation, indicating the presence\nof GWs, are approximately uncorrelated, and can hence be reconstructed\nindependently. These results can be reproduced with\n\\href{https://github.com/Mauropieroni/fastPTA}{\\texttt{fastPTA}}, a publicly\navailable Python code to forecast the constraining power of PTA configurations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CsigTjbHFTjyRFe3RzomsM70kfU2gDhG8cdxg_0GgQc","pdfSize":"1886199"}
