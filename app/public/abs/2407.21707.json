In this paper, we employ both\nconcepts in an Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting method to enable the\nuse of parallel computations for magnetostatic problems. We address the\nunderlying non-uniqueness by using a graph-theoretic approach, the tree-cotree\ndecomposition. The classical tree-cotree gauging is adapted to be feasible for\nparallelization, which requires that all local subsystems are uniquely\nsolvable. Our contribution consists of an explicit algorithm for constructing\ncompatible trees and combining it with a dual-primal approach to enable\nparallelization. The correctness of the proposed approach is proved and\nverified by numerical experiments, showing its accuracy, scalability and\noptimal convergence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
