Two important types of\nJosephson elements are often considered distinct: the tunnel junction\n(superconductor-insulator-superconductor, SIS) and the Andreev weak link\n(superconductor-normal-superconductor, SNS) referring to any\nnon-superconducting and non-insulating central region. SNS junctions and SIS\njunctions have appeared in related technological and fundamental science\ncontexts over the last decade, such as in the design of protected qubit\nconcepts. In this perspective article, we review correspondences between SISIS\njunctions and SNS junctions in limiting regimes, in which a single energy-phase\nrelationship describes both systems. We show how this insight helps to connect\nrecent bodies of theoretical and experimental work in both systems, and\nconclude by describing a few important differences.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
