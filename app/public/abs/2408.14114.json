However, applying these\nfoundation models to EM segmentation faces significant challenges due to domain\ndisparities. This paper presents ShapeMamba-EM, a specialized fine-tuning\nmethod for 3D EM segmentation, which employs adapters for long-range dependency\nmodeling and an encoder for local shape description within the original\nfoundation model. This approach effectively addresses the unique volumetric and\nmorphological complexities of EM data. Tested over a wide range of EM images,\ncovering five segmentation tasks and 10 datasets, ShapeMamba-EM outperforms\nexisting methods, establishing a new standard in EM image segmentation and\nenhancing the understanding of neural tissue architecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
