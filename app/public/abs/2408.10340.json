These systems' consistency is\nquestioned when they do not align with cohorts from unsupervised clustering\nalgorithms optimized for various metrics. We investigate whether unsupervised\nclustering can reproduce ground truth classes in a labeled dataset, showing\nthat success depends on feature selection and the chosen distance metric. Using\ntoy datasets and fund categorization as real-world examples we demonstrate that\naccurately reproducing ground truth classes is challenging. We also highlight\nthe limitations of standard clustering evaluation metrics in identifying the\noptimal number of clusters relative to the ground truth classes. We then show\nthat if appropriate features are available in the dataset, and a proper\ndistance metric is known (e.g., using a supervised Random Forest-based distance\nmetric learning method), then an unsupervised clustering can indeed reproduce\nthe ground truth classes as distinct clusters.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
