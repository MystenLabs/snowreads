The algebra $U_q^+$ admits an\nembedding, due to Rosso, into a $q$-shuffle algebra $\\mathbb{V}$. The\nunderlying vector space of $\\mathbb{V}$ is the free algebra on two generators\n$x,y$. Therefore, the algebra $\\mathbb{V}$ has a basis consisting of the words\nin $x,y$. Let $U$ denote the image of $U_q^+$ under the Rosso embedding. In our\nfirst main result, we find all the words in $x,y$ that are contained in $U$.\nOne type of solution is called alternating. The alternating words have been\nstudied by Terwilliger. There is another type of solution, which we call doubly\nalternating. In our second main result, we display many commutator relations\ninvolving the doubly alternating words. In our third main result, we describe\nhow the doubly alternating words are related to the alternating words.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
