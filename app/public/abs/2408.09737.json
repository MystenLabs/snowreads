Radford constructed an $mn^{2}$-dimensional\nHopf algebra $R_{mn}(q)$ such that its Jacobson radical is not a Hopf ideal. We\nshow that the Drinfeld double $D(R_{mn}(q))$ of Radford Hopf algebra\n$R_{mn}(q)$ has ribbon elements if and only if $n$ is odd. Moreover, if $m$ is\neven and $n$ is odd, then $D(R_{mn}(q))$ has two ribbon elements, if both $m$\nand $n$ are odd, then $D(R_{mn}(q))$ has only one ribbon element. Finally, we\ncompute explicitly all ribbon elements of $D(R_{mn}(q))$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MXPSSkRlyGM6v4wglxF5OCVzImrQV4Qh53Jyrnf2S2I","pdfSize":"183875"}
