This paper presents the Comprehensive AI Assessment Framework (CAIAF), an\nevolved version of the AI Assessment Scale (AIAS) by Perkins, Furze, Roe, and\nMacVaugh, targeted toward the ethical integration of AI into educational\nassessments. This is where the CAIAF differs, as it incorporates stringent\nethical guidelines, with clear distinctions based on educational levels, and\nadvanced AI capabilities of real-time interactions and personalized assistance.\nThe framework developed herein has a very intuitive use, mainly through the use\nof a color gradient that enhances the user-friendliness of the framework.\nMethodologically, the framework has been developed through the huge support of\na thorough literature review and practical insight into the topic, becoming a\ndynamic tool to be used in different educational settings. The framework will\nensure better learning outcomes, uphold academic integrity, and promote\nresponsible use of AI, hence the need for this framework in modern educational\npractice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fCprjGC3SbK6QmkVxkTjql2y2bLesMXHy4xX6dphqJc","pdfSize":"1688910"}
