When compactified to four dimensions, Yukawa couplings, initially\nexpressed as modular forms with mass dimensions, are normalized to conform to\ncanonical four-dimensional theory, with the Yukawa coefficients being complex\nnumbers of unit absolute value. We show that this model naturally explains the\nmass and mixing hierarchies of quarks and leptons, solves the strong CP\nproblem, provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem, and can\ninherently satisfy no axionic domain-wall problem. The $U(1)_X$ mixed\ngravitational anomaly-free condition necessitates that electrically neutral\nmirror bulk fermions couple to the normal neutrino field on the 3-brane,\nconsistent with the boundary condition. Consequently, we demonstrate a\nmechanism for generating light neutrino masses, similar to the Weinberg\noperator, by transmitting the information of $U(1)_X$ breakdown between the two\n3-branes. The scale of $U(1)_X$ breaking is estimated from neutrino data to be\naround $10^{15}$ GeV, leading to a QCD axion mass of approximately\n$2.5\\times10^{-9}$ eV. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the\nmodel yields results consistent with current experimental data on quarks and\nleptons, and it also provides predictions for neutrinos.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
