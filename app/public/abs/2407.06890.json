Then we construct a class of\nhomeomorphisms of the square $[-1, 1]^2$ which are $(\\omega, \\alpha,\nn)$-sensitive for any $n\\geq 2$ and have zero topological entropies. To\ninvestigate further the complexity of zero entropy homeomorphisms by using\nlimit sets, we analyze in depth the limit sets of square homeomorphisms by the\nboundary permeating technique. Specially, we prove that for any given set of\npoints $Y\\equiv\\{y_{n1}, y_{n2}:n\\in\\mathbb N\\}$ in $(-1, 1)^2$ which satisfies\nsome loosely technical conditions, and for any given family of pairwise\ndisjoint countable dense subsets $\\{W_n:n\\in\\mathbb N\\}$ of $(-1, 1)^2-Y$,\nthere is a zero entropy homeomorphism $f$ on the square $[-1, 1]^2$ such that\n$\\omega(x, f)=\\{y_{n1}\\}$ and $\\alpha(x, f)=\\{y_{n2}\\}$ for any $n$ and any\n$x\\in W_n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
