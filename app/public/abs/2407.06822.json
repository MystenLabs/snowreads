Univariate and joint\nradar and communication performance metrics are evaluated within three\ndifferent frameworks, namely the Stochastic Geometry (SG), Monte-Carlo (MC),\nand Ray-Tracing (RT) frameworks. The parameters of the system model are\nextracted from the RT simulations, and the metrics are compared to assess the\naccuracy of the SG framework. It is shown that the SG and MC system models are\nrelevant w.r.t. RT simulations for the evaluation of univariate communication\nand sensing metrics, but larger discrepancies are observed for the joint\nmetrics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
