It is manifestly inextendible as a Lorentzian manifold\nwith a twice differentiable metric. In this thesis we proof that it is even\ninextendible as a Lorentzian manifold with merely continuous metric, which is a\nstronger statement. We do so by adapting the proof of the $C^0$-inextendibility\nof the maximal analytically extended Schwarzschild spacetime established by Jan\nSbierski.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
