We call them {\\Lambda}-shiftable CBFs where {\\Lambda}\nstates the extent by which the CBF can be varied by adding a time-varying\nfunction. Moreover, we derive sufficient conditions under which a time-varying\nCBF can be obtained from a time-invariant one, and we propose a systematic\nconstruction method. Advantageous about our approach is that a\n{\\Lambda}-shiftable CBF, once constructed, can be reused for various control\nobjectives. In the end, we relate the class of {\\Lambda}-shiftable CBFs to\nControl Lyapunov Functions (CLF), and we illustrate the application of our\nresults with a relevant simulation example.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
