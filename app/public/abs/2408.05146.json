Existing work focuses on accuracy maximization under\nthis effect, but model deployment may have important unintended impacts,\nespecially in multiagent scenarios. In this work, we investigate performative\nprediction in a concrete game-theoretic setting where social welfare is an\nalternative objective to accuracy maximization. We explore a collective risk\ndilemma scenario where maximising accuracy can negatively impact social\nwelfare, when predicting collective behaviours. By assuming knowledge of a\nBayesian agent behavior model, we then show how to achieve better trade-offs\nand use them for mechanism design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
