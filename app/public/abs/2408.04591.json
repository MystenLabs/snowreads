In\nthis paper, we challenge a remaining assumption in this task: that all images\nshare the same domain. Specifically, we introduce a new task and method to\nhandle GCD when the unlabelled data also contains images from different domains\nto the labelled set. Our proposed `HiLo' networks extract High-level semantic\nand Low-level domain features, before minimizing the mutual information between\nthe representations. Our intuition is that the clusterings based on domain\ninformation and semantic information should be independent. We further extend\nour method with a specialized domain augmentation tailored for the GCD task, as\nwell as a curriculum learning approach. Finally, we construct a benchmark from\ncorrupted fine-grained datasets as well as a large-scale evaluation on\nDomainNet with real-world domain shifts, reimplementing a number of GCD\nbaselines in this setting. We demonstrate that HiLo outperforms SoTA category\ndiscovery models by a large margin on all evaluations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
