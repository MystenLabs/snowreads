In this work, we have revealed a contrasting behavior in the\nmagneto-thermal conductivity (MTC) between two Co-based honeycomb-lattice\nmagnets Co4M2O9 (M = Nb, Ta), despite their identical lattice structures and\nquite similar magnetism. Co4Ta2O9 exhibits enhanced MTC of about 550% at 9 T of\nan in-plane magnetic field, comparable to other honeycomb-magnets, while MTC\nfor Co4Nb2O9 reaches only ~30%. This marked difference is ascribed to distinct\nfeatures in the field-induced evolution of magnetic excitations that resonantly\nscatter phonons. This finding sheds light on implicit impacts of non-magnetic\nions on thermal transport, and hints at the potential for broad heat-transport\ntunability while preserving magnetism and lattice structures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
