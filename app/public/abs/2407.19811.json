This study presents\nsynthetic thermal videos generated by Generative Adversarial Networks\nintegrated into the pain recognition pipeline and evaluates their efficacy. A\nframework consisting of a Vision-MLP and a Transformer-based module is\nutilized, employing RGB and synthetic thermal videos in unimodal and multimodal\nsettings. Experiments conducted on facial videos from the BioVid database\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic thermal videos and underline the\npotential advantages of it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
