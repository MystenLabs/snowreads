The xc field, coupled to the\none-particle Green's function, is obtained through analytic analysis and\nnumerical extrapolation based on finite clusters. In the Kondo regime, the xc\nfield consists of a complex constant term and a main quasiparticle-like\noscillation term. The constant term represents the Hubbard side-band\ncontribution, containing a bath-induced broadening effect, while the\nquasiparticle-like term is related to the Kondo resonance peak at\nlow-temperature. We illustrate these features in terms of analytical and\nnumerical calculations for small and medium-size finite clusters, and in the\nthermodynamic limit. The results indicate that the xc field formalism provides\na good trade-off between accuracy and complexity in solving impurity problems.\nConsequently, it can significantly reduce the complexity of the many-body\nproblem faced by first-principles approaches to strongly correlated materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vSR-BFyex77lXsfE2WIqhNg0ZZcekH79g-ETV9UFxVk","pdfSize":"1350890"}
