Let $\\Theta \\subset \\Delta$ and $M =\nM_{\\Theta}$ be a standard Levi of a reductive group $G$ such that $a_{\\Theta}$\n$= a_M / a_G$. Let us denote $d$ the dimension of $a_{\\Theta}$, i.e the\ncardinal of $\\Delta - \\Theta$ and $\\Sigma_{\\Theta}$ the set of all non-trivial\nprojections of roots in $\\Sigma$. We obtain conditions on $\\Theta$ such that\n$\\Sigma_{\\Theta}$ contains a root system of rank $d$. When considering the case\nof $\\Sigma$ of type exceptional, we give a list of all exceptional root systems\nthat can occur in $\\Sigma_\\Theta$ and use it to prove the generalized\ninjectivity conjecture in most exceptional groups cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
