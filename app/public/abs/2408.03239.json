In contrast to these methods, we introduce the concept of\nimaginary-time Lindbladian evolution as an alternative framework. This new\napproach defines gapped quantum phases in open systems through the spectrum\nproperties of the imaginary-Liouville superoperator. We find that, in addition\nto all pure gapped ground states, the Gibbs state of a stabilizer Hamiltonian\nat any finite temperature can also be characterized by our scheme, demonstrated\nthrough explicit construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of this\nframework, we apply it to investigate the phase diagram for open systems with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\sigma} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\tau}$ symmetry, including\ncases with nontrivial average symmetry protected topological order or\nspontaneous symmetry breaking order. Our findings demonstrate universal\nproperties at quantum criticality, such as nonanalytic behaviors of\nsteady-state observables, divergence of correlation lengths, and closing of the\nimaginary-Liouville gap. These results advance our understanding of quantum\nphase transitions in open quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gfMXmaFHphRkeaY6-jXvUANztXZSwuoHQqKogbOVpLo","pdfSize":"1994403"}
