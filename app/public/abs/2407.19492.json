This paper\nproposes Heads Up eXperience (HUX), an AI system designed to bridge this gap,\nserving as a constant companion across the extended reality (XR) environments.\nBy tracking the user's eye gaze, analyzing the surrounding environment, and\ninterpreting verbal contexts, the system captures and enhances multi-modal\ndata, providing holistic context interpretation and memory storage in real-time\ntask specific situations. This comprehensive approach enables more natural,\nempathetic and intelligent interactions between the user and HUX AI, paving the\npath for human computer environment interaction. Intended for deployment in\nsmart glasses and extended reality headsets, HUX AI aims to become a personal\nand useful AI companion for daily life. By integrating digital assistance with\nenhanced physical world interactions, this technology has the potential to\nrevolutionize human-AI collaboration in both personal and professional spheres\npaving the way for the future of personal smart devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
