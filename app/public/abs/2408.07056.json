Jackson and Yoshimoto~[J. Graph Theory, 2024] conjectured\nthat every $r$-regular nonbipartite connected graph $G$ has a spanning even\ntree. They verified this conjecture for the case when $G$ has a $2$-factor. In\nthis paper, we prove that the conjecture holds when $r$ is odd, thereby\nresolving the only remaining unsolved case for this conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
