This paper explores PINNs for open-loop optimal control problems\n(OCPs) with incomplete information, such as unknown initial conditions and\nsparse boundary data. We derive optimality conditions from the Lagrangian\nmultipliers and use a neural network to predict the state, adjoint, and control\nvariables. In contrast with previous methods, our approach integrates these\nelements into a single neural network and addresses scenarios with consistently\nlimited data. Specifically, we address the study of partially unknown equations\nidentifying underlying parameters online by searching for the optimal solution.\nNumerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method even in\nscenarios characterized by a considerable lack of information.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
