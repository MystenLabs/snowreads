We\nintroduce spatial heterogeneity of resources into the Prisoner's Dilemma Game\nmodel to explore the co-evolution of individuals' strategies and environmental\nresources. The adequacy of resources significantly affects the survival\ncompetitiveness of surrounding individuals. Feedback between individuals'\nstrategies and the resources they can use leads to the dynamic of the\n\"oscillatory tragedy of the commons\". Our findings indicate that when the\ninfluence of individuals' strategies on the update rate of resources is\nsignificantly high, individuals can form sustained spatial clustered patterns.\nThese sustained patterns can directly trigger a transition in the system from\nthe persistent periodic oscillating state to an equilibrium state. These\nfindings align with observed phenomena in real ecosystems, where organisms\norganize their spatial structures to maintain system stability. We discuss\ncritical phenomena in detail, demonstrating that the aforementioned phase\ntransition is robust across various system parameters including: the strength\nof cooperators in restoring the environment, the initial distributions of\ncooperators, and noise.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
