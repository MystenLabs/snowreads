However, the opacity of AI systems\nraises concerns about essential characteristics needed in such sensitive\napplications, like transparency and trustworthiness. Our study addresses these\nconcerns by investigating a process for selecting the most adequate Explainable\nAI (XAI) methods to comply with the explanation requirements of key EU\nregulations in the context of smart bioelectronics for medical devices. The\nadopted methodology starts with categorising smart devices by their control\nmechanisms (open-loop, closed-loop, and semi-closed-loop systems) and delving\ninto their technology. Then, we analyse these regulations to define their\nexplainability requirements for the various devices and related goals.\nSimultaneously, we classify XAI methods by their explanatory objectives. This\nallows for matching legal explainability requirements with XAI explanatory\ngoals and determining the suitable XAI algorithms for achieving them. Our\nfindings provide a nuanced understanding of which XAI algorithms align better\nwith EU regulations for different types of medical devices. We demonstrate this\nthrough practical case studies on different neural implants, from chronic\ndisease management to advanced prosthetics. This study fills a crucial gap in\naligning XAI applications in bioelectronics with stringent provisions of EU\nregulations. It provides a practical framework for developers and researchers,\nensuring their AI innovations advance healthcare technology and adhere to legal\nand ethical standards.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
