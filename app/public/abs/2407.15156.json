The NPFC incorporates a finite range of spatial\nnonlocal interactions that can account for both repulsive and attractive\neffects. The specific form is data-driven and determined by a fitting to the\nmaterials structure factor, which can be much more accurate than the LPFC and\npreviously proposed fractional variant. In particular, it is able to match the\nexperimental data of the structure factor up to the second peak, an achievement\nnot possible with other PFC variants studied in the literature. Both LPFC and\nfractional PFC (FPFC) are also shown to be distinct scaling limits of the NPFC,\nwhich reflects the generality. The advantage of NPFC in retaining material\nproperties suggests that it may be more suitable for characterizing\nliquid-solid transition systems. Moreover, we study numerical discretizations\nusing Fourier spectral methods, which are shown to be convergent and\nasymptotically compatible, making them robust numerical discretizations across\ndifferent parameter ranges. Numerical experiments are given in the\ntwo-dimensional case to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NPFC in simulating\ncrystal structures and grain boundaries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
