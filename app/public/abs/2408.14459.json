We prove that these mapping classes are\ncharacterized by $p$-compact (resp., weakly $p$-compact and unconditionally\n$p$-compact) linear operators defined on a Banach predual space of\n$\\mathcal{H}^\\infty_v(U)$ by linearization. We show that\n$\\mathcal{H}^\\infty_{v\\mathcal{K}_{p}}$ (resp.,\n$\\mathcal{H}^\\infty_{v\\mathcal{K}_{wp}}$ and\n$\\mathcal{H}^\\infty_{v\\mathcal{K}_{up}}$) is a Banach ideal of weighted\nholomorphic mappings which is generated by composition with the ideal of\n$p$-compact (resp., weakly $p$-compact and unconditionally $p$-compact) linear\noperators and contains the Banach ideal of all right $p$-nuclear weighted\nholomorphic mappings. We also prove that these weighted holomorphic mappings\ncan be factorized through a quotient space of $l_{p^*}$, and\n$f\\in\\mathcal{H}^\\infty_{v\\mathcal{K}_{p}}(U,F)$ (resp.,\n$f\\in\\mathcal{H}^\\infty_{v\\mathcal{K}_{up}}(U,F))$ if and only if its\ntransposition $f^t$ is quasi $p$-nuclear (resp., quasi unconditionally\n$p$-nuclear).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LetOqgx0ntQJVTcDVS5inzut_5Iv_3N2q-elgOXvw14","pdfSize":"220003"}
