Here, we predict unconventional\nquantum optical behaviors of quantum emitters coupled to a non-Hermitian\ntopological bath, which is realized in a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic chain\nsubjected to nonlocal dissipation. In addition to the Hermitian-like chiral\nbound states in the middle line gap and skin-mode-like hidden bound states\ninside the point gap, we identify peculiar in-gap chiral and extended\nphoton-emitter dressed states. This is due to the competition of\ntopological-edge localization and non-Hermitian skin-mode localization in\ncombination with the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, when\ntwo emitters are coupled to the same bath, such in-gap dressed states can\nmediate the nonreciprocal long-range emitter-emitter interactions, with the\ninteraction range limited only by the dissipation of the bath. Our work opens\nthe door to further study rich quantum optical phenomena and exotic many-body\nphysics utilizing quantum emitters coupled to non-Hermitian topological baths.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
