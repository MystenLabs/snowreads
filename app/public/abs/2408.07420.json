However, reversing dynamo models are usually\nfound in regimes where the kinetic and magnetic energy is comparable, so that\ninertia is playing a significant role in the dynamics. In the Earth's core, the\nRossby number is very small, and the magnetic energy is much larger than the\nkinetic energy. Here we investigate dynamo models in the strong field regime,\nwhere magnetic forces have a significant effect on convection. In the core, the\nstrong field is achieved by having the magnetic Prandtl number Pm small, but\nthe Ekman number E extremely small. In simulations, very small E is not\npossible, but the strong field regime can be reached by increasing Pm. However,\nif Pm is raised while the fluid Prandtl number is fixed at unity, the most\ncommon choice, the Peclet number number becomes small, so that the linear terms\nin the heat (or composition) equation dominate, which is also far from\nEarth-like behaviour. Here we increase Pr and Pm together, so that nonlinearity\nis important in the heat equation and the dynamo is strong field. We find that\nEarth-like reversals are possible at numerically achievable parameter values,\nand the simulations have Earth-like magnetic fields away from the times at\nwhich it reverses. The magnetic energy is much greater than the kinetic energy\nexcept close to reversal times.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KQfT25LwwgcJRYwZEEOFNBK4W2ycsYRWtyLEoD2qrn8","pdfSize":"5015636"}
