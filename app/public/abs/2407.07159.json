Fake news content is primarily distributed\nthrough digital platforms, with websites dedicated to producing and\ndisseminating such content playing a pivotal role in this complex ecosystem.\nTherefore, these websites are of great interest to misinformation researchers.\nHowever, obtaining a comprehensive list of websites labeled as producers and/or\nspreaders of misinformation can be challenging, particularly in developing\ncountries. In this study, we propose a novel methodology for identifying\nwebsites responsible for creating and disseminating misinformation content,\nwhich are closely linked to users who share confirmed instances of fake news on\nsocial media. We validate our approach on Twitter by examining various\nexecution modes and contexts. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed methodology in identifying misinformation websites, which can aid in\ngaining a better understanding of this phenomenon and enabling competent\nentities to tackle the problem in various areas of society.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
