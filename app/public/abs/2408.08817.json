LTL-MT\nextends LTL_f by replacing atomic propositions with quantifier-free\nmulti-sorted first-order formulas interpreted over arbitrary theories. While\nstandard LTL_f is reduced to finite automata, we reduce LTL-MT to symbolic\ndata-word automata (SDWAs), whose transitions are guarded by constraints from\nunderlying theories. Both the satisfiability of LTL-MT and the emptiness of\nSDWAs are undecidable, but the latter can be reduced to a system of constrained\nHorn clauses, which are supported by efficient solvers and ongoing research\nefforts. We discuss multiple applications of our approach beyond\nsatisfiability, including model checking and runtime monitoring. Finally, a set\nof empirical experiments shows that our approach to satisfiability works at\nleast as well as a previous custom solution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Mf7VZ4lNQM60rbcjVJLP49evHBvfwXN8VhD2hNdtJYI","pdfSize":"254812"}
