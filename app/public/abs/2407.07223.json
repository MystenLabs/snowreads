We demonstrate that intelligent use of disorder in\nmetamaterials leads to distributed damage during failure, resulting in enhanced\nfracture toughness with minimal losses of strength. Toughness depends on the\nlevel of disorder, not a specific geometry, and the confined lattices studied\nexhibit a maximum toughness enhancement at an optimal level of disorder. A\nmechanics model that relates disorder to toughness without knowledge of the\ncrack path is presented. The model is verified through finite element\nsimulations and experiments utilizing photoelasticity to visualize damage\nduring failure. At the optimal level of disorder, the toughness is more than\n2.6x of an ordered lattice of equivalent density.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
