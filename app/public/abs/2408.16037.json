It is proposed to\nfully exploit the scientific potential of the continuous electron beam\naccelerator facility (CEBAF) 12 GeV energy upgrade at Jefferson Lab. Its\nconceptual design is mature, having passed multiple reviews and been validated\nby a successful pre-R\\&D phase. The envisioned scientific program consists of\nthree avenues of research, namely the 3D momentum imaging of the structure of\nthe nucleon, the origin of the proton mass through the gluonic gravitational\nform factors (GFFs), and the search of physics beyond the standard model of\nparticle physics. These avenues are complemented by a growing supplemental list\nof run group experiments that address a variety of important topics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zpwMwaYmrYiuxoax37HAG8kUf7ZK4BKHiRvqQ1C9QvI","pdfSize":"1175700"}
