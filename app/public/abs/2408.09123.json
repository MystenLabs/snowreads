This paper\nintroduces the Dynamic Neural Dowker Network (DNDN), a novel framework\nspecifically designed to approximate the results of dynamic Dowker filtration,\naiming to capture the high-order topological features of dynamic directed\ngraphs. Our approach creatively uses line graph transformations to produce both\nsource and sink line graphs, highlighting the shared neighbor structures that\nDowker complexes focus on. The DNDN incorporates a Source-Sink Line Graph\nNeural Network (SSLGNN) layer to effectively capture the neighborhood\nrelationships among dynamic edges. Additionally, we introduce an innovative\nduality edge fusion mechanism, ensuring that the results for both the sink and\nsource line graphs adhere to the duality principle intrinsic to Dowker\ncomplexes. Our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments on\nreal-world datasets, demonstrating DNDN's capability not only to effectively\napproximate dynamic Dowker filtration results but also to perform exceptionally\nin dynamic graph classification tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JhFfndlX-b2svGmmSiXp8g9jq9uSf3xKefDGYNhEEgM","pdfSize":"1127129"}
