A\ngeneral-relativistic violation of that inequality certifies change of\ncurvature, in the same sense as a quantum-mechanical violation of a Bell\ninequality certifies a source of entanglement. The inequality arises from a\nminimal generalization of the Bell setup. It represents a limit on the winning\nchance of a collaborative multi-agent game played on the M\\\"obius graph.
