The nonlinearities are of power type and\n$L^2$-subcritical, while the matching condition between the two planes\ngenerates two point interactions of different strengths on each plane, together\nwith a coupling condition between the two planes. We prove that ground states\nexist for every value of the mass and two different qualitative situations are\npossible depending on the matching condition: either ground states concentrate\non one of the plane only, or ground states distribute on both the planes and\nare positive, radially symmetric, decreasing and present a logarithmic\nsingularity at the origin of each plane. Moreover, we discuss how the mass\ndistributes on the two planes and compare the strengths of the logarithmic\nsingularities on the two planes when the parameters of the matching condition\nand the powers of the nonlinear terms vary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
