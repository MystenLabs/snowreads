It has become more prominent amongst a\nwider audience due to its multiple applications in science and industry. The\nconstant development of advanced programming and modeling techniques extends\nthe toolset for developers and users regularly. This paper demonstrates\ndifferent techniques to reuse logic program parts (multi-shot) by solving the\narcade game snake. This game is particularly interesting because a victory can\nbe assured by solving the underlying NP-hard problem of Hamiltonian Cycles. We\nwill demonstrate five hands-on implementations in clingo and compare their\nperformance in an empirical evaluation. In addition, our implementation\nutilizes clingraph to generate a simple yet informative image representation of\nthe game's progress.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
