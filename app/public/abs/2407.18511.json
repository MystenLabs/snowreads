It is intended to facilitate the simultaneous\nusage of multiresolution processing and boundary reduction, primarily for\nalgorithms in computational dynamics and computational control theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
