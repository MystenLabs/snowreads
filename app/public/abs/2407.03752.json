In particular, we prove that\n$\\|u(t)\\|_{\\dot{B}^{\\theta}_{p,1}({\\mathop{\\mathbb R\\kern\n0pt}\\nolimits}^2)}={\\mathcal O} (t^{\\frac1p-\\frac32-\\frac{\\theta}2})$ as\n$t\\rightarrow\\infty$ for any $p\\in[2,\\infty[,~\\theta\\in [0,2]$ if initially\n$\\rho_0u_0\\in \\dot{B}^{-2}_{2,\\infty}({\\mathop{\\mathbb R\\kern\n0pt}\\nolimits}^2)$. This is optimal even for the classical homogeneous\nNavier-Stokes equations. Different with Schonbek and Wiegner's Fourier\nsplitting device, our method here seems more direct, and can adapt to many\nother equations as well. Moreover, our method allows us to work in the\n$L^p$-based spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
