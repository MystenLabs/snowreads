In practice, accurate detection of a change-point within a sequence\nof responses that exhibit a functional relationship with multiple explanatory\nvariables is an important goal for effectively monitoring such profiles. We\npresent a nonparametric method utilizing ensembles of regression trees and\nrandom forests to model the functional relationship along with associated\nKolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to monitor profile behavior. Through a simulation\nstudy considering multiple factors, we demonstrate that our method offers\nstrong performance and competitive detection capability when compared to\nexisting methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
