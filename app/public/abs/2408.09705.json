Graph unlearning aims to\nquickly eliminate the effects of specific data on graph neural networks (GNNs).\nHowever, most existing deterministic graph unlearning frameworks follow a\nbalanced partition-submodel training-aggregation paradigm, resulting in a lack\nof structural information between subgraph neighborhoods and redundant\nunlearning parameter calculations. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nGraph Structure Mapping Unlearning paradigm (GSMU) and a novel method based on\nit named Community-centric Graph Eraser (CGE). CGE maps community subgraphs to\nnodes, thereby enabling the reconstruction of a node-level unlearning operation\nwithin a reduced mapped graph. CGE makes the exponential reduction of both the\namount of training data and the number of unlearning parameters. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on five real-world datasets and three widely used GNN\nbackbones have verified the high performance and efficiency of our CGE method,\nhighlighting its potential in the field of graph unlearning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"pOcHPVP_qOkZd2Q6zK1M25bkDyT2TvPItB1YyooIg1M","pdfSize":"470126"}
