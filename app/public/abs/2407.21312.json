The notion of\nwrapping property was introduced by the second author for studying related\nscalar curvature rigidity problems on spheres. For example, any closed subset\nof $\\mathbb S^n$ contained in a hemisphere and any finite subset of $\\mathbb\nS^n$ satisfy the wrapping property. The same techniques also apply to prove an\nanalogous scalar rigidity result for $L^\\infty$ metrics on tori that are smooth\naway from certain subsets of codimension at least $\\frac{n}{2}+1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"woaLrEAeLKbv8yoqBLprcpABY6bor7x3dkv3l7Qu8QU","pdfSize":"283898","objectId":"0xfb523082500c059409e5482045239f22938346de54487ccd40941f1d97d7eae5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
