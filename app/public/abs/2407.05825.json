Besides the\nwell known Weyl and Dirac semimetals, some materials posses nodes with linear\ncrossing of multiple bands. Low energy excitations around these nodes are\ncalled multifold fermions and can be described by $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}$\nHamiltonian with pseudospin greater than 1/2. In the present work we\ninvestigated the contribution of these states into orbital magnetic\nsusceptibility $\\chi$. We have found that, similarly to Weyl semimetals, the\ndependence of susceptibility on chemical potential $\\mu$ shows an extremum when\n$\\mu$ is close to the band crossing energy. In the case of half-integer\npseudospin this extremum is a minumum and the susceptibility is negative\n(diamagnetic). While in the case of integer pseudospin the susceptibility is\nlarge and positive (paramagnetic) due to the contribution of dispersionless\nband. This leads also to nonmonotonic temperature dependence of $\\chi$. As an\nexample, we considered the case of cobalt monosilicide where the states near\nthe $\\Gamma$ point correspond to pseudospin 1 without spin-orbital interaction,\nand to a combination of Weyl node and pseudospin-3/2 states with the account of\nspin-orbit coupling.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
