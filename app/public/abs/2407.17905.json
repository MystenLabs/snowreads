Most approaches explore\nspatio-temporal information from LiDAR sequences to predict moving objects in\nthe current frame. However, they often focus on transferring temporal cues in a\nsingle inference and regard every prediction as independent of others. This may\ncause inconsistent segmentation results for the same object in different\nframes. To overcome this issue, we propose a streaming network with a memory\nmechanism, called StreamMOS, to build the association of features and\npredictions among multiple inferences. Specifically, we utilize a short-term\nmemory to convey historical features, which can be regarded as spatial prior of\nmoving objects and adopted to enhance current inference by temporal fusion.\nMeanwhile, we build a long-term memory to store previous predictions and\nexploit them to refine the present forecast at voxel and instance levels\nthrough voting. Besides, we present multi-view encoder with cascade projection\nand asymmetric convolution to extract motion feature of objects in different\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments validate that our algorithm gets\ncompetitive performance on SemanticKITTI and Sipailou Campus datasets.
