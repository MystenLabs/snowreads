We establish a rigorous\ngeneralization of the Fourier diffraction theorem in arbitrary dimension,\ngiving a precise relation in the Fourier domain between measurements of the\nscattered wave and reconstructions of the scattering potential. With this\ntheorem at hand, Fourier coverages for different experimental setups are\ninvestigated taking into account parameters such as object orientation,\ndirection of incidence and frequency of illumination. Allowing for simultaneous\nand discontinuous variation of these parameters, a general filtered\nbackpropagation formula is derived resulting in an explicit approximation of\nthe scattering potential for a large class of experimental setups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
