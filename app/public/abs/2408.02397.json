For an ergodic hyperbolic measure of a smooth system, we show\nthat the $r$-neutralized local entropy equals the Brin-Katok local entropy plus\n$r$ times the pointwise dimension of the measure. We further establish the\nexistence of ergodic measures that maximize the $r$-neutralized entropy for\ncertain hyperbolic systems. Moreover, we construct a uniformly hyperbolic\nsystem, for which such measures are not unique. Finally, we present some\nrigidity results related to these ergodic measures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
