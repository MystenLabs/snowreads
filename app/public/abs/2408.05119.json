Despite\nimpressive progress in live imaging and quantitative physical descriptions of\ncytoskeletal network dynamics, the connection between processes at molecular\nscales and cell-scale spatio-temporal patterns is still unclear. Here we review\nstudies reporting acto-myosin clusters of micrometer size and with lifetimes of\nseveral minutes in a large number of organisms ranging from fission yeast to\nhumans. Such structures have also been found in reconstituted systems in vitro\nand in theoretical analysis of cytoskeletal dynamics. We propose that tracking\nthese clusters can serve as a simple readout for characterising living matter.\nSpatio-temporal patterns of clusters could serve as determinants of\nmorphogenetic processes that play similar roles in diverse organisms.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks","Quantitative Biology/Subcellular Processes"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qLx27N7tSc2SUv6Dt0_6QwKuzXXHJSunhFi7ptffORw","pdfSize":"3129389"}
