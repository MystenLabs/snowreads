Using the numerical renormalization group\nmethod, we map out the evolution of the ground state across a wide parameter\nspace of level detunings, size of the superconducting gap, lead couplings, and\ninter-dot coupling strength. The intricate phase diagrams feature singlet,\ndoublet, and a relatively uncommon triplet ground states, with the latter being\na distinct signature of strong lead-mediated interactions between the quantum\ndots. We benchmark the applicability of simplified effective models, including\nthe atomic limit and zero-bandwidth approximations, in capturing the complex\nbehavior of this parallel configuration. Our analysis reveals severe\nlimitations of these models, underscoring the necessity for maximal caution\nwhen extrapolating beyond their tested validity. In particular, all effective\nmodels except for the extended version of the zero-bandwidth approximation\nfailed in reproducing the triplet ground state and made several false\npredictions. These findings provide crucial insights for interpreting\nexperimental observations and designing superconducting devices based on\nquantum-dot architectures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
