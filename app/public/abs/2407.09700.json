As a core functionality, this provides a GPU\nimplementation of two-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) for contracted basis\nsets comprising up to g functions using Rys quadrature. As an illustration of\nhow this can accelerate a quantum chemistry workflow, we describe how to use\nthe ERIs efficiently in the integral-direct Hartree-Fock Fock build and nuclear\ngradient construction. Benchmark calculations show a significant speedup of two\norders of magnitude with respect to the multi-threaded CPU Hartree-Fock code of\nPySCF, and performance comparable to other GPU-accelerated quantum chemical\npackages including GAMESS and QUICK on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
