While cone-beam computed tomography\n(CBCT) is the gold standard for evaluating FD, it comes with limitations such\nas radiation exposure, limited accessibility, and higher cost compared to\nintraoral images. In intraoral images, dentists face challenges in the\ndifferential diagnosis of FD. This paper presents a novel and clinically\nsignificant application of FD detection solely from intraoral images. To\nachieve this, we propose FD-SOS, a novel open-set object detector for FD\ndetection from intraoral images. FD-SOS has two novel components: conditional\ncontrastive denoising (CCDN) and teeth-specific matching assignment (TMA).\nThese modules enable FD-SOS to effectively leverage external dental semantics.\nExperimental results showed that our method outperformed existing detection\nmethods and surpassed dental professionals by 35% recall under the same level\nof precision.
