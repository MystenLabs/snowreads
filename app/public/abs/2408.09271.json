Matching forward the\ngeneralized synthetic control method, our instrumented principal component\nanalysis method instruments factor loadings with predictive covariates rather\nthan including them as regressors. These instrumented factor loadings exhibit\ntime-varying dynamics, offering a better economic interpretation. Covariates\nare instrumented through a transformation matrix, $\\Gamma$, when we have a\nlarge number of covariates it can be easily reduced in accordance with a small\nnumber of latent factors helping us to effectively handle high-dimensional\ndatasets and making the model parsimonious. Moreover, the novel way of handling\ncovariates is less exposed to model misspecification and achieved better\nprediction accuracy. Our simulations show that this method is less biased in\nthe presence of unobserved covariates compared to other mainstream approaches.\nIn the empirical application, we use the proposed method to evaluate the effect\nof Brexit on foreign direct investment to the UK.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
