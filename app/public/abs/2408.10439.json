Posters can\nbe difficult to create, and the story on a poster is not always clear. Using a\ncase-study approach we propose three important aspects: the poster should have\na clear focus (especially a hero visualisation), envisioning its use helps to\ndrive the important aspects, and third the essence (its fundamental concept and\nguiding idea) must be clear. We will use case studies that have focused on the\nuse of the Five Design-Sheet method (FdS) as a way to sketch and plan a\nvisualisation, before successfully implementing and creating the visual poster.\nThe case studies serve as a practical illustration of the workflow, offering a\nmeans to explain the three key processes involved: (1) comprehending the data,\n(2) employing a design study with the FdS (Five Design-Sheet), (3) crafting,\nevaluating and refining the visualisation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zjBoUnP8-QvGnS3awhx03eNWd8tRgm_e4GLq3cYLH3k","pdfSize":"1609595"}
