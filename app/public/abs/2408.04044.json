These authors posed the problem of proving that there\nexist sequences $\\{\\gamma_t\\}_{t\\in\\Bbb N}$ of $t$-design curves on $S^d$ of\nasymptotically optimal length $\\ell(\\gamma_t)=\\Theta(t^{d-1})$ as $t\\to\\infty$\nand solved this problem for $d=2$. This work solves the problem for $d=3$ by\nproving existence of a constant $\\mathcal C>0$ such that for any $C>\\mathcal C$\nand $t\\in\\Bbb N_+$, there exists a $t$-design curve with no self-intersections\non $S^3$ of length $Ct^2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
