Current multilateral\nspace exploration paradigms, however, are divided between the Artemis and the\nRoscosmos-CNSA programs to return to the moon and establish permanent human\nsettlements. As space agencies work to expand human presence in space, economic\nresource consolidation in pursuit of technologically ambitious space\nexpeditions is the most sensible path to accomplish SDG17. This paper compiles\na budget dataset for the top five federally-funded space agencies: CNSA, ESA,\nJAXA, NASA, and Roscosmos. Using time-series econometric anslysis methods in\nSTATA, this work analyzes each agency's economic contributions toward space\nexploration. The dataset results are used to propose a multinational space\nmission, Vela, for the development of an orbiting space station around Mars in\nthe late 2030s. Distribution of economic resources and technological\ncapabilities by the respective space programs are proposed to ensure\nprogrammatic redundancy and increase the odds of success on the given timeline.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
