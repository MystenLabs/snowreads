In this paper, we show that if\nsome arc in a Walecki tournament on at least $7$ vertices lies in exactly one\ndirected triangle, then there is a vertex of the tournament (the vertex\ntypically labelled $*$ in the decomposition) that is fixed under every\nautomorphism of the tournament. Furthermore, any isomorphism between such\nWalecki tournaments maps the vertex labelled $*$ in one to the vertex labelled\n$*$ in the other.\n  We also show that among Walecki tournaments with a signature of even length\n$2k$, of the $2^{2k}$ possible signatures, at least $2^k$ produce tournaments\nthat have an arc that lies in a unique directed triangle (and therefore to\nwhich our result applies).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
