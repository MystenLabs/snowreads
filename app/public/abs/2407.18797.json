In particular, we\nallow ourselves to ``hear\" the local Weyl counting function at each point on\nthe manifold and ask if this is enough to uniquely recover the Riemannian\nmetric. This is physically equivalent to asking whether one can determine the\nshape of a drum if one is allowed to knock at any place on the drum. We show\nthat the answer to this question is ``yes\" provided the Laplace-Beltrami\nspectrum of the drum is simple. We also provide a counterexample illustrating\nwhy this hypothesis is necessary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
