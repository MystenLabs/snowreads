Current\nassessment methods, heavily reliant on immunohistochemistry (IHC), face\nchallenges in tumor margin delineation and are affected by tissue preservation\nconditions. In contrast, we propose a Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)\nstaining-based approach, underpinned by an advanced lymphocyte segmentation\nmodel trained on a public dataset for the precise detection of CD3+ and CD20+\nlymphocytes. In our colorectal cancer study, we demonstrate that our H&E-based\nmethod offers a compelling alternative to traditional IHC, achieving comparable\nresults in many cases. Our method's validity is further explored through a\nTuring test, involving blinded assessments by a pathologist of anonymized\ncurves from H&E and IHC slides. This approach invites the medical community to\nconsider Turing tests as a standard for evaluating medical applications\ninvolving expert human evaluation, thereby opening new avenues for enhancing\ncancer management and immunotherapy planning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
