Here, we apply a method originally\ndesigned to look for rapidly spinning-down neutron stars, the generalized\nfrequency-Hough transform, to search for planetary-mass primordial black holes\nusing data from the first half of the third observing run of advanced LIGO. In\nthis companion paper to arXiv:2402.19468, in which the main results of our\nsearch are presented, we delve into the details of the search methodology, the\nchoices we have made regarding the parameter space to explore, the follow-up\nprocedure we use to confirm or reject possible candidates returned in our\nsearch, and a comparison of our analytic procedure of generating upper limits\nto those obtained through injections.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
