The vortex\nsolitons, composed by three waves ($\\omega_{1,2,3}$) propagating through the\nlattices, exhibit a four-spotted discrete type, which gives rise to four\ndistinct modes: zero-vorticity, vortex, anti-vortex, and quadrupole. The\ncomposite vortex solitons result from combinations of these modes and lead to\nfour cases: vortex doubling, hidden vortices, vortex up-conversion, and\nanti-vortex up-conversion. Our findings indicate that all solitons can\npropagate stably through the crystals for 10 centimeters; however, only the\nvortex-doubling case remains stable over longer distances. This work enhances\nthe understanding of vortex beam manipulation within 3D QPM-PhCs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
