In this article, we\npresent the main mechanisms of Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput\n(L4S). Subsequently, we investigate the support and challenges of L4S\ntechnology in the latest 3GPP 5G-Advanced Release 18 (R18) standard. Our case\nstudy, using a prototype system for a real-time communication (RTC)\napplication, demonstrates the superiority of L4S technology. The experimental\nresults show that, compared with the GCC algorithm, the proposed L4S-GCC\nalgorithm can reduce the stalling rate by 1.51%-2.80% and increase the\nbandwidth utilization by 11.4%-31.4%. The results emphasize the immense\npotential of L4S technology in enhancing transmission performance in\ntime-critical applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
