In our example, a given holographic state has two\nsimple, semiclassical descriptions, one with a closed universe, constructed\nusing the gravitational path integral, and one without a closed universe,\nconstructed using the extrapolate dictionary. This highlights an ambiguity in\nthe AdS/CFT dictionary. We propose various options for resolving this tension\nalthough none are perfectly satisfactory. We also discuss what this implies for\nthe black hole interior and the gravitational path integral.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zUhq1hTlxZM3vTmMPGaK-zmCsDbSoMuAvNakAwMBKlI","pdfSize":"451929","txDigest":"GSrcNd87AbHhxzYkoLcWi457ZpY6gymVN3gYnSz8133k","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
