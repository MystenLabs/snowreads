For large classes of piecewise-continuous\nfunctions, we show that these estimators are consistent and achieve nearly\nminimax rates. These classes involve geometric control over the set of\ndiscontinuities of the density, and differ from commonly considered function\nclasses in mode(s) inference. Interestingly, we do not suppose regularity or\neven continuity in any neighborhood of the modes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
