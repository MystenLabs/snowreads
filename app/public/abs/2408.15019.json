First, a novel multivariable fixed-time disturbance\nobserver is proposed to estimate the lumped disturbances. The bi-limit\nhomogeneity and Lyapunov techniques are employed to ensure the convergence of\nestimation error within a fixed convergence time, independent of the initial\nestimation error. Then, an observerbased model predictive control strategy is\nformulated to achieve robust trajectory tracking of quadrotor, attenuating the\nlumped disturbances and model uncertainties. Finally, simulations and\nreal-world experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
