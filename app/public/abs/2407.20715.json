For this kind of knot we\nintroduce an invariant $\\Delta$ that is an analogue of Turaev comultiplication\nfor knots in a thickened orientable surface. As its classical prototype,\n$\\Delta$ takes value in a polynomial algebra generated by homotopy classes of\nnon-contractible loops on $\\Sigma$, however, as a ground ring we use some\nsubring of $\\mathbb{C}$ instead of $\\mathbb{Z}$. Then we define a few homotopy,\nhomology and polynomial invariants, which are consequences of $\\Delta$,\nincluding an analogue of the affine index polynomial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
