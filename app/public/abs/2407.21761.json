We devise minimal quantum circuits\nto demonstrate the non-Abelian nature of the doubled Fibonacci topological\norder, as realized in the Levin-Wen string net model. Our circuits effectively\ninitialize the ground state, create excitations, twist and braid them, all in\nthe smallest lattices possible. We further design methods to determine the\nfusion amplitudes and braiding phases of multiple excitations by carrying out a\nsingle qubit measurement. We show that the fusion channels of the doubled\nFibonacci model can be detected using only three qubits, twisting phases can be\nmeasured using five, and braiding can be demonstrated using nine qubits. These\ndesigns provide the simplest possible settings for demonstrating the properties\nof Fibonacci anyons and can be used as realistic blueprints for implementation\non many modern quantum architectures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
