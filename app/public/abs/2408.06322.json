We present a self-consistent approach integrating\ncomputation and experiment to understand and explore single-phase rock salt\nhigh-entropy oxides. By leveraging a machine-learning interatomic potential, we\nrapidly and accurately map high-entropy composition space using our two\ndescriptors: bond length distribution and mixing enthalpy. The single-phase\nstabilities for all experimentally stabilized rock salt compositions are\ncorrectly resolved, with dozens more compositions awaiting discovery.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
