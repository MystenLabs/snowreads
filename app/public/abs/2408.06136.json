The model is validated against an\nensemble of immobilized, non-interacting, randomly oriented uniaxial particles\n(solid superparamagnet) and a classical dilute (non-interacting) ferrofluid for\ndifferent combinations of anisotropy strength and magnetic field/moment\ncoupling, at a fixed temperature. We compare analytical and simulation results\nto quantify the viability of the tSW model in reproducing the equilibrium and\ndynamic properties of magnetic soft matter systems. We show that if the\nanisotropy of a particle is more than four-five times higher than the thermal\nfluctuations, tSW is applicable and efficient. It provides a valuable insight\ninto the interplay between internal magnetization degrees of freedom and\nBrowninan rotation that is often neglected in the fixed point-dipole\nrepresentation-based magnetic soft matter theoretical investigations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
