After defining that operation, we\ngeneralize a classical result by Cartier concerning Frobenius descent, that is,\nwe establish a bijective correspondence (including the version using\nhigher-level $\\mathcal{D}$-modules) between parabolic flat bundles with\nvanishing $p$-curvature on a pointed curve and parabolic bundles on its\nFrobenius twist. This correspondence gives a description of maximally\nFrobenius-destabilized parabolic bundles in terms of dormant opers admitting\nlogarithmic poles. As an application of that description together with a\nprevious result in the enumerative geometry of dormant opers, we obtain an\nexplicit formula for computing the number of such parabolic bundles of rank $2$\nunder certain assumptions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"m4XHWzurcZR57M9Eu1tzHaOLHtn8qTHNLTPY_iY1fms","pdfSize":"383123"}
