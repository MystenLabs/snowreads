A Sezawa mode, excited by a vertical electric field, exploits the\nd31 piezoelectric coefficient to propagate a longitudinal acoustic wave in the\nAlScN. The resonant frequency is determined via the pitch in the interdigitated\ntransducer (IDT) defined by Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. The resonant\nmode travels in the piezoelectric layer without leaking in the substrate thanks\nto the mismatch in acoustic phase velocities between the piezoelectric and\nsubstrate materials. We show the impact of the piezoelectric and IDT layers'\nthickness on the two found modes. Importantly, we show how thin piezoelectric\nand electrode layers effectively suppress the Rayleigh mode. While some\nchallenges in the deposition of AlScN remain towards a large coupling\ncoefficient k_eff^2, We show how wave confinement in the IDT obtains a good\nquality factor. We also show how modifying the IDT reflectivity allows us to\nengineer a stopband to prevent unwanted modes from being excited between\nresonance and antiresonance frequencies. Finally, we validate the simulation\nwith fabricated and measured devices and present possible improvements to this\nresonator architecture.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
