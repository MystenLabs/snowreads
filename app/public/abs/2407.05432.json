Assuming that the datum $f$ belongs to a suitable\nLebesgue-Besov parabolic space when $p>2$ and that $f\\in\nL_{loc}^{2}(\\Omega_{T})$ if $p=2$, we prove the Sobolev spatial regularity of a\nnovel nonlinear function of the spatial gradient of the weak solutions. This\nresult, in turn, implies the existence of the weak time derivative for the\nsolutions of the evolutionary $p$-Poisson equation. The main novelty here is\nthat $f$ only has a Besov or Lebesgue spatial regularity, unlike the previous\nwork [6], where $f$ was assumed to possess a Sobolev spatial regularity of\ninteger order. We emphasize that the results obtained here can be considered,\non the one hand, as the parabolic analog of some elliptic results established\nin [5], and on the other hand as the extension to a strongly degenerate setting\nof some known results for less degenerate parabolic equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
