Based on the AI-Gadget Kit we developed, this paper explores\nhow to integrate LLM-driven agents within tabletop games to enable SUIs to\nexecute complex interaction tasks. After defining the design space of this kit,\nwe elucidate the method for designing agents that can extend the meta-actions\nof SUIs to complex motion planning. Furthermore, we introduce an add-on prompt\nmethod that simplifies the design process for four interaction behaviors and\nfour interaction relationships in tabletop games. Lastly, we present several\napplication scenarios that illustrate the potential of AI-Gadget Kit to\nconstruct personalized interaction in SUI tabletop games. We expect to use our\nwork as a case study to inspire research on multi-agent-driven SUI for other\nscenarios with complex interaction tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
