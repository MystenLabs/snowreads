As there were\nconcerns that this extension might violate no-cloning theorem for example for\nattacks on quantum cryptographic protocols like BB84, here we extend the\noriginal proof to show this theorem still holds for 2WQC and postselection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
