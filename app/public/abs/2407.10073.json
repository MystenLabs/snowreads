Both functional and\nstationary complexity bounds for the two methods are established in terms of\nthe unknown strong convexity parameter. To the best of our knowledge, the two\nproposed methods are the first universal methods for solving hybrid strongly\nconvex composite optimization problems that do not rely on any restart scheme\nnor require the knowledge of the optimal value.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KYf03Bcaf-FXiFo4P_Vco3Dqd0Rsgc0ZaMpRnkHpBgU","pdfSize":"401557"}
