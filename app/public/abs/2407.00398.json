Stable Gabor phase retrieval for multivariate\nfunctions. Journal of the European Mathematical Society (2021)] the\ninstabilities of Gabor phase retrieval problem, i.e. reconstructing $ f\\in\nL^2(\\mathbb{R})$ from its spectrogram $|\\mathcal{V}_g f|$ where $$\\mathcal{V}_g\nf(x,\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(t)\\overline{g(t-x)}e^{-2\\pi i \\xi\nt}\\,\\mbox{d}t,$$ have been classified in terms of the connectivity of the\nmeasurements. These findings were however crucially restricted to the case\nwhere the window $g(t)=e^{-\\pi t^2}$ is Gaussian. In this work we establish a\ncorresponding result for a number of other window functions including the\none-sided exponential $g(t)=e^{-t}\\mathbb{1}_{[0,\\infty)}(t)$ and\n$g(t)=\\exp(t-e^t)$. As a by-product we establish a modified version of\nPoincar\\'e's inequality which can be applied to non-differentiable functions\nand may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
