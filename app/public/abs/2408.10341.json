This effect\nis crucial for finding and characterising planets beyond our Solar System,\nknown as exoplanets, as these planets are often studied when crossing in front\nof their host stars. As such, limb darkening is directly linked to the\nexoplanet signals. Limb darkening is typically modelled by one of various\nfunctional forms, as outlined in Claret (2000) and Sing (2010), and the\ncoefficients of these functions is what ExoTiC-LD is designed to compute. A\nwide variety of functional forms are supported, including those benchmarked by\nEspinoza & Jord\\'an (2016) as well as reparameterisations suggested by Kipping\n(2013).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
