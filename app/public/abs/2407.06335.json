In particular, we show\nthat, as time $t$ goes to infinity at fixed $L$, the large deviation function\nof $U$ approaches a universal form when expressed in terms of the energy\ncontent of the interval $|x|<L$ at time $t$. A key part of the solution is the\ndetermination of the most likely configuration of the energy density at time\n$t$, conditional on $U$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
