This extension\nenhances the representation of scenes with multiple spectra, providing insights\ninto the underlying materials and segmentation. We introduce an improved\nphysically-based rendering approach for Gaussian splats, estimating reflectance\nand lights per spectra, thereby enhancing accuracy and realism. In a\ncomprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our approach with respect to other recent\nlearning-based spectral scene representation approaches (i.e., XNeRF and\nSpectralNeRF) as well as other non-spectral state-of-the-art learning-based\napproaches. Our work also demonstrates the potential of spectral scene\nunderstanding for precise scene editing techniques like style transfer,\ninpainting, and removal. Thereby, our contributions address challenges in\nmulti-spectral scene representation, rendering, and editing, offering new\npossibilities for diverse applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QxOo5jQoSubtElzJ6FU0d9M7Lc1CLJgO4ugt6U3TP9s","pdfSize":"1443820"}
