We apply this to constraints on symplectic quasi-states. Quasi-states\nare a certain class of not necessarily linear functionals on the algebra of\ncontinuous functions of a compact space. When the space is a symplectic\nmanifold, a more restrictive subclass of symplectic quasi-states was introduced\nby Entov--Polterovich. We use our embedding result to prove that a certain\n`soft' construction of quasi-states, which is due to Aarnes, cannot yield\nnonlinear symplectic quasi-states in dimension at least four.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
