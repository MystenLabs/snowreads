Unlike previous artificial intelligence (AI) methods, LLMs can\ncapture the nuanced meanings of multi-word expressions. We systematically\nevaluated ChatGPT-4o's ability to predict concreteness, valence and arousal. In\nStudy 1, ChatGPT-4o showed strong correlations with human concreteness ratings\n(r = .8) for multi-word expressions. In Study 2, these findings were repeated\nfor valence and arousal ratings of individual words, matching or outperforming\nprevious AI models. Study 3 extended the prevalence and arousal analysis to\nmulti-word expressions and showed promising results despite the lack of\nlarge-scale human benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs\nfor generating valuable psycholinguistic data related to multiword expressions.\nTo help researchers with stimulus selection, we provide datasets with AI norms\nof concreteness, valence and arousal for 126,397 English single words and\n63,680 multi-word expressions\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"poEnqwWpXNC5yFcMjJhzIfvfA7FDDbQqZ9Wf-qsyxlU","pdfSize":"834823"}
