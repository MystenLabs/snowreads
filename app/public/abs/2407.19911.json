Since the state space is infinite, shields are\ntypically computed over a finite-state abstraction, with the most common\nabstraction being a rectangular grid. However, for many systems, such a grid\ndoes not align well with the safety property or the system dynamics. That is\nwhy a coarse grid is rarely sufficient, but a fine grid is typically\ncomputationally infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we show that appropriate\nstate-space transformations can still allow to use a coarse grid at almost no\ncomputational overhead. We demonstrate in three case studies that our\ntransformation-based synthesis outperforms a standard synthesis by several\norders of magnitude. In the first two case studies, we use domain knowledge to\nselect a suitable transformation. In the third case study, we instead report on\nresults in engineering a transformation without domain knowledge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
