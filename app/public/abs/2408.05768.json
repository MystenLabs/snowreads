Here, we propose for the first time that electron spin\npolarization can be realized efficiently via collective beam-target\ninteractions. When a relativistic unpolarized electron beam is incident onto\nthe surface of a solid target with a grazing angle, strong magnetic fields are\ninduced at the target surface due to the formation of a high reflux of target\nelectrons. This results in violent beam self-focusing and corresponding beam\ndensity increase via magnetic pinching. The pinched dense beam in turn further\nenhances the magnetic fields to the level of a few Giga-Gauss, which is high\nenough to trigger strong synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons.\nDuring the interaction, electron spin polarization develops along the magnetic\nfield direction, which is achieved via radiative spin flips in the quantum\nradiation-dominated regime. As a consequence, the incident electron beam can be\neffectively polarized via the spin-dependent radiation reaction, for example,\nthe mean polarization of electrons with energy less than 2 GeV can reach above\n50% for an initial 5GeV beam. This provides a robust way for the development of\npolarized electron sources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
