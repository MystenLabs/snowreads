The\nfocus is on the scenario where both the nonlinear dynamics and stage cost\nfunctions are unknown, while only control penalty function and constraints are\nprovided. Leveraging the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we\nintroduce novel kernel mean embeddings (KMEs) to identify the Markov transition\noperators associated with controlled diffusion processes. The KME learning\napproach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions. Thus, unlike traditional dynamic\nprogramming methods, our approach exploits the ``kernel trick'' to break the\ncurse of dimensionality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through\nnumerical examples, highlighting its ability to solve a large class of\nnonlinear optimal control problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
