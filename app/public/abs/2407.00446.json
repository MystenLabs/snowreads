We first define the tasks and discuss\nhow these tasks are represented and annotated in two widely used pedestrian\ndatasets, JAAD and PIE. We then propose a new benchmark based on these\ndefinitions, available annotations, and three new classes of metrics, each\ndesigned to assess different aspects of the model performance.\n  We apply the new evaluation approach to examine four SOTA prediction models\non each task and compare their performance w.r.t. metrics and input modalities.\nIn particular, we analyze the differences between intention estimation and\naction prediction tasks by considering various scenarios and contextual\nfactors. Lastly, we examine model agreement across these two tasks to show\ntheir complementary role. The proposed benchmark reveals new facts about the\nrole of different data modalities, the tasks, and relevant data properties. We\nconclude by elaborating on our findings and proposing future research\ndirections.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
