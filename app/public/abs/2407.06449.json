Experimental\nobservations suggest an aeroacoustic feedback loop to be the driving mechanism\nof oscillations. An analytical aeroacoustic model which predicts the\nexperimentally observed frequencies and explains the universal behavior is\npresented here. The model provides physical insights and informs of flow\nregimes where deviations from universal behavior are to be expected.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
