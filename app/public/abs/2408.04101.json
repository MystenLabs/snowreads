As a\nconsequence, we obtain, amongst other results, an exact formula for the\nprobability density function of the noncentral chi-square difference\ndistribution, a Stein characterisation of the noncentral chi-square difference\ndistribution, a simple formula for the moments of the sum of independent copies\nof the product of correlated normal random variables and an exact formula for\nthe probability that such a random variable is negative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
