Specifically, we consider three settings,\naccording to which the forbidden substructures are $3$-cycles, $4$-cycles or\nboth of them (i.e., girth $\\ge 5$). For all three settings and all\n$k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, we present lower and upper bounds on the maximum number of\nedges in any $k$-planar graph on $n$ vertices. Our bounds are of the form\n$c\\,n$, for some explicit constant $c$ that depends on $k$ and on the setting.\nFor general $k \\geq 4$ our bounds are of the form $c\\sqrt{k}n$, for some\nexplicit constant $c$. These results are obtained by leveraging different\ntechniques, such as the discharging method, the recently introduced density\nformula for non-planar graphs, and new upper bounds for the crossing number of\n$2$-- and $3$-planar graphs in combination with corresponding lower bounds\nbased on the Crossing Lemma.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
