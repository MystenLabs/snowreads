In this work, we propose and study the\nstochastic Euler dynamics - a continuous-time Markov process that is equivalent\nto a linear spline interpolation of a random timestep (forward) Euler method.\nWe understand the stochastic Euler dynamics as a path-valued ansatz for the ODE\nsolution that shall be approximated. We first obtain qualitative insights by\nstudying deterministic Euler dynamics which we derive through a first order\napproximation to the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic Euler dynamics.\nThen we show convergence of the stochastic Euler dynamics to the ODE solution\nby studying the associated infinitesimal generators and by a novel local\ntruncation error analysis. Next we prove stability by an immediate analysis of\nthe random timestep Euler method and by deriving Foster-Lyapunov criteria for\nthe stochastic Euler dynamics; the latter also yield bounds on the speed of\nconvergence to stationarity. The paper ends with a discussion of second-order\nstochastic Euler dynamics and a series of numerical experiments that appear to\nverify our analytical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z5NJctr3I8456lTDgrcA26ujlK_HloUGNSvEmzvdMBE","pdfSize":"2110392"}
