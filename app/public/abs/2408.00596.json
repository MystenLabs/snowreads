We additionally prove analogous hybrid\nsubconvex bounds for central values of certain $\\mathrm{GL}_3 \\times\n\\mathrm{GL}_2$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions. The subconvex bounds that we\nobtain are strong in the sense that, modulo current knowledge on estimates for\nthe second moment of $\\mathrm{GL}_3$ $L$-functions, they are the natural limit\nof the first moment method pioneered by Li and by Blomer.\n  The method of proof relies on an explicit $\\mathrm{GL}_3 \\times \\mathrm{GL}_2\n\\leftrightsquigarrow \\mathrm{GL}_4 \\times \\mathrm{GL}_1$ spectral reciprocity\nformula, which relates a $\\mathrm{GL}_2$ moment of $\\mathrm{GL}_3 \\times\n\\mathrm{GL}_2$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions to a $\\mathrm{GL}_1$ moment of\n$\\mathrm{GL}_4 \\times \\mathrm{GL}_1$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions. A key\nadditional input is a Lindel\\\"of-on-average upper bound for the second moment\nof Dirichlet $L$-functions restricted to a coset, which is of independent\ninterest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DGcLz25L7Hx7ZB-eu2ZjZlBKAHCxjXCtPIlUoOz_Q4E","pdfSize":"879973"}
