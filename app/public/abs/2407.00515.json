By combining Li's theory of $\\phi$-coordinated modules and the\nideas from our previous paper, we introduce the notion of deformed\n$\\phi$-coordinated quantum vertex algebra module. We show that the orthogonal\ntwisted $h$-Yangians and restricted modules for the generalized orthogonal\ntwisted $h$-Yangians can be equipped with the structure of (truncated) deformed\n$\\phi$-coordinated $\\mathcal{V}^c(\\mathfrak{gl}_N)$-module and demonstrate its\napplications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
