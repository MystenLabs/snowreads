Following Li,\nK\\'edagni, and Mourifi\\'e (2024), we propose a misspecification robust bound\nfor a real-valued vector of various causal parameters. We discuss\nidentification under two sets of weaker assumptions: random assignment and\nexclusion restriction (without monotonicity), and random assignment and\nmonotonicity (without exclusion restriction). We introduce two causal\nparameters: the local average treatment-controlled direct effect (LATCDE), and\nthe local average instrument-controlled direct effect (LAICDE). Under the\nrandom assignment and monotonicity assumptions, we derive sharp bounds on the\nlocal average treatment-controlled direct effects for the always-takers and\nnever-takers, respectively, and the total average controlled direct effect for\nthe compliers. Additionally, we show that the intent-to-treat effect can be\nexpressed as a convex weighted average of these three effects. Finally, we\napply our method on the proximity to college instrument and find that growing\nup near a four-year college increases the wage of never-takers (who represent\nmore than 70% of the population) by a range of 4.15% to 27.07%.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
