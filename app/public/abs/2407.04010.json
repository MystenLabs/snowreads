Recently, there has been a surge of interest in\nstudying diatopic and diachronic changes in dialect NLP, but there is currently\nno research exploring the intersection of both. Our work aims to fill this gap\nby systematically reviewing diachronic and diatopic papers from a unified\nperspective. In this work, we critically assess nine tasks and datasets across\nfive dialects from three language families (Slavic, Romance, and Germanic) in\nboth spoken and written modalities. The tasks covered are diverse, including\ncorpus construction, dialect distance estimation, and dialect geolocation\nprediction, among others. Moreover, we outline five open challenges regarding\nchanges in dialect use over time, the reliability of dialect datasets, the\nimportance of speaker characteristics, limited coverage of dialects, and\nethical considerations in data collection. We hope that our work sheds light on\nfuture research towards inclusive computational methods and datasets for\nlanguage varieties and dialects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
