In the large $N$ limit, we can focus on the single\ntrace moments associated with the words composed of the letters $A$ and $B$.\nAnalytic continuations in the lengths of the words and subwords lead to\nanalytic trajectories of single trace moments and intriguing intersections of\ndifferent trajectories. Inspired by the one-cut solutions of one-matrix models,\nwe propose some simple ansatzes for the singularity structure of the two-matrix\ngenerating functions and the corresponding single trace moments. Together with\nthe self-consistent constraints from the loop equations, we determine the free\nparameters in the ansatzes and obtain highly accurate solutions for the\ntwo-matrix model at a low computational cost. For a given length cutoff\n$L_\\text{max}$, our results are within and more accurate than the positivity\nbounds from the relaxation method, such as about 6-digit accuracy for\n$L_\\text{max}=18$. The convergence pattern suggests that we achieve about\n$8$-digit accuracy for $L_\\text{max}=22$. As the singularity structure is\nclosely related to the eigenvalue distributions, we further present the results\nfor various types of eigenvalue densities. In the end, we study the symmetry\nbreaking solutions using more complicated ansatzes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
