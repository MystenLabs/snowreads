We detect molecular gas with masses in the range $10^{8.9} < M_{H_2}\n< 10^{10.2}$ M$_{\\odot}$ in the early-type host galaxies of 10 targets, while\nfor the other 19 sources we derive upper limits. The detection rate of objects\nwith such large molecular masses -- $34\\pm9$% -- is higher than in the general\npopulation of non-active early-type galaxies (ETG: $<$10%). The kinematics of\nthe molecular gas are dominated in most cases by rotating disk-like structures,\nwith diameters up to 25 kpc. Compared with the results for samples of quiescent\nETG in the literature, we find a larger fraction of more massive, more extended\nand less settled molecular gas structures. In most of the CO-detected sources,\nthe results are consistent with triggering of the AGN as the gas settles\nfollowing a merger or close encounter with a gas-rich companion. However, in a\nminority of objects at the centres of rich clusters of galaxies, the accretion\nof gas cooling from the hot X-ray halos is a plausible alternative to galaxy\ninteractions as a triggering mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
