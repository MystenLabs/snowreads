The interaction between different\nfactors is considered to allow for the identification of a precise optimal\ncontrol strategy to maximise the profits of a power storage facility under a\nvariety of different conditions. The methodology is based upon traditional\nstochastic techniques, however by working directly with excess demand data is\nmodel independent and does not require identification of the underlying\nprocess.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
