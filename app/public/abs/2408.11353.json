While many hints have\nemerged, all the evidence gathered by IceCube and ANTARES, over the course of\nalmost a decade and a half of operation, have fallen short of providing any\nconclusive answer to the puzzle of the origin of high-energy cosmic rays and\nneutrinos. The advancement of the field is thus closely associated with not\nonly the neutrino observatories coming online in the next few years, but also\non the coordinated efforts of the EM, GW and cosmic ray communities to develop\ndedicated channels and infrastructure that allows for swift and comprehensive\nmulti-messenger follow-up of relevant events detected in any of the sectors.\nThis paper highlights the strides that have been already taken in that\ndirection and the fruits that they have born, as well as the challenges that\nlie ahead.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
