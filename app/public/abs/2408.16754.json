Visual place recognition, a critical component\nfor navigation, is often hampered by the high resource demands of conventional\nsystems, making them unsuitable for small-scale robotic platforms which still\nrequire to perform complex, long-range tasks. Although neuromorphic approaches\noffer potential for greater efficiency, real-time edge deployment remains\nconstrained by the complexity and limited scalability of bio-realistic\nnetworks. Here, we demonstrate a neuromorphic localization system that performs\naccurate place recognition in up to 8km of traversal using models as small as\n180 KB with 44k parameters, while consuming less than 1% of the energy required\nby conventional methods. Our Locational Encoding with Neuromorphic Systems\n(LENS) integrates spiking neural networks, an event-based dynamic vision\nsensor, and a neuromorphic processor within a single SPECK(TM) chip, enabling\nreal-time, energy-efficient localization on a hexapod robot. LENS represents\nthe first fully neuromorphic localization system capable of large-scale,\non-device deployment, setting a new benchmark for energy efficient robotic\nplace recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
