Coherent X-ray diffraction techniques such as coherent X-ray\ndiffractive imaging (CXDI) and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) are\ncapable for this purpose and provide complimentary information, although due to\nsignal-to-noise requirements, their simultaneous demonstration has been\nlimited. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for the simultaneous use of CXDI and\nXPCS to study in situ the Brownian motion of colloidal gold nanoparticles of\n200 nm diameter suspended in a glycerol-water mixture. We visualise the process\nof agglomeration, examine the spatiotemporal space accessible with the\ncombination of techniques, and demonstrate CXDI with 22 ms temporal resolution.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W0rvB8hyJqBEMnNB3bvEtRm-UM0hHPUz5qWZDpctp8s","pdfSize":"13699025"}
