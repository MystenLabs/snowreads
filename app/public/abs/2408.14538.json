By leveraging JAX, LINX achieves both speed and\ndifferentiability, enabling the use of Bayesian inference, including\ngradient-based methods. We discuss the formalism used in LINX for rapid\nprimordial elemental abundance predictions and give examples of how LINX can be\nused. When combined with differentiable Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power\nspectrum emulators, LINX can be used for joint CMB and BBN analyses without\nrequiring extensive computational resources, including on personal hardware.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
