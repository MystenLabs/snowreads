Our study reveals that when reheating EoS\n$\\wre > 1/3$ and $\\xi \\gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field\nexperience a \\textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase.\nParticularly for $\\xi >1$ such instability causes substantial growth in the\nscalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in an\nintermediate-frequency range that is strong enough to be detected by future\ngravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar\nfield and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the\nstrength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nscales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom\n(parametrized by $\\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such\noverproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \\leq 0.036$\nand $\\dneff \\leq 0.284$ yield a strong upper bound on the value of $\\xi$\ndepending upon the value of $\\wre$ and reheating temperature $\\Tre$. Taking\ninto account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\\xi$\nshould be $ \\lesssim 4.0$ for any value of reheating temperature within\n$10^{-2} \\lesssim \\Tre \\lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, reheating equation of state\nwithin $ 1/2 \\leq\\wre \\leq 1$, and for a wide range of inflationary energy\nscales. However, for $\\wre < 1/3$, $\\xi$ is found to be unconstrained by any\nknown observation. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\\Tre,\\xi)$\nplane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO,\nLISA, and ET.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
