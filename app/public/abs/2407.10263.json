However, this requires an efficient framework.\nIn this work, we present a machine-learning-based framework capable of\ndetecting and analyzing binary neutron star mergers during their inspiral.\nUsing a residual network to summarize the strain data, we use its output as\ninput to a classifier giving the probability of having a signal in the data,\nand to a normalizing-flow network to perform neural posterior estimation. We\ntrain a network for several maximum frequencies reached by the signal to\nimprove the estimate over time. Our framework shows good results both for\ndetection and characterization, with improved parameter estimation as we get\ncloser to the merger time. Thus, we can effectively evolve the precision of the\nsky location as the merger draws closer. Such a setup would be important for\nfuture multi-messenger searches where one would like to have the most precise\ninformation possible, as early as possible.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
