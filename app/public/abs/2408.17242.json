Given the well-known connection between\nMcKean-Vlasov SDEs and interacting particle systems, we show propagation of\nchaos and that the key properties of the interacting particle systems recover\nthose of the McKean-Vlasov SDEs in the particle limit. All results in the\npresent work are shown under two settings: fully and partially dissipative\ncase. Each setting has its challenges and limitations. For instance, weakening\nfull dissipativity to partial dissipativity demands stronger structural\nassumptions on the equations' dynamics and yields random periodic behaviour in\nthe weak sense instead of pathwise sense (as in the full dissipativity case).\nThe proof mechanisms are close but fundamentally different.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dPZ_s94nVLMgpclDDsaO0_Fpc7xH68zn7vx_z3ESEX8","pdfSize":"398010"}
