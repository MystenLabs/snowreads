However, it has not yet been properly considered and studied for\nLiDAR-based odometry. In this paper, we propose a novel tightly coupled\nLiDAR-inertial odometry based on the MSCKF framework, named MSC-LIO. An\nefficient LiDAR same-plane-point (LSPP) tracking method, without explicit\nfeature extraction, is present for frame-to-frame data associations. The\ntracked LSPPs are employed to build an LSPP measurement model, which constructs\na multi-state constraint. Besides, we propose an effective point-velocity-based\nLiDAR-IMU time-delay (LITD) estimation method, which is derived from the\nproposed LSPP tracking method. Extensive experiments were conducted on both\npublic and private datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed MSC-LIO\nyields higher accuracy and efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods. The\nablation experiment results indicate that the data-association efficiency is\nimproved by nearly 3 times using the LSPP tracking method. Besides, the\nproposed LITD estimation method can effectively and accurately estimate the\nLITD.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
