In the high-energy region, the Feynman\nintegrals involving external and internal massive particles, such as the top\nquark, Higgs and vector bosons, can be asymptotically expanded and directly\ncalculated in the small-mass limit. With this approach, analytic results for\nhigher-order terms in the expansion parameter and the dimensional regulator can\nbe obtained with AsyInt. These results are important ingredients for the\ntwo-loop electroweak and QCD corrections for $2 \\to 2$ scattering processes in\nthe large transverse momenta region, which is relevant to both precision\ncollider phenomenology and new physics searches at current and future\nhigh-energy colliders. In this paper, analytic results of representative planar\nand non-planar Feynman integrals are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
