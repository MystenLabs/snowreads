The first purpose of this paper is to prove\nthat the heat equation is observable from any measurable set $\\omega$ with\npositive $(n-1+\\delta)$-Hausdorff content, for $\\delta >0$ arbitrary small. The\nproof relies on a new spectral estimate for linear combinations of Laplace\neigenfunctions, obtained via a Remez type inequality, and the use of the\nso-called Lebeau-Robbiano's method. Even if this observability result is sharp\nwith respect to the scale of Hausdorff dimension, our second goal is to\nconstruct families of sets $\\omega$ which have codimension greater than or\nequal to $1$ for which the heat equation remains observable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L8xFOCm2EtsiMonEDS5kMaNiTGYdk5Da-PYGfABViAQ","pdfSize":"373322","objectId":"0x807cd5551f3a79a623200ba1c95839a3ec9b51c0c84e8f76e6b117c4a5e6c6b4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
