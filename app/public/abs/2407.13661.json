Questions like determining how far a candidate is from winning or\nidentifying effective election strategies are computationally challenging as\nminor changes in voter rankings can lead to significant ripple effects - for\nexample, lending support to a losing candidate can prevent their votes from\ntransferring to a more competitive opponent. We study optimal strategies -\npersuading voters to change their ballots or adding new voters - both\nalgorithmically and theoretically. Algorithmically, we develop efficient\nmethods to reduce election instances while maintaining optimization accuracy,\neffectively circumventing the computational complexity barrier. Theoretically,\nwe analyze the effectiveness of strategies under both perfect and imperfect\npolling information. Our algorithmic approach applies to the ranked-choice\npolling data on the US 2024 Republican Primary, finding, for example, that\nseveral candidates would have been optimally served by boosting another\ncandidate instead of themselves.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
