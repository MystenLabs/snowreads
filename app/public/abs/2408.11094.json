Utilizing the covariant phase space\nformalism, we identify the relevant degrees of freedom that localize to the\n$d$-dimensional bifurcate horizon and, upon canonical quantization, determine\ntheir commutators. On this phase space, we find two Iyer-Wald charges. The\nfirst of these charges, proportional to the area of the causal diamond, is\nresponsible for shifting the null time along the horizon and has been\nwell-documented in the literature. The second charge is much less understood,\nbeing integrable for $d \\geq 2$ only if we allow for field-dependent\ndiffeomorphisms and is responsible for changing the size of the causal diamond.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dE32YmyP4Re5vskECRJ_WPxvidd25Yjy2r45XvC7zIA","pdfSize":"479638"}
