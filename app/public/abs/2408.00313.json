Such surfaces have many\nkinds of singularities. In this paper, we prove existence and non-existence\ntheorems of singularities of timelike minimal surfaces, and show that various\ndiffeomorphism types of singularities that do not appear on these Riemannian\ncounter parts, such as minimal surfaces in Euclidean space and maximal surfaces\nin Minkowski space, appear on timelike minimal surfaces. We also give criteria\nfor cuspidal butterfly, cuspidal $S_1$ singularity, $(2,5)$-cuspidal edge,\ncuspidal beaks and $D_4$ singularity of timelike minimal surfaces. Finally,\nduality and invariance theorems for these singularities and examples are given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
