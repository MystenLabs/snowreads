This independent generation\nfor each view often results in spatial inconsistency and implausibility in the\n3D scenes. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel text-driven\n3D-consistent scene generation model: SceneDreamer360. Our proposed method\nleverages a text-driven panoramic image generation model as a prior for 3D\nscene generation and employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to ensure consistency\nacross multi-view panoramic images. Specifically, SceneDreamer360 enhances the\nfine-tuned Panfusion generator with a three-stage panoramic enhancement,\nenabling the generation of high-resolution, detail-rich panoramic images.\nDuring the 3D scene construction, a novel point cloud fusion initialization\nmethod is used, producing higher quality and spatially consistent point clouds.\nOur extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to other methods,\nSceneDreamer360 with its panoramic image generation and 3DGS can produce higher\nquality, spatially consistent, and visually appealing 3D scenes from any text\nprompt.
