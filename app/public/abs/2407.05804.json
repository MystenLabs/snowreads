The model consists\nof a tractable core-periphery model assuming a quasi-linear log utility\nfunction of consumers and an advection-diffusion equation governing the time\nevolution of a population distribution. The stability of a spatially\nhomogeneous stationary solution and the large time behavior of solutions to the\nmodel on a one-dimensional periodic space are investigated. When the spatially\nhomogeneous stationary solution is unstable, solutions starting around it are\nfound to eventually form spatial patterns with several urban areas in which\nmobile workers agglomerate.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
