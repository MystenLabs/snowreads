An order-divisor graph of a finite group is an undirected\ngraph in which the set of vertices includes all elements of the group, and two\ndistinct vertices with different orders are adjacent if the order of one vertex\ndivides the order of the other. We prove some beautiful results in\norder-divisor graphs of finite groups. The primary focus is on examining the\ngirth, degree of vertices, and size of the order-divisor graph. In particular,\nwe provide a comprehensive description of these parameters for the\norder-divisor graphs of finite cyclic groups and dihedral groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9N4HZhUddzwOSUZWoSCFPhXDMTp4yLfNd-gsnXbfrmI","pdfSize":"468232"}
