We allow the\nnetwork parameters to be time dependent, which is a prerequisite for the\nanalysis of optimal strategies on networks. Using a novel top-down analysis of\nthe master equations, we present a simple proof for the monotone convergence of\nthese models to their respective infinite-population limits. This leads to\nexplicit expressions for the expected adoption or infection level in the Bass\nand SI models, respectively, on infinite homogeneous complete and circular\nnetworks, and on heterogeneous complete networks with two homogeneous groups\nwith time-dependent parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
