However, traditional adaptive filter-based approaches\nmay suffer from individual variations in EEG signals, while deep neural\nnetwork-based approaches may be hindered by the non-stationarity of EEG signals\ncaused by biomarker attenuation and background oscillations. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Visual Evoked Potential Booster (VEP Booster), a\nnovel closed-loop AI framework that generates reliable and stable EEG\nbiomarkers under visual stimulation protocols. Our system leverages an image\ngenerator to refine stimulus images based on real-time feedback from human EEG\nsignals, generating visual stimuli tailored to the preferences of primary\nvisual cortex (V1) neurons and enabling effective targeting of neurons most\nresponsive to stimuli. We validated our approach by implementing a system and\nemploying steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) visual protocols in five\nhuman subjects. Our results show significant enhancements in the reliability\nand utility of EEG biomarkers for all individuals, with the largest improvement\nin SSVEP response being 105%, the smallest being 28%, and the average increase\nbeing 76.5%. These promising results have implications for both clinical and\ntechnological applications\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sEeMRpcLmPk5N8ewndKCC07MTJbioV9xlrxPJKMLcI4","pdfSize":"1085830"}
