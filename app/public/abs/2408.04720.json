This\nwork explores the application of machine learning to a particular facet of this\nchallenge: the task of simplifying scattering amplitudes expressed in terms of\nspinor-helicity variables. We demonstrate that an encoder-decoder transformer\narchitecture achieves impressive simplification capabilities for expressions\ncomposed of handfuls of terms. Lengthier expressions are implemented in an\nadditional embedding network, trained using contrastive learning, which\nisolates subexpressions that are more likely to simplify. The resulting\nframework is capable of reducing expressions with hundreds of terms - a regular\noccurrence in quantum field theory calculations - to vastly simpler equivalent\nexpressions. Starting from lengthy input expressions, our networks can generate\nthe Parke-Taylor formula for five-point gluon scattering, as well as new\ncompact expressions for five-point amplitudes involving scalars and gravitons.\nAn interactive demonstration can be found at\nhttps://spinorhelicity.streamlit.app .\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wDXWr0FrtR4_2yYn_JeCDtpfadEd7bmfnvXDOP6rQD8","pdfSize":"2342782"}
