Motivated by recent advances in mean curvature flows, we introduce the\nnotion of $F-$functional, $F$-stability and entropy for solutions of\nsupercritical Fujita equation. Using these tools, we prove that among bounded\npositive self similar solutions, the constant solution has the lowest entropy.\nFurthermore, there is also a gap between the entropy of constant and\nnon-constant solutions. As an application of these results, we prove that if\n$p>(n+2)/(n-2)$, then the blow up set of type I blow up solutions is the union\nof a $(n-1)-$ rectifiable set and a set of Hausdorff dimension at most $n-3$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"s34bITim4f-hgbZuPlI4bujIcJhaKMBa7eRkoaZPWjg","pdfSize":"552938","objectId":"0x61618239a705b685d255de965a0f6ec8e278f247bdbc196c9b55503e94af5510","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
