Our research reveals that these lunar swirls are\nthe result of ancient electrical currents that traversed the Moon's surface,\ngenerating powerful magnetizing fields impacting both native lunar rocks and\nextralunar projectile materials. We have reconstructed 3-D distribution maps of\nthese ancient subsurface currents and developed coupling models of magnetic and\nelectric fields that take into account the subsurface density in the prominent\nlunar maria and basins. Our simulations suggest these ancient currents could\nhave reached density up to 13 A/m2, with surface magnetizing field as strong as\n469 {\\mu}T. We propose that these intense electrical current discharges in the\ncrust originate from ancient interior dynamo activity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wc3e32HD1_VATb2fXqjm2v0DdcMT4ZmWB-ty5nDe9MA","pdfSize":"6309048"}
