In particular this cannot be handled by straightforward\nadaptation of the methods developed in [Krieger-Schlag-Tataru, 2008/09]. The\nkey new ingredients we use are a type of approximate modulation theory, taking\nadvantage of frequency localisations, and the exploitation of an inhomogeneous\nwave equation with both a non-local, as well as a local potential term. These\nterms arise for the main non-perturbative component of the ion density $n$ and\ncan be solved via inversion of a certain Fredholm type operator, as well as by\nusing distorted Fourier methods. Our result relies on a number of numerical\nnon-degeneracy assumptions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
