However, recent\nadvancements in nanofabrication capabilities and design opportunities have led\nto the recognition of the advantages of incorporating disorder for specific\noptical functionalities. This review provides an overview of the principal\ntheoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects concerning the exploration of\ndisordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light\nscattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical\nmethodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication\ntechniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and\ntheir achievable precision level. The review also explores critical\napplications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in\nthin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances.\nFinally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in\nthis field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5oO_RclBg1oQeJCEBmpwbEi8OqVwdLk4O3roZ8lTPsA","pdfSize":"5010857"}
