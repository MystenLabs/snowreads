For abelian\ncategories ${\\mathscr A}:=({\\mathscr A}, ^{\\vee}, \\varpi)$ with duality, and\nappropriate abelian subcategories ${\\mathscr B}\\subseteq {\\mathscr A}$, we\nprove D\\'{e}vissage theorems for ${\\bf GW}$ spaces, $G{\\mathcal W}$-spectra and\n${\\mathbb G}W$ bispectra. As a consequence, for regular local rings $R$ with\n$1/2\\in R$, we compute the ${\\mathbb G}W$ groups ${\\mathbb\nG}W^{[n]}_k(Spec{R})$ forall $k, n\\in {\\mathbb Z}$, where $n$ represent the\ntranslation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
