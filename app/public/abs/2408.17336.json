The analysis uses proton-proton collision data at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The search is performed in the final state with\nlarge missing transverse momentum and a pair of jets originating from bottom\nquarks. No significant excess of data is observed with respect to the standard\nmodel expectation. Results are interpreted in the context of a type-II\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model with an additional light pseudoscalar (2HDM+a). An\nupper limit is set on the mass of the lighter pseudoscalar, excluding masses up\nto 260 GeV at 95% confidence level. This is the first search at the LHC to\nprobe DM produced in association with two nonresonant bottom quarks in the\n2HDM+a model. Sensitivity to the parameter space with the ratio of the vacuum\nexpectation values of the two Higgs doublets, $\\tan\\beta$, greater than 15 is\nachieved, capitalizing on the enhancement of couplings between pseudoscalars\nand bottom quarks with high $\\tan\\beta$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l-TFIZWIqkxoVcz4pUwxcLoNiwYVoZ1W6qkoLgNbQao","pdfSize":"1990774"}
