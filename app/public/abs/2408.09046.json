While fallback drivers significantly\ninfluence the perceived trustfulness of self-driving vehicles, fallback drivers\nare an expensive solution that may not even improve vehicle safety in emergency\nsituations. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this work delves into\nthe potential of HMI and UI in enhancing trustfulness and emotion regulation in\ndriverless vehicles. By analyzing the impact of various HMI and UI on passenger\nemotions, innovative and cost-effective concepts for improving human-vehicle\ninteraction are conceptualized. To enable a trustful, highly comfortable, and\nsafe ride, this work concludes by discussing whether HMI and UI are suitable\nfor calming passengers down in emergencies, leading to smarter mobility for\nall.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O3ueCRtPASmmirPaO5XnfWYRbpFgsvKiejEON1mQupQ","pdfSize":"13337229"}
