While the upper bound of the simulation cost has been\nextensively studied through various quantum algorithms, much less work has\nfocused on establishing the lower bound, particularly for the simulation of\nopen quantum system dynamics. In this work, we present a general framework to\ncalculate the lower bound for simulating a broad class of quantum Markov\nsemigroups. Given a fixed accessible unitary set, we introduce the concept of\nconvexified circuit depth to quantify the quantum simulation cost and analyze\nthe necessary circuit depth to construct a quantum simulation scheme that\nachieves a specific order. Our framework can be applied to both unital and\nnon-unital quantum dynamics, and the tightness of our lower bound technique is\nillustrated by showing that the upper and lower bounds coincide in several\nexamples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F9Juu97l-2RdJIKw5_QxIOSRWBAqvjZkMIIioJtkbHQ","pdfSize":"1200350"}
