State-of-the-art super-resolution\ntechniques underpinned with deep learning allow for obtaining results of\noutstanding visual quality, but it is seldom verified whether they constitute a\nvaluable source for specific computer vision applications. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing super-resolution as a preprocessing\nstep to improve optical character recognition from document scans. To achieve\nthat, we propose to train deep networks for single-image super-resolution in a\ntask-driven way to make them better adapted for the purpose of text detection.\nAs problems limited to a specific task are heavily ill-posed, we introduce a\nmulti-task loss function that embraces components related with text detection\ncoupled with those guided by image similarity. The obtained results reported in\nthis paper are encouraging and they constitute an important step towards\nreal-world super-resolution of document images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
