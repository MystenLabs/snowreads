Following\nthe need of a rapid solution for the detection of floating plastic, methods\nbased on remote sensing data have been proposed recently. Their main limitation\nis represented by the lack of a general reference for evaluating performance.\nRecently, the Marine Debris Archive (MARIDA) has been released as a standard\ndataset to develop and evaluate Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for detection\nof Marine Plastic Debris. The MARIDA dataset has been created for simplifying\nthe comparison between detection solutions with the aim of stimulating the\nresearch in the field of marine environment preservation. In this work, an\nassessment of spectral based solutions is proposed by evaluating performance on\nMARIDA dataset. The outcome highlights the need of precise reference for fair\nevaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
