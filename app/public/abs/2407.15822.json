It has been observed that the scalar potentials induced by such\ngeneralized superpotentials typically have an enormous amount of terms, making\nit hard to study any phenomenological aspects such as moduli stabilization. In\nthis regard, we present a set of generic master formulae which not only\nformulate the scalar potential in a compact way but also enable one to {\\it\nread-off} the various scalar potential pieces by simply knowing a set of\ntopological data of the compactifying Calabi Yau and its mirror threefold. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of our master formulae by {\\it reading-off} the\nscalar potentials for five explicit models, and using a set of {\\it axionic\nflux} combinations we show that 76276 terms arising from the flux\nsuperpotential in a ${\\mathbb T}^6/({\\mathbb Z}_2\\times{\\mathbb Z}_2)$-based\nmodel can be equivalently expressed by using 2816 terms, while 11212 terms\narising from the flux superpotential in a Quintic-based model can be\nequivalently expressed by 668 terms! We argue that the master formulae\npresented in this work can be useful in an analytic exploration of the rich\nlandscape of the non-geometric flux vacua.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
