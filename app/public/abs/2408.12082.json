Motivated by algorithmic applications, the study of the\nextremal function $\\text{ex}(n, K_k, K_t\\text{-minor})$, i.e., the number of\ncliques of order $k$ in $K_t$-minor free graphs on $n$ vertices, has received\nmuch attention. In this paper, we determine essentially sharp bounds on the\nmaximum possible number of cliques of order $k$ in a $K_t$-minor free graph on\n$n$ vertices. More precisely, we determine a function $C(k,t)$ such that for\neach $k < t$ with $t-k\\gg \\log_2 t$, every $K_t$-minor free graph on $n$\nvertices has at most $ n C(k, t)^{1+o_t(1)}$ cliques of order $k$. We also show\nthis bound is sharp by constructing a $K_t$-minor-free graph on $n$ vertices\nwith $C(k, t) n$ cliques of order $k$. This bound answers a question of Wood\nand Fox-Wei asymptotically up to $o_t(1)$ in the exponent except the extreme\nvalues when $k$ is very close to $t$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
