As\nthe resolution level of the observations tends to zero, we establish the\nasymptotic normality of an augmented maximum likelihood estimator. The rate of\nconvergence for the dissipative coefficients matches rates in related parabolic\nproblems, whereas the rate for the elastic parameters also depends on the\nmagnitude of the damping. The analysis of the observed Fisher information\nmatrix relies upon the asymptotic behaviour of rescaled $M, N$-functions\ngeneralising the operator sine and cosine families appearing in the undamped\nwave equation. In contrast to the energetically stable undamped wave equation,\nthe $M, N$-functions emerging within the covariance structure of the local\nmeasurements have additional smoothing properties similar to the heat kernel,\nand their asymptotic behaviour is analysed using functional calculus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
