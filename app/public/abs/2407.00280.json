The IVCA addresses the limitation of VCA by considering\ninter-frame relations, namely motion and reference structure. First, we enhance\nthe accuracy of temporal features by introducing feature-domain motion\nestimation into the IVCA. Next, drawing inspiration from the hierarchical\nreference structure in codecs, we design layer-aware weights to adjust the\nmajorities of frame complexity in different layers. Additionally, we expand the\nscope of temporal features by considering frames that be referred to, rather\nthan relying solely on the previous frame. Experimental results show the\nsignificant improvement in complexity estimation accuracy achieved by IVCA,\nwith minimal time complexity increase.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
