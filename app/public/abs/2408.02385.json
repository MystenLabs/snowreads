The metric spaces $(V(G), d_{G})$ are characterized up to isometry for\nall finite connected $G$ by David C. Kay and Gary Chartrand in 1964. The main\nresult of the paper expands this characterization on the infinite connected\ngraphs. We also prove that every metric space with integer distances between\nits points admits an isometric embedding into $(V(G), d_G)$ for suitable $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
