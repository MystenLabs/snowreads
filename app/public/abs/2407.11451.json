In fact,\nthe latent space of existing diffusion models are entangled, with a distorted\nmapping from its latent space to image space. To tackle this problem, we\npresent Isometric Diffusion, equipping a diffusion model with a geometric\nregularizer to guide the model to learn a geometrically sound latent space of\nthe training data manifold. This approach allows diffusion models to learn a\nmore disentangled latent space, which enables smoother interpolation, more\naccurate inversion, and more precise control over attributes directly in the\nlatent space. Our extensive experiments consisting of image interpolations,\nimage inversions, and linear editing show the effectiveness of our method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
