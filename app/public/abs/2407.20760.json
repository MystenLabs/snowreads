While for Kerr black holes\nthese modes have been known for a long time, their calculation has remained a\nchallenge in alternative theories of gravity. We obtain the spectrum of\nquasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory without resorting to perturbation theory\nin the coupling constant. Our approach is based on a spectral decomposition of\nthe linear perturbations of the metric and the scalar field. The quasinormal\nmodes approach smoothly the slow rotation and weak coupling limits known from\nperturbative studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
