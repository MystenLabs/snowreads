The problem was treated at\nthe level of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian describing both light and matter\nquantum mechanically. The effect of cavity size on the energy levels and high\nharmonics generation (HHG) spectrum is studied. We have shown that the energy\nlevels, transition states, entanglement, and the HHG spectrum can be strongly\ninfluenced by changing the cavity size.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6nBIwgxfrsvhqmoMJqOrTFAaeNNXYVzctwcR9dtsrz0","pdfSize":"707709"}
