By using\nfirst-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we demonstrate that WC-type\nTiO and its analogues are promising candidates for Floquet engineering of\ntriple fermions. The symmetry analysis reveals that the electric field of CPL\ncan break the specific symmetries, such as the time-reversal symmetry and its\ncombination of spatial symmetries, inducing a transition to a flexibly\ncontrollable Weyl semimetallic phase. The survived spatial symmetry, controlled\nby light, guarantees that the Weyl nodes are located along the high-symmetry\nline or in high-symmetry planes in momentum space. Our findings focusing on\nFloquet engineering in realistic materials featured by triple fermions would\nfacilitate both theoretical and experimental interest.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BtaDkXCHzidZYZ40jb06Ft-rWI7yJiIh1jS3OErQlOk","pdfSize":"3059148"}
