The variability of the source is not limited to the types of data\nacquisition techniques, as we have maps from different time periods. To\nincorporate these data for a coherent analysis, it is essential to first align\ndifferent \"styles\" of geospatial data to its matching images that point to the\nsame location on the surface of the Earth. In this paper, we approach the image\nregistration as a two-step process of (1) extracting geospatial contents\ninvariant to visual (and any other non-content-related) information, and (2)\nmatching the data based on such (purely) geospatial contents. We hypothesize\nthat a combination of $\\beta$-VAE-like architecture [2] and adversarial\ntraining will achieve both the disentanglement of the geographic information\nand artistic styles and generation of new map tiles by composing the encoded\ngeographic information with any artistic style.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
