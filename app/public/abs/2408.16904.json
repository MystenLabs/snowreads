We prove\nthat the number of indecomposable direct summands of every maximal almost rigid\n$A$-module is equal to the sum of the number of vertices and the number of\narrows of the Gabriel quiver of $A$. Moreover, the algebra $A$, considered as\nan $A$-module, can be completed to a maximal almost rigid module in a unique\nway.\n  Gentle algebras are precisely the tiling algebras of surfaces with marked\npoints. We show that the (permissible) triangulations of the surface of $A$ are\nin bijection with the maximal almost rigid $A$-modules.\n  Furthermore, we study the endomorphism algebra $C=\\text{End}_A T$ of a\nmaximal almost rigid module $T$. We construct a fully faithful functor $G\\colon\n\\text{mod}\\,A\\to \\text{mod}\\, \\overline{A}$ into the module category of a\nbigger gentle algebra $\\overline{A}$ and show that $G$ maps maximal almost\nrigid $A$-modules to tilting $\\overline{A}$-modules. In particular, $C$ and\n$\\overline{A}$ are derived equivalent and $C$ is gentle.\n  After giving a geometric realization of the functor $G$, we obtain a tiling\n$G(\\mathbf{T})$ of the surface of $\\overline{A}$ as the image of the\ntriangulation $\\mathbf{T}$ corresponding to $T$. We then show that the tiling\nalgebra of $G(\\mathbf{T})$ is $C$. Moreover, the tiling algebra of $\\mathbf{T}$\nis obtained algebraically from $C$ as the tensor algebra with respect to the\n$C$-bimodule $\\text{Ext}_C^2(DC,C)$, which also is fundamental in\ncluster-tilting theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
