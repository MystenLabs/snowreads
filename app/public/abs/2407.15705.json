The\n$\\{9,3\\}$ is formed by a regular 3-coordinated tiling of nonagons, where the\n3-color coding of bonds according to the inequivalent Kitaev Ising spin\ncouplings yields the natural generalization of the original Kitaev model for\nEuclidean regular honeycomb tiling. Upon investigation of the bulk spectrum for\nlarge finite size droplets, we identify a gapless chiral $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin\nliquid state featuring spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking. Due to its\nnon-commutative translation group structure, such type of hyperbolic spin\nliquid is conjectured to feature chiral quasiparticles with a potentially\nnon-Abelian Bloch profile.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
