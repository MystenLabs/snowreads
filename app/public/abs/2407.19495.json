In this paper, we study the asymptotic symmetry of\nthe string theory in the bulk. We find a state-dependent, non-local field\nredefinition under which the worldsheet equations of motion, stress tensor, as\nwell as the symplectic form of string theory after the TsT transformation are\nmapped to those before the TsT transformation. The asymptotic symmetry in the\nauxiliary AdS basis is generated by two commuting Virasoro generators, while in\nthe TsT transformed basis is non-linear and non-local. Our result from string\ntheory analysis is compatible with that of the $T\\bar T$ deformed CFT$_2$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
