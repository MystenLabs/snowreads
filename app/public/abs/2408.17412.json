Many protocols\nemploying discrete or continuous variables have been developed over time.\nWhereas the firsts usually excel in covering longer distances, the seconds are\ntypically superior in producing higher secret key rates at short distances.\nPresent efforts aim to create systems that can exploit both these strengths,\nforeseeing the future challenge regarding the realization of a quantum network\nconsisting of multiple and heterogeneous interconnected nodes. Within such a\ncontext, a possible solution is systems able to efficiently toggle between\ndiscrete and continuous variable working modes with hybrid quantum state\nencoders. Therefore, this study presents a new hybrid encoder based on an\niPOGNAC modulator, ensuring compatibility with DV and CV QKD systems that can\nbe assembled entirely with commercial-off-the-shelf components. The proposed\nscheme is the first supporting DV polarization protocols, thus making it an\nappealing candidate for space nodes of a future quantum network, given that\npolarization-based protocols are well suited for space links.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
