We use the \\textsc{mesa} stellar evolution code to model the\nevolution of a $70~M_{\\odot}$ star that undergoes a GE. We let the star evolve\nto the termination of the main sequence (MS) and when it reaches $T\\simeq\n19\\,400 $ K we emulate a GE by removing mass from its outer layers, at a rate\nof $0.15~ M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$ for 20 years. As mass is being lost, the star\ncontracts and releases a substantial amount of gravitational energy. The star\nundergoes an initial $\\simeq 3$ days of expansion followed by years of\ncontraction. During that time the star tries to reach an equilibrium state and\nas a result of loss in gravitational energy, its luminosity drops about one\norder of magnitude. As the GE terminates, we let the star continue to evolve\nwithout any further mass loss and track its recovery as it regains its\nequilibrium by adjusting its internal structure. After $\\simeq 87$ years it\nreaches a state very close to the one where the GE was first initiated. We\nsuggest that at this point another GE or a cycle of GEs may occur.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
