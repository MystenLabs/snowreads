The pipeline is highly\nmodular and designed to produce reliable spectra from raw JWST exposures.\nexoTEDRF (pronounced exo-tedorf) consists of four stages, each of which are\nfurther subdivided into a series of steps. These steps can either be run\nindividually, for example in a Jupyter notebook, or via the command line using\nthe provided configuration files. The steps are highly tunable, allowing full\ncontrol over every parameter in the reduction. Each step also produces\ndiagnostic plots to allow the user to verify their results at each intermediate\nstage, and compare outputs with other pipelines if so desired. Finally,\nexoTEDRF has also been designed to be run in \"batch\" mode: simultaneously\nrunning multiple reductions, each tweaking a subset of parameters, to\nunderstand any impacts on the resulting atmosphere spectrum.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
