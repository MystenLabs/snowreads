Using the\nFloquet theory, the periodic interaction Hamiltonians were transfromed into a\ntime-independent interaction. Using the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation method, a\ndegenerated subspace is constructed, where the effective Hamiltonian is given\nin a perturbation expansion. In this framework, we found that the upper\ntriangular element $\\langle \\alpha | H^1 | \\beta \\rangle$, determines whether\nthe resonance happens. The generalized Rabi frequency and the Bloch-Siegert\nshift were solved straightforwardly as the first order and the second order\nsolution, proving the benefit of the developed method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
