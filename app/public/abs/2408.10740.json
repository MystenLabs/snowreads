If the initial hypersurface is strictly convex and\nWulff shape satisfies a mild condition, the solution of this flow remains to be\nstrictly convex for all $t>0$ by adopting a new approach applicable to\nanisotropic capillary setting. Furthermore, we define some suitable\nquermassintegrals for anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces, which satisfy some\nmonotonicity results along the flow. As applications, we establish an\nanisotropic capillary isoperimetric inequality for star-shaped anisotropic\ncapillary hypersurfaces and a family of new Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for\nstrictly convex anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
