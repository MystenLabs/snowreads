Archival EVLA radio observations at 6\ncm and 20 cm reveal two symmetric radio lobes aligned with the galactic plane,\nextending to a distance of $\\overline{R}=4.6\\pm0.6$ kpc from the core, oriented\nwith the polar axis of the circumnuclear disk. The spectral energy distribution\nlacks strong emission lines in the optical range.\n  Three formation scenarios are considered to explain these multi-wavelength\narchival observations: 1) AGN re-orientation caused by accretion of surrounding\nmaterial, 2) AGN-driven hot gas outflow directed along the galactic minor axis,\nor 3) a starburst / supernovae driven outflow at the core of the galaxy. This\ndiscovery is enabled by new imaging analysis tools including \\SAUNAS\\\n(Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal), demonstrating the\nabundance of information still to be exploited in the vast and growing\nastronomical archives.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9lGRqV16gz7UUOeUWv8m1tTrgq0Ll2rTu0hCB_6e8fU","pdfSize":"44662373"}
