This work demonstrates the use\nof hardware FPGA neural network controllers trained to imitate NMPC with\nsupervised learning. We use these Neural Controllers (NCs) implemented on\ninexpensive embedded FPGA hardware for high frequency control on physical\ncartpole and F1TENTH race car. Our results show that the NCs match the control\nperformance of the NMPCs in simulation and outperform it in reality, due to the\nfaster control rate that is afforded by the quick FPGA NC inference. We\ndemonstrate kHz control rates for a physical cartpole and offloading control to\nthe FPGA hardware on the F1TENTH car.
