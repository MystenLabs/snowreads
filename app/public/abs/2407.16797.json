Assuming that the\nstructure factor $S$ of the point process follows a vanishing power law at the\norigin (the typical case of a hyperuniform point process), this exponent is\ndefined as the slope near the origin of $\\log S$. Our estimator is built upon\nthe (expanding window) asymptotic variance of some wavelet transforms of the\npoint process. By combining several scales and several wavelets, we develop a\nmulti-scale, multi-taper estimator $\\widehat{\\alpha}$. We analyze its\nasymptotic behavior, proving its consistency under various settings, and\nenabling the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals for $\\alpha$ when\n$\\alpha < d$ and under Brillinger mixing. This construction is derived from a\nmultivariate central limit theorem where the normalisations are non-standard\nand vary among the components. We also present a non-asymptotic deviation\ninequality providing insights into the influence of tapers on the bias-variance\ntrade-off of $\\widehat{\\alpha}$. Finally, we investigate the performance of\n$\\widehat{\\alpha}$ through simulations, and we apply our method to the analysis\nof hyperuniformity in a real dataset of marine algae.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jx3a8ftTSWee8AdOhaF1HFZTrmKFf0bLxp_ugwhrUMo","pdfSize":"916612"}
