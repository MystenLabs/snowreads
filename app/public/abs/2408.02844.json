While turbulence is ubiquitous, from teacups to\nplanetary atmospheres, oceans and stars, its manifestations can vary\nconsiderably between different physical systems. For instance,\nthree-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows display a forward energy cascade from\nlarge to small scales, while in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, energy\ncascades from small to large scales. In a given physical system, a transition\nbetween such disparate regimes of turbulence can occur when a control parameter\nreaches a critical value. The behavior of flows close to such transition\npoints, which separate qualitatively distinct \\textit{phases} of turbulence,\nhas been found to be unexpectedly rich. Here, we survey recent findings on such\ntransitions in highly anisotropic turbulent fluid flows, including turbulence\nin thin layers and under the influence of rapid rotation. We also review recent\nwork on transitions induced by turbulent fluctuations, such as random reversals\nand transitions between large-scale vortices and jets, among others. The\nrelevance of these results and their ramifications for future investigations\nare discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
