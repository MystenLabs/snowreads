The QSVT\ncircuit is parameterized by a sequence of angles that must be pre-calculated\nclassically, with the number of angles increasing as the matrix condition\nnumber grows. Computing QSVT angles for ill-conditioned problems is a\nnumerically challenging task. We propose a numerical technique for estimating\nQSVT angles for large condition numbers. This technique allows one to avoid\nexpensive numerical computations of QSVT angles and to emulate QSVT circuits\nfor solving ill-conditioned problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
