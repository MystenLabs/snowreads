Symmetry breaking\npredicates (SBPs) typically impose an order on variables and single out the\nlexicographic leader (lex-leader) in each orbit of assignments. Although it is\nNP-hard to find complete lex-leader SBPs, incomplete lex-leader SBPs are widely\nused in practice.\n  In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing complete SBPs,\nlex-leader or otherwise, for SAT. Our main result proves a natural barrier for\nefficiently computing SBPs: efficient certification of graph non-isomorphism.\nOur results explain the difficulty of obtaining short SBPs for important CP\nproblems, such as matrix-models with row-column symmetries and graph generation\nproblems. Our results hold even when SBPs are allowed to introduce additional\nvariables. We show polynomial upper bounds for breaking certain symmetry\ngroups, namely automorphism groups of trees and wreath products of groups with\nefficient SBPs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
