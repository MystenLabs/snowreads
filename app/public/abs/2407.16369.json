The\nexisting NeRVI solution, albeit enjoying a high compression ratio, incurs slow\nspeeds in encoding and decoding. Built on the recent advances in stereo image\ncompression, FCNR assimilates stereo context modules and joint context transfer\nmodules to compress image pairs. Our solution significantly improves encoding\nand decoding speed while maintaining high reconstruction quality and satisfying\ncompression ratio. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we compare FCNR with\nstate-of-the-art neural compression methods, including E-NeRV, HNeRV, NeRVI,\nand ECSIC.
