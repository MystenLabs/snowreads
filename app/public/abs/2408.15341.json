These corrections pair up with those\nthat modify the optical mass with respect to the quasiparticle effective one,\nor the charge compressibility with respect to the quasiparticle density of\nstates. Our result supports recent claims that the correct expressions for\ntopological observables include vertex corrections besides the topological\ninvariants built just upon the Green's functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates\nthat such corrections are already accounted for by Landau's Fermi liquid theory\nof topological metals, and have important implications when those metals are on\nthe verge of a doping-driven Mott transition, as we discuss.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
