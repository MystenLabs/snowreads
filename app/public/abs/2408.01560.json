It is derived that there exists a threshold $\\sigma_0$ such\nthat, if the noise intensity $\\sigma \\geq\\sigma_0$, the noise destroys all\nbifurcations of the deterministic system and the corresponding stochastic\nKolmogorov system is uniquely ergodic. On the other hand, when the noise\nintensity $\\sigma<\\sigma_0$, the stochastic system undergoes bifurcations from\nthe unique ergodic stationary measure to three different types of ergodic\nstationary measures: (I) finitely many ergodic measures supported on rays, (II)\ninfinitely many ergodic measures supported on rays, (III) infinitely many\nergodic measures supported on invariant cones. Correspondingly, the global\ndynamics undergo similar bifurcation phenomena, which even displays infinitely\nmany Crauel random periodic solutions in the sense of \\cite{ELR21}.\nFurthermore, we prove that as $\\sigma$ tends to zero, the ergodic stationary\nmeasures converge to either Dirac measures supported on equilibria, or to Haar\nmeasures supported on non-trivial deterministic periodic orbits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
