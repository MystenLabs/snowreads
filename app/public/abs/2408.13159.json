We show that in different schemes, different\ndiagrams are responsible for the running, such as momentum-independent tadpoles\nor even UV-finite bubble diagrams. We also comment on the relation between the\nbeta functions and the energy dependence of scattering amplitudes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zlWzy6gp2-4QG-qzW6mvCYbkgXNXJ_QtVfIUCTh1GXo","pdfSize":"161848"}
