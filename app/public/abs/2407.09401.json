This puzzling relation was observed via bold line\ndiagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations in dimensions two and three. The matching\nwas within error bars and seemed valid down to the lowest accessible\ntemperatures $T$ about an order of magnitude smaller than the exchange coupling\n$J$. Here we employ resummed spin diagrammatic perturbation theory to show\nanalytically that the QCC breaks at fourth order in $J/T$ and provide the\napproximate mapping between classical and quantum temperatures. Our treatment\nfurther reveals that QCC is an indication of the surprising accuracy with which\nstatic correlators can be approximated by a simple renormalized mean-field\nform. We illustrate this for all models discussed in the context of QCC so far,\nincluding a recent example of the $S=1$ material\n$\\mathrm{K}_2\\mathrm{Ni}_2(\\mathrm{SO}_4)_3$. The success of the mean-field\nform is traced back to partial diagrammatic cancellations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
