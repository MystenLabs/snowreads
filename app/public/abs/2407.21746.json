In a previous study, we demonstrated\nthe emergence of GUP from non-extensive entropies, particularly for $S_\\pm$\ndependent only on the probability. In this new research, we derive a\ngeneralized energy-time uncertainty relation from these entropies.\nConsequently, we observe that the dispersion relation undergoes modification\ndue to the non-extensivity introduced by the entropies $S_{+}$ and $S_{-}$.\nThese modifications play a significant role at the Planck scale, but are\nnegligible in the classical regime of large distances and low energies.\nMoreover, the modified uncertainty relation results in a maximum uncertainty in\nenergy, attributed to the negative deformation parameter associated with\nentropy $S_{+}$. Conversely, the deformation parameter linked with $S_{-}$\nleads to the emergence of a minimum time interval. In the Planck regime, the\nminimum time interval is on the order of the Planck time, while the maximum\nuncertainty in energy reaches the Planck energy. These findings imply that\nquantum gravity effects can be connected with non-extensive statistics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
