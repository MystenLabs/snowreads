These bosonic dark matter halos can be\nviewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods\nused for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly\napplied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are\ncategorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles\ncomposing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various\nmodels from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution\ninduces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that\nexplain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By\nexploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable\ngalactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the\napparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible\nexplanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
