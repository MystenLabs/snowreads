{"id":"2408.08176","title":"General theory of moving Fabry-Perot","authors":"Lingze Duan","authorsParsed":[["Duan","Lingze",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 14:24:07 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-16","timestamp":1723731847000,"abstract":"  In a follow-up effort to our prior report on the optical transmission of a\nmoving Fabry-Perot \\cite{Pyvovar}, this work seeks to establish a general\nframework that describes the transmission and reflection properties of a\nFabry-Perot interferometer when key components in its operation system,\nincluding the light source, the detector and the interferometer itself, have\nrelative motions against each other along their common optical axis. Our\nanalysis indicates that these movements result in various new factors in the\ntransmission and reflection coefficients, which all find their roots in the\nDoppler effect. As a demonstration of its potential application, the new theory\nis applied to the Pound-Drever-Hall frequency-locking technique. It is shown\nthat velocity-induced frequency modulations are effectively added to the laser\nfrequency due to the motions, and such excess frequency noise can be impactful\nin certain applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
