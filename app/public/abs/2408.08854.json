Our approach involves a new technique, Hamiltonian\nsymmetrization. Essentially, we prove that every autonomous Hamiltonian\ndiffeomorphism is conjugate to an element C-close in the Hofer metric to one\ngenerated by a function of the height.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
