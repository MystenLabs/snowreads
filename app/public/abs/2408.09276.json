This remarkable process\nattracted the attention of the biomolecular electronics community, which aims\nto study and understand the underlying electronic transport through these\nproteins by contacting ensembles of PSI with solid-state metallic contacts.\nThis paper extends published work of immobilizing monolayers of PSI with a\nspecific orientation, by using organophosphonate self-assembled molecules with\nhydrophilic heads on ultra-flat titanium nitride. Electrical measurements\ncarried out with eutectic GaIn top contacts showed current rectification ratios\nof up to ~200. The previously proposed rectification mechanism, relying on the\nprotein's internal electric dipole, was inquired by measuring shifts in the\nwork function. Our straightforward bottom-up fabrication method may allow for\nfurther experimental studies on PSI molecules, such as embedding them in\nsolid-state, transparent top contact schemes for optoelectronic measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
