We uncover long-lived X-ray (Chandra)\nand radio/millimeter (VLA, MeerKAT, and ALMA) afterglow emission, detected to\n$\\sim 37~$days and $\\sim 20~$days (rest frame), respectively. We measure a wide\njet ($\\sim 10.4^\\circ$) and relatively high circumburst density ($\\sim\n0.07~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$) compared to the short GRB population. Our data cannot be\neasily fit with a standard forward shock model, but they are generally well fit\nwith the incorporation of a refreshed forward shock and a reverse shock at $<\n1~$day. We incorporate GRB 231117A into a larger sample of 132 X-ray detected\nevents, 71 of which were radio-observed (17 cm-band detections), for a\nsystematic study of the distributions of redshifts, jet and afterglow\nproperties, galactocentric offsets, and local environments of events with and\nwithout detected radio afterglows. Compared to the entire short GRB population,\nthe majority of radio-detected GRBs are at relatively low redshifts ($z < 0.6$)\nand have high circumburst densities ($> 10^{-2}~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$), consistent\nwith their smaller ($< 8~$kpc) projected galactocentric offsets. We\nadditionally find that 70% of short GRBs with opening angle measurements were\nradio-detected, indicating the importance of radio afterglows in jet\nmeasurements, especially in the cases of wide ($> 10^\\circ$) jets where\nobservational evidence of collimation may only be detectable at radio\nwavelengths. Owing to improved observing strategies and the emergence of\nsensitive radio facilities, the number of radio-detected short GRBs has\nquadrupled in the past decade.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
