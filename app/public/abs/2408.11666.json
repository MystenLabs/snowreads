Here we design and\nimplement a multiplexed NV sensing platform that allows us to read out many\nsingle NV centers simultaneously using a low-noise camera. Using this platform,\nwe coherently manipulate and read out the spin states of hundreds of individual\nNV centers in parallel, achieving comparable magnetic field sensitivity to\nconfocal measurements. We also implement a parallelized version of\nspin-to-charge-conversion readout for low NV center spin state readout noise\nand use it to demonstrate multiplexed covariance magnetometry, in which we\nmeasure six two-point magnetic field correlators from four NV centers\nsimultaneously. The number of correlators we can measure is limited only by the\navailable laser power, opening the door to massively multiplexed covariance\nmagnetometry. Our platform significantly increases the throughput and broadens\nthe applications of nanoscale sensing using diamond quantum sensors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
