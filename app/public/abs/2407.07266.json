In recent years, they have become extremely successful in generating\nmultimedia content. However, it is still unknown if such models can be used to\ngenerate high-quality datasets of physical models. In this work, we use a\nLandau-Ginzburg-like diffusion model to infer the distribution of a $2D$\nbond-diluted Ising model. Our approach is simple and effective, and we show\nthat the generated samples reproduce correctly the statistical and critical\nproperties of the physical model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
