Importantly, we find that the same combination of annuli will cloak\nany possible mode of imposed deformation or loading, for any randomly chosen\nadmixture of imposed compression, pure shear and simple shear, without the need\nto re-design the cloak for different deformation modes. A full range of\ncircular inclusions can be cloaked in this way, from soft to stiff. In\nconsequence, we suggest that an inclusion of any arbitrary shape can also be\ncloaked, by first enveloping it in a stiff circle, then cloaking the combined\nstructure with three annuli as described. Given that a single inclusion can be\nfully cloaked in this way, even at near field close to the cloaking perimeter,\nit also follows that multiple such neutral inclusions arranged with arbitrarily\nhigh packing fraction in a surrounding medium can also be cloaked. We confirm\nthis by direct simulation. This indicates a possible route to fabricating\ncomposite materials with the same global mechanical response as a counterpart\nhomogeneous material, and with uniform strain and stress fields outwith the\ncloaked inclusions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
