The May\nsuperstorm was characterized by a sudden impulse (SI+) amplitude of +88 nT,\nfollowed by a three-step storm main phase development which had a total\nduration of ~9 hr. The cause of the first storm main phase with a peak SYM-H\nintensity of -183 nT was a fast forward interplanetary shock (magnetosonic Mach\nnumber Mms ~7.2) and an interplanetary sheath with southward interplanetary\nmagnetic field component Bs of ~40 nT. The cause of the second storm main phase\nwith a SYM-H intensity of -354 nT was a deepening of the sheath Bs to ~43 nT. A\nmagnetosonic wave (Mms ~0.6) compressed the sheath to a high magnetic field\nstrength of ~71 nT. Intensified Bs of ~48 nT was the cause of the third and\nmost intense storm main phase with a SYM-H intensity of -518 nT. Three magnetic\ncloud events with Bs fields of ~25-40 nT occurred in the storm recovery phase,\nlengthening the recovery to ~2.8 days. At geosynchronous orbit, ~76 keV to ~1.5\nMeV electrons exhibited ~1-3 orders of magnitude flux decreases following the\nshock/sheath impingement onto the magnetosphere. The cosmic ray decreases at\nDome C, Antarctica (effective vertical cutoff rigidity <0.01 GV) and Oulu,\nFinland (rigidity ~0.8 GV) were ~17% and ~11%, respectively relative to quite\ntime values. Strong ionospheric current flows resulted in extreme\ngeomagnetically induced currents of ~30-40 A in the sub-auroral region. The\nstorm period is characterized by strong polar region field-aligned currents,\nwith ~10 times intensification during the main phase, and equatorward expansion\ndown to ~50 deg geomagnetic (altitude-adjusted) latitude.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"obXdTrlKTKquYV_staDZ5xexmYd_U7iBLURMis8tI4M","pdfSize":"6697457"}
