Moreover, surface-active materials\nor surfactants can significantly alter interfacial dynamics by their adsorption\non fluid interfaces. The coupled effects of temperature- and surfactant-induced\nMarangoni stresses on migration bubbles in SRFs remain unexplored. We use a\nrobust lattice Boltzmann (LB) method based on central moments to simulate the\ntwo-fluid motions, capture interfaces, and compute the transport of energy and\nsurfactant concentration fields, and systematically study the surfactant-laden\nbubble dynamics in SRFs. When compared to motion of bubbles in normal fluids,\nin which they continuously migrate without a stationary behavior, our results\nshow that they exhibit dramatically different characteristics in SRFs. Not only\nis the bubble motion directed from the hot to the cold sides in SRFs, which is\nopposite to that in NFs, but, more importantly, the bubble attains an\nequilibrium position. In the absence of surfactants, such an equilibrium\nposition arises at the reference temperature occurring at the center of the\ndomain. The addition of surfactants moves the equilibrium location further\nupstream, which is controlled by the magnitude of the Gibbs elasticity\nparameter that determines the magnitude of the surface tension variation with\nsurfactants. The quadratic sensitivity coefficient of surface tension on\ntemperature associated with the SRF modulates this behavior. The lower this\nquantity, the greater is the role of surfactants modifying the equilibrium\nposition of the bubble in SRF. These findings provide new means to potentially\nmanipulate the bubble dynamics, and especially to tune its equilibrium states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eum76cVjBzSSuDErGP72dnHW42AEG9MG0sxJbpwq9pI","pdfSize":"2336423"}
