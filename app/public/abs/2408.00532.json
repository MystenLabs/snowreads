Under some\nspecific conditions, Belloum and Mallein in \\cite{BeMa21} showed that the\nmaximum position $M_t$ of all particles alive at time $t$, suitably centered by\na deterministic function $m_t$, converge weakly. In this work, we are\ninterested in the decay rate of the following upper large deviation\nprobability, as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$, \\[ {\\mathbb P}(M_t\\geq \\theta m_t),\\quad\n\\theta>1. \\] We shall show that the decay rate function exhibits phase\ntransitions depending on certain relations between $\\theta$, the variance of\nthe underling Brownian motion and the branching rate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"G4sVh9-vxauU6zdPyn67YbL4OBHx2EmclJpWxzW-kTY","pdfSize":"279739","txDigest":"GwC48CbcYCLmDS1vHXPFa5jooHLukZNKZV7vCHZkvwt","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
