The dynamics is derived from a production function that considers\ncapital and a generalized form of energy as inputs. Energy, the new variable,\nis depleted during the production process and has to be renewed, whereas\ncapital grows with production and decreases from depreciation. Dependent on\ntime scales and energy related control parameters, we obtain steady states of\nhigh or low production, but also sustained oscillations that show properties of\nbusiness cycles. We also find conditions for the coexistence of stable fixed\npoints and limit cycles. Our model allows to specify investment and saving\nfunctions for Kaldor's model of business cycles. We provide evidence for an\nendogenous origin of business cycles if depleting resources are taken into\naccount.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
