Here we demonstrate avalanche-breakdown-based\nremote detection of a 3.6 mCi alpha-particle source at a stand-off distance of\n10 m, using 70 ps, long wave infrared (lambda=9.2 micron) CO2 laser pulses.\nThis is ~10X longer than our previous results using a mid-IR laser. The primary\ndetection method is direct backscatter from microplasmas generated in the laser\nfocal volume. The backscatter signal is amplified as it propagates back through\nthe CO2 laser chain, enhancing sensitivity by >100X. We also characterize\nbreakdown plasmas with fluorescence imaging, and present a simple model to\nestimate backscattered signal as a function of the seed density profile in the\nlaser focal volume. All of this was achieved with a relatively long drive laser\nfocal geometry (f/200) that is readily scalable to >100 m.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
