This problem arises\nnaturally in the context of open quantum systems subject to decoherence. Here,\nwe develop a general theory to formalize and analyze QPP. We characterize\nproperties encoded as scalar functions of the system state that can be\npreserved time-locally via continuous control using smoothly varying,\ntime-dependent control Hamiltonians. The theory offers an intuitive geometric\ninterpretation involving the level sets of the target property and the stable\nand unstable points related to the noise channel. We present solutions for\nvarious noise channels and target properties, which are classified as trivially\ncontrollable, uncontrollable, or controllable. In the controllable scenario, we\ndemonstrate the existence of control Hamiltonian singularities and breakdown\ntimes, beyond which property preservation fails. QPP via Hamiltonian control is\ncomplementary to quantum error correction, as it does not require ancilla\nqubits or rely on measurement and feedback. It is also complementary to\ndynamical decoupling, since it uses only smooth Hamiltonians without pulsing\nand works in the regime of Markovian open system dynamics. From the perspective\nof control theory, this work addresses the challenge of tracking control for\nopen quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6xXRieymAh30WUJ7t_n7Oae0JTivJMjW3A_RR8QsrFs","pdfSize":"6244974"}
