For\n$x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\backslash\\{0\\}$ and $d\\ge1$ we show that the kernel\n$\\xi(x)$ is well-defined as a Hida distribution for all $H\\in(0,1/2]$. For\n$x=0$ and $d=1$, $\\xi(0)$ is a Hida distribution for all $H\\in(0,1)$. For\n$d\\ge2$, then $\\xi(0)$ is a Hida distribution only for $H\\in(0,1/d)$. To cover\nthe case $H\\in[1/d,1)$ we have to truncate the delta function so that\n$\\xi^{(N)}(0)$ is a Hida distribution whenever $2N(H-1)+Hd>1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JZXQuJXUpuOU_b1zCj_ZL85W8Jx58IrbPur6QCc5CRY","pdfSize":"211678"}
