X-ray pulsations from the system are detected by both missions.\nThe astrosat discovered a significant periodic signal at $\\sim 5619$ s in 2016\nand hxmt found a pulsation period at $\\sim 5291$ s in 2020. A comparison of its\nspin-period evolution with the present spin-period estimates shows that the\nneutron star in 4U 2206+54 now has recently undergoing a spin-up episode after\nattaining to its slow pulsations of ~5750~s around 2015 from its prolonged\nspin-down phase. The present average spin-up rate of the pulsar is found to be\nat $\\sim1.2\\times10^{-13}$ Hz~s$^{-1}$. The phase-averaged spectra of the\npulsar in 1-60\\kev could be explained with a high energy cutoff power-law\ncontinuum model, no evident line features are found with astrosat. The\napplication of Comptonization models such as comptt and compmag to the phase\naveraged spectra of 4U 2206+54 reveal a hotter source photon region near the\npulsar with an emission size extending to $\\sim 2-2.8$~km. Using the\nquasi-spherical settling accretion theory, we explain the present spin-up and\nthe possibility of strong magnetic field of the pulsar.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
