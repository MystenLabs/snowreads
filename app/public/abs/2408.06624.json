I propose new estimation\nand inference methods for the ATE in percentage points, with inference\nutilizing the Fenton-Wilkinson approximation. These methods are particularly\nrelevant for staggered difference-in-differences designs, where treatment\neffects often vary across groups and periods. I prove the methods' large-sample\nproperties and demonstrate their finite-sample performance through simulations,\nrevealing substantial discrepancies between conventional and proposed measures.\nTwo empirical applications further underscore the practical importance of these\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
