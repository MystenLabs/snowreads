Achieving real-time PBNR\non mobile devices is challenging.\n  This paper proposes RTGS, a PBNR system that for the first time delivers\nreal-time neural rendering on mobile devices while maintaining human visual\nquality. RTGS combines two techniques. First, we present an efficiency-aware\npruning technique to optimize rendering speed. Second, we introduce a Foveated\nRendering (FR) method for PBNR, leveraging humans' low visual acuity in\nperipheral regions to relax rendering quality and improve rendering speed. Our\nsystem executes in real-time (above 100 FPS) on Nvidia Jetson Xavier board\nwithout sacrificing subjective visual quality, as confirmed by a user study.\nThe code is open-sourced at [https://github.com/horizon-research/Fov-3DGS].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
