In this paper, we establish global\nwell-posedness results for certain parameter regimes and prove finite-time\nblow-up phenomena under specific conditions. Our analysis relies on stability\ntheory, energy estimates, and virial identities adapted to the DINLS model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TIw1Xq4O9TuvhJok55YJQ9Vl1ay4Esx_yMUAzYcnPBw","pdfSize":"367277"}
