In general, numerous model parameters are\ninvolved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories\nwith experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency\nrelations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the\ninformation of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent\nconsistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories\nand argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity\ntheories.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0dtSPvo2Mjtiql_99o3HVCj8tAG4-ZMYklLTSo9HwiA","pdfSize":"551353"}
