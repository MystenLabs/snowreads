This\nstudy identifies, appraises and synthesizes published studies on the use of AI\nfor the prognosis of COVID-19. Method: Electronic search was performed using\nMedline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest. Studies that\nexamined machine learning or deep learning methods to determine the prognosis\nof COVID-19 using CT or chest X-ray images were included. Polled sensitivity,\nspecificity area under the curve and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated.\nResult: A total of 36 articles were included; various prognosis-related issues,\nincluding disease severity, mechanical ventilation or admission to the\nintensive care unit and mortality, were investigated. Several AI models and\narchitectures were employed, such as the Siamense model, support vector\nmachine, Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and convolutional neural\nnetworks. The models achieved 71%, 88% and 67% sensitivity for mortality,\nseverity assessment and need for ventilation, respectively. The specificity of\n69%, 89% and 89% were reported for the aforementioned variables. Conclusion:\nBased on the included articles, machine learning and deep learning methods used\nfor the prognosis of COVID-19 patients using radiomic features from CT or CXR\nimages can help clinicians manage patients and allocate resources more\neffectively. These studies also demonstrate that combining patient demographic,\nclinical data, laboratory tests and radiomic features improves model\nperformances.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
