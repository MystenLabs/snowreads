This paper\norganizes and documents constraints on the size of these space stations. Human\nfrailty, station design, and construction impose these constraints. Human\nlimitations include gravity, radiation, air pressure, rotational stability,\npopulation, and psychology. Station design limitations include gravity,\npopulation, material, geometry, mass, air pressure, and rotational stability.\nLimits on space station construction include construction approaches, very\nlarge stations, and historic station examples. This paper documents all these\nconstraints for thoroughness and review; however, only a few constraints\nsignificantly limit the station size. This paper considers rotating stations\nwith radii greater than 10 kilometers. Such stations may seem absurd today;\nhowever, with robotic automation and artificial intelligence, such sizes may\nbecome feasible in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Popular Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0g3euScZG474JaW81-hzJFw2D6Mk5Yu66Sx8MmIL1Pk","pdfSize":"3159602"}
