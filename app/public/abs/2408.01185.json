We provide existence and uniqueness results in a general\nframework with relatively general regularity assumptions on the coefficients.\nWe show how such stochastic equations arise within the modern paradigm of\nderivative pricing where a central counterparty (CCP) requires the members to\ndeposit variation and initial margins to cover their exposure. In the case when\nthe initial margin is proportional to the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of\nthe contract price, we apply our general result to define the price as a\nsolution of a MKABSDE. We provide several linear and non-linear simpler\napproximations, which we solve using different numerical (deterministic and\nMonte-Carlo) methods.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Pricing of Securities","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
