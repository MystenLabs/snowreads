Recent approaches attempt to straighten these flow trajectories to\ngenerate high-quality samples with fewer function evaluations, typically\nthrough iterative rectification methods or optimal transport solutions. In this\npaper, we introduce Consistency Flow Matching (Consistency-FM), a novel FM\nmethod that explicitly enforces self-consistency in the velocity field.\nConsistency-FM directly defines straight flows starting from different times to\nthe same endpoint, imposing constraints on their velocity values. Additionally,\nwe propose a multi-segment training approach for Consistency-FM to enhance\nexpressiveness, achieving a better trade-off between sampling quality and\nspeed. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our Consistency-FM\nsignificantly improves training efficiency by converging 4.4x faster than\nconsistency models and 1.7x faster than rectified flow models while achieving\nbetter generation quality.
