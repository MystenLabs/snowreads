We report results of our methods\non four commonly used intent classification datasets and compare against\nprevious works of a similar nature. Our work shows promising results for\ndataless classification scaling to a large number of unseen intents. We show\ncompetitive results and significant improvements (+6.12\\% Avg.) over strong\nzero-shot baselines, all without training on labelled or task-specific data.\nFurthermore, we provide qualitative error analysis of the shortfalls of this\nmethodology to help guide future research in this area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
