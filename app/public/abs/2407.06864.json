This generalizes\nearlier results on graph conditions. Furthermore we introduce a notion of\nwitnesses, allowing the detection of infinite models in some cases. To ensure\ncompleteness, paths in a tableau must be fair, where fairness requires that all\nparts of a condition are processed eventually. Since the correctness arguments\nare non-trivial, we rely on coinductive proof methods and up-to techniques that\nstructure the arguments. We distinguish between two types of categories:\ncategories where all sections are isomorphisms, allowing for a simpler tableau\ncalculus that includes finite model generation; in categories where this\nrequirement does not hold, model generation does not work, but we still obtain\na sound and complete calculus.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
