The newly proposed clustering variant leverages the concept\nof similarity and higher-order interactions across multiple subspaces to group\ndata into clusters. To showcase the merit of SPINEX, a thorough set of\nbenchmarking experiments was carried out against 13 algorithms, namely,\nAffinity Propagation, Agglomerative, Birch, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture, HDBSCAN,\nK-Means, KMedoids, Mean Shift, MiniBatch K-Means, OPTICS, Spectral Clustering,\nand Ward Hierarchical. Then, the performance of all algorithms was examined\nacross 51 synthetic and real datasets from various domains, dimensions, and\ncomplexities. Furthermore, we present a companion complexity analysis to\ncompare the complexity of SPINEX to that of the aforementioned algorithms. Our\nresults demonstrate that SPINEX can outperform commonly adopted clustering\nalgorithms by ranking within the top-5 best performing algorithms and has\nmoderate complexity. Finally, a demonstration of the explainability\ncapabilities of SPINEX, along with future research needs, is presented.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
