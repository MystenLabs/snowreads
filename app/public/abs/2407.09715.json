With the\nengagement of a noncommutative Schwartz' kernel theorem on the quantum torus, a\nspecific test for Schatten class properties of bounded operators on the quantum\ntorus is established.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
