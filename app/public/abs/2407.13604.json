We extend many of Sam--Snowden's far-reaching results from characteristic\nzero to this setting. For example, while the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of\na finitely generated GL-equivariant $S$-module need not be finite in positive\ncharacteristic, we show that the resolution still has finitely many \"linear\nstrands of higher slope\".\n  The crux of this paper is two technical results. The first is an extension to\npositive characteristic of Snowden's recent linearization of Draisma's\nembedding theorem which we use to study the generic category of $S$-modules.\nThe second is a Nagpal-type \"shift theorem\" about torsion $S$-modules for which\nwe introduce certain categorifications of the Hasse derivative. These two\nresults together allow us to obtain explicit generators for the derived\ncategory. In a follow-up paper, we also use these results to prove finiteness\nresults for local cohomology modules.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
