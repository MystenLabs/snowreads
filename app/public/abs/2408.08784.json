Rapid and reliable prognosis are\ncrucial for effective patient stratification and informed treatment\ndecision-making. In this study, we aim to enhance image-based prognosis by\nlearning a robust feature representation shared between prognosis and the\nclinical and demographic variables most highly correlated with it. Our approach\nmimics clinical decision-making by reinforcing the model to learn valuable\nprognostic data embedded in the image. We propose a 3D multi-task image model\nto predict prognosis, Glasgow Coma Scale and age, improving accuracy and\ninterpretability. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art baseline\nimage models, and demonstrates superior performance in ICH prognosis compared\nto four board-certified neuroradiologists using only CT scans as input. We\nfurther validate our model with interpretability saliency maps.
