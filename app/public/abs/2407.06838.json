However, research\ninto the potential risk associated with backdoor attacks in asynchronous event\ndata has been scarce, leaving related tasks vulnerable to potential threats.\nThis paper has uncovered the possibility of directly poisoning event data\nstreams by proposing Event Trojan framework, including two kinds of triggers,\ni.e., immutable and mutable triggers. Specifically, our two types of event\ntriggers are based on a sequence of simulated event spikes, which can be easily\nincorporated into any event stream to initiate backdoor attacks. Additionally,\nfor the mutable trigger, we design an adaptive learning mechanism to maximize\nits aggressiveness. To improve the stealthiness, we introduce a novel loss\nfunction that constrains the generated contents of mutable triggers, minimizing\nthe difference between triggers and original events while maintaining\neffectiveness. Extensive experiments on public event datasets show the\neffectiveness of the proposed backdoor triggers. We hope that this paper can\ndraw greater attention to the potential threats posed by backdoor attacks on\nevent-based tasks.
