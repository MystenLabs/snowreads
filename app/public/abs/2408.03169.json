Also, some characterizations and many fundamental results regarding\nthis new concept are obtained. Moreover, the relationships between the concepts\ndefined within the scope of this study and some other types of local closed\nsets in the literature have been revealed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
