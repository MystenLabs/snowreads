We report the impact of isovalent lanthanide substitution\non the buckling, structural phase transitions, and electronic and magnetic\nproperties of Gd$_x$La$_{1-x}$PtSb films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)\non c-plane sapphire substrates. The Gd$_x$La$_{1-x}$PtSb films form a solid\nsolution from x = 0 to 1 and retain the polar hexagonal structure ($P6_3 mc$)\nout to $x \\leq 0.95$. With increasing $x$, the PtSb buckling increases and the\nout of plane lattice constant $c$ decreases due to the lanthanide contraction.\nWhile hexagonal LaPtSb is a highly conductive polar metal, the carrier density\ndecreases with $x$ until an abrupt phase transition to a zero band overlap\nsemimetal is found for cubic GdPtSb at $x=1$. The magnetic susceptibility peaks\nat small but finite $x$, which we attribute to Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida\n(RKKY) coupling between localized $4f$ moments, whose concentration increases\nwith $x$, and free carriers that decrease with $x$. Samples with $x\\geq 0.3$\nshow antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss behavior and a Neel temperature that\nincreases with $x$. The Gd$_x$La$_{1-x}$PtSb system provides opportunities to\ndramatically alter the polar buckling and concentration of local $4f$ moments,\nfor tuning chiral spin textures and topological phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"McQMod8YiEK4DvI2_UHVLZ7Lko4-tdHoANaMXvcR180","pdfSize":"2159679"}
