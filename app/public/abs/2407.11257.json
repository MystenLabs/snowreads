Previous approximate expressions in the\nliterature diverge as $q$ approaches 2 (or 0, depending on convention). In\ncontrast, our derived formula provides an exact, smooth function for all real\nvalues of $q$, expressed as an infinite series expansion involving Tsallis\nentropies with sequential entropic indices, coupled with Bernoulli numbers.\nThis formulation is achieved through the analytic continuation of the Riemann\nzeta function, stemming from the $q$-deformed factorials. Thus, our formula\noffers a distinctive characterisation of Tsallis entropy within the\n$q$-deformed combinatorics. Furthermore, we discuss extending our results to\nencompass more general, affinity-sensitive cases based on the previously\nestablished framework of affinity-based extended entropy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
