These polynomials\nare usually resummed using Pad\\'e approximants obtained first assuming that the\nlogarithms are constant, and then replacing them back into the resulting\nrational functions. A recent study pointed out that this procedure introduces\nspurious logarithmic terms when the resummed functions are reexpanded. We\ntherefore explore analytically more consistent resummation schemes. Here we\nupdate the TEOBResumS-Dali waveform model for spin-aligned, noncircularized,\ncoalescing black hole binaries by systematically implementing new (still Pad\\'e\nbased) resummations for all EOB functions. Once the model is informed by 51\nNumerical Relativity simulations this new approach proves key in lowering the\nmaximum EOB/NR unfaithfulness $\\bar{F}_{\\rm EOBNR}^{\\rm max}$ for the\n$\\ell=m=2$ mode (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range\n$10-200M_{\\odot}$) over the whole Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog of 534\nwaveforms. A median mismatch of $3.418\\times 10^{-4}$ is achieved, which is a\nmarked improvement on the previous value, $1.06\\times 10^{-3}$. The largest\nvalue, $\\bar{\\cal F}^{\\rm max}_{\\rm EOBNR}\\sim 10^{-2}$, is found for an\nequal-mass, equal-spin simulation with dimensionless spins $\\sim +0.994$; only\nsix configurations (all equal-mass, and with equal spins larger than $+0.97$)\nare above $5\\times 10^{-3}$. Results for eccentric binaries are similarly\nexcellent (well below $10^{-2}$ and mostly around $10^{-3}$). For scattering\nconfigurations, we find an unprecedented EOB/NR agreement ($<1\\%$) for\nrelatively small values of the scattering angle, though differences\nprogressively increase as the threshold of immediate capture is approached.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
