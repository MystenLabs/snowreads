It has found applications in network\ncoherence, machine learning, and computational graphics, among others. In spite\nof BD's importance, efficient algorithms for the exact computation or\napproximation of this metric on large graphs remain notably absent. In this\nwork, we provide several algorithms to estimate BD, building on a novel\nformulation of this metric. These algorithms enjoy locality property (that is,\nthey only read a small portion of the input graph) and at the same time possess\nprovable performance guarantees. In particular, our main algorithms approximate\nthe BD between any node pair with an arbitrarily small additive error $\\eps$ in\ntime $O(\\frac{1}{\\eps^2}\\text{poly}(\\log\\frac{n}{\\eps} ))$. Furthermore, we\nperform an extensive empirical study on several benchmark networks, validating\nthe performance and accuracy of our algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
