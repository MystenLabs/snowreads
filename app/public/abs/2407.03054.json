Illustrating that open-loop\nB-MBM, in the absence of feedback, only achieves a diversity order of one.\nHowever, with feedback and optimal weight selection in closed-loop\nconfigurations, a diversity order of two becomes achievable. Notably, the\nclosed-loop B-MBM, with analytically computed optimal weights, performs\nequivalent to Alamouti-coded BPSK transmission, demonstrating feasibility even\nwith just one radio frequency chain when feedback is available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
