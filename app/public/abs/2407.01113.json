We consider the Schwarzschild solution written in the spatially-flat\ncoordinates in the self-accelerating branch as the background solution. We\nclarify the gauge transformations for the $\\ell=0$, $1$, and $\\geq2$ modes with\n$\\ell$ being the angular multipole moments under the joint foliation-preserving\ndiffeomorphism transformation. Requiring that the asymptotic regions in the\nphysical and fiducial sectors share the same Minkowski vacua, the solution to\nthe $\\ell=0$ perturbations can be absorbed by a redefinition of the\nSchwarzschild background. In order to analyze the $\\ell=1$ and $\\geq 2$ modes,\nfor simplicity we focus on the effectively massless case, where the constant\nparameter measuring the ratio of the proper times between the two sectors is\nset to unity and the effective mass terms in the equations of motion vanish. We\nalso find that as a particular solution all the $\\ell=1$ perturbations vanish\nby imposing their regularity at spatial infinity. For each of the $\\ell\\geq 2$\nmodes, in the effectively massless case, we highlight the existence of the\nexpected two propagating modes and four instantaneous modes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
