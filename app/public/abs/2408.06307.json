Momentum dependence gives insight into decay of\ncorrelation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different\ncorrelation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the\nkicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular\nrandom matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated\nresonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime\nwith a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe\na huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions due to an\nalmost conserved operator. An exact expression for the singular values of the\noperator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a\nspecial point.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"utvNVDiZsZDEGaXDOXGCxiKjOSP30pv59Y73RK_VsVs","pdfSize":"945437"}
