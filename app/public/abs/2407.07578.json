When such quantum Hall systems are coupled with external\nsources for charge, energy, and momentum currents, they exhibit invariance\nunder the Milne boost as well as under the gauge and general coordinate\ntransformations. We construct the most general effective action consistent with\nall the symmetries in the derivative expansion, where an electric field is\nregarded as order of unity so as to allow for nonlinear responses. The\nresulting action is shown to consist of four terms proportional to the Hall\nconductivity and viscosity and the energy density and magnetization. We then\ncompute the local currents induced by electromagnetic fields, revealing\nuniversal relations among distinct kinds of responses. In particular, we find\nthe Hall conductivity determining the longitudinal conductivity at nonzero\nfrequency and the Hall viscosity contributing to the nonlinear electrothermal\nconductivity at nonzero wave number.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
