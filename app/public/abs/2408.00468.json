In this manuscript, we show that the resonance can also\nbe generated in the absence of the 1/3 condition by employing an artificial\natom with tunable transition frequency. To realize the protocol, the modulation\nfrequency should be comparable to the cavity frequency in order to induce a\ncounter-rotating interaction in the effective Hamiltonian. In this way,\nthree-photon Rabi oscillations can be observed in a small-detuning regime, thus\navoiding the excitation of high-energy states. We derive an effective\nHamiltonian (equivalent to the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian) to determine\nthe magnitude of the energy splitting and the resonance position. Numerical\nsimulations results show that the protocol not only generates a three-photon\nresonance, but also has a detectable output photon flux. We hope the protocol\ncan be exploited for the realization of Fock-state sources and the generation\nof multiparticle entanglement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
