To overcome the limitations of traditional methods,\nthis study provides an in-depth theoretical analysis of how to maximize\ninteractions and information fusion among brain regions. Building on the\nresults of this analysis, we propose to identify the hierarchical emotional\nareas in the human brain through multi-source information fusion and graph\nmachine learning methods. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the identified\nhierarchical emotional areas, from lower to higher levels, primarily facilitate\nthe fundamental process of emotion perception, the construction of basic\npsychological operations, and the coordination and integration of these\noperations. Overall, our findings provide unique insights into the brain\nmechanisms underlying specific emotions based on the psychological\nconstructionist hypothesis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
