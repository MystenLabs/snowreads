Given a digraph $G$\nwith a not necessarily proper $2$-coloring of $V(G)$, the Digraph Placement\ngame played on $G$ by the players Left and Right, who play alternately, is\ndefined as follows. On her turn, Left chooses a blue vertex which is deleted\nalong with all of its out-neighbours. On his turn Right chooses a red vertex,\nwhich is deleted along with all of its out-neighbours. A player loses if on\ntheir turn they cannot move. We show constructively that Digraph Placement is a\nuniversal partisan ruleset; for all partisan combinatorial games $X$ there\nexists a Digraph Placement game, $G$, such that $G = X$. Digraph Placement and\nmany other games including Nim, Poset Game, Col, Node Kayles, Domineering, and\nArc Kayles are instances of a class of placement games that we call conflict\nplacement games. We prove that $X$ is a conflict placement game if and only if\nit has the same literal form as a Digraph Placement game. A corollary of this\nis that deciding the winner of a Digraph Placement game is PSPACE-hard. Next,\nfor a game value $X$ we prove bounds on the order of a smallest Digraph\nPlacement game $G$ such that $G = X$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BbrnO-NoNCO4hvRRD3118JstP2i7tlnInrxpigygPQw","pdfSize":"281299","objectId":"0x1dc9a0e021069f508196ce35194ed4ccf9df4ebadea9665c5e0b38a0d1ae38fb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
