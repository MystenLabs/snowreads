Our core ingredient is a\nnovel hierarchy deformation model, which captures motions of objects with a\ntree-structured bones. Our hierarchy system decomposes motions based on the\ngranularity and reveals the correlations between parts without exploiting any\nprior structural knowledge. We further propose to regularize the bones to be\npositioned at the basis of motions, centers of parts, sufficiently covering\nrelated surfaces of the part. This is achieved by our bone occupancy function,\nwhich identifies whether a given 3D point is placed within the bone. Coupling\nthe proposed components, our framework offers several clear advantages: (1)\nusers can obtain animatable 3D models of the arbitrary objects in improved\nquality from their casual videos, (2) users can manipulate 3D models in an\nintuitive manner with minimal costs, and (3) users can interactively add or\ndelete control points as necessary. The experimental results demonstrate the\nefficacy of our framework on diverse instances, in reconstruction quality,\ninterpretability and easier manipulation.
