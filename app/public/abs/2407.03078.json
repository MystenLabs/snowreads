We establish an upper\nbound for this counting function which holds when $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies a\nstrong curvature condition, first introduced by Schindler-Yamagishi in\n\\cite{schindler2022density}. Further, even in the isotropic case when\n$\\delta_1=\\ldots=\\delta_R=\\delta$, we obtain an asymptotic formula which holds\nbeyond the range of distance to $\\mathcal{M}$ established in\n\\cite{schindler2022density}. Our result is also a generalization of the work of\nJ.J. Huang \\cite{huangduke} for hypersurfaces.\n  As an application, we establish for the first time an upper bound for the\nHausdorff dimension of the set of weighted simultaneously well approximable\npoints on a manifold $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfying the strong curvature condition,\nwhich agrees with the lower bound obtained by Allen-Wang in\n\\cite{allen2022note}. Moreover, for $R>1$, we obtain a new upper bound for the\nnumber of rational points \\textit{on} $\\mathcal{M}$, which goes beyond the\nbound in an analogue of Serre's dimension growth conjecture for submanifolds of\n$\\mathbb{R}^M$ .\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
