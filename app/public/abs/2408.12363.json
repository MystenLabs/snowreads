We develop a general HA for a cold spatially inhomogeneous Bose gas\nassuming two different temporal and spatial scales and obtain the energy as a\nfunctional of both fast inner quantum mode and slow macroscopic mode. The\nequations governing the fast and slow modes are obtained from this functional\nby their independent variations. The fast mode is the wave function in the\nstationary state at local density which can be ground, excited with a nonzero\natom momenta, or a superposition of more than one states. The energy eigenvalue\n(or expectation value) of this local wave function universally enters the\nhydrodynamic equation for the slow mode in the form of the local chemical\npotential which incorporates the inner local momentum. For zero inner momenta\nand particular choices of this eigenvalue as a function of gas density, this\nequation reduces to the known equations based on the local density\napproximation. If however the inner momenta are nonzero, the equation includes\nthe interaction between these momenta and the slow mode velocity. Relation\nbetween this general HA and the standard local density approximation is\nelaborated. Two effects of the local momenta and their density dependence on\nthe soliton solutions are demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
