Using\nmicroARPES, we measure the spatially-dependent modifications of the electronic\nstructure of the sample following a short current pulse. We observe that, in\nsome regions of the sample, a Fermi surface emerges, while other regions remain\ngapped. A detailed study of the band structure in these different regions\nsuggests that the metallic parts are in a state similar to the nearly\ncommensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) state, where the gaps are suppressed\nand a band crosses the Fermi level. Furthermore, we find that the metallic and\ninsulating regions of the sample exhibit different dispersions normal to the\nplanes. This observation is consistent with a scenario in which the current\npulse breaks the star-of-David dimers present in the commensurate charge\ndensity wave (C-CDW) state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
