But for future large surveys like the Large Survey of\nSpace and Time undertaken by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, the large\nstatistical power of the promised catalogues will make the photometric\ncalibration uncertainties dominant in the error budget and will limit our\nability to use it for precision cosmology. The knowledge of the in situ\natmospheric transmission for each exposure, each season and on average for the\nentire survey can help reaching the subpercent precision for magnitudes. I will\nshow the impact of precipitable water vapour during a cosmological survey on\nsupernova cosmology. Then I will present how AuxTel at the Vera Rubin\nObservatory have the capability to measure the on-site atmospheric transmission\nin real time to improve LSST photometric calibration for precision cosmology.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"r1KoyZ7jCbgc-DzdnrHu3_o8rOp7FQrJUSwXYmZmW2U","pdfSize":"920632"}
