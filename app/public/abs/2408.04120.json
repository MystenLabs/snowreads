Francisco, Mermin, and Schweig developed formulas for the Hilbert series\nand Betti numbers of strongly stable ideals in terms of their Borel generators.\nIn this work, a specialization of strongly stable ideals is presented which\nfurther restricts the subset of relevant generators. A choice of weight vector\n$w\\in\\mathbb{N}_{> 0}^n$ restricts the set of strongly stable ideals to a\nsubset designated as $w$-stable ideals. This restriction further compresses the\nBorel generators to a subset termed the weighted Borel generators of the ideal.\nA new Macaulay2 package wStableIdeals.m2 has been developed alongside this\npaper and segments of code support computations within.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
