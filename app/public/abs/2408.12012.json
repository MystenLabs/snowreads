Pepper\nmild mottle virus (PMMoV), a plant RNA virus abundant in human feces and\nwastewater, has been used as a fecal contamination indicator and has been used\nto normalize wastewater measurements extensively. However, there has been\nlittle work to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of PMMoV in\nwastewater, which may influence the effectiveness of PMMoV for adjusting or\nnormalizing WBE measurements. Here, we investigate its variability across space\nand time using data collected over a two-year period from sewage treatment\nplants across the United States. We find that most variation in PMMoV\nmeasurements can be attributed to longitude and latitude followed by\nsite-specific variables. Further research into cross-geographical and -temporal\ncomparability of PMMoV-normalized pathogen concentrations would strengthen the\nutility of PMMoV in WBE.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
