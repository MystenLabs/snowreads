To reduce costs and maintain connectivity in IoT networks,\nenergy harvesting technologies are regarded as a promising solution. Notably,\ndue to its robust analytical and generative capabilities, generative artificial\nintelligence (GenAI) has demonstrated significant potential in optimizing\nenergy harvesting networks. Therefore, we discuss key applications of GenAI in\nimproving energy harvesting wireless networks for IoT in this article.\nSpecifically, we first review the key technologies of GenAI and the\narchitecture of energy harvesting wireless networks. Then, we show how GenAI\ncan address different problems to improve the performance of the energy\nharvesting wireless networks. Subsequently, we present a case study of unmanned\naerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled data collection and energy transfer. The case\nstudy shows distinctively the necessity of energy harvesting technology and\nverify the effectiveness of GenAI-based methods. Finally, we discuss some\nimportant open directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
