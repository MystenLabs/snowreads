We show that the\ncapacity increases for special Bell-diagonal states under amplitude damping\nchannel. The sudden death of the capacity occurs under depolarizing channel. We\nalso investigate the capacity evolution of Bell-diagonal states under Markovian\nchannels on the first subsystem $n$ times. It is shown that the capacity under\ndepolarizing channel decreases initially, then increases for small $n$ and tend\nto zero for large $n$. We find that under bit flip channel and amplitude\ndamping channel, the quantum battery capacity of special Bell-diagonal states\ntends to a constant for large $n$, namely, the frozen capacity occurs. The\ndynamics of the capacity of the Bell-diagonal states under two independent same\ntype local Markovian channels is also studied.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
