We perform a high-precision numerical\ncalculation using a lattice model in order to determine the dependence on these\nscales in the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We derive the leading de Sitter corrections\nto the flat-space entanglement entropy for subhorizon entangling radii. We\nanalyze the structure of the finite-size effects and we show that the\ncontribution to the entanglement entropy of the sector of the theory with\nvanishing angular momentum depends logarithmically on the size of the overall\nsystem, which extends beyond the horizon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"INydxuz7X-vvtegECZgFjrtHqX28u8r9ihZgK_jvzgo","pdfSize":"3615115"}
