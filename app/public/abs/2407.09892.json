When manipulating images, many\nediting tools offer a feature that allows the user to manipulate a limited\nselection of familiar colors. Editing by color name allows easy adjustment of\nelements like the \"blue\" of the sky or the \"green\" of trees. Inspired by this\napproach to color manipulation, we propose NamedCurves, a learning-based image\nenhancement technique that separates the image into a small set of named\ncolors. Our method learns to globally adjust the image for each specific named\ncolor via tone curves and then combines the images using an attention-based\nfusion mechanism to mimic spatial editing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method against several competing methods on the well-known Adobe 5K dataset\nand the PPR10K dataset, showing notable improvements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uZYVOIZ9OaGYFo4m2l0riTnreCRkiA9af8FOwcvtRHk","pdfSize":"5128654"}
