The core concept is that the evolution of\nmagnetization encapsulates thermodynamic information [R. da Silva, Int. J. Mod.\nPhys. C, 2350061 (2023)], which is directly reflected in the eigenvalues of\nthese matrices. When these evolutions are analyzed in the mean-field regime, an\nimportant question arises: Can the Langevin equation, when translated into\nmaps, perform the same function? Some studies suggest that this method may also\ncapture the chaotic behavior of certain systems. In this work, we propose that\nthe spectral properties of random matrices constructed from maps derived from\ndeterministic or stochastic differential equations can indicate the critical or\nchaotic behavior of such systems. For chaotic systems, we need only the\nevolution of iterated Hamiltonian equations, and for spin systems, the Langevin\nmaps obtained from mean-field equations suffice, thus avoiding the need for\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations or other techniques.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
