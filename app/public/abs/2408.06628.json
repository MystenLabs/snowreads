A\nnonlinear mathematical optimization model is developed to refine the world\nmodel, optimizing oscillation frequency and amplitude to improve resolution.\nThe findings suggest that this approach can double the conventional resolution,\npromising significant advancements in the accuracy of lunar landings, with\npotential real-time application.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
