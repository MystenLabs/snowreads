While the availability\nof large amounts of user data from social media, app store reviews, and support\nchannels bears many benefits, it still remains unclear how software development\nteams can effectively use this data. We present an LLM-powered approach called\nDeeperMatcher that helps agile teams use crowd-based requirements engineering\n(CrowdRE) in their issue and task management. We are currently implementing a\ncommand-line tool that enables developers to match issues with relevant user\nreviews. We validated our approach on an existing English dataset from a\nwell-known open-source project. Additionally, to check how well DeeperMatcher\nworks for other languages, we conducted a single-case mechanism experiment\nalongside developers of a local project that has issues and user feedback in\nBrazilian Portuguese. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the accuracy of\nour approach is highly dependent on the text embedding method used. We discuss\nfurther refinements needed for reliable crowd-based requirements engineering\nwith multilingual support.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
