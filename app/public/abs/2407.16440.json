We prove that every finite\ncentral extension of a definably connected solvable definable group in an\no-minimal structure is equivalent to a finite central extension which is\ndefinable without additional parameters. The proof relies on an o-minimal\nadaptation of the higher inflation-restriction exact sequence due to Hochschild\nand Serre. As in \\cite{jM83}, we also prove in o-minimal expansions of real\nclosed fields that the conjecture reduces to definably simple groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
