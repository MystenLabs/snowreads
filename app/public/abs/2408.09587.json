The spatial\nirregularity of the asymmetric confinement results in an effective asymmetric\nentropic bistable potential along the direction of transport. We investigate\nhow the frequency of the periodic field and the intensity of the noise impact\nthe average work done, focusing on its potential as a key metric for examining\nEntropic Stochastic Resonance (ESR). The study highlights the impact of\nconfinement asymmetry on reducing the average work done. Furthermore, we\nobserve a transition of average work done from a state dominated by energy to\none dominated by entropy, as we manipulate the magnitude of the transverse\nforce. In addition, an alternative quantity called the mean free flight time\n($T_{MFFT}$) is proposed to describe the ESR in the presence of asymmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
