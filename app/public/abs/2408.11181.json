Learning their graphical\nstructure from observational data has received a lot of attention in the\nliterature. When there exists no latent (unobserved) confounder, i.e., no\nunobserved direct common cause of some observed variables, learning algorithms\ncan be divided essentially into two classes: constraint-based and score-based\napproaches. The latter are often thought to be more robust than the former and\nto produce better results. However, to the best of our knowledge, when\nvariables are discrete, no score-based algorithm is capable of dealing with\nlatent confounders. This paper introduces the first fully score-based structure\nlearning algorithm searching the space of DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) that\nis capable of identifying the presence of some latent confounders. It is\njustified mathematically and experiments highlight its effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
