We discuss the\nphysical features of compact objects by employing bag model equation of state\nand construct the modified field equations in terms of Krori-Barua ansatz\ninvolving unknowns ($A,B,C$). The observational data of 4U 1820-30,~Vela\nX-I,~SAX J 1808.4-3658,~RXJ 1856-37 and Her X-I is used to calculate these\nunknowns and bag constant $\\mathfrak{B_c}$. Further, we observe the behavior of\nenergy density, radial and tangential pressure as well as anisotropy through\ngraphical interpretation for a viable model $\\mathcal{R}+\\varrho\\mathcal{Q}$ of\nthis gravity. For a particular value of the coupling constant $\\varrho$, we\nstudy the behavior of mass, compactness, redshift and the energy bounds. The\nstability of the considered stars is also checked by using two criteria. We\nconclude that our developed structure in this gravity is in well-agreement with\nall the physical requirements.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
