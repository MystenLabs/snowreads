We establish a\nLidskii-type formula for continuous singular traces on these ideals. Using this\nformula, we obtain a necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary\noperator being Dixmier measurable. These conditions are expressed in terms of\neigenvalues of an operator and an asymptotic of its zeta-function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
