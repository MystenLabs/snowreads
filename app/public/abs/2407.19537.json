The heterogeneity\nof various application interfaces often requires blind users to remember\ndifferent keyboard combinations and navigation methods to use each application\neffectively. To alleviate this significant interaction burden imposed by\nheterogeneous application interfaces, we present Savant, a novel assistive\ntechnology powered by large language models (LLMs) that allows blind screen\nreader users to interact uniformly with any application interface through\nnatural language. Novelly, Savant can automate a series of tedious screen\nreader actions on the control elements of the application when prompted by a\nnatural language command from the user. These commands can be flexible in the\nsense that the user is not strictly required to specify the exact names of the\ncontrol elements in the command. A user study evaluation of Savant with 11\nblind participants demonstrated significant improvements in interaction\nefficiency and usability compared to current practices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X1ddgEKBgv03yAFer8kj16k8yiMqth7DCCxz8x2vsUU","pdfSize":"7040026"}
