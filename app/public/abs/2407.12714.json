We develop a model to explain the carrier dynamics that underpins\nthe frequency response of the pulsed electroluminesence intensity. Higher\nmobilities enable larger active emission areas than previous reports, as well\nas stable emission over long timescales.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
