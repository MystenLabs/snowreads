The simulator, implemented in Python, supports traditional\nDijkstra's based routing as well as more advanced learning solutions,\nspecifically Q-Routing and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL)\nfrom our previous work. It uses an event-based approach with the SimPy module\nto accurately simulate packet creation, routing and queuing, providing\nreal-time tracking of queues and latency. The simulator is highly configurable,\nallowing adjustments in routing policies, traffic, ground and space layer\ntopologies, communication parameters, and learning hyperparameters. Key\nfeatures include the ability to visualize system motion and track packet paths.\nResults highlight significant improvements in end-to-end (E2E) latency using\nReinforcement Learning (RL)-based routing policies compared to traditional\nmethods. The source code, the documentation and a Jupyter notebook with\npost-processing results and analysis are available on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
