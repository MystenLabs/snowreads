We provide a linear-optical architecture with\nthese properties, compatible with arbitrary codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill\nqubits on generic lattices, and featuring a natural way to leverage physical\nnoise bias. Simulations involving hyperbolic surface codes, promising quantum\nlow-density parity-check codes, reveal a threshold comparable to the 2D surface\ncode at about a ten-fold improvement in encoding rate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
