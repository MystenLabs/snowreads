PINNs have been successfully applied\nto solve various forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations\n(PDEs). However, a notable challenge can emerge during the early training\nstages when solving inverse problems. Specifically, data losses remain high\nwhile PDE residual losses are minimized rapidly, thereby exacerbating the\nimbalance between loss terms and impeding the overall efficiency of PINNs. To\naddress this challenge, this study proposes a novel framework termed\ndata-guided physics-informed neural networks (DG-PINNs). The DG-PINNs framework\nis structured into two distinct phases: a pre-training phase and a fine-tuning\nphase. In the pre-training phase, a loss function with only the data loss is\nminimized in a neural network. In the fine-tuning phase, a composite loss\nfunction, which consists of the data loss, PDE residual loss, and, if\navailable, initial and boundary condition losses, is minimized in the same\nneural network. Notably, the pre-training phase ensures that the data loss is\nalready at a low value before the fine-tuning phase commences. This approach\nenables the fine-tuning phase to converge to a minimal composite loss function\nwith fewer iterations compared to existing PINNs. To validate the\neffectiveness, noise-robustness, and efficiency of DG-PINNs, extensive\nnumerical investigations are conducted on inverse problems related to several\nclassical PDEs, including the heat equation, wave equation, Euler--Bernoulli\nbeam equation, and Navier--Stokes equation. The numerical results demonstrate\nthat DG-PINNs can accurately solve these inverse problems and exhibit\nrobustness against noise in training data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
