For multi--component KP theory, corresponding Lax\nstructures are mainly constructed by matrix pseudo-differential operators for\nfixed discrete variables, or by matrix difference operators for even-component\ncases. Here we use Shiota method to construct Lax structure of 3-component KP\nhierarchy and its reduction by introducing two shift operators $\\Lambda_1$ and\n$\\Lambda_2$, where relations among different discrete variables can be easily\nfound. We believe the results here are quite typical for general\nmulti-component KP theory, which may be helpful for general cases.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
