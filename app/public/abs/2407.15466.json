We arrive at a consistent, nonstandard representation of the\nGalilei group which was disregarded long ago by supposedly unphysical\nproperties. The corresponding quantum (and classical) theory shares with the\nrelativistic one their fundamentals, and serves as a toy model to better\ncomprehend the unusual behavior of the tachyonic representation. For instance,\nwe see that evolution takes place in a spatial coordinate rather than time, as\nfor relativistic tachyons, but the modulus of the three-momentum is the same\nfor all Galilean observers, leading to a new dispersion relation for a Galilean\nsystem. Furthermore, the tachyonic objects described by the new representation\ncannot be regarded as localizable in the standard sense.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
