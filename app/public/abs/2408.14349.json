To address this gap, we systematize QES use cases and\ncategorize the system designs implemented to support these use cases,\nemphasizing the necessity to evaluate their respective strengths and weaknesses\nthrough usability studies. Additionally, we present findings from cognitive\nwalkthroughs conducted on use cases across four different QES systems. We\nanticipate that this work will serve as a foundation for a significant\nexpansion of research into the usability of Qualified Electronic Signatures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Other Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
