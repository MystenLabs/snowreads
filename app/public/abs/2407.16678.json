FitzHugh-Nagumo model is\na nonlinear dynamical system applicable to neurosciences, chemical kinetics,\ncell division, population dynamics, electronics, epidemiology, cardiac\nphysiology and pattern formation. Non-classical symmetry analysis has been\ncarried out to find invariant solutions. In many ways this finding makes the\ncorpus of asymptotics and numerics obsolete. Non singular, physically stable\nand meaningful solutions could now be found without distorting the actual model\nor introducing forced conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
