One of the key to these properties is the construction of the coarse\nspace used to solve a global coupling problem, which traditionally requires\ninformation about the underlying discretization. An algebraic formulation of\nthe coarse space reduces the complexity of its assembly. Furthermore,\nwell-chosen coarse basis functions within this space can better represent\nchanges in the problem's properties. Here we introduce an algebraic formulation\nof the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) based on the algebraic\nmultiscale solver (AMS) in the context of the two-level Schwarz method. We show\nhow AMS is related to other energy-minimizing coarse spaces. Furthermore, we\ncompare the AMS with other algebraic energy-minimizing spaces: the generalized\nDryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW), and the reduced dimension GDSW (RGDSW).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
