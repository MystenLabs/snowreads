To use such models in\nmorphogenesis and development requires to incorporate active forces. We\nconsider active geometric forces which respond to mean curvature gradients. Due\nto these forces perturbations in shape can induce tangential flows which can\nenhance the perturbation leading to shape instabilities. We numerically explore\nthese shape instabilities and analyse the resulting dynamics of closed surfaces\nwith constant enclosed volume. The numerical approach considers surface finite\nelements and a semi-implicit time stepping scheme and shows optimal convergence\nproperties, which have been proven for Stokes flow on stationary surfaces.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vK4n6bX4tK87xbfkbraAhIwdWWHl09Jnl0L_922EihU","pdfSize":"22186653"}
