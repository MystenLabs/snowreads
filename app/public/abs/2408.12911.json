Finite-size scaling of\ncorrelation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state\nin qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group\ncalculations, but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling\ndistribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations\nversus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\\mu}$ for $r \\ll L$\nand $C(r,L)=L^{-\\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L > 0$, where $\\mu > \\eta$ and the scaling\nfunction is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with\nprevious spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus\nhighlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
