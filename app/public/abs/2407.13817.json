We re-examine\nthis in the light of claimed tensions between the NO$\\nu$A and T2K long\nbaseline experiments, also taking into account data from the MINOS experiment.\nWe obtain leading limits on the $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ gauge coupling $g'$ versus dark\nphoton mass $m_{A'}$, and find no statistically significant alleviation of the\ntension from inclusion of the new physics effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
