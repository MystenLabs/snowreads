As an application of this\nresult and the atomic decomposition developed by S. Boza and M. Carro in [Proc.\nR. Soc. Edinb., 132 A (1) (2002), 25-43], we prove that the discrete Riesz\npotential $I_{\\alpha}$ defined on $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is a bounded operator\n$H^p(\\mathbb{Z}^n) \\to H^q(\\mathbb{Z}^n)$ for $\\frac{n-1}{n} < p <\n\\frac{n}{\\alpha}$ and $\\frac{1}{q} = \\frac{1}{p} - \\frac{\\alpha}{n}$, where $0\n< \\alpha < n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
