This article proposes a cloud-edge-terminal collaborative\narchitecture to support AIGC for autonomous driving. By delving into the unique\nproperties of AIGC services, this article initiates the attempts to construct\nmutually supportive AIGC and network systems for autonomous driving, including\ncommunication, storage and computation resource allocation schemes to support\nAIGC services, and leveraging AIGC to assist system design and resource\nmanagement.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
