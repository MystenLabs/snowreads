The spectra show evidence for a structural phase\ntransition around 200 K and a coexistence of phases, consistent with the\nresults of other measurement techniques. The NMR spectra and line shift\nmeasurements demonstrate a strong suppression of the local magnetic\nsusceptibility at high pressure. However, the spin-lattice relaxation ($1/T_1$)\nshows a clear power-law temperature dependence. This is inconsistent with a\ngapped singlet ground state of dimers and tetramers, as was previously\nproposed, and is instead evocative of a more exotic quantum spin liquid-like\nground state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
