It is shown that the STIRAP\ntechnique suppresses the occupation of the intermediate state, which is a\ncrucial factor for improvements in quantum sensing technology. Building on that\nadvantage, we develop and implement a generalized version of the Ramsey\ninterferometric scheme, employing half-STIRAP pulses to perform the necessary\nquantum-state manipulation with high fidelity. The enhanced robustness of the\nSTIRAP-based Ramsey scheme to variations in the pulse parameters is\nexperimentally demonstrated, showing good agreement with theoretical\npredictions. Our results pave the way for improving the long-term stability of\ndiamond-based sensors, such as gyroscopes and frequency standards.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kzpEobRE8yg0awNhuwNTdXD6vt5MLeJ6fDImlcyDc_c","pdfSize":"1271017"}
