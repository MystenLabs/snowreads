The cross sections are evaluated with an effective Lagrangian\nconstructed by the heavy-quark limit and chiral symmetry. Our estimations show\nthat at $P_\\pi=80$ GeV, the cross sections for $B(5279)$, $B^\\ast (5325)$,\n$B_0^\\ast (5738)$, $B_1^\\prime (5757)$, $B_1(5721)$ and $B_2^\\ast (5747)$\nproduction processes are estimated to be $3.19 \\sim 86.26$, $1.86\\sim 51.29$,\n$0.87 \\sim 24.25$, $0.84 \\sim 23.14$, $162.35 \\sim 4477.66$, and $57.16 \\sim\n1604.43$ nb, respectively, where uncertainties arise from the model parameter.\nIn addition, the cross sections for the corresponding bottom-strange mesons\nproduction processes are very similar. Moreover, our estimations indicate that\nthe ratios of these cross sections are almost independent on the model\nparameters. In particular, the cross-section ratios related to the states in\nthe same doublets are of order one, which is consistent with the expectation of\nheavy-quark limit. The cross sections related to the states in the $T$ doublets\nare about two orders larger than those related to the states in the $S$\ndoublets.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
