The agents communicate via a directed graph containing $n$ nodes. We\ncreate smooth approximations of the functions $f_i$ and $g_i$ and develop a\ndistributed algorithm utilizing the gradients of the smooth surrogates and a\nfinite-time approximate consensus protocol. We term this algorithm as\nDDC-Consensus. The developed DDC-Consensus algorithm allows for non-symmetric\ndirected graph topologies and can be synthesized distributively. We establish\nthat the DDC-Consensus algorithm converges to a stationary point of the\nnonconvex distributed optimization problem. The performance of the\nDDC-Consensus algorithm is evaluated via a simulation study to solve a\nnonconvex DC-regularized distributed least squares problem. The numerical\nresults corroborate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"AqF8ZaiW7Injuyrv4Ua2KCRIBNFnO22V6n0wkjEeLgQ","pdfSize":"617588"}
