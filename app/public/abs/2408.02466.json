Looking for solutions of the form $$ u(t,x)=e^{-\\alpha\nt}f(|x|e^{\\beta t}), \\qquad \\alpha=\\frac{2}{m-1}\\beta,$$ it is shown that, for\n$m+q>2$, there exists a unique exponent $\\beta_*\\in(0,\\infty)$ for which there\nexists a one-parameter family of compactly supported profiles presenting a\n\\emph{dead core}. The precise behavior of the solutions at their interface is\nalso determined. Moreover, these solutions show the optimal limitations for the\nfinite time extinction property of genuine non-negative solutions to the Cauchy\nproblem, studied in previous works.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
