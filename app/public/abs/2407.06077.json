RGB-based scene-level semantic segmentation has been\nwell-addressed in the literature. However, improving material recognition using\nthe depth modality and its integration with SLAM algorithms for 3D semantic\nmapping could unlock new potential benefits in the robotics perception\npipeline. To this end, we propose a complementarity-aware deep learning\napproach for RGB-D-based material classification built on top of an\nobject-oriented pipeline. The approach further integrates the ORB-SLAM2 method\nfor 3D scene mapping with multiscale clustering of the detected material\nsemantics in the point cloud map generated by the visual SLAM algorithm.\nExtensive experimental results with existing public datasets and newly\ncontributed real-world robot datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in\nmaterial classification and 3D clustering accuracy compared to state-of-the-art\napproaches for 3D semantic scene mapping.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
