There is a lack of research on\nrobust manipulation of heavy objects using larger arrays of suction cups, which\nintroduces challenges in modeling and predicting grasp failure. This paper\npresents a general approach to modeling grasp strength in multi-suction-cup\ngrippers, introducing new constraints usable for trajectory planning and\noptimization to achieve fast and reliable pick-and-place maneuvers. The primary\nmodeling challenge is the accurate prediction of the distribution of loads at\neach suction cup while grasping objects. To solve for this load distribution,\nwe find minimum spring potential energy configurations through a simple\nquadratic program. This results in a computationally efficient analytical\nsolution that can be integrated to formulate grasp failure constraints in\ntime-optimal trajectory planning. Finally, we present experimental results to\nvalidate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
