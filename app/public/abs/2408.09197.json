A key ingredient is the well-known fact that every ordering of the atoms\nof any finite geometric lattice gives rise to a lexicographic shelling of its\norder complex. The paper also gives results that provide some evidence that\nthis bound ought to be sharp as well as examples indicating that the question\nof sharpness is quite subtle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
