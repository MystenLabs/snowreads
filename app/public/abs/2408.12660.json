We provide a sharp condition, which when satisfied,\nguarantees that any fixed-depth matrix recurrence relation defined over a\nproduct (with respect to matrix multiplication) will converge to the zero\nmatrix. We also show that the same statement applies to matrix recurrence\nrelations defined over a Kronecker product. Lastly, we show that the dual of\nthis condition, which remains sharp, guarantees the divergence of matrix\nrecurrence relations defined over a consecutive Kronecker product. These\nresults completely determine the stability of nontrivial fixed-depth\ncomplex-valued recurrence relations defined over a consecutive product.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RF8uGxe0bxRv3o7SX7-YgxnvXgnNtzdm9IRO-ObSDhc","pdfSize":"217036"}
