It is shown that\nthe presence of such oscillations is strongly Reynolds number dependent. It is\nfurther shown that there is a threshold Reynolds number below which wake\nunsteadiness and oscillations do not appear. Attention is drawn to the earlier\nexperimental investigation of supersonic wakes behind cylinders and spheres by\n\\cite{kendall1962exp} which discusses cylinder oscillations and confirms the\nconcept of threshold Reynolds number. Following the earlier work of\n\\cite{goldburg1965strouhal} on hypersonic wakes of spheres and cones, a\nStrouhal number($St_\\theta$) based on total wake momentum thickness ($\\theta$)\nis shown to be the relevant similarity parameter for correlating the hypersonic\nand high supersonic wakes of spheres, cones, as well as cylinders. In this\nlimited sense, $St_\\theta$ can be said to be `universal'. A universal Strouhal\nnumber based on only one geometry (\\textit{i.e.,} a circular cylinder) and over\na limited Reynolds number range as proposed by \\cite{schmidt2015oscillations}\nis much too restrictive.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
