This work is an entry into the world of Random Walk in a\nRandom Environment (RWRE). We will discuss some intuitive concepts such as\nrecurrence, location, and random potential. We will thereafter focus on\nproviding an \"electrical\" understanding of this type of walk and finally\nexplore an application of RWRE to graphene conduction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
