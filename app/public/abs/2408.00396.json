We prove that long-time optimally accurate solutions\nare obtained for such parameters for the heat and Navier-Stokes equations\n(using implicit time stepping methods), with error bounds that do not grow as\nthe nudging parameter gets large. Existing theoretical results either prove\noptimal accuracy but with the error scaled by the nudging parameter, or\nsuboptimal accuracy that is independent of it. The key idea to the improved\nanalysis is to decompose the error based on a weighted inner product that\nincorporates the (symmetric by construction) nudging term, and prove that the\nprojection error from this weighted inner product is optimal and independent of\nthe nudging parameter. We apply the idea to BDF2 - finite element\ndiscretizations of the heat equation and Navier-Stokes equations to show that\nwith CDA, they will admit optimal long-time accurate solutions independent of\nthe nudging parameter, for nudging parameters large enough. Several numerical\ntests are given for the heat equation, fluid transport equation, Navier-Stokes,\nand Cahn-Hilliard that illustrate the theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
