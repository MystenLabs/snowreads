We here investigate the physical limits on\nnonequilibrium sensing in bipartite systems with nonreciprocal coupling. We\nshow that one of the subsystems, acting as a Maxwell's demon, can significantly\nsuppress the fluctuations of the other subsystem relative to its response to an\nexternal perturbation. Such negative violation of the fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation can considerably improve the signal-to-noise ratio above its\ncorresponding equilibrium value, allowing the subsystem to operate as an\nenhanced sensor. We find that the nonequilibrium signal-to-noise ratio of\nlinear systems may be arbitrary large at low frequencies, even at a fixed\noverall amount of dissipation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
