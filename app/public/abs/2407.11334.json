The Deep Learning\n(DL) based semantic communication, which can integrate application requirements\nand the data meanings into data processing and transmission, is expected to\nbecome a new paradigm in 6G wireless networks. However, existing semantic\ncommunications frameworks rely on sending full semantic feature, which can\nmaximize the semantic fidelity but fail to achieve the efficient semantic\ncommunications. In this article, we introduce a novel Scalable Extraction based\nSemantic Communication (SE-SC) model to support the potential applications in\n6G wireless networks and then analyze its feasibility. Then, we propose a\npromising the SE-SC framework to highlight the potentials of SE-SC model in 6G\nwireless networks. Numerical results show that our proposed SE-SC scheme can\noffer an identical Quality of Service (QoS) for the downstream task with much\nfewer transmission symbols than the full semantic feature transmission and the\ntraditional codec scheme. Finally, we discuss several challenges for further\ninvestigating the scalable extraction based semantic communications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
