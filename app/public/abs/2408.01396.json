The chromatic symmetric homology $H_*(G)$ is a doubly graded family\nof $\\mathbb{C}[\\mathfrak{S}_n]$-modules that was defined by Sazdanovi\\'c and\nYip (2018) as a categorification of $X_G$. Chandler, Sazdanovi\\'c, Stella, and\nYip (2023) proved that $H_*(G)$ is a strictly stronger graph invariant than\n$X_G$, and they also computed or conjectured formulas for it in a number of\nspecial cases. We prove and extend some of their conjectured formulas for the\ncase of star graphs, where one central vertex is connected to all other\nvertices and no other pairs of vertices are connected.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
