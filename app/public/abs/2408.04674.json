We argue that perturbative QCD breaks down at such a distance scale\nafter resumming the associated large logarithms, while the ansatz used in the\nanalysis there did not account for resummation or the leading renormalon, both\nof which significantly affect the convergence of perturbation theory. Besides,\nwe provide an explanation why the ansatz appears to describe the lattice data\ndespite the breakdown of perturbation theory at large distances.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"yAt6rrwUEWTaZPYwVuhpHU08CRghYiSARu3xvAZf80Q","pdfSize":"484238"}
