We think that it is worth posting this\nedition as a separate entry in arXiv for those reasons, although this edition\ncontains no essential progress beyond Part I and Part II.\n  S. Gukov and C. Vafa proposed a characterization of rational N=(1,1)\nsuperconformal field theories (SCFTs) on 1+1 dimensions with Ricci-flat Kahler\ntarget spaces in terms of the Hodge structure of the target space, extending an\nearlier observation by G. Moore. We refined this idea and obtained a\nconjectural statement on necessary and sufficient conditions for such SCFTs to\nbe rational, which we indeed prove to be true in the case the target space is\nT^4. In the refined statement, the algebraicity of the geometric data of the\ntarget space turns out to be essential, and the Strominger--Yau--Zaslow\nfibration in the mirror correspondence also plays a vital role.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
