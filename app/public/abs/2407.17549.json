This asymmetry can also lead to a\nfirst-order cosmic QCD transition, accompanied by detectable gravitational wave\n(GW) signals. By employing next-to-leading order dimensional reduction we\ndetermine that the necessary lepton asymmetry is approximately one order of\nmagnitude smaller than previously estimated. Incorporating an updated QCD\nequation of state that harmonizes lattice and functional QCD outcomes, we\npinpoint the range of lepton flavor asymmetries capable of inducing a\nfirst-order cosmic QCD transition. To maintain consistency with observational\nconstraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,\nachieving the correct baryon asymmetry requires entropy dilution by\napproximately a factor of ten. However, the first-order QCD transition itself\ncan occur independently of entropy dilution. We propose that the sphaleron\nfreeze-in mechanism can be investigated through forthcoming GW experiments such\nas $\\mu$Ares.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
