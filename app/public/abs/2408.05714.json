The electronic energy spectrum of TBGQC contains\nperiodic energy ranges (PER) and quasiperiodic energy ranges (QER), where the\nunderlying local density of states (LDOS) exhibits periodic and quasiperiodic\ndistribution, respectively. We found that superconductivity in the PER is a\nsimple superposition of two monolayer superconductors. This is because,\nparticularly near the charge neutrality point of TBGQC, the two layers are\nweekly coupled, leading to pairing instabilities with uniform distribution in\nreal space. On the other hand, within QER, the inhomogeneous distribution of\nthe LDOS enhances the superconducting instability with a non-uniform\ndistribution of pairing amplitudes, leading to quasiperiodic superconductivity.\nOur study can qualitatively explain the superconductivity in recently\ndiscovered moir\\'e quasicrystals, which show superconductivity in its QER.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
