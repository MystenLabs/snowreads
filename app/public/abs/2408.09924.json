As an\napplication of this fact, we deduce decomposition property. Further, using\nmoving plane method, we prove symmetry of solutions of a mixed local and\nnonlocal singular perturbed problem, where the decomposition plays a crucial\nrole. Finally, we apply the variational property to deduce existence,\nnonexistence and regularity results of a mixed local and nonlocal singular\njumping problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
