However,\nthis evaluation method is far from efficient because samples are not shared\nacross policies, and running target policies to evaluate themselves is actually\nnot optimal. In this paper, we address these two weaknesses by designing a\ntailored behavior policy to reduce the variance of estimators across all target\npolicies. Theoretically, we prove that executing this behavior policy with\nmanyfold fewer samples outperforms on-policy evaluation on every target policy\nunder characterized conditions. Empirically, we show our estimator has a\nsubstantially lower variance compared with previous best methods and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in a broad range of environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
