The complexity and seriousness of this security threat growths\nnowadays exponentially, due to the emergence of new advanced technologies (e.g.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), 3D printing, etc.);\nespecially when it comes to large-scale, popular and diverse public spaces. In\nthis paper, a novel Digital Twin-as-a-Security-Service (DTaaSS) architecture is\nintroduced for holistically and significantly enhancing the protection of\npublic spaces (e.g. metro stations, leisure sites, urban squares, etc.). The\nproposed framework combines a Digital Twin (DT) conceptualization with\nadditional cutting-edge technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud\ncomputing, Big Data analytics and AI. In particular, DTaaSS comprises a\nholistic, real-time, large-scale, comprehensive and data-driven security\nsolution for the efficient/robust protection of public spaces, supporting: a)\ndata collection and analytics, b) area monitoring/control and proactive threat\ndetection, c) incident/attack prediction, and d) quantitative and data-driven\nvulnerability assessment. Overall, the designed architecture exhibits increased\npotential in handling complex, hybrid and combined threats over large, critical\nand popular soft-targets. The applicability and robustness of DTaaSS is\ndiscussed in detail against representative and diverse real-world application\nscenarios, including complex attacks to: a) a metro station, b) a leisure site,\nand c) a cathedral square.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
