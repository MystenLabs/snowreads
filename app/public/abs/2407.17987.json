This appeals to the ongoing debate about the source of the\nspatially-correlated common-spectrum process observed in PTAs, which is likely\nassociated with a nanohertz stochastic GWB. We investigate the distribution of\nthe sample statistics of the one-point function in the presence of a Gaussian\nGWB. Our results indicate that, within PTAs, one-point statistics are\nimpractical for constraining the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB due to\ndominant pulsar noises. However, our analysis of two-point statistics shows\npromise, suggesting that it may be possible to constrain the Gaussianity of the\nnanohertz GWB using PTA data. We also emphasize that the Gaussian signatures\nidentified in the one- and two-point functions in this work are expected to be\napplicable to any gravitational wave background.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
