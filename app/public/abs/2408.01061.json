If $I=\\{0,1,2,\\dots r-1\\}$ is the set of residues\ncorresponding to the simple modules of $FC_r$, the elementary equivalence is\ndetermined by a proper, non-empty subset $I_0 \\subset I$, and the corresponding\nelementary tilting complex is completely determined by $I_0$.\n  We give a catalog of homogeneous maps between irreducible components of the\nelementary tilting complex. When the subset $I_0$ is an interval, we prove that\nthe maps in the catalog are sufficient to describe all homogeneous maps between\ntwo irreducible components.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kYQxZftwmwnQxZYTkSUwXj52Y3Hr9BqGQLDbBbPLy7Q","pdfSize":"425407","txDigest":"HR9TMQbi58WRMLYfDAHQHMUjcHzNfha1hoWqxnW5hf5","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
