The impact of noise is studied by constructing Kraus\noperators of different dimensions, making use of the Weyl operators. These\nKraus operators are employed as the coin operators of the DTOQW. The walker\ndynamics is studied under the impact of non-Markovian amplitude damping,\ndepolarizing and dephasing noise channels. In addition, the walk is implemented\non arbitrary graphs, such as path graph, cycle graph, star graph, complete\ngraph, and complete bipartite graph. The dynamics, due to the influence of\nnoise, is gauged by computing the coherence and fidelity at different time\nsteps. Further, the probability distribution, representing the availability of\nthe quantum walker at different vertices of the graph, is computed at different\ntime steps for the above noises.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
