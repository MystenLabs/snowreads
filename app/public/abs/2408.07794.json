We\nconstruct the manifold of pure states as an orbit under the conjugation action\nof the Lie group $\\SU(n)$ on the manifold of one-dimensional orthogonal\nprojectors, obtaining an isometry with the flag manifold\n$\\SU(n)/\\textnormal{S}(\\textnormal{U}(1)\\times \\textnormal{U}(n-1 ))$. From\nthis construction, we show that Hamiltonians generating optimal-speed time\nevolution are fully characterized by equigeodesic vectors of\n$\\SU(n)/\\textnormal{S}(\\textnormal{U}(1)\\times \\textnormal{U}(n-1))$. We later\nextend that result to quasi-pure quantum states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
