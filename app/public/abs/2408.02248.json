Many tools and libraries exist for helping create such systems,\nhowever none support recursive multi-agent systems -- where the models\nthemselves flexibly decide when to delegate tasks and how to organize their\ndelegation structure. In this work, we introduce ReDel: a toolkit for recursive\nmulti-agent systems that supports custom tool-use, delegation schemes,\nevent-based logging, and interactive replay in an easy-to-use web interface. We\nshow that, using ReDel, we are able to achieve significant performance gains on\nagentic benchmarks and easily identify potential areas of improvements through\nthe visualization and debugging tools. Our code, documentation, and PyPI\npackage are open-source and free to use under the MIT license.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
