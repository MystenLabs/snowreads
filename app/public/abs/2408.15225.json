Using our framework, we apply several common techniques from these\nclassical domains and numerically examine their suitability for and performance\non this problem. Our methods are evaluated on single-qubit systems as well as\non larger systems. While the first part of our proposed method outputs a single\nunitary matrix representing the composite effects of a quantum circuit or\nalgorithm, we use existing tools - and assess the performance of these - to\nfactor such a matrix into a product of elementary quantum gates. This enables\nour pipeline to be truly end-to-end: starting from desired input/output\nexamples, our code ultimately results in a quantum circuit diagram. We release\nour code to the research community (upon acceptance).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
