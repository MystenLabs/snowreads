An exact formula for\nthe final number of leptons is obtained by solving the kinetic equations. We\ndemonstrate that in such a model the final number of leptons does not depend on\nphoton and lepton free paths. We derive approximate formulas for the main\ncharacteristics of cascades at high energy, including the final number of\nleptons and the cascade depth. We show that in general the final number of\nleptons is asymptotically proportional to the energy of seed particle. It is\nalso demonstrated how the original Heitler model is reproduced as a special\ncase.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
