These regimes adapt treatment strategies based on decision rules learned\nfrom clinical data to enhance therapeutic effectiveness. Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) algorithms allow to determine these decision rules conditioned by\nindividual patient data and their medical history. The integration of medical\nexpertise into these models makes possible to increase confidence in treatment\nrecommendations and facilitate the adoption of this approach by healthcare\nprofessionals and patients. In this work, we examine the mathematical\nfoundations of RL, contextualize its application in the field of DTR, and\npresent an overview of methods to improve its effectiveness by integrating\nmedical expertise.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
