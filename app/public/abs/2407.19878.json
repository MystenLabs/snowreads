Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a\nlazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the\nform $(\\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this\nrandom walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all\n$3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of\nthe comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We\nalso give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering\na question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
