The decision maker pays attention to\ndifferent subsets of the available set of alternatives randomly. The reference\nalternatives are exactly those alternatives that are always paid attention to,\ni.e. they are attention-privileged and these alternatives are supposed to be\nunknown to the outside observer. The characterization allows for a complete\nidentification of the reference alternatives and a coarse identification of the\nunderlying preferences. I then restrict the model by considering the\nindependent random attention function and provide a complete identification of\nthe underlying preferences as well.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"247YrTlCBoZa75MkfsBK90KwV-22u0_jUyYh01hESI4","pdfSize":"263578"}
