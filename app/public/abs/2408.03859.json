The detectors must have noise equivalent powers (NEPs) at or\nbelow 0.1 aW/sqrt(Hz) to be subdominant to noise from sky backgrounds and\nthermal noise from PRIMA's cryogenically cooled primary mirror. Using a Radio\nFrequency System on a Chip for multitone readout, we measure the NEPs of\ndetectors on a flight-like array designed to observe at a wavelength of 210\nmicrons. We find that 92% of the KIDs measured have an NEP below 0.1\naW/sqrt(Hz) at a noise frequency of 10 Hz.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
