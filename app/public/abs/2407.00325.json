Quantum metric plays a central\nrole in determining the properties of single exciton excitation as well as the\nexciton condensate. While the electrons and holes are extremely heavy in flat\nbands, the excitons (boundstate of an electron-hole pair) could be light and\nmobile. In particular, we show that the inverse of exciton's effective mass\ntensor is proportional to the quantum metric tensor. Meanwhile, the flat band\nexcitons have a finite size, lower bounded by the trace of the quantum metric\ntensor. Given the properties of single exciton excitation, one can argue for\nthe formation of exciton condensate. Because of the quantum metric, the exciton\ncondensate can support dissipationless counterflow supercurrent, implying the\nstability of exciton condensate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
