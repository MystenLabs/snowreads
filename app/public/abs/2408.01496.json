Numerical modeling\nof these streams is essential for understanding their interaction with the host\ngalaxy's mass distribution. Traditional methods are either computationally\nexpensive or oversimplified, motivating us to develop a fast and accurate\napproach using a particle spray algorithm. By conducting a series of N-body\nsimulations of GCs orbiting a host galaxy, we find that the position and\nvelocity distributions of newly-escaped stream particles are consistent across\nvarious GC masses and orbital parameters. Based on these distributions, we\ndevelop a new algorithm that avoids computing the detailed internal cluster\ndynamics by directly drawing tracer particles from these distributions. This\nalgorithm correctly reproduces the action space distribution of stream\nparticles and achieves a 10% accuracy in stream morphology and velocities\ncompared to N-body simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tJ-i9_g9z5BIIlTh10pvcjH2a6pRL-pDIuOWmqm7oZ4","pdfSize":"3563828"}
