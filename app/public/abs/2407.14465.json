In addition to\ntopological invariants, the position of the Wannier centers provide a\nfingerprint for the topological character of a material. Here, we demonstrate a\nmethod to experimentally determine the location of Wannier centers in\nartificial lattices made of Cs/InAs(111)A by integrating the density of states.\nWe determine the locations of the Wannier centers for various 1D chains,\ntopological and trivial, and corroborate our findings with tight-binding\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1fWHCZ2MdPootj3l6rHxPj5ohYCW-FXUqLD7GCX1PM4","pdfSize":"17705334","objectId":"0x1cd10e7a125c7eadd2ad90476f7a4b4f94f93cbc4eb1cd9be394ff38f35c00ec","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
