The current available SC potentials\ncan accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital\n(HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule\ninteractions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent\ndiscoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for\nmore precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and\naccurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that\nsimultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies,\nsymmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML\nmodel to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively\nanalyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted during\nthe H-CN stretching. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming\nthe second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the\nplateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the\nredistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with\nother experimental and theoretical studies. Lastly, the machine learning\napproach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present\nstudy is so general that it can be applied to construct molecular potential for\nother molecules and molecular dynamic processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yGlEf-LAz4pIMxEYhGQwQojL2zNg2NI-aTecQWlHY5k","pdfSize":"2096068"}
