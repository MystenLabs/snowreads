Through the optical flare in the CSS 8.5years-long\nlight curve and the none-variability in the up-to-date ASAS-SN light curves,\nthe theoretical TDE model described by the MOSFIT code can be applied in SDSS\nJ1617+0638. Meanwhile, considering the assumed central TDE expected continuum\nemissions not strong enough to describe the continuum emissions in the SDSS\nspectrum of SDSS J1617+0638, an additional power law component from\npre-existing AGN activity should be necessary in SDSS J1617+0638. Furthermore,\nconsidering the short time duration to the observed date for the SDSS spectrum\nfrom the starting time of the assumed central TDE in SDSS J1617+0638, TDE model\nexpected accreting mass only about 0.03$M_\\odot$ can lead to few effects of\nTDEs debris on the observed broad emission lines in the SDSS spectrum of SDSS\nJ1617+0638, indicating the TDE model determined BH mass simply consistent with\nthe virial BH mass by broad emission lines, as determined results in SDSS\nJ1617+0638. Therefore, through both the photometric variability and the\nspectroscopic results, a central TDE can be preferred in the normal broad line\nAGN SDSS J1617+0638 with pre-existing central AGN activity and pre-existing\nbroad emission line regions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
