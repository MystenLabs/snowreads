In\nthis work, we identify that existing large language models (LLMs) underperform\nin this domain due to challenges in understanding case complexities and\ndistinguishing between similar charges. To adapt LLMs for effective legal\njudgment prediction, we introduce the Ask-Discriminate-Predict (ADAPT)\nreasoning framework inspired by human judicial reasoning. ADAPT involves\ndecomposing case facts, discriminating among potential charges, and predicting\nthe final judgment. We further enhance LLMs through fine-tuning with multi-task\nsynthetic trajectories to improve legal judgment prediction accuracy and\nefficiency under our ADAPT framework. Extensive experiments conducted on two\nwidely-used datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in\nlegal judgment prediction, particularly when dealing with complex and confusing\ncharges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
