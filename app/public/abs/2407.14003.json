To achieve this goal,\nwe investigate image generation in a time series context. Specifically, we\nformulate a min-max problem derived from the $f$-divergence between neighboring\npairs to learn a time series generator in a nonparametric manner. The generator\nenables us to generate future images by transforming prior lag-k observations\nand a random vector from a reference distribution. With a deep neural network\nlearned generator, we prove that the joint distribution of the generated\nsequence converges to the latent truth under a Markov and a conditional\ninvariance condition. Furthermore, we extend our generation mechanism to a\npanel data scenario to accommodate multiple samples. The effectiveness of our\nmechanism is evaluated by generating real brain MRI sequences from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. These generated image sequences\ncan be used as data augmentation to enhance the performance of further\ndownstream tasks, such as Alzheimer's disease detection.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
