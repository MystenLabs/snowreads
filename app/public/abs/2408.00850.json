At an angular resolution of $\\approx0.32''\\times0.24''$,\nDLA-B1228g shows extended CO(3-2) emission with a deconvolved size of\n$\\approx0.78''\\times0.18''$, i.e. a spatial extent of $\\approx6.4$ kpc. We\ndetect extended stellar emission from DLA-B1228g in a Hubble Space Telescope\nWide Field Camera 3 F160W image, and find that H$\\alpha$ emission is detected\nin a Very Large Telescope SINFONI image from only one side of the galaxy. While\nthe clumpy nature of the F160W emission and the offset between the kinematic\nand physical centers of the CO(3-2) emission are consistent with a merger\nscenario, this appears unlikely due to the lack of strong H$\\alpha$ emission,\nthe symmetric double-peaked CO(3-2) line profile, the high molecular gas\ndepletion timescale, and the similar velocity dispersions in the two halves of\nthe CO(3-2) image. Kinematic modelling reveals that the CO(3-2) emission is\nconsistent with arising from an axisymmetric rotating disk, with an exponential\nprofile, a rotation velocity of $v_{rot}=328\\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$, and a velocity\ndispersion of $\\sigma_{v}=62\\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$. The high value of the ratio\n$v_{rot}/\\sigma_v$, $\\approx5.3$, implies that DLA-B1228g is a\nrotation-dominated cold disk galaxy, the second case of a high-$z$\nHI-absorption-selected galaxy identified with a cold rotating disk. We obtain a\ndynamical mass of $M_{dyn}= (1.5\\pm0.1)\\times10^{11}~M_\\odot$, similar to the\nmolecular gas mass of $\\approx10^{11} M_\\odot$ inferred from earlier CO(1-0)\nstudies; this implies that the galaxy is baryon-dominated in its inner regions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Uq4d8VgvhZi8QvuyjhylIg5b4hbIK_fqo_dQCi9OnQE","pdfSize":"1823621"}
