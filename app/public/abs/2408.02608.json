This new definition coincides with the\noriginal topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case\nand allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular\nand degenerate situations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
