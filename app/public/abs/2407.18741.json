However, their intrinsic ``black-box'' nature makes it difficult\nto interpret them or guarantee ``safe behavior'' when deployed in high-risk\napplications such as feedback control, healthcare and finance. This drawback\nacts as a significant barrier to their wider application across many scientific\nand industrial domains where the interpretability of the model predictions is\nas important as accuracy. Leveraging the latest developments in interpretable\nmachine learning, we develop a method to parameterise ``black-box'' models,\neffectively transforming them into ``grey-box'' models. We apply this approach\nto plasma diagnostics by creating a parameterised synthetic Soft X-Ray imaging\n$-$ Thomson Scattering diagnostic, which predicts high temporal resolution\nelectron temperature and density profiles from the measured soft X-ray\nemission. The ``grey-box'' model predictions are benchmarked against the\ntrained ``black-box'' models as well as a diverse range of plasma conditions.\nOur model-agnostic approach can be applied to various machine learning\narchitectures, enabling direct comparisons of model interpretations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
