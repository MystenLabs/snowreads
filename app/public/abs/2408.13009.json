This paper covers\nthe design and implementation of a merged electrostatic guide whose geometry\nwas numerically optimized for ND$_3$-ND$_3$ and ND$_3$-NH$_3$ collisions. This\ndevice guides both beams simultaneously and makes them converge up to an\neffective collision angle of 2$\\mathrm{^\\circ}$, yielding the optimal\ncompromise between spatial overlap and the lowest possible collision energy. We\npresent preliminary data for inelastic ND$_3$-ND$_3$ collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
