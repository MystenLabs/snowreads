Theoretical results are obtained by\nanalyzing the asymptotic pseudo trajectory of a PSP. We show that under mild\nassumptions a proximal stochastic approximation scheme converges to an\ninternally chain transitive invariant set of the corresponding PSP.\nFurthermore, given the existence of a Lyapunov function $V$ with respect to a\nset $\\Lambda$, convergence to $\\Lambda$ can be established if $V(\\Lambda)$ has\nan empty interior. Based on these theoretical results, we are able to provide a\nuseful framework for convergence analysis of proximal gradient methods.\nIllustrative examples are provided to determine the convergence of proximal\nvariants of gradient methods (including accelerated gradient methods). Finally,\nnumerical simulations are conducted to confirm the validity of theoretical\nanalysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
