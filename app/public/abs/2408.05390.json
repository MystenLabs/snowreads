These solutions have recently been shown to describe various\nlimit processes involving large-amplitude waves, and they have also appeared in\nsome physical models not directly connected with nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequations. We establish the following key property of these solutions: they are\nall in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ with respect to the spatial variable but they exhibit\nanomalously slow temporal decay. In this paper we define general rogue waves of\ninfinite order, establish their basic exact and asymptotic properties, and\nprovide computational tools for calculating them accurately.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
