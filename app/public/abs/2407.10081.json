The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a new horizon for\nredefining recommender systems with vast general knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities. Standing across this LLM era, we aim to integrate recommender\nsystems into a broader picture, and pave the way for more comprehensive\nsolutions for future research. Therefore, we first offer a comprehensive\noverview of the technical progression of recommender systems, particularly\nfocusing on language foundation models and their applications in\nrecommendation. We identify two evolution paths of modern recommender systems\n-- via list-wise recommendation and conversational recommendation. These two\npaths finally converge at LLM agents with superior capabilities of long-term\nmemory, reflection, and tool intelligence. Along these two paths, we point out\nthat the information effectiveness of the recommendation is increased, while\nthe user's acquisition cost is decreased. Technical features, research\nmethodologies, and inherent challenges for each milestone along the path are\ncarefully investigated -- from traditional list-wise recommendation to\nLLM-enhanced recommendation to recommendation with LLM agents. Finally, we\nhighlight several unresolved challenges crucial for the development of future\npersonalization technologies and interfaces and discuss the future prospects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
