The studied dynamics are formulated as monotone\ninclusions governed by Lipschitz perturbations of maximally monotone operators\nwhere the concept of equilibrium plays a central role. We discuss the\nrelationship between the $\\mathbb{W}_1$-Wasserstein Lipschitz behavior of the\ndistribution and the so-called coarse Ricci curvature. As an application, we\nconsider the monotone inclusions associated with stochastic optimisation\nproblems involving the sum of a smooth function with Lipschitz gradient, a\nproximable function and a composite term.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
