The geometric spin $s$ is related to the\ntopological dimension of the internal space $V$ by $\\dim V = 2s + 1$. This\nbreaks down for massless particles, which are characterized by their helicity\n$h$, but all have 1D internal spaces. We show that a subtler relation exists\nbetween the topological and geometry of massless particles. Wave functions of\nmassless particles are sections of nontrivial line bundles over the lightcone\nwhose topology are completely characterized by their first Chern number $C$. We\nprove that in general $C = -2h$. In doing so, we also exhibit a method of\ngenerating all massless bundle representations via an abelian group structure\nof massless particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
