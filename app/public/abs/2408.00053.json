There are two critical velocities,\n$U_{\\text{low}}$ and $U_{\\text{upp}}$, where $U_{\\text{low}}$ and\n$U_{\\text{upp}}$ represent the lower and upper critical velocities,\nrespectively. We demonstrate that if the rectilinear solutions satisfy\n$U_{\\text{low}}+c\\epsilon_{0}< \\dot{v}^{+}_{1} < U_{\\text{upp}}$, the linear\nand nonlinear ill-posedness of Kelvin-Helmholtz problem for two-dimensional\nideal compressible elastic fluids is established.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
