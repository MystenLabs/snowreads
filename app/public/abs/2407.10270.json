The semitrailer plays an\nimportant role for the vehicles driving dynamics due to its highly varying\nloads and the large proportion to the total mass of the truck-semitrailer,\nespecially when it is fully loaded. To create a basis for further development\nof assistance systems for the semitrailer, this paper presents a two-track\nmodel which includes the lateral and roll dynamics of the semitrailer. This\nenables the future development of observer and filter-based estimation of\nvehicle states and parameters, which are impossible or very difficult to\nmeasure. For offline identification of the unknown model parameters, a\nParticle-Swarm-Optimization (PSO) algorithm will be used. The validation of the\nmodel is based on measurements from a test vehicle. The focus is on the lateral\nand vertical tire forces of the semitrailer, which are measured at the test\nvehicle using strain gauges.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TC3I9xyTceh39VRZFtG8O2UXJ_Gmu-mmMw0_KUWuJgE","pdfSize":"2578348"}
