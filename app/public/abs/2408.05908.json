Its\n$J^{PC}$ quantum numbers could be either $0^{-+}$ or $2^{-+}$. We explore the\npossibility of the $X(2600)$ being a higher state of the $\\eta_2$ meson family.\nThrough ($n,M^2$) trajectory analysis and the Quark Pair Creation model, we\npropose that the $X(2600)$ could be the third radial excitation of the\n$\\eta_2(1870)$. However, the theoretical decay width of the $\\eta_2(4D)$ is\nsmaller than the experimental width of the $X(2600)$, and branching ratio\ncalculations suggest inconsistencies, leading us to exclude the $X(2600)$ as\nthe $\\eta_2(4D)$. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the $X(2600)$\nand provide insights for future experimental searches for excited the $\\eta_2$\nstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
