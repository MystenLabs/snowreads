The\nshort note analyzes the conservative closures preservation of the hyperbolicity\nand anti-symmetry of the Vlasov equation. Furthermore, we verify numerically\nthe analytically derived conservative closures on simulating a classic\nelectrostatic benchmark problem: the Langmuir wave. The numerical results and\nanalytic analysis show that the closure by truncation is the most suitable\nconservative closure for the symmetrically weighted Hermite formulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EES2SzVJIV89SHq__UUp813uHGDUKSfF314wObl0tVA","pdfSize":"2739816"}
