Our\nfiltration specialises to the Jantzen filtration of a Verma module for a\ncertain choice of parameter. We prove that embeddings of standard Whittaker\nmodules are strict with respect to our filtration, and that the filtration\nlayers are semisimple. This provides a generalisation of the Jantzen\nconjectures to Whittaker modules. We prove these statements in two ways. First,\nwe give an algebraic proof which compares Whittaker modules to Verma modules\nusing a functor introduced by Backelin. Second, we give a geometric proof using\nmixed twistor $\\mathcal{D}$-modules.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
