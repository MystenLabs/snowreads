This has been made particularly evident in recent\nyears, with motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) exhibiting several\nintriguing dependencies on translational inertia. Here we report extensive\nsimulations characterizing the phase behavior of inertial active matter and\ndevelop a mechanical theory for the complete phase diagram without appealing to\nequilibrium notions. Our theory qualitatively captures all aspects of\nliquid-gas coexistence, including the critical value of inertia above which\nMIPS ceases. Notably, our findings highlight that particle softness, and not\ninertia, is responsible for the MIPS reentrance effect at the center of a\nproposed active refrigeration cycle.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nubTleKTRWeD-uxAmmpOmRrBu5fU0_bwjVa4cnTkO2s","pdfSize":"9148916"}
