In this paper, we will prove a discrete version of this inequality, which\nwill hold whenever $X$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on\n$K\\cap\\mathbb Z^n$ for any convex body $K\\subseteq\\mathbb R^n$ containing the\norigin in its interior. We will also make use of such discrete version to\nobtain discrete inequalities from which we can recover the estimate $\\mathbb E\nw(K_N)\\sim w(Z_{\\log N}(K))$ for any convex body $K$ containing the origin in\nits interior, where $K_N$ is the centrally symmetric random polytope\n$K_N=\\operatorname{conv}\\{\\pm X_1,\\ldots,\\pm X_N\\}$ generated by independent\nrandom vectors uniformly distributed on $K$ and $w(\\cdot)$ denotes the mean\nwidth.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
