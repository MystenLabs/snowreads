Meanwhile, in this paper,\nwe impose weaker regularity on the initial data, and work on the weak\nformulation of the systems. In this light, we set our goal of this paper to\nprove two Main Theorems, concerned with: the existence and the uniqueness of\nweak solution to (S)$_\\varepsilon$, and the continuous dependence with respect\nto the index $\\varepsilon$, initial data and forcings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qwwnp2kVluyUxVGSblmCpRtWcDvS86PDt41X00mSPF8","pdfSize":"193175","objectId":"0xf95f3660edd4a080629f949e083e36436032fdb890b9b48d06dc96461fb8b07b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
