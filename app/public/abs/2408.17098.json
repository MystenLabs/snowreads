Although\nexhibiting uncertainty through a confidence score, these predictions do not\ncapture the entire variability of the inference process. For safety and\nsecurity critical applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, etc.,\nknowing this predictive uncertainty is essential though. Therefore, we\nintroduce, for the first time, a fast way to obtain the empirical predictive\ndistribution during object detection and incorporate that knowledge in\nmulti-object tracking. Our mechanism can easily be integrated into\nstate-of-the-art trackers, enabling them to fully exploit the uncertainty in\nthe detections. Additionally, novel association methods are introduced that\nleverage the proposed mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\ncontribution on a variety of benchmarks, such as MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack, and\nKITTI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
