The necessary\nprerequisite for this result is the characterization of monomorphic structures\nwith finite big Ramsey degrees: a countable monomorphic structure has finite\nbig Ramsey degrees if and only if it is chainable by a chain with finite big\nRamsey degrees. Interestingly, both characterizations require deep structural\nproperties of chains. Fra\\\"{i}ss\\'{e}'s Conjecture (actually, its positive\nresolution due to Laver) is instrumental in the characterization of monomorphic\nstructures with finite big Ramsey degrees, while the analysis of big Ramsey\ncombinatorics of structures admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition\nrequires a product Ramsey theorem for big Ramsey degrees. We find this last\nresult particularly intriguing because big Ramsey degrees misbehave notoriously\nwhen it comes to general product statements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
