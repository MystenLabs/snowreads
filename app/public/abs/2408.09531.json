Trust between humans and robots is recognized as a key enabler for\nhuman-robot teaming (HRT) activity: if trust during a mission falls below\nsufficient levels for cooperative tasks to be completed, it could critically\naffect success. Changes in trust could be particularly problematic in teams\nthat have formed on an ad hoc basis (as might be expected in emergency\nsituations) where team members may not have previously worked together. In such\nad hoc teams, a foundational level of 'swift trust' may be fragile and\nchallenging to sustain in the face of inevitable setbacks. We present results\nof an experiment focused on understanding trust building, violation and repair\nprocesses in ad hoc teams (one human and two robots). Trust violation occurred\nthrough robots becoming unresponsive, with limited communication and feedback.\nWe perform exploratory analysis of a variety of data, including communications\nand performance logs, trust surveys and post-experiment interviews, toward\nunderstanding how autonomous systems can be designed into interdependent ad hoc\nhuman-robot teams where swift trust can be sustained.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
