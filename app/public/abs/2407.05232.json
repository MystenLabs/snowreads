As a promising alternative, physics-aware models\nincorporate partial physics knowledge to ameliorate these challenges. Although\ndemonstrating efficacy, they fall short in terms of exploration depth and\nuniversality. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a physics-aware proxy\nmodel (PAPM) that fully incorporates partial prior physics of process systems,\nwhich includes multiple input conditions and the general form of conservation\nrelations, resulting in better out-of-sample generalization. Additionally, PAPM\ncontains a holistic temporal-spatial stepping module for flexible adaptation\nacross various process systems. Through systematic comparisons with\nstate-of-the-art pure data-driven and physics-aware models across five\ntwo-dimensional benchmarks in nine generalization tasks, PAPM notably achieves\nan average performance improvement of 6.7%, while requiring fewer FLOPs, and\njust 1% of the parameters compared to the prior leading method.
