Making\nuse of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the\nthree-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of\nequations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in\nthe shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of\nthe reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g.,\nliquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the\nreactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that\nintroducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the\nreactor walls can improve the yield.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
