The possibility\nto extract morality rapidly from lyrics enables a deeper understanding of our\nmusic-listening behaviours. Building on the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), we\ntasked a set of transformer-based language models (BERT) fine-tuned on 2,721\nsynthetic lyrics generated by a large language model (GPT-4) to detect moral\nvalues in 200 real music lyrics annotated by two experts.We evaluate their\npredictive capabilities against a series of baselines including out-of-domain\n(BERT fine-tuned on MFT-annotated social media texts) and zero-shot (GPT-4)\nclassification. The proposed models yielded the best accuracy across\nexperiments, with an average F1 weighted score of 0.8. This performance is, on\naverage, 5% higher than out-of-domain and zero-shot models. When examining\nprecision in binary classification, the proposed models perform on average 12%\nhigher than the baselines.Our approach contributes to annotation-free and\neffective lyrics morality learning, and provides useful insights into the\nknowledge distillation of LLMs regarding moral expression in music, and the\npotential impact of these technologies on the creative industries and musical\nculture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rO_N7UeDoqzllUvLWTm58YzZBZPoGVyWT_8RqTbLag8","pdfSize":"894873","objectId":"0x1f8f6f5d1c97e0f41daee38ce25b4af3fc48400237c9907e8245d3135c11bf93","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
