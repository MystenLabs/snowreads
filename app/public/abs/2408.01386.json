Observations over the\npast two decades from routinely operational facilities such as CHARA and VLTI\nhave produced groundbreaking scientific results, reflecting the mature state of\nthe techniques in optical interferometry. However, routine imaging of bright\nmain sequence stars remains a surprisingly unexplored scientific realm.\nAdditionally, the three-plus decade old technology infrastructure of these\nfacilities leads to high operations \\& maintenance costs, and limits\nperformance. We are developing the BFT, based upon robust, modern,\ncommercially-available, automated technologies with low capital construction\nand O\\&M costs, in support of kilometer-scale optical interferometers that will\nopen the door to regular `snapshot' imaging of main sequence stars. Focusing on\nextreme angular resolution for bright objects leads to substantial reductions\nin expected costs through use of COTS elements and simplified infrastructure.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
