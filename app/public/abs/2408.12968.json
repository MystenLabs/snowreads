However, implementing\nsingle-qubit rotation operations on binomial codes has proven challenging,\nrequiring an ancillary qubit in previous approaches. Here, we propose a method\nfor performing logical qubit rotation on binomial codes without requiring an\nancillary qubit. Specifically, we explain how to implement $X$-axis rotations\nby simultaneously applying two-frequency parametric drives to resonators with\nnonlinearity. Furthermore, we show that $Z$-axis rotations could be realized\nwith the detuning. Due to the reduction of the need for the ancillary qubit for\nthe logical qubit rotation, our proposed approach is advantageous for quantum\ncomputation in the NISQ era, where the number of qubits is limited.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
