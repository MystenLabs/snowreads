Previous works on linear theory were\nconducted in the hydrodynamic limit. Nevertheless, protoplanetary disks are\nlikely magnetized and weakly ionized. We examine the influence of magnetic\nfields and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects - namely, Ohmic\nresistivity, Hall drift, and ambipolar diffusion - on the RWI unstable modes.\nWe perform radially global linear analyses, employing constant azimuthal\n($B_\\phi$) or vertical ($B_z$) background magnetic fields. It is found that, in\nthe ideal MHD regime, magnetism can either enhance or diminish RWI growth.\nStrong non-ideal MHD effects cause RWI growth rates to recover hydrodynamic\nresults. The sign of Hall Els\\\"{a}sser number subtly complicates the results,\nand vertical wavenumbers generically diminish growth rates.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DztIg3lIdN5OX1YJF4UqU9F93E-Y7m2sIJBTYmdL_Ts","pdfSize":"388007"}
