In this paper, we analyse the computational\nproperties of SLTL. First, we establish logarithmic-space reductions between\nthe satisfiability problems for the multi-dimensional modal logic PTLxS5 and\nSLTL. This leads to the EXPSPACE-completeness of the satisfiability problem in\nSLTL, which is a surprising result in view of previous investigations. Next, we\npresent a method of restricting SLTL so that the obtained fragment is a strict\nextension of both the (non-temporal) standpoint logic and linear-time temporal\nlogic LTL, but the satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete in this fragment.\nThus, we show how to combine standpoint logic with LTL so that the worst-case\ncomplexity of the obtained combination is not higher than of pure LTL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nMcuxrbdGSSiTNAJPr20fdgmb0AWWAkFOlUcbpTS7Po","pdfSize":"278970"}
