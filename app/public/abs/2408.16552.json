The {\\tt AAK24} QCD analysis incorporates SU(2) and SU(3) symmetry\nbreaking, specifically $\\delta \\bar{u} \\neq \\delta \\bar{d} \\neq \\delta\n\\bar{s}$, while assuming $\\delta \\bar{s}$ and $\\delta s$ are equal. Emphasizing\nthe significance of the semi-inclusive data, the study explores the\ndetermination of polarized sea quark distributions. Recent experimental data\nfrom {\\tt JLAB17}, {\\tt COMPASS16}, and {\\tt COMPASS17}, including the $A_2$\nasymmetry measurements along with SIDIS observables, are thoroughly examined\nfor their impact on the central values of polarized PDFs, their uncertainties,\nand overall fit quality. Additionally, we include the nonperturbative target\nmass corrections (TMC) as well as higher-twist terms (HT) which are\nparticularly important. In this work, the uncertainties are quantified using\nthe standard Hessian method. The main results and findings of the {\\tt AAK24}\nQCD analysis show overall good agreement with the analyzed experimental data,\naligning well with other polarized PDF determinations, particularly {\\tt\nDSSV14}, {\\tt LSS10}, {\\tt JAM17}, and {\\tt AKS14}, all considering SU(2) and\nSU(3) symmetry breaking.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
