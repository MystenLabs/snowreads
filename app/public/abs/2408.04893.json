We present a mechanical cantilever-based tabletop\ninterferometer to measure the force exerted by light from a pulsed laser beam.\nThe experiment uses the interference of two sinusoidal voltage signals passing\nthrough nominally similar dielectrics formed by two cantilever-based air\ncapacitors on a PCB. The radiation force exerted by a pulsed laser beam on one\nof the air capacitors causes a change in its capacitance, which is measured as\na proportional change in the interfering voltage signal. This experiment uses\nequipment commonly found in an undergraduate teaching laboratory for physics\nand electronics while providing excellent insight into electromagnetic wave\ntheory, circuit design for low-noise measurements, Fourier analysis, and\ninterpretation of experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
