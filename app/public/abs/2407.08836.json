Traditional diagnostic systems\noften struggle with the complexity and variability of power grid data. This\npaper proposes a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs),\nspecifically ChatGPT and GPT-4, combined with advanced prompt engineering to\nenhance fault diagnosis accuracy and explainability. We designed comprehensive,\ncontext-aware prompts to guide the LLMs in interpreting complex data and\nproviding detailed, actionable insights. Our method was evaluated against\nbaseline techniques, including standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and\nTree-of-Thought (ToT) methods, using a newly constructed dataset comprising\nreal-time sensor data, historical fault records, and component descriptions.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic\naccuracy, explainability quality, response coherence, and contextual\nunderstanding, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach. These findings\nsuggest that prompt-engineered LLMs offer a promising solution for robust and\nreliable power grid fault diagnosis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
