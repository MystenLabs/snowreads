Unlike controlled\nlaboratory settings, real-world environments often contain motion artifacts and\nnoise, affecting the performance of existing rPPG methods. To address this, we\npropose PhysMamba, a dual-Pathway time-frequency interaction model via State\nSpace Duality. This method allows the network to learn richer, more\nrepresentative features, enhancing robustness in noisy conditions. To\nfacilitate information exchange and feature complementation between the two\npathways, we design an improved algorithm: Cross-Attention State Space Duality\n(CASSD). We conduct comparative experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD\ndatasets. Experimental results show that PhysMamba achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, particularly in complex environments, demonstrating its potential\nin practical remote physiological signal measurement applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
