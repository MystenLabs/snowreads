Pure Appl.\nAlgebra, 198(1-3), 43--55 (2005)]. We investigate the $t$-fold Segre powers of\nthe Boolean lattice $B_n$ and the subspace lattice $B_n(q)$. The case $t=2$ was\nconsidered by Yifei Li in [Alg. Comb. 6 (2), 457--469, 2023]. We describe how\nto construct an EL-labeling for the $t$-fold Segre power $P^{(t)}=P\\circ \\cdots\n\\circ P$ ($t$ factors) from an EL-labeling of a pure poset $P$. We develop an\nextension of the product Frobenius characteristic defined by Li to examine the\naction of the $t$-fold direct product of the symmetric group on the homology of\nrank-selected subposets of $B_n^{(t)}$, giving an explicit formula for the\ndecomposition into irreducibles for the homology of the full poset. We show\nthat the stable principal specialisation of the associated Frobenius\ncharacteristics coincides with the corresponding rank-selected invariants for\nthe $t$-fold Segre power of the subspace lattice.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
