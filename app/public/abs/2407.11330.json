Such phenomena are ubiquitously\nobserved in nature, from cell migration, bacterial swarms, animal and insect\ngroups, and even human societies. Primary mechanisms responsible for the\nemergence of collective behavior have been extensively identified, including\nlocal alignments based on average or relative velocity, non-local pairwise\nrepulsive-attractive interactions such as distance-based potentials, interplay\nbetween local and non-local interactions, and cognitive-based inhomogeneous\ninteractions. However, discovering how to adapt these mechanisms to modulate\nemergent behaviours remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible\nto generate coordinated structures in collective behavior at desired moments\nwith intended global patterns by fine-tuning an inter-agent interaction rule.\nOur strategy employs deep neural networks, obeying the laws of dynamics, to\nfind interaction rules that command desired collective structures. The\ndecomposition of interaction rules into distancing and aligning forces,\nexpressed by polynomial series, facilitates the training of neural networks to\npropose desired interaction models. Presented examples include altering the\nmean radius and size of clusters in vortical swarms, timing of transitions from\nrandom to ordered states, and continuously shifting between typical modes of\ncollective motions. This strategy can even be leveraged to superimpose\ncollective modes, resulting in hitherto unexplored but highly practical hybrid\ncollective patterns, such as protective security formations. Our findings\nreveal innovative strategies for creating and controlling collective motion,\npaving the way for new applications in robotic swarm operations, active matter\norganisation, and for the uncovering of obscure interaction rules in biological\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
