However, their practical applicability is limited due to\nthe subproblems, which often require an exhaustive search over a discrete\ndictionary and incur significant computational costs. This limitation becomes\ncritical, especially in high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we propose a\nmore practical approach of randomly discretizing the dictionary at each\niteration of the greedy algorithm. We quantify the required size of the\nrandomized discrete dictionary and prove that, with high probability, the\nproposed algorithm realizes a weak greedy algorithm, achieving optimal\nconvergence orders. Through numerous numerical experiments, we demonstrate the\nadvantage of using randomized discrete dictionaries over a deterministic one by\nshowing orders of magnitude reductions in the size of the discrete dictionary,\nparticularly in higher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
