The saturation number sat$(n,H)$ is the minimum number of edges\nin an $H$-saturated graph on $n$ vertices. In this paper, we determine the\nsaturation number sat$(n,P_7+tP_2)$ for $n\\geq \\frac {14}{5}t+27$ and\ncharacterize the extremal graphs for $n\\geq \\frac{14}{13}(3t+25)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
