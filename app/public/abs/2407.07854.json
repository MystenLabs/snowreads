Abrams introduced a cubical complex, denoted here\nby DConf$(G,n)$, sitting inside Conf$(G,n)$ as a strong deformation retract\nprovided $G$ is suitably subdivided. Using discrete Morse Theory techniques, we\nextend Abrams' result to the realm of configurations having no $k$-fold\ncollisions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
