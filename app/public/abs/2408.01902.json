Despite substantial\nwork in this area, a comprehensive survey on GNN characterization is lacking.\nThis work presents a comprehensive survey, proposing a triple-level\nclassification method to categorize, summarize, and compare existing efforts.\nIn addition, we identify promising future directions for GNN characterization.\nOur survey aims to help scholars systematically understand GNN performance\nbottlenecks and patterns from a computer architecture perspective, contributing\nto more efficient GNN execution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KaURD7r-3KzokO_vffvjYv96V3fKjS1gNdXADhT5cn4","pdfSize":"2054278","txDigest":"8sP9SDgj2vu8e9TZoxDmA5AxDdFQMhVNDWjD97mBCdNq","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
