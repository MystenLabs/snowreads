We count the\nnumber of arcs in such a surface, and associate a graded quiver with\nsuperpotential associated with an $(m2)$-angulation. We show the compatibility\nbetween the flip of an $(m+2)$-angulation and the flip in the unpunctured case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
