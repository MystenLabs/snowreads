With ChatGPT as the backbone,\nthis app ecosystem has illustrated great business potential by offering users\npersonalized services in a conversational manner. Nonetheless, many crucial\naspects regarding app development, deployment, and security of this ecosystem\nhave yet to be thoroughly studied in the research community, potentially\nhindering a broader adoption by both developers and users. In this work, we\nconduct the first comprehensive study of the ChatGPT app ecosystem, aiming to\nilluminate its landscape for our research community. Our study examines the\ndistribution and deployment models in the integration of LLMs and third-party\napps, and assesses their security and privacy implications. We uncover an\nuneven distribution of functionality among ChatGPT plugins, highlighting\nprevalent and emerging topics. We also identify severe flaws in the\nauthentication and user data protection for third-party app APIs integrated\nwithin LLMs, revealing a concerning status quo of security and privacy in this\napp ecosystem. Our work provides insights for the secure and sustainable\ndevelopment of this rapidly evolving ecosystem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
