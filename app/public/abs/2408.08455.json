Central to the\nfunc-tionality of the SuperNANO system is its capacity for simultaneous\nnanoimaging and nanopatterning, enabling the creation of anti-counterfeiting\nmarkings and precision cutting with exceptional accuracy. The SuperNANO system,\nfeaturing a unibody superlens objective, achieves a resolution ranging from 50\nto 320 nm. We showcase the instrument's versatility through its application in\ngenerating high-security anti-counterfeiting features on an aluminum film.\nThese 'invisible' security features, which are nanoscale in dimension, can be\ncrafted with arbi-trary shapes at designated locations. Moreover, the system's\nprecision is further evidenced by its ability to cut silver nanowires to a\nminimum width of 50 nm. The integrated imaging and fabricating functions of the\nSu-perNANO make it a pivotal tool for a variety of applications, including nano\ntrapping, sensing, cutting, weld-ing, drilling, signal enhancement, detection,\nand nano laser treatment.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
