Many of\nthe applications of cavity-QED and cold-atom experiments more broadly, suffer\nfrom limitations caused by the transient nature of an atomic loading cycle. The\ndevelopment of continuous operation schemes is necessary to push these systems\nto the next level of performance. Here we present a machine designed to produce\na continuous flux of collimated atoms that traverse an optical cavity. The\natom-light interaction is enhanced by a fast-decaying cavity optimal for\nstudying phenomena where atomic properties dominate. We demonstrate the\ntransition to a collective strong coupling regime heralded by a normal-mode\nsplitting. We observe a second phase with a binary normal-mode splitting born\nfrom an offset in the mean velocity of the atoms. Inverting the atomic ensemble\nin the collective strong coupling regime, we measure continuous optical gain.\nThis work sets the stage for studying threshold conditions for continuous\ncollective phenomena, such as continuous superradiant lasing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
