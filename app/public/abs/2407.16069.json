We show that, for any suitable probability measure $\\mu$,\nrandom walks with respect to $\\mu$ will produce elements with strong mixing\nproperties for this action asymptotically almost surely. In particular, when\nthe group has no finite normal subgroups this implies that the action is highly\ntopologically transitive. Along the way, we prove technical results about\nconvex cocompact subgroups which allow us to extend some results on random\nwalks of Abbott and the first author.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
