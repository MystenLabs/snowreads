In particular, we prove that the maximal sphere\npacking densities $\\delta_n$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy \\[\\delta_n\\leq\n\\frac{1+o(1)}{e}\\cdot \\delta^{\\text{KL}}_{n}\\] for large $n$, where\n$\\delta^{\\text{KL}}_{n}$ is the best bound on $\\delta_n$ obtained essentially\nby Kabatyanskii and Levenshtein from the 1970s with improvements over the\nyears. We also obtain the same improvement factor for the maximal size\n$M(n,\\theta)$ of $\\theta$-spherical codes in $S^{n-1}$: for angles\n$0<\\theta<\\theta'\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, \\[M(n,\\theta)\\leq \\frac{1+o(1)}{e}\\cdot\n\\frac{M_{\\text{Lev}}(n-1,\\theta')}{\\mu_n(\\theta,\\theta')}\\] for large $n$,\nwhere $\\mu_n(\\theta,\\theta')$ is the mass of the spherical cap in the unit\nsphere $S^{n-1}$ of radius $\\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\sin(\\theta'/2)}$, and\n$M_{\\text{Lev}}(n-1,\\theta')$ is Levenshtein's upper bound on $M(n-1,\\theta')$\nwhen applying the Delsarte linear programming method to Levenshtein's optimal\npolynomials. In fact, we prove that there are no analytic losses in our\narguments and that the constant $\\frac{1}{e}=0.367...$ is optimal for the class\nof functions considered. Our results also show that the improvement factor does\nnot depend on the special angle $\\theta^*=62.997...^{\\circ}$, explaining the\nnumerics in arXiv:2001.00185. In the spherical codes case, the above inequality\nimproves the Kabatyanskii--Levenshtein bound by a factor of $0.2304...$ on\ngeometric average. Along the way, we construct a general class of functions\nusing Stiefel manifolds for which we prove general results and study the\nimprovement factors obtained from them in various settings.and study the\nimprovement factors obtained from them in various settings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
