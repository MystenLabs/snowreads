A prime conclusion is an ``openness'' result: once the\nsingular locus has sufficiently large codimension, $\\mathrm{Dec}$ turns out to\nbe open. In the present paper, we study the locus $\\mathrm{LF}$ of points of a\nfamily of distributions where the tangent sheaf is {\\it locally free}. Through\ngeneral Commutative Algebra, we show that $\\mathrm{LF}$ is open provided that\nsingularities have codimension at least three. When dealing with foliations\nrather than distributions, the condition on the lower bound of the singular set\ncan be weakened by the introduction of ``Kupka'' points. We apply the available\n``openness'' results to families in $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathbb C}^n$ and in $\\mathcal\nB$, the variety of Borel subgroups of a simple group. By establishing a theorem\nputting in bijection irreducible components of the space of two-dimensional\nsubalgebras of a given semi-simple Lie algebra and its nilpotent orbits, we\nconclude that the space of foliations of {\\it rank two} on $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathbb\nC}^n$ and $\\mathcal B$, may have quite many irreducible components as $n$ and\n$\\dim \\mathcal B$ grow. We also set in place several algebro-geometric\nfoundations for the theory of families of distributions in two appendices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wmseix8Lk43TzjYfZXLLv2Tgjn_0vmWLt_vAsT51TYE","pdfSize":"728269"}
