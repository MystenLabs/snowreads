We introduce a novel conceptual\nframework for phase analysis, using the osculating circle to construct a\nco-moving coordinate system, which allows us to define a unique phase of the\nsystem. This coordinate independent, geometrical technique allows dissecting\nintricate local phase dynamics, even in regimes where traditional methods fail.\nOur methodology enables the analysis of a wider range of complex systems which\nwere previously deemed intractable.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
