We then give a general class of ALF spaces such that each of them\ncontains a non-holomorphic minimal sphere. Together with Foscolo's construction\nthis gives a large class of $K3$ surfaces containing non-holomorphic minimal\nspheres.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
