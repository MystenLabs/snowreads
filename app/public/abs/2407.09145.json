These\ndecays are governed by the same set of Wilson-coefficients at the tree level in\nStandard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). In this study, we aim to explain\nthis potential discrepancy between the decays $h\\to \\gamma \\gamma$ and $h\\to\nZ\\gamma$. We conduct a model-independent analysis in SMEFT to determine the\nmagnitude and features of the Wilson coefficients required to account for the\nobserved distinction between the two signal strengths. Following this, we adopt\na top-down approach, considering all single and two field extensions of the SM,\nincluding scalars and fermions, as candidates for new interactions. We perform\nthe matching of these models to one loop using automated packages and compare\nthe models' predictions regarding $h\\to Z\\gamma$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0OmT6pnOCxVeHq_K9AYM2dpRH8xmxY7GBG7tPRQDCJk","pdfSize":"550895","objectId":"0x0327cb68ba46bcad0687f3e3c3eb31b1add871b74b2a80cc75e1485f33723719","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
