We prove that there is a constant $c>0$ such that\nfor any unit vectors $v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$,\n  $$\\Pr\\left[||\\epsilon_1 v_1+\\ldots+\\epsilon_n v_n||_2 \\leq\n\\sqrt{2}\\right]\\geq \\frac{c}{n}.$$\n  This resolves the only remaining conjecture from the seminal paper of\nErd\\H{o}s on the Littlewood--Offord problem, and it is sharp both in the sense\nthat the constant $\\sqrt{2}$ cannot be reduced and that the magnitude $n^{-1}$\nis best possible. We also prove polynomial bounds for the analogous problem in\nhigher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
