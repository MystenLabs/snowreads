Much work has been done on addressing\nthis challenge, but most of the existing research ignores the bias introduced\nby the post-treatment variables. In this paper, we propose a novel method of\njoint Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and identifiable Variational AutoEncoder\n(iVAE) for learning the representations of latent confounders and latent\npost-treatment variables from their proxy variables, termed CPTiVAE, to achieve\nunbiased causal effect estimation from observational data. We further prove the\nidentifiability in terms of the representation of latent post-treatment\nvariables. Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets\ndemonstrate that the CPTiVAE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the\npresence of latent confounders and post-treatment variables. We further apply\nCPTiVAE to a real-world dataset to show its potential application.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
