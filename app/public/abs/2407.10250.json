We derive the series expression for the probability density function\n(PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and moment generating function\n(MGF) of the product and ratio of i.n.i.d $ \\alpha - \\kappa - \\mu $ shadowed\nrandom variables. We then give the single integral representation for the\nderived PDF expressions. Further, as application examples, 1) outage\nprobability has been derived for cascaded wireless systems, and 2)\nphysical-layer security metrics like secrecy outage probability and strictly\npositive secrecy capacity are derived for the classic three-node model with\n$\\alpha-\\kappa-\\mu$ shadowed fading. Next, we discuss an intelligent reflecting\nsurface-assisted communication system over $\\alpha-\\kappa-\\mu$ shadowed fading.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"A8ukkKjNSfdMDggzDRxphPebwF7YCAG4TrHotdIkwF8","pdfSize":"1042392"}
