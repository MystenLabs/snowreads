The correlations\nare consistent with 'risk-on' behavior in markets, a term which describes\ninvestors moving toward riskier asset classes, as the election results became\nclearer. Further, we decompose the market reaction into a 'reduction in\nuncertainty' component and a 'probability of a Democratic party presidency'\ncomponent. This decomposition reveals how markets reacted to the increasing\ncertainty of the outcome as election results came in. Finally, we analyze the\ndiffering market reactions to the presidential election and the Senate\nelection, including data from the unique Georgia runoffs, and demonstrate that\nbond prices were particularly sensitive to the probability of a combined\nDemocratic Senate and Presidency.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BEqzejj8HmsPnRucgsjofrkgOryyG85Xsw-OO_YCZXM","pdfSize":"535634"}
