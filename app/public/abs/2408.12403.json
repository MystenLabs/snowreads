In this work, we\ninvestigate the implications of RSD for a cosmological framework postulating an\ninteraction between Dark Energy (DE) and Dark Matter (DM). We explore scenarios\nwhere DM can transfer energy-momentum to DE or vice versa. The energy-momentum\nflow is characterized by the strength and the sign of the coupling parameter\n$\\xi$. Our baseline analysis combines RSD measurements with the latest data\nfrom Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observed by DESI, Type Ia Supernovae\nfrom the PantheonPlus sample, and CMB data from Planck. We demonstrate that RSD\nmeasurements provide significant additional information. When energy-momentum\nflows from DM to DE (i.e., $\\xi < 0$), these measurements set stringent new\nbounds on the interaction strength. Conversely, when energy-momentum flows from\nDE to DM ($\\xi > 0$), they favor interactions at more than the $2\\sigma$\nconfidence level. Models with $\\xi > 0$ can effectively resolve the tension in\n$S_8$, presenting them as compelling alternatives.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
