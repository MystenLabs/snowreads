However, in practice, manually\nspecified priors often lead to unreasonable simulation outcomes, a common\nobstacle for full Bayesian simulations. As a remedy, we propose to add small\nportions of real or simulated data, which creates implicit priors that improve\nthe stability of Bayesian simulations. We formalize this approach, providing a\ndetailed process for constructing implicit priors and relating them to existing\nresearch in this area. We also integrate the implicit priors into\nsimulation-based calibration, a prominent Bayesian simulation task. Through two\ncase studies, we demonstrate that implicit priors quickly improve simulation\nstability and model calibration. Our findings provide practical guidelines for\nimplementing implicit priors in various Bayesian modeling scenarios, showcasing\ntheir ability to generate more reliable simulation outcomes.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
