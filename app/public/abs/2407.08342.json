The matrix elements of the\nsubleading contact potentials become nearly dependent of each other for the\nso-called exceptional ultraviolet momentum cutoff, making it difficult to\ndetermine the strengths of those contact potentials from the empirical phase\nshifts, as reported in Ref. [1]. We argue that this issue can be resolved by\nadjusting the strategy by which the low-energy constants are deduced from the\ndata, thus making those exceptional cutoffs amenable to chiral effective field\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
