An essential aspect of this study is quantum\nmeasurement theory, which allows us to access the dynamical fluctuations of\nobservables via a two-point measurement scheme. Using this formalism, we\nestablish specific fluctuation theorems. Additionally, we demonstrate that\nquantum channels are represented by subfactors, using the relationship between\nmeasurement theory and quantum channels. We also comment on implementing a\nquantum channel using Jones' theory of subfactors.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
