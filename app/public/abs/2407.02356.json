However, current FU approaches often face\ntrade-offs between efficiency, model performance, forgetting efficacy, and\nprivacy preservation. In this paper, we delve into the paradigm of Federated\nClient Unlearning (FCU) to guarantee a client the right to erase the\ncontribution or the influence, introducing the first FU framework in medical\nimaging. In the unlearning process of a client, the proposed model-contrastive\nunlearning marks a pioneering step towards feature-level unlearning, and\nfrequency-guided memory preservation ensures smooth forgetting of local\nknowledge while maintaining the generalizability of the trained global model,\nthus avoiding performance compromises and guaranteeing rapid post-training. We\nevaluated our FCU framework on two public medical image datasets, including\nIntracranial hemorrhage diagnosis and skin lesion diagnosis, demonstrating that\nour framework outperformed other state-of-the-art FU frameworks, with an\nexpected speed-up of 10-15 times compared with retraining from scratch.
