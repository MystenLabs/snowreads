The traditional methodology is\nusually model-based, but its performance heavily relies on an accurate\nmathematical model of the system. In control applications with complex\ndynamics, obtaining a precise model is often challenging, leading us towards a\ndata-driven approach. While optimizing a single controller has been explored by\nvarious researchers, it remains a challenge to obtain the optimal controller\nparameters safely and efficiently when multiple controllers are involved. In\nthis paper, we propose a high-dimensional safe Bayesian optimization method\nbased on additive Gaussian processes to optimize multiple controllers\nsimultaneously and safely. Additive Gaussian kernels replace the traditional\nsquared-exponential kernels or Mat\\'ern kernels, enhancing the efficiency with\nwhich Gaussian processes update information on unknown functions. Experimental\nresults on a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) demonstrate that\ncompared to existing safe Bayesian optimization algorithms, our method can\nobtain optimal parameters more efficiently while ensuring safety.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
