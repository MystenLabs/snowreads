The superconducting state is generally thought to\nbe characterized by three gaps in different bands, with the usual homogenous,\nspatially extended Bogoliubov excitations -- in this work, we uncover evidence\nthat it is instead of a very different nature. Our scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy data shows several peaks in the density of states above a full\ngap, and by analyzing the spatial and junction-resistance dependence of the\npeaks, we conclude that the peaks above the first one are not coherence peaks\nfrom different bands. Instead, comparisons with our simulations indicate that\nthey originate from generalized Shiba states that are spatially overlapping.\nThis can lead to an amorphous state of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, reminiscent\nof impurity bands in semiconductors. We discuss the origin and implications of\nthis new state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
