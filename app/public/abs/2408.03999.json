In\nthis work we show that a characteristic spin-sublattice locking in altermagnets\nputs severe constraints on possible superconducting pairing. In particular, we\nuncover that the most common form of superconductivity, uniform $s$-wave\nspin-singlet pairing is not possible to achieve in altermagnets. Considering an\neffective model for a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet on a square lattice, we\ninstead find that the most likely forms of spin-singlet pairing have\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$- or extended $s$-wave symmetry. We also find that the simplest\nform of equal-spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing is not allowed, but it can only\nexist as a mixed-spin-triplet $p$-wave state. We verify these constraints on\npairing within an interaction-induced model of altermagnetism, where we also\nestablish their validity for finite-momentum pairing. Additionally we discuss\nthe possible pairing symmetries for odd-frequency superconducting pairing. Due\nto the generality of our results, they are applicable to both intrinsic\nsuperconductivity and proximity-induced superconductivity in\naltermagnet-superconductor hybrid junctions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
