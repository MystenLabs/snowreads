To ensure robust\ntractography and connectomes, resample data to 1 mm isotropic resolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
