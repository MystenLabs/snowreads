We first focus on a class of time-varying quadratic cost\nfunctions, and develop a new distributed algorithm that integrates an average\nestimator and an adaptive optimizer, with both bridged by a Dead Zone\nAlgorithm. Based on a composite Lyapunov function and finite escape-time\nanalysis, we prove the closed-loop global asymptotic convergence to the optimal\nsolution under mild assumptions. Particularly, the introduction of the\nestimator relaxes the requirement for the Hessians of cost functions, and the\nintegrated design eliminates the waiting time required in the relevant\nliterature for estimating global parameter during algorithm implementation. We\nthen extend this result to a more general class of time-varying cost functions.\nTwo examples are used to verify the proposed designs.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
