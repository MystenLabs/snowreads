Fast and radiation hard\ninorganic scintillators to face the challenge of severe radiation environment\nexpected by future HEP experiments at hadron colliders, such as the high\nluminosity LHC and FCC hh. Ultrafast inorganic scintillators to face the\nchallenge of unprecedented event rate expected by future HEP experiments\nsearching for rare decays, such as Mu2e II, and ultrafast time of flight system\nat hadron colliders. Cost effective inorganic scintillators for the homogeneous\nhadron calorimeter concept to face the challenge of both electromagnetic and\njet mass resolutions required by the proposed Higgs factory. We report novel\nmaterials along all directions: LuAG:Ce ceramic fibers for the HL LHC, Lu2O3:Yb\nceramic scintillators for ultrafast applications, and ABS:Ce and DSB:Ce glass\nscintillators for the proposed Higgs factory. The result of this investigation\nmay also benefit nuclear physics experiments, GHz hard X ray imaging, medical\nimaging, and homeland security applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
