In this\nwork, we study the spreading of an initial product state in Hilbert space under\ndual-unitary dynamics, captured by the inverse participation ratios and the\ndistribution of overlaps (bit-string probabilities). We consider the self-dual\nkicked Ising model, a minimal model of many-body quantum chaos which can be\nseen as either a periodically driven Floquet model or a dual-unitary quantum\ncircuit. Both analytically and numerically, we show that the inverse\nparticipation ratios rapidly approach their ergodic values, corresponding to\nthose of Haar random states, and establish the emergence of the Porter-Thomas\ndistribution for the overlap distribution. Importantly, this convergence\nhappens exponentially fast in time, with a time scale that is independent of\nsystem size. We inspect the effect of local perturbations that break\ndual-unitarity and show a slowdown of the spreading in Fock space, indicating\nthat dual-unitary circuits are maximally efficient at preparing random states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
