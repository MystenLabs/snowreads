Acronal localization\nfulfills automatically the requirements of causality. It constitutes the frame\nwhich complies most completely with the principle of causality for quantum\nmechanical systems. Acronal localization is equivalent to the localization in\nthe regions of the causal logic. Representations of the causal logic are\nconstructed for the systems with mass spectrum of positive Lebesgue measure and\nevery definite spin. Apparently no representation of the causal logic for a\nreal mass system has been achieved in the past.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
