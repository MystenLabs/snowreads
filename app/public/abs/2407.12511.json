In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach termed CoLIE, which redefines the enhancement\nprocess through mapping the 2D coordinates of an underexposed image to its\nillumination component, conditioned on local context. We propose a\nreconstruction of enhanced-light images within the HSV space utilizing an\nimplicit neural function combined with an embedded guided filter, thereby\nsignificantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, we introduce a single\nimage-based training loss function to enhance the model's adaptability to\nvarious scenes, further enhancing its practical applicability. Through rigorous\nevaluations, we analyze the properties of our proposed framework, demonstrating\nits superiority in both image quality and scene adaptability. Furthermore, our\nevaluation extends to applications in downstream tasks within low-light\nscenarios, underscoring the practical utility of CoLIE.
