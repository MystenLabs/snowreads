To address this, we study a quantum system that exhibits\nchaotic behavior in its classical limit: the kicked top model, whose classical\ndynamics are governed by Hamilton's equations on phase space, whereas its\nquantum dynamics are described by the Schr\\\"odinger equation in Hilbert space.\nWe explore the critical degree of non-linearity signifying the onset of chaos\nin the kicked top by modifying the original Hamiltonian so that the\nnon-linearity is parametrized by a quantity $p$. We find two distinct behaviors\nof the modified kicked top depending on the value of $p$. Chaos intensifies as\n$p$ varies within the range of $1\\leq p \\leq 2$, whereas it diminishes for $p >\n2$, eventually transitioning to a purely regular oscillating system as $p$\ntends to infinity. We also comment on the complicated phase space structure for\nnon-chaotic dynamics. Our investigation sheds light on the relationship between\nnon-linearity and chaos in classical systems, offering insights into their\ndynamic behavior.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
