We present an algorithm of constructing a\ncomplete set of possible arguments of $\\text{Li}_n$ functions. The\ncorresponding Mathematica code is included as ancillary file. Using this\nalgorithm and the symbol map, we provide some examples of polylogarithmic\nidentities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
