Here we employ the quantum decoherence imaging\ntechnique utilizing nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to explore the critical\nmagnetic fluctuations and the associated temporal spin noise in van der Waals\nmagnet $\\rm{Fe_{3}GeTe_{2}}$. We show that the critical fluctuation contributes\nto a random magnetic field characterized by the noise spectra, which can be\nchanged dramatically near the critical temperature $T_c$. A theoretical model\nto describe this phenomenon is developed, showing that the spectral density is\ncharacterized by a $1/f$ noise near the $T_c$, while away from this point it\nbehaves like a white noise. The crossover at a certain temperature between\nthese two situations is determined by changing of the distance between the\nsample and the diamond. This work provides a new way to study critical\nfluctuation and to extract some of the critical exponents, which may greatly\ndeepen our understanding of criticality in a wide range of physical systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
