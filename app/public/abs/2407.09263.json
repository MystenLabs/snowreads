We use the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET)\nas the main theoretical tool. We conclude that collinear factorization holds in\nthe double-deeply virtual case, where both photons are far off-shell. The\nagreement is found with the known results for the hard matching coefficients at\nleading order $\\alpha_s^0$, and we can therefore connect the traditional\napproach with SCET. In the single-deeply-virtual case, commonly called deeply\nvirtual Compton scattering (DVCS), the contribution of non-target collinear\nregions complicates the factorization. These include momentum modes collinear\nto the real photon and ultrasoft interactions between the photon-collinear and\ntarget-collinear modes. Indeed, we identify a potentially problematic\nnon-perturbative contribution, which might violate the universality of the\ngeneralized parton distributions (GPDs) at NLP accuracy.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
