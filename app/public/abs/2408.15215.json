In this paper, we close several significant gaps: 1) We prove\n$2$-point concentration of the maximum sizes of an induced forest and an\ninduced tree with maximum degree at most $\\Delta$ in dense binomial random\ngraphs $G(n,p)$ with constant probability $p$. 2) We show concentration in an\nexplicit interval of size $o(1/p)$ for the maximum size of an induced forest\nwith maximum degree at most $\\Delta$ for $1/n\\ll p=o(1)$. Our proofs rely on\nboth the second moment approach, with the probabilistic part involving\nTalagrand's concentration inequality and the analytical part involving\nsaddle-point analysis, and new results on enumeration of labelled trees and\nforests that might be of their own interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
