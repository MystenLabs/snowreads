We\npresent a new conjecture that states that if such a matrix has vanishing\ndeterminant, then after a rational change of basis on the left and right, it\ncan be made to have a vanishing coefficient.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
