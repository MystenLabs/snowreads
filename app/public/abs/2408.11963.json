In this paper we introduce IncX, an algorithm for real-time incremental\napproximations of explanations, based on linear transformations of saliency\nmaps. We implement IncX on top of D-RISE, a state-of-the-art black-box\nexplainability tool for object detectors. We show that IncX's explanations are\ncomparable in quality to those of D-RISE, with insertion curves being within\n8%, and are computed two orders of magnitude faster that D-RISE's explanations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tj-p9LmWanmi93XhzRyAzHEmuvvqhX4dOXy4GGzf03A","pdfSize":"6111588"}
