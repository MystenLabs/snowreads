Earlier findings\nincluded a saddle-node bifurcation, whose terminal point initiated the\nobservation of chaos; the system was found to exhibit bistability and potential\nquasiperiodicity. We now complement these findings by the identification of\nunstable manifolds of saddle periodic solutions (saddle points of the\nstroboscopic map) within the system dynamics. We unravel how homoclinic tangles\nof these manifolds lead to the appearance of a chaotic attractor, upon the\napparent period-doubling bifurcations that destroy invariant tori associated\nwith quasiperiodicity. These findings complement the earlier ones, offering\nmore concrete insights into the emergence of chaos within this\nhigh-dimensional, experimentally accessible system.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
