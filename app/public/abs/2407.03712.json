The generalized Riemann invariants associated with the\nrarefaction waves, the contact discontinuity and the shear waves are given, and\nthe 1D exact Riemann solver is obtained. After that, the generalized Riemann\ninvariants and the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions are directly used to\nresolve the left and right nonlinear waves (rarefaction wave and shock wave) of\nthe local GRP in Eulerian formulation, and then the 1D direct Eulerian GRP\nscheme is derived. They are much more complicated, technical and nontrivial due\nto more physical variables and elementary waves. Some 1D and 2D numerical\nexperiments are presented to check the accuracy and high resolution of the\nproposed GRP schemes, where the 2D direct Eulerian GRP scheme is given by using\nthe Strang splitting method for simplicity. It should be emphasized that\nseveral examples of 2D Riemann problems are constructed for the first time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
