Recently, there has been increasing interest\nin computing PageRank on dynamic graphs, where the graph structure evolves due\nto edge insertions and deletions. However, traditional barrier-based approaches\nfor updating PageRanks encounter significant wait times on certain graph\nstructures, leading to high overall runtimes. Additionally, the growing trend\nof multicore architectures with increased core counts has raised concerns about\nrandom thread delays and failures. In this study, we propose a lock-free\nalgorithm for updating PageRank scores on dynamic graphs. First, we introduce\nour Dynamic Frontier (DF) approach, which identifies and processes vertices\nlikely to change PageRanks with minimal overhead. Subsequently, we integrate DF\nwith our lock-free and fault-tolerant PageRank ($DF_{LF}$), incorporating a\nhelping mechanism among threads between its two phases. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that $DF_{LF}$ not only eliminates waiting times at iteration\nbarriers but also withstands random thread delays and crashes. On average, it\nis 4.6x faster than lock-free Naive-dynamic PageRank ($ND_{LF}$).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7B0y8K17Bu8mtPJ7kwoO3qX9-a0ZeUrmDAsZL8ic6cg","pdfSize":"1156874"}
