We explore the\ncorrelations between a pc-scale radio wind and the BLR wind in a sample of 19\nRQ Palomar-Green (PG) quasars. The radio wind is defined based on the spectral\nslope and the compactness of the emission at 1.5-5 GHz, and the BLR wind is\ndefined by the excess blue wing in the C IV emission line profile. The five\nobjects with both radio and BLR wind indicators are found at high Eddington\nratios L/L_Edd (> 0.66), and eight of the nine objects with neither radio nor\nBLR winds reside at low L/L_Edd (< 0.28). This suggests that the BLR wind and\nthe radio wind in RQ AGN are related to a radiation pressure driven wind.\nEvidence for free-free absorption by AGN photoionized gas, which flattens the\nspectral slope, is found in two objects. Radio outflows in three low L/L_Edd\n(0.05-0.12) objects are likely from a low-power jet, as suggested by additional\nevidence. The presence of a mild equatorial BLR wind in four intermediate\nL/L_Edd (0.2-0.4) objects can be tested with future spectropolarimetry.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
