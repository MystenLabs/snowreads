They form a natural\ncounterpart to the classes of malleable and quasi-malleable varieties. The\napproximation property studied here is stronger than the ones considered\nbefore, and allows one to deduce non-trivial facts about extensions of regular\nmappings between varieties from closed subvarieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
