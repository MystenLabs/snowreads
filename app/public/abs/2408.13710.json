Skandalis, that the universal covering group of the unitary group\nof a II$_1$ von Neumann algebra $\\mathcal{M}$, when equipped with the norm\ntopology, splits algebraically as the direct product of the self-adjoint part\nof its center and the unitary group $U(\\mathcal{M})$. Thus, when $\\mathcal{M}$\nis a II$_1$ factor, the universal covering group of $U(\\mathcal{M})$ is\nalgebraically isomorphic to the direct product $\\mathbb{R} \\times\nU(\\mathcal{M})$. In particular, the question of P. de la Harpe and D. McDuff of\nwhether the universal cover of $U(\\mathcal{M})$ is a perfect group is answered\nin the negative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y2_LUSv6dMZmcPHZyIPBRAc3XnIPSAVcmHJzt7uTjo0","pdfSize":"565667"}
