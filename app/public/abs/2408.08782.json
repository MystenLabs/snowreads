Recently, with\nadvancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents\nwithout explicit socio-emotional strategy prediction steps have become\nprevalent. However, despite their excellence in language generation, recent\nstudies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain\nsocio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional\nsupport. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction\nfrom language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy predictor,\nEmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user emotions and\nsystem strategies using a heterogeneous graph. Additionally, we make use of the\nEmotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) task and design a flexible\nmixed-emotion module to capture fine-grained emotional states of the user.\nExperimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods with a significant margin.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_Wbqw3CH25-BF9Jy1d046jjP4JysWJSuEpOJ7BF14PI","pdfSize":"2034082"}
