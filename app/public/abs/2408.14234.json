In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation\nmetric to address several problems of its predecessors and allow for flexible\nand reliable evaluation of feature selection algorithms. The proposed metric is\na dynamic metric with two properties that can be used to evaluate both the\nperformance and the stability of a feature selection algorithm. We conduct\nseveral empirical experiments to illustrate the use of the proposed metric in\nthe successful evaluation of feature selection algorithms. We also provide a\ncomparison and analysis to show the different aspects involved in the\nevaluation of the feature selection algorithms. The results indicate that the\nproposed metric is successful in carrying out the evaluation task for feature\nselection algorithms.\n  This paper is an extended version of a paper accepted at SISAP 2024.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dC8V-RQ-irdDnCtIrwo_4mEAN06EQfsIEAgE1ypIVMs","pdfSize":"566469"}
