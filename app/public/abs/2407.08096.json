This is possible because of the important dynamical role\nthat phase plays in the evolution of quantum systems, very similar,\nnonetheless, to effects observable in analogous optical systems. The present\nwork focuses on how Bohmian mechanics proves to be a rather convenient\ntheoretical framework to analyze phase-based phenomena, since the phase\nconstitutes the central element in this hydrodynamical formulation of quantum\nmechanics. More specifically, it allows us to understand how spatial phase\nvariations give rise to velocity fields that eventually rule the dynamical\nbehavior of quantum systems, and that, when integrated in time locally (i.e.,\ntaking into account specific positions), they provide us with a neat local\n(point by point) description of the system evolution in the configuration\nspace. Indeed, it will also be seen that this idea transcends the quantum realm\nand can be profitably used to describe the behavior of optical analogs with\nrather singular behaviors. With this purpose, two interesting phenomena that\ntake place in free space are considered, namely, the self-acceleration and\nshape-invariance of Airy beams, and spontaneous self-focusing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
