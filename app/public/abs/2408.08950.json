In this\nwork, we reexamine the impact of an EMD on the weakly- and feebly-interacting\nmassive particle (WIMP and FIMP) paradigms. EMD eras significantly modify the\ngenesis of DM because of the change in the Hubble expansion rate and the\ninjection of entropy. The WIMP paradigm can be realized with couplings much\nsmaller than in the standard cosmological scenario, whereas much larger\ncouplings are required in the FIMP case. Using the singlet-scalar DM model as a\ncase study, we show that these results can lead to a continuous transition\nbetween the WIMP and FIMP scenarios, with results that are also applicable to\nother DM models. This broadens the parameter space consistent with observed DM\nlevels and suggests that even elusive FIMP scenarios may be within the reach of\nfuture experimental searches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Av61eG5OJGfniQi_uNXB72iqZRXa1u819WPGS5h-RF4","pdfSize":"1462319"}
