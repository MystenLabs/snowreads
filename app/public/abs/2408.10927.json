In this context, a vertical column on the slab\ncomprises the set of vertical edges projecting to the same vertex on\n$\\mathbb{Z}_+\\times\\{0,\\dots,k\\}$. Columns are chosen based on the arrivals of\na renewal process, where the tail distributions of inter-arrival times follow a\npower law with exponent $\\alpha>1$. Inhomogeneities are introduced as follows:\nvertical edges on selected columns are open (closed) with probability $q$\n(respectively $1-q$), independently. Conversely, vertical edges within\nunselected columns and all horizontal edges are open (closed) with probability\n$p$ (respectively $1-p$). We prove that for all sufficiently large $\\alpha$\n(depending solely on $k$), the following assertion holds: if\n$q>p_c(\\mathbb{S}^+_k)$, then $p$ can be taken strictly smaller than\n$p_c(\\mathbb{S}^+_k)$ in a manner that percolation still occurs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
