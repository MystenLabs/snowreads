However,\nthe number of MOFs reported to exhibit proton conductivity remains limited, and\nthe mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully elucidated,\ncomplicating the design of proton-conductive MOFs. In response, we developed a\ncomprehensive database of proton-conductive MOFs and applied machine learning\ntechniques to predict their proton conductivity. Our approach included the\nconstruction of both descriptor-based and transformer-based models. Notably,\nthe transformer-based transfer learning (Freeze) model performed the best with\na mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.91, suggesting that the proton conductivity of\nMOFs can be estimated within one order of magnitude using this model.\nAdditionally, we employed feature importance and principal component analysis\nto explore the factors influencing proton conductivity. The insights gained\nfrom our database and machine learning model are expected to facilitate the\ntargeted design of proton-conductive MOFs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
