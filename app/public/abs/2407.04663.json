It is a cost-efficient and\neffective approach for assessing myocardial function. However, ultrasound\nimaging has the inherent characteristics of spatially low resolution and\ntemporally random noise, which leads to difficulties in obtaining reliable\nannotation. Thus it is difficult to perform supervised learning for motion\ntracking. In addition, there is no end-to-end unsupervised method currently in\nthe literature. This paper presents a motion tracking method where unsupervised\noptical flow networks are designed with spatial reconstruction loss and\ntemporal-consistency loss. Our proposed loss functions make use of the\npair-wise and temporal correlation to estimate cardiac motion from noisy\nbackground. Experiments using a synthetic 4D echocardiography dataset has shown\nthe effectiveness of our approach, and its superiority over existing methods on\nboth accuracy and running speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work performed that uses unsupervised end-to-end deep learning optical\nflow network for 4D cardiac motion tracking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
