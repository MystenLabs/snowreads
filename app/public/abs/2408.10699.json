One such potential test arises\nfrom the fact that the surface of zero expansion around the collapsing object\nwith spherical symmetry is strictly related to the object's mass and the value\nof the cosmological constant. We propose a complementary probe relating the\naveraged zero-expansion volume to the mass and the background cosmological\nHubble parameter. Using the relativistic Zel'dovich approximation we are able\nto relax the spherical symmetry assumption and hence obtain a more general test\nof cosmological dynamics. Alternatively, our method can serve as a test of\ncompatibility of relativistic N-body simulations and the scalar, averaged\nEinstein's equations with the relativistic Zel'dovich approximation serving as\na closure condition.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"niaV2fmJk5Jt8uBdoTE85kM1wbXA5LZjdh4eaPWuZc8","pdfSize":"99495"}
