Aided by the Hilbert series, we construct all the basic invariants with\nwhich any flavor invariant can be written as a polynomial. In special, this\ntheory contains one CP odd invariant of degree six which has degree much lower\nthan the usual Jarlskog invariant of the SM. We find the nonlinear polynomial\nrelations (syzygies) of lowest degrees involving these basic invariants,\nincluding the expression of the square of the CP odd invariant of lowest degree\nin terms of CP even invariants. The $SU(3)$ identity underlying this syzygy is\nuncovered in terms of invariant tensors, which can be applied to rewrite any\nsquare of a CP odd invariant of the same form, involving three hermitean\nmatrices of size three. We demonstrate by an example that there is CP violation\nthat is not detected by the CP odd invariants proposed in the literature so far\nbut it can be detected with the full list of CP odd invariants found here.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"zvaC0M_5DHPF8dDLJfk1RMFYtO6sutnr1aO4eEWUqzY","pdfSize":"2968327"}
