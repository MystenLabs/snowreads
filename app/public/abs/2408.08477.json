For example, the high-profile investigation into\nthe Curtis Flowers case took seven reporters a full year to assemble evidence\nabout the prosecutor's history of selecting racially biased juries. LLMs have\nthe potential to automate and scale these transparency pipelines, especially\ngiven their demonstrated capabilities to extract information from unstructured\ndocuments. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs to provide\ntransparency in two important court processes: jury selection in criminal\ntrials and housing eviction cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uTP6jJnYfC7cbDzTkx_0Aq8-tPiTrKrZAcRYt5rA-dA","pdfSize":"2831048"}
