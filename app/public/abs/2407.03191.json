In this Letter, we demonstrate\nthat strong coupling between resonator structures and plasmonic nanoparticles\ncan be used to control the spectral overlap between the plasmonic excitation\nenergy and the charge injection energy into nearby molecules. Our atomistic\ndescription couples real-time density-functional theory self-consistently to\nMaxwell's equations via the radiation-reaction potential. Control over the\nresonator provides then an additional knob for non-intrusively enhancing\nplasmonic catalysis and dynamically reacting to deterioration of the catalyst\n-- a new facet of modern catalysis.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
