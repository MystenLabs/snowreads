We consider risk-neutral\ncomposite optimal control problems, where the objective function is the sum of\na potentially nonconvex expectation function and a nonsmooth convex function.\nTo approximate the risk-neutral optimization problems, we use a Monte Carlo\nsample-based approach, study its asymptotic consistency, and derive\nnonasymptotic sample size estimates. Our analyses leverage problem structure\ncommonly encountered in PDE-constrained optimization problems, including\ncompact embeddings and growth conditions. We apply our findings to\nbang-bang-type optimal control problems and propose the use of a conditional\ngradient method to solve them effectively. We present numerical illustrations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8i5oAd0AiQDx6CEd8u69o7GEkUQG0CxlRJ_3qNFbaoA","pdfSize":"1083382"}
