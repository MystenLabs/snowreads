One bottleneck\nof current PINNs is computing the high-order derivatives via automatic\ndifferentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources. In\nthis paper, we focus on removing the automatic differentiation of the spatial\nderivatives and propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the\ndifferential operator with a multiplication. Compared to the PINNs, our\napproach requires lower memory and shorter training time. Thanks to the\nexponential convergence of the spectral basis, our approach is more accurate.\nMoreover, to handle the different situations between physics domain and\nspectral domain, we provide two strategies to train networks by their spectral\ninformation. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, We validate the\naforementioned merits of our proposed network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
