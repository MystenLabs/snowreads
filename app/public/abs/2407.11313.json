We consider the poset topology of a\nspecific poset induced from a chordal building set, and show its\nEL-shellability. Based on this, we present an explicit description using\nalternating $\\mathcal{B}$-permutations for a chordal building set\n$\\mathcal{B}$, transforming the computing Betti numbers into a counting\nproblem. This approach allows us to compute the $a$-number of a finite simple\ngraph through permutation counting when the graph is chordal. In addition, we\nprovide detailed computations for specific cases such as real Hochschild\nvarieties corresponding to Hochschild polytopes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
