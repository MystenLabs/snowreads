Praise as a Social Signal","authors":"Jean-Louis Dessalles","authorsParsed":[["Dessalles","Jean-Louis",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2024 14:32:02 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-20","timestamp":1723127522000,"abstract":"  Heroes are people who perform costly altruistic acts. Few people turn out to\nbe heroes, but most people spontaneously honor heroes overtly by commenting,\napplauding, or enthusiastically celebrating their deeds. This behavior seems\nodd from an individual fitness optimization perspective. The best strategy\nshould be to rely on others to invest time and effort in celebrations. To\nexplain the universal propensity to pay tribute, we propose that public\nadmiration is a way for admirers to signal that they are committed to the same\nvalues as the hero. We show that the emergence of heroic acts is an expected\nside-effect of this propensity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
