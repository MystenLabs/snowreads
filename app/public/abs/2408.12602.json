Like other optical\nstructured neural networks, fiber neural networks which utilize the mechanism\nof light transmission to compute can take great advantages in both computing\nefficiency and power cost. Though the potential ability of optical fiber was\ndemonstrated via the establishing of fiber neural networks, it will be of great\nsignificance of combining both fiber transmission and computing functions so as\nto cater the needs of future beyond 5G intelligent communication signal\nprocessing. Thus, in this letter, the fiber neural networks and their related\noptical signal processing methods will be both developed. In this way,\ninformation derived from the transmitted signals can be directly processed in\nthe optical domain rather than being converted to the electronic domain. As a\nresult, both prominent gains in processing efficiency and power cost can be\nfurther obtained. The fidelity of the whole structure and related methods is\ndemonstrated by the task of modulation format recognition which plays important\nrole in fiber optical communications without losing the generality.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
