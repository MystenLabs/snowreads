To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean\nManifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small\ndiffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM\ndirectly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold,\neliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our\nmethodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications\nwith reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale\nArgoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering\na viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory\nprediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.
