We first prove the existence and uniqueness\nof high regularity local solutions to this equation using the Faedo-Galerkin\nmethod. Then we construct a numerical method for the problem and prove that it\nconverges to a global weak solution of the PDE. Numerical simulations of the\nproblem are also included.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
