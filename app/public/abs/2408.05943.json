Regarding this issue, the idea of\nclosed-loop designed open-loop control has been mentioned in literature, which\nmeans to design the closed-loop dynamics theoretically, simulate the\nclosed-loop system, generate control pulses based on simulation and apply them\nto the real plant in an open-loop fashion. Based on bilinear quantum control\nmodel, we analyze in this article the error, i.e., difference between the\ntheoretical and real systems' time-evolved states, incurred by the procedures\nof closed-loop designed open-loop control. It is proved that the error at an\narbitrary time converges to a unitary transformation of initialization error as\nthe number of simulation grids between 0 and that time tends to infinity.\nMoreover, it is found that once the simulation accuracy reaches a certain\nlevel, adopting more accurate (thus possibly more expensive) numerical\nsimulation methods does not efficiently improve convergence. We also present an\nupper bound on the error norm and an example to illustrate our results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
