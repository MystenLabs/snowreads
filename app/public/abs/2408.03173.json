We propose here a generalization of the Landau-Zener (LZ)\nproblem characterized by distinct paths of the instantaneous eigenstates as the\nsystem evolves in time, while keeping the instantaneous eigenenergies exactly\nas in the standard LZ model. We show that these paths play an essential role in\nthe transition probability $P$ between the two states, and can lead to\nsuperadiabatic transitions, i.e., to a substantial reduction of $P$. As an\ninstructive extreme case, we identify an unconditionally adiabatic regime with\n$P=0$ no matter how fast the system evolves in time and regardless of the\nenergy gap between the two levels at the anticrossing point. On the other hand,\nlarge $P$ occur even in the absence of any anticrossing point. These phenomena\ncan be explained by observing the rotation of the instantaneous eigenvectors on\nthe Bloch sphere. The superadiabatic LZ model can describe valley transition\ndynamics during charge and spin shuttling in semiconductor quantum dots.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
