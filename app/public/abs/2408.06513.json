Unfortunately, classical\nscatterplots suffer from scalability issues, since growing data sizes\neventually lead to overplotting and visual clutter on a screen with a fixed\nresolution, which hinders the data analysis process. We propose an algorithm\nthat compensates for irregular sample distributions by a smooth transformation\nof the scatterplot's visual domain. Our algorithm evaluates the scatterplot's\ndensity distribution to compute a regularization mapping based on integral\nimages of the rasterized density function. The mapping preserves the samples'\nneighborhood relations. Few regularization iterations suffice to achieve a\nnearly uniform sample distribution that efficiently uses the available screen\nspace. We further propose approaches to visually convey the transformation that\nwas applied to the scatterplot and compare them in a user study. We present a\nnovel parallel algorithm for fast GPU-based integral-image computation, which\nallows for integrating our de-cluttering approach into interactive visual data\nanalysis systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
