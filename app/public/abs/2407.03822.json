Luca proved for any fixed rational number $\\alpha>0$ that the Diophantine\nequations of the form $\\alpha\\,m!=f(n!)$, where $f$ is either the Euler\nfunction or the divisor sum function or the function counting the number of\ndivisors, have only finitely many integer solutions $(m,n)$. In this paper we\ngeneralize the mentioned result and show that Diophantine equations of the form\n$\\alpha\\,m_1!\\cdots m_r!=f(n!)$ have finitely many integer solutions, too. In\naddition, we do so by including the case $f$ is the sum of\n$k$\\textsuperscript{th} powers of divisors function. Moreover, we observe that\nthe same holds by replacing some of the factorials with certain examples of\nBhargava factorials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
