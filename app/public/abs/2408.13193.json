Multivariate functional approximation\n(MFA) has recently emerged as a new continuous meshless representation that\napproximates raw discrete data with a set of piecewise smooth functions. An MFA\nmodel of data thus offers a compact representation and supports high-order\nevaluation of values and derivatives anywhere in the domain. In this paper, we\npresent CPE-MFA, the first critical point extraction framework designed for MFA\nmodels of large-scale, high-dimensional data. CPE-MFA extracts critical points\ndirectly from an MFA model without the need for discretization or resampling.\nThis is the first step toward enabling continuous implicit models such as MFA\nto support topological data analysis at scale.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
