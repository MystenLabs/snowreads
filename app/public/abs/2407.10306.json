We consider cooperative\nmulti-agent systems satisfying either of such conditions. For first-order\nsystems, we prove that consensus is attained. For second-order systems,\nflocking is attained under a standard condition of nonintegrability of the\ninteraction function. In both cases and under both conditions, the original\ngoal is reached under no additional hypotheses on the system with respect to\nthe case of no communication failures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"85V9GLlnuy6ZSBU9LXffZ01jnIGVzH5WddeoTcyFfSQ","pdfSize":"236996","objectId":"0x664a62e33a5494e2ca53a9ddf0062eb423c5eb465f7ce543fa1c36bdb4e26bed","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
