Our model reproduces the quantum mechanical predictions under the\nassumption of relaxed measurement independence, demonstrating that the\nstatistical independence of measurement settings does not necessarily preclude\nunderlying correlations. Our findings highlight the nuanced relationship\nbetween local determinism and quantum mechanics, offering new insights into the\nnature of quantum correlations and hidden variables.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
