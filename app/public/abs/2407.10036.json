Families of\nbound states, pinned to the double HS, are found in the system's parameter\nspace. They feature the effect of the symmetry breaking (SB) between peaks\npinned to individual HSs, provided that the phase shift takes values $0<\\chi\n<\\pi $, and the LL equation includes the loss term. The SB, which is explained\nanalytically, takes place in the full LL model and its linearized version\nalike. The same phenomenology is also explored in the framework of the LL\nequation with the double HS and quintic self-focusing. In that case, there are\nstable symmetric and asymmetric bound states, in spite of the presence of the\nbackground instability driven by the critical collapse.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
