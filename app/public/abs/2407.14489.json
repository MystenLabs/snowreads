The CME-sensitive\nobservable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\\Delta\\gamma$,\nis contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's\nelliptic anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in\ndynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events\nin statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by\nprojecting $\\Delta\\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic\nstudy of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model\nsimulations. It is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more\nstatistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the\nintercept. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the\ndetails of the event content, such as the mixtures of background contributing\nsources, and thus is not a clean measure of the CME.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
