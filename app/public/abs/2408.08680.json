The compound exhibits long-range antiferromagnetic order\nbelow TN = 14 K. Magnetization data indicated a slight anisotropy along with a\nspin-flop transition at 10 kOe , a saturation field of 310 kOe and an ordered\nmoment of 2.17 Mu_B at T = 1.6 K. Heat capacity measurements indicate an\neffective j = 1/2 ground state configuration, resulting from the combined\neffects of the crystal electric field and spin-orbit interaction. Surface\nphotovoltage analysis reveals two optical gaps in the UV-Visible region,\nsuggesting potential applications in photocatalysis and photovoltaics. The\nmagnetic and optical properties highlight the significant role of orbital\ncontributions within BCWO, indicating various other potential applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7ysrXjaWfLiDbQy9jmc7Nrc0VNm7oVmhh_JLeNGd_7s","pdfSize":"1628512"}
