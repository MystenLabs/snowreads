More precisely, we present six new classes of permutation\npolynomials over $\\F_{q^3}$ of the aforementioned form: one class over finite\nfields of even characteristic, three classes over finite fields of odd\ncharacteristic, and the remaining two over finite fields of arbitrary\ncharacteristic. Furthermore, we show that these classes of permutation\npolynomials are inequivalent to the known ones of the same form. We also\nprovide the explicit expressions for the compositional inverses of each of\nthese classes of permutation polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uPUfe-W5blZCOCmyL3QPCuMBq0JcgQ5F_s3xeS2Y_Fg","pdfSize":"270430"}
