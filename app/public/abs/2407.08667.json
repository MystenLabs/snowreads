However, there exist intriguing hybrid theories\nthat are topological in some directions and holomorphic in others, such as\ntwists of supersymmetric field theories or Costello's 4-dimensional\nChern-Simons theory. In this paper, we rigorously prove the ultraviolet (UV)\nfiniteness for such hybrid theories on flat space, and present two significant\nvanishing results regarding anomalies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
