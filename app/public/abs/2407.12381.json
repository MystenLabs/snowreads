In this paper, we propose a unified approach\nthat combines an optimization-based multi-contact whole-body controller with\nFlow Matching, a recently introduced method capable of generating multi-modal\ntrajectory distributions for imitation learning. In simulation, we show that\nFlow Matching is more appropriate for robotics than Diffusion and traditional\nbehavior cloning. On a real full-size humanoid robot (Talos), we demonstrate\nthat our approach can learn a whole-body non-prehensile box-pushing task and\nthat the robot can close dishwasher drawers by adding contacts with its free\nhand when needed for balance. We also introduce a shared autonomy mode for\nassisted teleoperation, providing automatic contact placement for tasks not\ncovered in the demonstrations.
