We show that the geometry of the\nnodes plays an important role in the scaling of the eigenvalues of these kernel\nmatrices. For the multivariate Dirichlet kernel matrix, we establish a\ncriterion for the sampling set ensuring precise scaling of eigenvalues.\nAdditionally, we identify specific sampling sets that satisfy this criterion.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of these results for the problem of\nsuper-resolution, i.e. stable recovery of sparse measures from bandlimited\nFourier measurements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
