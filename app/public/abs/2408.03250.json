The\nfundamental mode ($s$ orbital) is near resonance with the neighboring\nhigher-order $p$ orbital, causing efficient light transfer at low power. Due to\nKerr nonlinearity, the coupler works as an all-optical switch between $s$ and\n$p$ orbitals. Single- and double-peak spatial solitons of $s$-$p$ orbitals form\nin the lattice due to the bipartite nature of the on-site nonlinearity. We\nprobe highly localized bulk and edge solitons, peaked at the $s$ and $p$\norbitals, spectrally residing in the photonic band gap. Our work will be\nimportant for exploring inter-orbital couplings and nonlinear interactions in\nintricate photonic devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
