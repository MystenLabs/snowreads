We examine the ground state energetic properties of a scalar\nfield confined on a $D$-dimensional sphere, and subjected to these two effects.\nWe focus on $D=2$ and $D=3$, with a non-minimal coupling of a massless scalar\nfield to curvature, which provides a radius-dependent effective mass. This\nscenario allows tunnelling to be more important than the Casimir effect, in a\ncertain regime of parameters, and potential implications in Early Cosmology are\ndiscussed for the case $D=3$, which could avoid a cosmological singularity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
