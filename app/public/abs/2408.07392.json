However,\npreviously this setting has not been applicable to initial-boundary value\nproblems. The aim of this short note is therefore to demonstrate that this\ngeneral framework can be applied to such problems as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9j0cYadSyaim7VlYXhQ-SsfgxgTguhDH154mDtGyDIc","pdfSize":"127886"}
