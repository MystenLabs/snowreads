The velocity field of H$\\alpha$ shows an anomalous\ndistribution in the North-Western (NW) disk. The H$\\alpha$ spectrum is\nwell-fitted by two Gaussian components, and the weak Gaussian component is\ndominated by the anomalous H$\\alpha$ in the NW disk. The Gaussian fit center of\nH$\\alpha$ emission is offset by +24.2 km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic velocity\nobtained from the HI emission. We derive the gas-phase metallicity,\n12+log(O/H), using [{\\ion{N}{II}}]$\\lambda$6583/H$\\alpha$ ratio as a proxy. The\nmean value of 12+log(O/H) is 8.30 $\\pm$ 0.19 over the whole galaxy. The\nmetallicity in the outer disk is lower than the detection limit of 7.72,\nindicating the metallicity gradient exists in AGC 102004. We speculate a\nminor/mini-merger event could have happened to the NW disk. CO(2-1) emission\nhas non-detection in AGC 102004, reaching a noise level of 0.33 mK smoothed to\n30 km s$^{-1}$.
