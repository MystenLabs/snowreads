This\ntutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to the Berry phase, beginning\nwith the essential mathematical framework required to grasp its significance.\nWe explore the intrinsic link between the emergence of a non-trivial Berry\nphase and the presence of topological characteristics in quantum systems,\nshowing the connection between the Berry phase and the band structure as well\nas the phase's gauge-invariant nature during cyclic evolutions. The tutorial\ndelves into various topological effects arising from the Berry phase, such as\nthe quantum, anomalous, and spin Hall effects, which exemplify how these\nquantum phases manifest in observable phenomena. We then extend our discussion\nto cover the transport properties of topological insulators, elucidating their\nunique behaviour rooted in Berry phase physics. This tutorial aims at equipping\nits readers with a robust understanding of the basic theory around the Berry\nphase and its pivotal role in the realm of topological quantum phenomena.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V-6tJCSzQdb1iMwQQ6ghqY7-LVTcMT9RpDx_f004JN4","pdfSize":"2049090"}
