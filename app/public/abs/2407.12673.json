It has been\nproven by Y. Liokumovich, A. Nabutovsky and R. Rotman that the shortest three\nsuch curves have lengths bounded in terms of the diameter $d$ of $M$. We show\nthat at any point $p$ on $M$ there exist at least two distinct simple geodesic\nloops (geodesic segments that start and end at $p$) whose lengths are\nrespectively bounded by $8d$ and $14d$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
