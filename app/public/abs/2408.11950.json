In this context, the hash value serves as\na crucial element in linking blocks within the blockchain, ensuring the\nintegrity of block contents. Therefore, hash algorithms represent a vital\nsecurity technology for ensuring the integrity and security of blockchain\nsystems. This study primarily focuses on analyzing the security and execution\nefficiency of mainstream hash algorithms in the Proof of Work (PoW)\ncalculations within blockchain systems. It proposes an evaluation factor and\nconducts comparative experiments to evaluate each hash algorithm. The\nexperimental results indicate that there are no significant differences in the\nsecurity aspects among SHA-2, SHA-3, and BLAKE2. However, SHA-2 and BLAKE2\ndemonstrate shorter computation times, indicating higher efficiency in\nexecution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
