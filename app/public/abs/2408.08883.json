Simultaneous\nmulti-slice imaging (SMS), as a method for accelerating MR acquisition, can\nsignificantly reduce scanning time, but further optimization of reconstruction\nresults is still possible. In order to optimize the reconstruction of SMS, we\nproposed a method to use diffusion model based on slice-GRAPPA and SPIRiT\nmethod. approach: Specifically, our method characterizes the prior distribution\nof SMS data by score matching and characterizes the k-space redundant prior\nbetween coils and slices based on self-consistency. With the utilization of\ndiffusion model, we achieved better reconstruction results.The application of\ndiffusion model can further reduce the scanning time of MRI without\ncompromising image quality, making it more advantageous for clinical\napplication\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
