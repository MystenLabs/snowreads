This extends\nthe results of Cao et al. (2020) to both the Sobolev-Fock spaces and the\nPolyanalytic Sobolev-Fock spaces. We use results on symbol classes of\npseudo-differential operators to give sufficient conditions for boundedness of\n$S_{\\phi}$ on all polyanalytic Sobolev-Fock spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
