We focus on two objectives-utilitarian\nwelfare (Util) and egalitarian welfare (Egal)-and consider the computational\ncomplexity of the associated maximization problems, as well as their\ncompatibility with strategyproofness and proportionality. We observe that\nmaximizing Util is easy, but the corresponding decision problem for Egal is\nNP-complete even in restricted cases. We complement this hardness result for\nEgal with parameterized complexity analysis and an approximation algorithm.\nAdditionally, we show that, while a mechanism that outputs a Util outcome is\nstrategyproof, all deterministic mechanisms for computing Egal outcomes fail a\nvery weak variant of strategyproofness, called non-obvious manipulability\n(NOM). However, we show that when agents have non-empty approval sets at each\ntimestep, choosing an Egal-maximizing outcome while breaking ties\nlexicographically satisfies NOM. Regarding proportionality, we prove that a\nproportional (PROP) outcome can be computed efficiently, but finding an outcome\nthat maximizes Util while guaranteeing PROP is NP-hard. We also derive upper\nand lower bounds on the price of proportionality with respect to Util and Egal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
