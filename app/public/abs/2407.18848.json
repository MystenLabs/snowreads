Traditional debugging techniques\nrepair ontology networks by removing unwanted axioms and mappings, but may\nthereby remove consequences that are correct in the domain of the ontology\nnetwork. In this paper we propose a framework for repairing ontology networks\nthat deals with this issue. It defines basic operations such as debugging,\nweakening and completing. Further, it defines combination operators that\nreflect choices in how and when to use the basic operators, as well as choices\nregarding the autonomy level of the ontologies and alignments in the ontology\nnetwork. We show the influence of the combination operators on the quality of\nthe repaired network and present an implemented tool. By using our framework\ntogether with existing algorithms for debugging, weakening and completing, we\nessentially provide a blueprint for extending previous work and systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
