Using an automorphy lifting theorem, we show that if the\nautomorphic side comes from a twist of Steinberg at $v | l$, then the Galois\nside has nontrivial monodromy at $v$. Based on this observation, we will give a\ndefinition of the Fontaine-Mazur $\\mathcal{L}$-invariants attached to certain\nautomorphic representations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
