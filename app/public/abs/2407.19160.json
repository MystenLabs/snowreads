We show\nthat graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction\nrules and the structure of the heterogeneity from data alone. The learned\nlatent structure and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex\nsystem which is necessary to parameterize and infer the underlying governing\nequations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of moving\nparticles and vector fields that interact with each other. While our current\naim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we\nanticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing\nrules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
