By\napplying the A priori algorithm to the modus operandi of Advanced Persistent\nThreats, extracted from an extensive corpus of over 17,000 articles spanning\n2007 to 2020, we highlight the enduring patterns leveraged by sophisticated\ncyber criminals. Our findings verify the existence of unique signatures\nassociated with advanced cybercriminals, bridging a crucial gap in current\nunderstanding of human behavior in cyber-attacks. This pivotal research sets\nthe foundation for an entirely new academic intersection in cybersecurity and\ncomputational criminology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
