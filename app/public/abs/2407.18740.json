Our approach uses recent work of\nthe author with Yamagishi, allowing us to bypass the combinatorial arguments\nand the use of recollement from the original paper with Gammelgaard, Gyenge and\nSzendroi.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
