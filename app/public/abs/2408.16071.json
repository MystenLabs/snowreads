We explore an unprecedented range of shock speeds\n$v_{\\rm sh}\\approx 0.067-0.267\\,c$, Alfv\\'{e}n Mach numbers $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm\nA} = 5-40$, sonic Mach numbers $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm s} = 5-160$, as well as the\nproton-to-electron mass ratios $m_{\\rm i}/m_{\\rm e}=16-1836$. We find that high\nAlfv\\'{e}n Mach number shocks can channel a large fraction of their kinetic\nenergy into nonthermal particles, self-sustaining magnetic turbulence and\nacceleration to larger and larger energies. The fraction of injected particles\nis $\\lesssim 0.5\\%$ for electrons and $\\approx 1\\%$ for protons, and the\ncorresponding energy efficiencies are $\\lesssim 2\\%$ and $\\approx 10\\%$,\nrespectively. The extent of the nonthermal tail is sensitive to the Alfv\\'{e}n\nMach number; when $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm A}\\lesssim 10$, the nonthermal electron\ndistribution exhibits minimal growth beyond the average momentum of the\ndownstream thermal protons, independently of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.\nAcceleration is slow for shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, yet nonthermal\nelectrons still achieve momenta exceeding the downstream thermal proton\nmomentum when the shock Alfv\\'{e}n Mach number is large enough. We provide\nsimulation-based parametrizations of the transition from thermal to nonthermal\ndistribution in the downstream (found at a momentum around $p_{\\rm i,e}/m_{\\rm\ni}v_{\\rm sh} \\approx 3\\sqrt{m_{\\rm i,e}/m_{\\rm i}}$), as well as the ratio of\nnonthermal electron to proton number density. The results are applicable to\nmany different environments and are important for modeling shock-powered\nnonthermal radiation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
