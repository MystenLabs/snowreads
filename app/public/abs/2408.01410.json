A scalar field, non-minimally coupled to the metric, provides an\nextra degree of freedom compared to General Relativity. We analyze the impact\nof such a scalar field on the cosmic expansion, leading to an effective Hubble\nconstant $H_{0}^{\\text{eff}}(z)$, dependent on redshift $z$. We show that our\n$f(R)$ model might mimic dark energy and provide an apparent variation of the\nHubble constant. Our results align with recent cosmological data analysis in\nredshift bins, indicating a decreasing trend of the Hubble constant. The\nredshift dependence of $H_{0}^{\\text{eff}}(z)$ might potentially reconcile\nmeasurements of the Hubble constant from probes at different redshifts.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BBd8Bu_H_9QWkCf-A2-LButFbGdtMmLViJvCsjwxVI8","pdfSize":"140333","txDigest":"HzK6x5LNakhetQiTd6uH9BUcMVShJdRYdkatSLiX9AU5","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
