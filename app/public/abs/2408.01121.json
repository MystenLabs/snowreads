Nevertheless, adopting AI in critical infrastructures presents\nchallenges due to unclear regulations and lacking risk quantification\ntechniques. Regulated and accountable approaches for integrating AI-based\nservices into the smart grid could accelerate the adoption of innovative\nmethods in daily practices and address society's general safety concerns. This\npaper contributes to this objective by defining accountability and highlighting\nits importance for AI-based services in the energy sector. It underlines the\ncurrent shortcomings of the AI Act and proposes an approach to address these\nissues in a potential delegated act. The proposed technical approach for\ndeveloping and operating accountable AI-based smart grid services allows for\nassessing different service life cycle phases and identifying related\naccountability risks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
