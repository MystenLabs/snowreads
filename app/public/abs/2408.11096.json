Krylov complexity\ncharacterizes chaos by quantifying the spread of a state or operator under a\nknown Hamiltonian. In contrast, quantum field theory often relies on\nS-matrices, where the Hamiltonian density becomes non-trivially time-dependent\nrendering the computations of complexity in Krylov basis exponentially hard. We\ndefine Krylov spread complexity for scattering amplitudes by analyzing the\ndistribution of extrema, treating these as eigenvalues of a fictional\nHamiltonian that evolves a thermo-field double state non-trivially. Our\nanalysis of black hole scattering, through highly excited string states\nscattering into two or three tachyons, reveals that the Krylov complexity of\nthese amplitudes mirrors the behavior of chaotic Hamiltonian evolution, with a\npre-saturation peak indicating chaos. This formalism bridges the concepts of\nchaos in scattering and state evolution, offering a framework to distinguish\ndifferent scattering processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
