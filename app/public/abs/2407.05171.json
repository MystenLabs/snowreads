We find this DTC to be robust\nagainst changes in detuning and anharmonicity of the field mode. Additionally,\nwe study the system in the semiclassical limit, where mean-field approximations\nare valid, and demonstrate the utility of a suitable semiclassical Hamiltonian\nfor this purpose. Intriguingly, we observe that the system exhibits a transient\nDTC even with only two qubits. We examine the dynamics of bipartite\nentanglement between the qubits and the field. Our findings show that the\nentanglement saturates to a steady value early in the dynamics, following a\nsudden peak. We find a strong positive correlation between this long-term\nentanglement value and the lifetime of the transient DTC, in a wide range of\nthe parameter regime where the field is due to a lossy photon or a lossy\ntransmon mode, with small detuning.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
