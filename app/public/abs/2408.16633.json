This study focuses on automated picking\nsystems in warehouses, utilizing deep learning and reinforcement learning\ntechnologies to enhance picking efficiency and accuracy while reducing system\nfailure rates. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthese technologies in improving robot picking performance and adaptability to\ncomplex environments. The results show that the integrated machine learning\nmodel significantly outperforms traditional methods, effectively addressing the\nchallenges of peak order processing, reducing operational errors, and improving\noverall logistics efficiency. Additionally, by analyzing environmental factors,\nthis study further optimizes system design to ensure efficient and stable\noperation under variable conditions. This research not only provides innovative\nsolutions for logistics automation but also offers a theoretical and empirical\nfoundation for future technological development and application.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
