A custom CNN model is developed, featuring a straightforward\narchitecture with 4 convolutional layers and 4 fully connected layers. Despite\nthe absence of data augmentation, the model achieves a 72\\% accuracy in\nclassifying cardiomegaly severity. The study contributes to automated\nassessment of cardiac conditions in dogs, highlighting the potential for early\ndetection and intervention in veterinary care.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
