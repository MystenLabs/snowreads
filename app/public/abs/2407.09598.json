This has detrimental consequences\nsince it empties the spectrum from all particle states. Being an artifact of\nthe linearized approximation on top of Minkowski background, the symmetry does\nnot persist at higher orders and degrees of freedom are reintroduced via\ninteractions, making $R^2$ gravity infinitely strongly-coupled.\n  Provided that the theory is considered on appropriate backgrounds -- for\ninstance de Sitter spacetime -- or is supplemented with the Einstein-Hilbert\nterm, $R^2$ gravity propagates the two usual graviton polarizations plus one\nadditional (massless or massive) scalar field. We explicitly demonstrate that\nin a fully covariant manner.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
