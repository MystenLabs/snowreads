Inspired by this result and the importance\nof lifts in the setting of integer programming, we show that a similar result\nholds for the discrete analog of convex polyhedral cones-affine semigroups. We\ndefine the notions of the integer slack matrix and a lift of an affine\nsemigroup. We show that many of the characterizations of the slack matrix in\nthe convex cone setting have analogous results in the affine semigroup setting.\nWe also show how slack matrices of affine semigroups can be used to obtain new\nresults in the study of nonnegative integer rank of nonnegative integer\nmatrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6T9PJ0FibH7yDS63m-GDB8_e0XFer9ouksQ2QcTdkxc","pdfSize":"691190"}
