This regularizer is intended to promote solutions\nconforming to some notion of simplicity or low complexity. We investigate both\nnoiseless recovery and stability to noise and provide a very general and\nunified analysis framework that goes far beyond the sparse phase retrieval\nmostly considered in the literature. In the noiseless case we provide\nsufficient conditions under which exact recovery, up to global sign change, is\npossible. For Gaussian measurement maps, we also provide a sample complexity\nbound for exact recovery. This bound depends on the Gaussian width of the\ndescent cone at the soughtafter vector which is a geometric measure of the\ncomplexity of the latter. In the noisy case, we consider both the constrained\n(Mozorov) and penalized (Tikhonov) formulations. We provide sufficient\nconditions for stable recovery and prove linear convergence for sufficiently\nsmall noise. For Gaussian measurements, we again give a sample complexity bound\nfor linear convergence to hold with high probability. This bound scales\nlinearly in the intrinsic dimension of the sought-after vector but only\nlogarithmically in the ambient dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
