Quadratic functionals of the density\ncovered are the $\\mathbb{L}^2$-norm of the density and its derivatives or the\nsurvival function. We construct a fully data-driven estimator when the error\ndensity is known. The plug-in estimator is based on a density estimation\ncombining the estimation of the Mellin transform of the $Y$ density and a\nspectral cut-off regularized inversion of the Mellin transform of the error\ndensity. The main issue is the data-driven choice of the cut-off parameter\nusing a Goldenshluger-Lepski-method. We discuss conditions under which the\nfully data-driven estimator attains oracle-rates up to logarithmic\ndeteriorations. We compute convergence rates under classical smoothness\nassumptions and illustrate them by a simulation study.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
