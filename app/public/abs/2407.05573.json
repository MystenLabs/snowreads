Traditional\nmethods based on generative adversarial networks(GAN) or joint learning\nframeworks can achieve good prediction accuracy under low observation ratios,\nbut they usually have high computational costs. In view of this, this paper\nproposes a spatio-temporal encoding and decoding-based method for future human\nactivity skeleton synthesis. Firstly, algorithms such as time control, discrete\ncosine transform, and low-pass filtering are used to cut or pad the skeleton\nsequences. Secondly, the encoder and decoder are responsible for extracting\nintermediate semantic encoding from observed skeleton sequences and inferring\nfuture sequences from the intermediate semantic encoding, respectively.\nFinally, joint displacement error, velocity error, and acceleration error,\nthree higher-order kinematic features, are used as key components of the loss\nfunction to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that the\nproposed future skeleton synthesis algorithm performs better than some existing\nalgorithms. It generates skeleton sequences with smaller errors and fewer model\nparameters, effectively providing future information for early activity\nprediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
