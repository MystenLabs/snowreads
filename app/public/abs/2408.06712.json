The ultimate\ngoal, achieved in Part III, is to correct $g_\\epsilon$ to a true solution on\nany fixed precompact subset of $M$ by addition of a size\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^\\infty)$ metric perturbation which needs to satisfy a\nquasilinear wave equation (the Einstein vacuum equations in a suitable gauge).\n  The present paper lays the necessary analytical foundations. We develop a\nframework for proving estimates for solutions of (tensorial) wave equations on\n$(M_\\epsilon,g_\\epsilon)$ which, on a suitable scale of Sobolev spaces, are\nuniform on $\\epsilon$-independent precompact subsets of the original spacetime\n$M$. These estimates are proved by combining two ingredients: the spectral\ntheory for the corresponding wave equation on Kerr; and uniform microlocal\nestimates governing the propagation of regularity through the small black hole,\nincluding radial point estimates reminiscent of diffraction by conic\nsingularities and long-time estimates near perturbations of normally hyperbolic\ntrapped sets.\n  As an illustration of this framework, we construct solutions of a toy\nnonlinear scalar wave equation on $(M_\\epsilon,g_\\epsilon)$ for uniform\ntimescales and with full control in all asymptotic regimes as $\\epsilon\\to 0$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
