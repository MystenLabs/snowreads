While the theory has been developed primarily for specific\napplications in free probability, it also possesses an elegant, purely\ncombinatorial core that is of independent interest. The present article aims at\noffering a simple account of various aspects of higher-order Kreweras\ncomplementation on the basis of elementary arithmetic, (co)algebraic,\ncategorical and simplicial properties of noncrossing partitions. The main idea\nis to see noncrossing partitions as providing an interesting noncommutative\nanalogue of the interplay between the divisibility poset and the multiplicative\nmonoid of positive integers. Just as the divisibility poset can be regarded as\nthe decalage of the multiplicative monoid, we exhibit the lattice of\nnoncrossing partitions as the decalage of a partial monoid structure on\nnoncrossing partitions encoding higher-order Kreweras complements. While our\nresults may be considered known, some of the viewpoints can be regarded as\nnovel, providing an efficient approach both conceptually and computationally.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
