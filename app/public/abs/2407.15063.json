The design of corresponding haptic parameters for real-world\ntactile textures is a complex task. Furthermore, users often face difficulties\nin simultaneously controlling multi-dimensional haptic parameters to achieve\nthe desired vibration feedback. To address these challenges, the SLS\noptimization method facilitates user control of these multi-dimensional\nparameters through a simple one-dimensional slider. Concurrently, our system\nemploys the \"Growing Grass\" metaphor to visualize haptic parameter adjustments\nin real-time. This approach combining visual and haptic sensations can bring\nricher experiences and generate a realistic sensation of touching a grassy\nsurface. Our objective is to enhance users' intuitive comprehension of haptic\nparameters through this innovative system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
