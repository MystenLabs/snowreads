We explore a constructive\napproach to each phenomenon that involves orthogonal polynomials on the unit\ncircle. In the case of mutually unbiased bases, we show that this approach does\nnot produce such bases. In the case of balanced states, we provide examples of\npairs of orthonormal bases and states that are balanced with respect to them.\nWe also consider extensions of these ideas to the infinite dimensional setting.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
