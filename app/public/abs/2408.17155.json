In the $L^2$-supercritical\nregime $2+\\frac{8}{N}<p<2^*$, we establish the existence of mountain pass-type\nnormalized solutions. Our approach relies on utilizing a parameterized version\nof the minimax theorem with Morse index information for constraint functionals,\nand developing a blow-up analysis for the nonlinear Kirchhoff equations.\nFurthermore, we explore the asymptotic behavior of these solutions as\n$b\\rightarrow0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
