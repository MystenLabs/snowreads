However, this natural\nchoice is by no means mandatory and different choices, like, for example, the\nLagrange basis, are possible and might offer additional features. In this\narticle, we discuss different alternatives together with their canonical duals.\nWe study a localized version of the Lagrange basis, localized orthogonal bases,\nsuch as the Newton basis, and multiresolution versions thereof, constructed by\nmeans of samplets. We argue that the choice of orthogonal bases is particularly\nuseful as they lead to symmetric preconditioners. All bases under consideration\nare compared numerically to illustrate their feasibility for scattered data\napproximation. We provide benchmark experiments in two spatial dimensions and\nconsider the reconstruction of an implicit surface as a relevant application\nfrom computer graphics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
