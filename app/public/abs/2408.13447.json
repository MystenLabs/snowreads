To analyze this technology, we\nderive the outage probability based on the block-diagonal matrix approximation\n(BDMA) model. With this, we obtain the upper bound, lower bound, and asymptotic\napproximation of the outage probability to gain more insights. Moreover, we\ndesign the phase shift matrix of the RIS in order to minimize the system outage\nprobability. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of our approximations and\nthat the proposed schemes outperform benchmarks significantly.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KMbQbMPLTRSB_80cNK7MYt1OQzL8LWIZuHATwQoaEdI","pdfSize":"186236"}
