With controversial cases\ndisregarded, so far 27 of those systems have been identified. Our analysis,\nbased on an exploratory approach, shows that those systems are on average\nnotably younger than stars situated in the solar neighborhood. Though the\nstatistical significance of this result is not fully established, the most\nplausible explanation is a possible double selection effect due to the\nrelatively high mass of planet-hosting stars of those systems (which spend less\ntime on the main-sequence than low-mass stars) and that planets in triple\nstellar systems may be long-term orbitally unstable. The stellar metallicities\nare on average solar-like; however, owing to the limited number of data, this\nresult is not inconsistent with the previous finding that stars with planets\ntend to be metal-rich as the deduced metallicity distribution is relatively\nbroad.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
