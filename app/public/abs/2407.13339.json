We show that $\\overline{\\text{K}}$\nhas the exponential-sized model property, and hence its satisfiability problem\nis NExpTime-complete. Additionally, we get new complexity results on related\nfragments studied in the literature, and propose a new decidable extension of\nthe uniform one-dimensional fragment (without equality). Our approach involves\na use of satisfiability games tailored to $\\overline{\\text{K}}$ and a novel\napplication of paradoxical tournament graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
