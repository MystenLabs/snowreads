We have recently extended the so-called hat map to\ndifference ascent sequences, and self-modified difference ascent sequences are\nthe fixed points under this map. We characterize self-modified difference\nascent sequences and enumerate them in terms of certain generalized Fibonacci\npolynomials. Furthermore, we describe the corresponding subset of $d$-Fishburn\npermutations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
