While laboratory detection\nof such bosons is challenging, their existence in nature can be imprinted on\nmeasurable properties of astrophysical black holes (BHs). The phenomenon of\nsuperradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of\nscalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the\nmass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH\nspin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum\nfitting and iron K$\\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on\na dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch\nbetween the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional\nextended mass around the BH. We find that a precision of $\\sim 1\\%$ on the two\nspin measurements is required to exclude the null hypothesis of no dark mass\naround the BH at a 2$\\sigma$ confidence level for dark masses about a few\npercent of the BH mass, as motivated in some superradiance scenarios.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JWI-4P3uwnFvqTr4i334rMjsX8ujTM7IXcepRxSxNMM","pdfSize":"1215430"}
