We here propose an alternative encoding\nand alternative quantum algorithm to solve the SVP: the one-hot encoding and\nthe quantum imaginary-time algorithm with the folded spectrum (FS) method. We\ndemonstrate that our approach is applicable to find the shortest vector with a\nvariational quantum algorithm. The application of the FS method to the quantum\nannealing and simulated annealing is also discussed to solve the SVP. Our study\nshows wide potential applicability of the SVP in quantum computing frameworks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
