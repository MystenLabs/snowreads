More robust than\nexisting works in the literature, our result only requires the Markov chain to\nsatisfy an iterated Poincar\\'e inequality. Moreover, our method can be readily\ngeneralized to continuous-time Markov processes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
