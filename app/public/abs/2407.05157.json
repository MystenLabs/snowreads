With growing\nnumbers of storage units, identifying these dynamics can be cumbersome. This\npaper employs recent data-driven control approaches that do not require an\nexplicit identification step. Instead, they use measured input/output data in\ncontrol formulations. In detail, we propose an economic data-driven model\npredictive control (MPC) scheme to operate a small power system with\ninput-nonlinear battery dynamics. First, a linear data-driven MPC approach that\nuses a slack variable to account for plant-model-mismatch is proposed. In a\nsecond step, an input-nonlinear data-driven MPC scheme is deduced. Comparisons\nwith a reference indicate that the linear data-driven MPC approximates the\nnonlinear plant in an acceptable manner. Even better results, however, can be\nobtained with the input-nonlinear data-driven MPC scheme which provides\nincreased prediction accuracy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RCndHtGWhtH2kYxyC_flwh2oHmPRMANIZrltSbLaQes","pdfSize":"715504"}
