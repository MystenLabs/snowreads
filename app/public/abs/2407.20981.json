Specifically, we introduce Escape Sensing Games\n(ESGs). In ESGs, a blue player manages the order in which targets pass through\na channel, while her opponent tries to capture the targets using a set of\nsensors that need some time to recharge after each activation. We present a\nthorough computational study of ESGs. Among others, we show that it is NP-hard\nto compute best responses and equilibria. Nevertheless, we propose a variety of\neffective (heuristic) algorithms whose quality we demonstrate in extensive\ncomputational experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
