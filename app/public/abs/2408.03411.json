A thin-film\nYBCO superconductor ($\\approx$ 567 nm thick) was subject to a series of proton\nirradiations with a total fluence of $7.6\\times10^{16}$ $\\text{p/cm}^2$. Upon\nirradiation, $T_c$ was drastically decreased from 89.3 K towards zero with a\ncorresponding increase in its normal state resistivity above $T_c$. This\nincrease in resistivity which indicates the increase of defects inside the\nthin-film sample can be converted to the dimensionless scattering rate. We\nfound that the relation between $T_c$ and dimensionless scattering rate\nobtained during proton irradiation approximates the generalized d-wave\nAbrikosov-Gor'kov theory better than the previous results obtained from\nelectron irradiations. This is an unexpected result since the electron\nirradiation is known to be most effective to suppress superconductivity over\nother heavier ion irradiations such as proton irradiation. It suggests that the\ntype of defects created by proton irradiation evolves from cascade defects (in\nbulk single crystals) to point-like defects (in thin-film single crystals) as\nthe thickness decreases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CmMWj7tOE70ZIr1UB_Q3KWk81Ooy11OE8bJgt3TF5m0","pdfSize":"3347262"}
