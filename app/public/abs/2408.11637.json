In the turnstile\nmodel, Jain et al. [NeurIPS2023] initiated the study of this problem\nparameterized by the maximum flippancy of any element, i.e., the number of\ntimes that the count of an element changes from 0 to above 0 or vice versa.\nThey give an item-level $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private algorithm\nwhose additive error is tight with respect to that parameterization. In this\nwork, we show that a very simple algorithm based on the sparse vector technique\nachieves a tight additive error for item-level $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential\nprivacy and item-level $\\epsilon$-differential privacy with regards to a\ndifferent parameterization, namely the sum of all flippancies. Our second\nresult is a bound which shows that for a large class of algorithms, including\nall existing differentially private algorithms for this problem, the lower\nbound from item-level differential privacy extends to event-level differential\nprivacy. This partially answers an open question by Jain et al. [NeurIPS2023].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"70rH43Osl5ZDGGvv_Lmp6L6W_4aolgAHqUShRMAZjqw","pdfSize":"791004"}
