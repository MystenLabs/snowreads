Looking at the sectional curvature bounds of this example leads to\nthe more general statement that normed spaces in which the norm does not come\nfrom an inner product, have no sectional curvature bounds. This statement holds\nin the Riemannian and Lorentzian cases. In addition, the Lorentzian $L^p$ space\ncan be used as an example in the context of Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff\nconvergence, to show that unbounded sectional curvature or geodesic regularity\nis in general not preserved in the GH limit, and as an example of a sequence of\nuniform bounded length spaces which are not GH pre-compact.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
