This $2d$ CFT is composed of a\nLiouville field theory, coupled to a level-one $SO\\left(N\\right)$ Kac-Moody\ncurrent, and a doublet of free fermions residing on $\\mathbf{CP}^{1}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
