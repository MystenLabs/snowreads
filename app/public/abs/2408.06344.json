IFN can be decomposed into\ncanonical cycles to form a string code called network signature. A network\nsignature can be composed back into an IFN by assignment and merging\noperations. Using string manipulations on network signatures, we can derive\ntotal flow, link values, sum of rows and columns, and probability matrices and\ntest for irreducibility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2UE8Ks3REd807B4tM8vDPgwDRFjMxucRxYZrtMatk8o","pdfSize":"186646"}
