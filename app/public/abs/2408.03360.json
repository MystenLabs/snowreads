To achieve this, existing methods use the agent model to extract\ninformation from the target dataset and embed it into the distilled dataset.\nConsequently, the quality of extracted and embedded information determines the\nquality of the distilled dataset. In this work, we find that existing methods\nintroduce misaligned information in both information extraction and embedding\nstages. To alleviate this, we propose Prioritize Alignment in Dataset\nDistillation (PAD), which aligns information from the following two\nperspectives. 1) We prune the target dataset according to the compressing ratio\nto filter the information that can be extracted by the agent model. 2) We use\nonly deep layers of the agent model to perform the distillation to avoid\nexcessively introducing low-level information. This simple strategy effectively\nfilters out misaligned information and brings non-trivial improvement for\nmainstream matching-based distillation algorithms. Furthermore, built on\ntrajectory matching, \\textbf{PAD} achieves remarkable improvements on various\nbenchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PbSpfyh0dR1-ipzb3_Lek1X_ZfuObng1k5YdWy03m_0","pdfSize":"8319093"}
