There is still a\nlarge uncertainty on the critical global warming level at which the AMOC will\nstart to collapse. Here we analyse targeted climate model simulations, together\nwith observations, reanalysis products and a suite of state-of-the-art climate\nmodel results to reassess this critical global warming level. We find a\ncritical threshold of +3C global mean surface temperature increase compared to\npre-industrial with a lower bound of +2.2C (10%-Cl). Such global mean surface\ntemperature anomalies are expected to be reached after 2050. This means that\nthe AMOC is more likely than not (> 50%) to tip within the 21st century under a\nmiddle-of-the-road climate change scenario and very likely (> 90%) to tip under\na high emissions scenario. The AMOC collapse induced cooling is shown to be\noffset by the regional warming over Northwestern Europe during the 21st\ncentury, but will still induce severe impacts on society.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
