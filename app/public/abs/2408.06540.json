Bayesian Optimization is an efficient machine\nlearning approach to finding global optima of beam quality, but the model can\neasily be impaired by faulty data points caused by the beam going off the edge\nof the sensor or by background noise. This study, conducted at the National\nSynchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) facility at Brookhaven National\nLaboratory (BNL), is an investigation of methods to identify untrustworthy\nreadings of beam quality and discourage the optimization model from seeking out\npoints likely to yield low-fidelity beams. The approaches explored include\ndynamic pruning using loss analysis of size and position models and a\nlengthscale-based genetic algorithm to determine which points to include in the\nmodel for optimal fit. Each method successfully classified high and low\nfidelity points. This research advances BNL's mission to tackle our nation's\nenergy challenges by providing scientists at all beamlines with access to\nhigher quality beams, and faster convergence to these optima for their\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
