Recent advances in natural domain have been driven by foundation\nmodels like the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2). To explore the performance of\nSAM-2 in biomedical applications, we designed three evaluation pipelines for\nsingle-frame 2D image segmentation, multi-frame 3D image segmentation and\nmulti-frame video segmentation with varied prompt designs, revealing SAM-2's\nlimitations in medical contexts. Consequently, we developed BioSAM-2, an\nenhanced foundation model optimized for biomedical data based on SAM-2. Our\nexperiments show that BioSAM-2 not only surpasses the performance of existing\nstate-of-the-art foundation models but also matches or even exceeds specialist\nmodels, demonstrating its efficacy and potential in the medical domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
