We achieved\nelectron spin resonance of individual lanthanide atoms using a scanning\ntunneling microscope to probe the atoms bound to a protective insulating film.\nThese atoms were prepared in the monovalent state with an unpaired 6s electron,\nenabling tunnel current to access their 4f electrons. Europium spectra display\na rich array of transitions among the 54 combined electron and nuclear spin\nstates. In contrast, samarium's ground state is a Kramers doublet with an\nextraordinarily large g-factor of nearly 5. These results demonstrate that\nall-electronic sensing and control of individual lanthanide spins is possible\nfor quantum devices and spin-based electronics by using their rarely-observed\nmonovalent cation state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
