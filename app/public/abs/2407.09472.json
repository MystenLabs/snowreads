We\ntarget galaxies with masses $\\log_{10}(\\mathrm{M}_*/\\mathrm{M}_\\odot) = 8.0 -\n10.0$, utilizing data from eight JWST Cycle-1 fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S,\nNEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, MACS-0416), covering an unmasked\narea of 189.36 $\\mathrm{arcmin}^2$. We develop a new probabilistic\npair-counting methodology that integrates full photometric redshift posteriors\nand corrects for detection incompleteness to quantify close pairs with physical\nprojected separations between 20 and 50 kpc. Our analysis reveals an increase\nin pair fractions up to $z = 8$, reaching $0.211 \\pm 0.065$, followed by a\nstatistically flat evolution to $z = 11.5$. We find that the galaxy merger rate\nincreases from the local Universe up to $z = 6$ and then stabilizes at a value\nof $\\sim 6$ Gyr$^{-1}$ up to $z = 11.5$. We fit both a power-law and a\npower-law + exponential model to our pair fraction and merger rate redshift\nevolution, finding that the latter model describes the trends more accurately,\nparticularly at $z = 8.0 - 11.5$. In addition, we measure that the average\ngalaxy increases its stellar mass due to mergers by a factor of $2.77 \\pm 0.99$\nfrom redshift $z = 10.5$ to $z = 5.0$. Lastly, we investigate the impact of\nmergers on galaxy stellar mass growth, revealing that mergers contribute $71\n\\pm 25\\%$ as much to galaxy stellar mass increases as star formation from gas.\nThis indicates that mergers drive about half of galaxy assembly at high\nredshift.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
