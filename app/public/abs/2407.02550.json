In this regard, the elements of the mass matrix are expressed\nin terms of their absolute values and arguments. We propose a neutrino mass\nmatrix texture that highlights four correlations among its elements. The mixing\nscheme obtained from the proposed texture is consistent with experimental\nobservations. In addition, we derive the proposed texture from the $SU(2)_L\n\\times U(1)_Y \\times A_4 \\times Z_{10}$ group in the light of the seesaw\nmechanism.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zthbZe31FT4m5LqBzaRIzYyYudjY1bUz0EqzeGoUahs","pdfSize":"4079522","objectId":"0xe3b1ba24bee5d47220a67f1103e33a37c55bffeb23b633b1cc4fad6fec39b3bd","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
