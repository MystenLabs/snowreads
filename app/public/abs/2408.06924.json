The concept of $b$-matchings, where $b$\nis a function that assigns positive integers to the vertices of the graph, is a\nnatural extension of matchings in graphs, where each vertex $v$ is allowed to\nbe matched to up to $b(v)$ edges, rather than just one. The weighted\n$b$-matching problem then seeks to select a subset of the hyperedges that\nfulfills the constraint and maximizes the weight.\n  In this work, we engineer novel algorithms for this generalized problem. More\nprecisely, we introduce exact data reductions for the problem as well as a\nnovel greedy initial solution and local search algorithms. These data\nreductions allow us to significantly shrink the input size. This is done by\neither determining if a hyperedge is guaranteed to be in an optimum\n$b$-matching and thus can be added to our solution or if it can be safely\nignored. Our iterated local search algorithm provides a framework for finding\nsuitable improvement swaps of edges.\n  Experiments on a wide range of real-world hypergraphs show that our new set\nof data reductions are highly practical, and our initial solutions are\ncompetitive for graphs and hypergraphs as well.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
