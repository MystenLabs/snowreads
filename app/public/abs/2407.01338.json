We demonstrate\nthat the intensity of the saturation effects significantly affects the ratio\nbetween the flow coefficients $v_3$ and $v_2$ at the LHC. Adding a hotspot\nsubstructure to the nucleons enhances the saturation effects and improves the\nagreement with the measured data. We show that the collision-energy dependence\nof the flow coefficients obtained using the MC-EKRT initial states with\nhotspots is improved in comparison with the earlier event-by-event EKRT model.\nIn addition, we present the results for the charged hadron multiplicity\ndistribution in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, and show that the\nminijet-multiplicity originating fluctuations of the saturation scale included\nin MC-EKRT, as well as the presence of hotspots, are necessary for describing\nthe measured large-multiplicity tail in the distribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
