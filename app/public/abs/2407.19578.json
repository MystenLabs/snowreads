For such a matrix $A_n$, we show that\n$n-\\operatorname{rank}(A_n) \\approx \\log_q n$ as $n \\to \\infty$, and find that\nthe fluctuations around this limit are finite-order and given by explicit\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-valued random variables. More generally, we consider the random\npartition whose parts are the sizes of the nilpotent Jordan blocks of $A_n$:\nits $k$ largest parts (rows) were previously shown by Borodin to have jointly\nGaussian fluctuations as $N \\to \\infty$, and its columns correspond to\ndifferences $\\operatorname{rank}(A_n^{i-1}) - \\operatorname{rank}(A_n^i)$. We\nshow the fluctuations of the columns converge jointly to a discrete random\npoint configuration $\\mathcal{L}_{t,\\chi}$ introduced in arXiv:2310.12275. The\nproofs use an explicit integral formula for the probabilities at finite $N$,\nobtained by de-Poissonizing a corresponding one in arXiv:2310.12275, which is\namenable to asymptotic analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
