The third-order operator is an $L$-operator in\nthe Lax pair for the good Boussinesq equation. We construct the mapping from\nthe set of the coefficients to the set of spectral data. This mapping is an\nanalytic bijection on a neighborhood of the zero.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
