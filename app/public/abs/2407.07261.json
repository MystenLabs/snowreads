In the 1970s, Roter proved that\nwhile Riemannian ECS manifolds do not exist, pseudo-Riemannian ones do exist in\nall dimensions $n\\geq 4$, and realize all indefinite metric signatures. The\nlocal structure of ECS manifolds is known, and every ECS manifold carries a\ndistinguished null parallel distribution $\\mathcal{D}$, whose rank is always\nequal to $1$ or $2$. We review basic facts about ECS manifolds, briefly discuss\nthe construction of compact examples, and outline the proof of a topological\nstructure result: outside of the locally homogeneous case and up to a double\ncovering, every compact rank-one ECS manifold is a bundle over $\\mathbb{S}^1$\nwhose fibers are the leaves of $\\mathcal{D}^\\perp$. Finally, we mention some\nclassification results for compact rank-one ECS manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
