While the\ndynamical implications of such a phase space electronic Hamiltonian are not yet\nknown, we hypothesize that, by offering classical trajectories the conserve the\ntotal angular momentum (unlike Born-Oppenheimer theory), this new phase space\nelectronic structure Hamiltonian may well explain some fraction of the\nchiral-induced spin selectivity effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
