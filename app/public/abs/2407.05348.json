After the degeneration of elliptic beta integrals of type I and type\nII for root systems $A_n$ and $C_n$ to the hyperbolic hypergeometric integrals,\nwe apply the limit $\\omega_1\\to - \\omega_2$ for their quasiperiods\n(corresponding to $b\\to i$ in the two-dimensional conformal field theory) and\nobtain complex beta integrals in the Mellin--Barnes representation admitting\nexact evaluation. Considering type I elliptic hypergeometric integrals of a\nhigher order obeying nontrivial symmetry transformations, we derive their\ndescendants to the level of complex hypergeometric functions and prove the\nDerkachov--Manashov conjectures for functions emerging in the theory of\nnon-compact spin chains. We describe also symmetry transformations for a type\nII complex hypergeometric function on the $C_n$-root system related to the\nrecently derived generalized complex Selberg integral. For some hyperbolic beta\nintegrals we consider a special limit $\\omega_1\\to \\omega_2$ (or $b\\to 1$) and\nobtain new hypergeometric identities for sums of integrals of rational\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
