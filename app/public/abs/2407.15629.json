By\ndesigning suitable ansatz circuits utilizing universal SO(4) or SO(8) qubit\ngates, we demonstrate how to efficiently obtain the lowest two, four, and eight\neigenstates with one, two, and three ancillary qubits for both vanishing and\nnon-vanishing background electric field cases. Simulating the resulting quantum\ncircuits classically with tensor network techniques, we demonstrate the\ncapability of our approach to compute the two lowest eigenstates of systems\nwith up to $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ qubits. Given that our method allows for\nmeasuring the low-lying spectrum precisely, we also present a novel technique\nfor estimating the additive mass renormalization of the lattice based on the\nenergy gap. As a proof-of-principle calculation, we prepare the ground and\nfirst-excited states with one ancillary and four physical qubits on quantum\nhardware, demonstrating the practicality of using the cVQE to simulate excited\nstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
