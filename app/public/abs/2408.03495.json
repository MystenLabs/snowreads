We consider two types of algebraic extensions in this paper; one is of\nextensions obtained by adjoining the coordinates of certain points of various\nsemiabelian varieties; the other is of extensions obtained as the fixed\nsubfield in an algebraically closed field by a finite number of automorphisms.\nSome of such fields turn out to be new examples of Kummer-faithful fields which\nare not sub-$p$-adic. Among them, we find both examples of Kummer-faithful\nfields over which the Mordell--Weil group modulo torsion can be free of\ninfinite rank and not free.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
