Long coherence times have been demonstrated in trapped-ion\nqubits, typically using the hyperfine levels within the ground state of a\nsingle ion. However, recent research suggests qubits encoded in metastable\nstates could provide architectural benefits for quantum information processing,\nsuch as the possibility of effective dual-species operation in a single-species\nsystem and erasure-error conversion for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here\nwe demonstrate long-lived encoding of a quantum state in the metastable states\nof a trapped ion. By sympathetically cooling with another ion of the same\nspecies and constantly monitoring for erasure errors, we demonstrate a\ncoherence time of 136(42) seconds with a qubit encoded in the metastable\n$5D_{5/2}$ state of a single $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ion. In agreement with a model\nbased on empirical results from dynamical-decoupling-based noise spectroscopy,\nwe find that dephasing of the metastable levels is the dominant source of error\nonce erasure errors are removed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
