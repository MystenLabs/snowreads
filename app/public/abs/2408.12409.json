While graph forecasting networks(GFNs)\nare ideal for forecasting MTS data that exhibit spatio-temporal dependencies,\nprior works rely solely on the domain-specific knowledge of time-series\nvariables inter-relationships to model the nonlinear dynamics, neglecting\ninherent relational structural dependencies among the variables within the MTS\ndata. In contrast, contemporary works infer relational structures from MTS data\nbut neglect domain-specific knowledge. The proposed hybrid architecture\naddresses these limitations by combining both domain-specific knowledge and\nimplicit knowledge of the relational structure underlying the MTS data using\nKnowledge-Based Compositional Generalization. The hybrid architecture shows\npromising results on multiple benchmark datasets, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art forecasting methods. Additionally, the architecture models the\ntime varying uncertainty of multi-horizon forecasts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-DJ3s4OzcMX3aXhhNekR9LY6C_8vz-aYISJEFQCs58A","pdfSize":"2607095"}
