The findings help to understand key features\nof La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 and further support the real-space mechanism of\nsuperconductivity in cuprates. The rules of real-space superconductivity are\nformulated at the end.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
