Rev. Lett. 55, 912 (1985)] and Feynman and\nKleinert [Phys. Rev. A 34, 5080 (1986)] to time-dependent Hamiltonians, thus\nextending the scope of the method to the pricing of financial derivatives. We\nillustrate the accuracy of the approach by presenting results for the\nwell-known, but analytically intractable, Black-Karasinski model for the\ndynamics of interest rates. The accuracy and computational efficiency of this\npath integral approach makes it a viable alternative to fully-numerical schemes\nfor a variety of applications in derivatives pricing.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
