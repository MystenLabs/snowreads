These stochastic\nperturbations generate a variety of different types of ensemble spread in the\nsolution behaviour whilst also preserving the deterministic Lie Poisson\nstructure and Casimir conservation laws. We numerically compare the solution\nsensitivity, to another type of structure-preserving stochastic perturbation\nwhere instead of bathymetry, the velocity is stochastically perturbed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
