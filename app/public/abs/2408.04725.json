They target system availability, compromising entire systems\nwithout breaking underlying security protocols. Consequently, numerous studies\nhave focused on preventing, detecting, and mitigating DoS attacks. However,\nstate-of-the-art systematization efforts have limitations such as isolated DoS\ncountermeasures, shortcomings of AI-based studies, and a lack of DoS\nintegration features like privacy, anonymity, authentication, and transparency.\nAdditionally, the emergence of quantum computers is a game changer for DoS from\nattack and defense perspectives, yet it has remained largely unexplored. This\nstudy aims to address these gaps by examining (counter)-DoS in the AI era while\nalso considering post-quantum (PQ) security when it applies. We highlight the\ndeficiencies in the current literature and provide insights into synergistic\ntechniques to bridge these gaps. We explore AI mechanisms for DoS intrusion\ndetection, evaluate cybersecurity properties in cutting-edge machine learning\nmodels, and analyze weaponized AI in the context of DoS. We also investigate\ncollaborative and distributed counter-DoS frameworks via federated learning and\nblockchains. Finally, we assess proactive approaches such as honeypots,\npuzzles, and authentication schemes that can be integrated into next-generation\nnetwork systems for DoS prevention and mitigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gxjS-7XYkM7AuGOHv2TlUn1HaA1ZWSXsYGwkUkNOMkE","pdfSize":"650794"}
