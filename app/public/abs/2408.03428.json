We first derive the Babenko equation that\ndescribes the profile of the solitary wave. When the velocity $c$ is close to a\ncritical velocity and a sign condition involving the physical parameters is\nmet, the Babenko equation can be reduced to the stationary focusing cubic\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation plus perturbative error. We show the existence\nof a critical value of a dimensionless physical parameter below which at least\ntwo families of velocities satisfy the focusing condition and above which only\none does. This gives the existence of small-amplitude solitary wave solutions\nfor the water wave system with constant vorticity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uIt86inVJUYLZV7mQCoaZVJrnMToPgLD2ywMRqPEpJM","pdfSize":"362549"}
