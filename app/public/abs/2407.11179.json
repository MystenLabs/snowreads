The implementation of the full quantum phase\nestimation algorithm with a $U(N)$ unitary operator is realised through the\nnon-abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The implementation allows for a more\nphysically intuitive understanding of the algorithm. As an example we use the\npath integral formulation of the implemented quantum phase estimation algorithm\nto analyse the classical limit $\\hbar\\to0$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oAgq3ZrWUThF0UIgWGaXgXpMYzYDGG-QS9Jt4z10a24","pdfSize":"721707"}
