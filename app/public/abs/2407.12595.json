In this work, we address the fully dynamic edge orientation\nproblem, also known as the fully dynamic $\\Delta$-orientation problem. The\nobjective is to maintain an orientation of the edges in an undirected graph\nsuch that the out-degree of any vertex remains low. When edges are inserted or\ndeleted, it may be necessary to reorient some edges to prevent vertices from\nhaving excessively high out-degrees. In this paper, we introduce the first\nalgorithm that maintains an optimal edge orientation during both insertions and\ndeletions. In experiments comparing with recent nearly exact algorithms, we\nachieve a 32% lower running time. The update time of our algorithm is up to 6\norders of magnitude faster than static exact algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
