Nevertheless\nthe classical soft graviton theorem determines the power law fall-off of the\nwave-form at late and early times, including logarithmic corrections, in terms\nof only the momenta of the incoming and outgoing objects without any reference\nto what transpired during the collision. In this short review I shall explain\nthe results and very briefly outline the derivation of these results.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
