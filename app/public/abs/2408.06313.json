We show that in the case of finite-dimensional\ninput and output spaces, both are equivalent and preserved under duality\ntransformations. In the general case, neither of these properties is satisfied,\nbut BIBO and LILO stability remain dual to each other.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
