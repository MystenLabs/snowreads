We\ndefine a categorical semantics for projective Cliffords based on Pauli\nencodings in terms of $\\mathbb{Z}_d$-linear maps. We then introduce a type\nsystem and lambda calculus for both $\\mathbb{Z}_d$-linear maps and projective\nCliffords, and prove that these type systems have a sound denotational\nsemantics in terms of the relevant categories. Finally, we explore what it\nmeans to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and\nprogramming constructions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
