Epitaxial\nfilms are achieved from self-assembly of an interface ``buffer'' layer, which\naccommodates the large film/substrate lattice mismatch of nearly 40\\% for the\nalloy film studied here. The self-assembled buffer layer, occurring for both\nthe as-grown sulfide and post-selenization alloy films, is shown to have\nrock-salt-like atomic stacking akin to a Ruddlesden-Popper phase. Above this\nbuffer, the film quickly transitions to the perovskite structure. Overall,\nthese results provide insights into oxide-chalcogenide heteroepitaxial film\ngrowth, illustrating a process that yields relaxed, crystalline, epitaxial\nchalcogenide perovskite films that support ongoing studies of optoelectronic\nand device properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
