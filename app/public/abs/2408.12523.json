A key criterion in these problems is satisfying fairness constraints\nsuch as envy-freeness. We extend this problem by considering agents with\narbitrary weights, focusing on the concept of weighted envy-freeness, which has\nbeen extensively studied in fair division. We present a polynomial-time\nalgorithm to determine whether weighted envy-free allocations exist and, if so,\nto compute one. Since weighted envy-free allocations do not always exist, we\nalso investigate the potential of achieving such allocations through the use of\nsubsidies. We provide several characterizations for weighted envy-freeable\nallocations (allocations that can be turned weighted envy-free by introducing\nsubsidies) and show that they do not always exist, which is different from the\nunweighted setting. Furthermore, we explore the existence of weighted\nenvy-freeable allocations in specific scenarios and outline the conditions\nunder which they exist.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
