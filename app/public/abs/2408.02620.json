This platform unlocks\nunique features not found in traditional pilot-wave hydrodynamics, inviting\nfurther exploration across varied physical settings to fully unravel its\npotential and limitations as a quantum analog. In this study, we explore how\nthe recently reported phenomenon of hydrodynamic superradiance is affected when\na single hydrodynamic cavity is taken to interact with a submerged reflective\nbarrier. Our experimental findings reveal that the presence of a barrier near a\ncavity enhances its droplet emission rate, emulating the effect of a second\ncavity positioned at twice the distance. Moreover, the system exhibits a\nsinusoidal modulation of the emission rate as a function of the distance\nbetween the cavity and its mirror image, echoing the characteristic\nsuperradiance signature observed in optical systems. These findings broaden our\nunderstanding of wave-particle duality in hydrodynamic quantum analogs and\nsuggest new pathways for replicating quantum behaviors in macroscopic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
