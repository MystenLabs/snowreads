Several apparent tensions in cosmology have occupied\nresearchers in recent years, and a number of different metrics have been\nproposed to quantify tension. Many of these metrics suffer from limiting\nassumptions, and correctly calibrating these is essential if we want to\nsuccessfully determine whether discrepancies are significant. A commonly used\nmetric of tension is the evidence ratio R. The statistic has been widely\nadopted by the community as a Bayesian way of quantifying tensions, however, it\nhas a non-trivial dependence on the prior that is not always accounted for\nproperly. We show that this can be calibrated out effectively with Neural Ratio\nEstimation. We demonstrate our proposed calibration technique with an analytic\nexample, a toy example inspired by 21-cm cosmology, and with observations of\nthe Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument~(DESI) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey~(SDSS). We find no\nsignificant tension between DESI and SDSS.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
