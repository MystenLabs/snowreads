We show that many commonly used extremely heavy-tailed (i.e.,\ninfinite-mean) distributions, such as the Pareto, Fr\\'echet, and Burr\ndistributions, belong to the class of super heavy-tailed distributions. The\nestablished stochastic dominance relation is further generalized to allow\nnegatively dependent or non-identically distributed random variables. In\nparticular, the weighted average of non-identically distributed random\nvariables stochastically dominates their distribution mixtures. Applications of\nthese results in portfolio diversification, goods bundling, and inventory\nmanagement are discussed. Remarkably, in the presence of super\nheavy-tailedness, the results that hold for finite-mean models in these\napplications are flipped.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Economics/Theoretical Economics","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
