These innovative architectures move away from\ntraditional host-centric models to focus on content-oriented approaches. This\npaper offers a succinct understanding and in-depth exploration of these\nrevolutionary networking frameworks. It explores into their foundational\nconcepts, technical principles, and the latest developments. Also, the paper\nexamines the current standards that govern these architectures and discusses\ntheir practical applications in the real world. By providing a comprehensive\noverview, this study aims to highlight how ICN, CCNx, and NDN are reshaping the\nlandscape of digital communications, emphasizing efficiency, security, and\nscalability in data handling and distribution across networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
