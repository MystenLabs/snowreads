However, existing schemes for 3D scene editing still exhibit certain\nshortcomings, hindering their further interactive design. Such schemes\ntypically adhere to fixed input patterns, limiting users' flexibility in text\ninput. Moreover, their editing capabilities are constrained by a single or a\nfew 2D visual models and require intricate pipeline design to integrate these\nmodels into 3D reconstruction processes. To address the aforementioned issues,\nwe propose a dialogue-based 3D scene editing approach, termed CE3D, which is\ncentered around a large language model that allows for arbitrary textual input\nfrom users and interprets their intentions, subsequently facilitating the\nautonomous invocation of the corresponding visual expert models. Furthermore,\nwe design a scheme utilizing Hash-Atlas to represent 3D scene views, which\ntransfers the editing of 3D scenes onto 2D atlas images. This design achieves\ncomplete decoupling between the 2D editing and 3D reconstruction processes,\nenabling CE3D to flexibly integrate a wide range of existing 2D or 3D visual\nmodels without necessitating intricate fusion designs. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CE3D effectively integrates multiple visual models to achieve\ndiverse editing visual effects, possessing strong scene comprehension and\nmulti-round dialog capabilities.
