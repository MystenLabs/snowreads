The usual approach for studying these effects is to\nnumerically integrate the Schrodinger equation, recovering the neutrino mixing\nmatrix and its parameters from the solution. This work suggests using the\nclassical Jacobi's diagonalization in combination with a reordering procedure\nto produce a new algorithm, the Sequential Jacobi Diagonalization. This\nstrategy separates linear algebra operations from numerical integration,\nallowing physicists to study how the oscillation parameters are affected by\nadiabatic MSW effects in a more efficient way. The mixing matrices at every\npoint of a given parameter space can be stored for speeding up other\ncalculations, such as model fitting and Monte Carlo productions. This approach\nhas two major computation advantages, namely: being trivially parallelizable,\nmaking it a suitable choice for concurrent computation, and allowing for\nquasi-model-independent solutions that simplify Beyond Standard Model searches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
