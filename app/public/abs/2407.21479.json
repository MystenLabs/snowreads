However, the\nhollow divergence and alignment requirement impose crucial challenges for users\nto achieve air-to-ground OAM communications, where there exists the\nline-of-sight path. Therefore, we propose the air-to-ground cooperative OAM\ncommunication (ACOC) scheme, which can realize OAM communications for users\nwith size-limited devices. The waist radius is adjusted to guarantee the\nmaximum intensity at the cooperative users (CUs). We derive the closed-form\nexpression of the optimal FBS position, which satisfies the antenna alignment\nfor two cooperative user groups (CUGs). Furthermore, the selection constraint\nis given to choose two CUGs composed of four CUs. Simulation results are\nprovided to validate the optimal FBS position and the SE superiority of the\nproposed ACOC scheme.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
