We focus on models that sit between incompressible 3D LU\nNavier-Stokes equations and standard LU primitive equations, aiming for\nnumerical manageability while capturing non-hydrostatic phenomena. Our main\nresult concerns the well-posedness of a specific stochastic interpretation of\nthe LU primitive equations. This holds with rigid-lid type boundary conditions,\nand when the horizontal component of noise is independent of z. In fact these\nconditions can be related to the dynamical regime in which the primitive\nequations remain valid. Moreover, under these conditions, we show that the LU\nprimitive equations solution tends toward the one of the deterministic\nprimitive equations for a vanishing noise, thus providing a physical coherence\nto the LU stochastic model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JQpVppR6PNIJBJ1ck_HXFqvycAAdW_6feTaUlbfsSJ0","pdfSize":"279664"}
