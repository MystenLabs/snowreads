This paper\ninvestigates how adding design frictions into the interface of a social media\nplatform reduce mindless scrolling and user satisfaction. We conducted a study\nwith 30 participants and compared their memory recognition of posts in two\nscenarios: one where participants had to react to each post to access further\ncontent and another using an infinite scroll design. Participants who used the\ndesign frictions interface exhibited significantly better content recall,\nalthough a majority of participants found the interface frustrating. We discuss\ndesign recommendations and scenarios where adding design frictions to social\nmedia platforms can be beneficial.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
