As up-type quarks and neutrinos are arranged in\nthe same multiplets, they exhibit strong correlations, and it is commonly\nbelieved that the masses of right-handed (RH) neutrinos are too hierarchical to\nfit the low-energy neutrino data. This pattern generally predicts a lightest RH\nneutrino too light to yield successful leptogenesis, with any lepton-antilepton\nasymmetry generated from heavier neutrinos being washed out unless special\nflavour structures are assumed. We propose a different scenario in which the\nlightest two RH neutrinos $N_1$ and $N_2$ have nearby masses of order $10^9$\nGeV, with thermal leptogenesis arising non-resonantly from both $N_1$ and\n$N_2$. We show that this pattern is consistent with all data on fermion masses\nand mixing and predicts the lightest physical left-handed neutrino mass to be\nsmaller than about $10^{-7}$ eV. The Dirac phase, which does not take the\nmaximal CP-violating value, plays an important role in leptogenesis.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
