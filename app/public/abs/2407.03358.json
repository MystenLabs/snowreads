Our analysis indicates that the RPM cannot account for the\nbiological effects observed under exposure to telecommunication frequencies due\nto negligible effects under low-amplitude conditions used in experimental\nsetups. Observable effects on radical pairs at these frequencies would require\nhyperfine coupling constants that are precisely fine-tuned to large values that\nfar exceed those naturally occurring within biological systems. We conclude\nthat some other mechanism must be responsible for the effects of\ntelecommunication frequency fields in biological systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
