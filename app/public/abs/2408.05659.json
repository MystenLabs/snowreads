We provide visual\ndemonstrations of the correlation structures of these products in terms of\ntheir returns, realized volatility, and trading volume. The resulting networks\noffer insights into the contemporaneous movements across the different\nproducts, illustrating how inherently connected the movements of the future\nproducts belonging to these two classes are. These networks are further\nutilized by a multi-channel Graph Convolutional Network to enhance the\npredictive power of a Long Short-Term Memory network, allowing for the\npropagation of forecasts of highly correlated quantities, combining the\ntemporal with the spatial aspect of the term structure.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_luD93tCp6Qg5_eJ6tlG9ssFYVd2egaj01em7921QNM","pdfSize":"1246911"}
