Transitions between these local minima govern the\ndynamics of such systems. Precisely determining the transition pathways in\ncomplex and high-dimensional systems is challenging because these transitions\nare rare events, and isolating the relevant species in experiments is\ndifficult. Most of the time, the system remains near a local minimum, with\nrare, large fluctuations leading to transitions between minima. The probability\nof such transitions decreases exponentially with the height of the energy\nbarrier, making the system's dynamics highly sensitive to the calculated energy\nbarriers. This work aims to formulate the problem of finding the minimum energy\nbarrier between two stable states in the system's state space as a\ncost-minimization problem. We propose solving this problem using reinforcement\nlearning algorithms. The exploratory nature of reinforcement learning agents\nenables efficient sampling and determination of the minimum energy barrier for\ntransitions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
