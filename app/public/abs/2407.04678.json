The unique attribute of\nXQSV is its capacity to alter its structural configuration dynamically,\noptimizing performance for the task based on the particular subset of data on\nwhich it is trained. We have incorporated several design improvements to\nsignificantly enhance the network's predictive accuracy, including a local\nillegal move filter, an Elo range partitioning, a sequential one-dimensional\ninput, and a simulation of imperfect memory capacity. Empirical evaluations\nreveal that XQSV attains a predictive accuracy of approximately 40%, with its\nperformance peaking within the trained Elo range. This indicates the model's\nsuccess in mimicking the play behavior of individuals within that specific\nrange. A three-terminal Turing Test was employed to demonstrate that the XQSV\nmodel imitates human behavior more accurately than conventional Xiangqi\nengines, rendering it indistinguishable from actual human opponents. Given the\ninherent nondeterminism in human gameplay, we propose two supplementary relaxed\nevaluation metrics. To our knowledge, XQSV represents the first model to mimic\nXiangqi players.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
