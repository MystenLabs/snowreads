In this compound, Fe$^{3+}$ and Os$^{5+}$ ions generate\nsubstantial magnetization, while Ca$^{2+}$ and Zn$^{2+}$ ions create a\nlayerwise polar environment, resulting in a synergistic combination for\nmultiferroicity. We determine the magnitude of the spontaneous polarization,\n$\\vert P_s \\vert$, to be 16.8 $\\mu$ C/cm$^2$, and the magnetic moment is\napproximately 2 $\\mu_B$ per formula unit. The remarkable ferroelectric and\nferrimagnetic behaviors exhibited by CZFOO make it a promising candidate for\nvarious device applications. Despite the significant magnetization and\npolarization observed, surpassing those of other double perovskites, we find a\nweak spin-orbit coupling, leading to the absence of any significant\nmagnetoelectric effect in CZFOO. Our findings shed light on the potential of\nCZFOO as a multiferroic material and provide insights into the intricate\ninterplay between ferroelectricity and ferrimagnetism in double perovskite\ncompounds.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
