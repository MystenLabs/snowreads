In contrast to traditional recommender system, it learns the user\npreference better through interactions (i.e. conversations), and then further\nboosts the recommendation performance. However, existing studies on CRS ignore\nto address the relationship among attributes, users, and items effectively,\nwhich might lead to inappropriate questions and inaccurate recommendations. In\nthis view, we propose a knowledge graph based conversational recommender system\n(referred as KG-CRS). Specifically, we first integrate the user-item graph and\nitem-attribute graph into a dynamic graph, i.e., dynamically changing during\nthe dialogue process by removing negative items or attributes. We then learn\ninformative embedding of users, items, and attributes by also considering\npropagation through neighbors on the graph. Extensive experiments on three real\ndatasets validate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art\napproaches in terms of both the recommendation and conversation tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z15WrjDdpGDugwuC38bOmY4H1AB7ShmWqazgd7NnqOY","pdfSize":"1253401"}
