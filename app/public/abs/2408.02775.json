To test the cosmological viability of these\nmodels, we use 57 Hubble parameter data points (OHD), 1048 supernovae distance\nmodulus (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate ($f$-data),\nand 30 redshift-space distortions ($f\\sigma_8$) datasets. We compute the\nbest-fit values $\\Omega_m, H_0$ and exponents $\\{n, p, \\gamma\\}$ including the\nbulk viscosity coefficient $\\zeta_0$, through a detailed statistical analysis.\nMoreover, we study linear cosmological perturbations and compute the density\ncontrast \\(\\delta(z)\\), growth factor $D(z)$, growth rate $(f(z)$, and\nredshift-space distortion $f\\sigma_8(z)$. Based on the Akaike Information\nCriterion (AIC) and Bayesian / Schwartz Information Criterion (BIC), a\nstatistical comparison of the $f(Q)$ gravity models with \\lcdm is made. From\nour statistical analysis of cosmic measurements, we found an underestimation of\nall models on the OHD data; therefore, statistical viability led us to weigh it\nin favour of SNIa data which resulted in the exponential ($f_{2\\rm{CDM}}$)\nmodel without bulk viscosity being the most plausible alternative model, while\non average the $f_{1\\rm{CDM}}$ model performed statistically the weakest. We\nalso found that adding bulk viscosity did not improve the fit of the models to\nall observational data.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
