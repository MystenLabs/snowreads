These systems are parametric in the number of nodes in the network or\nthe number of threads, which is finite in any system instance, but unbounded.\nOne disadvantage of first-order logic is that it cannot distinguish between\nfinite and infinite structures, leading to spurious counterexamples. To\nmitigate this, we offer a verification approach that captures only finite\nsystem instances. Our approach is an adaptation of the cutoff method to systems\nmodeled in first-order logic. The idea is to show that any safety violation in\na system instance of size larger than some bound can be simulated by a safety\nviolation in a system of a smaller size. The simulation provides an inductive\nargument for correctness in finite instances, reducing the problem to showing\nsafety of instances with bounded size. To this end, we develop a framework to\n(i) encode such simulation relations in first-order logic and to (ii) validate\nthe simulation relation by a set of verification conditions given to an SMT\nsolver. We apply our approach to verify safety of a set of examples, some of\nwhich cannot be proven by a first-order inductive invariant.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
