Over time a biometric system may\nevolve to add new modalities, retire old modalities, or be merged with other\nbiometric systems. This can lead to scenarios where there are missing scores\ncorresponding to the input probe set. Previous work on this topic has focused\non either the verification or identification tasks, but not both. Further, the\nproportion of missing data considered has been less than 50%. In this work, we\nstudy the impact of missing score data for both the verification and\nidentification tasks. We show that the application of various score imputation\nmethods along with simple sum fusion can improve recognition accuracy, even\nwhen the proportion of missing scores increases to 90%. Experiments show that\nfusion after score imputation outperforms fusion with no imputation.\nSpecifically, iterative imputation with K nearest neighbors consistently\nsurpasses other imputation methods in both the verification and identification\ntasks, regardless of the amount of scores missing, and provides imputed values\nthat are consistent with the ground truth complete dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZiDkSGzopyk9f4GDITZ3RNwDS1EDq9W9jHw_iIzodYg","pdfSize":"1055662"}
