Typically, proposed solutions to this problem focus on\nways in which we can reduce the number of job losses which result from\nautomation, ways to retrain those that lose their jobs, or ways to mitigate the\nsocial consequences of those job losses. However, even in cases where workers\nkeep their jobs, their agency within them might be severely downgraded. For\ninstance, human employees might work alongside AI but not be allowed to make\ndecisions or not be allowed to make decisions without consulting with or coming\nto agreement with the AI. This is a kind of epistemic harm (which could be an\ninjustice if it is distributed on the basis of identity prejudice). It\ndiminishes human agency (in constraining people's ability to act\nindependently), and it fails to recognize the workers' epistemic agency as\nqualified experts. Workers, in this case, aren't given the trust they are\nentitled to. This means that issues of human dignity remain even in cases where\neveryone keeps their job. Further, job retention focused solutions, such as\ndesigning an algorithm to work alongside the human employee, may only enable\nthese harms. Here, we propose an alternative design solution, adversarial\ncollaboration, which addresses the traditional retention problem of automation,\nbut also addresses the larger underlying problem of epistemic harms and the\ndistribution of trust between AI and humans in the workplace.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
