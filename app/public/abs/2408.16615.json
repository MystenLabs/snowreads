Most of TFB models are established in two-dimensional Euclidean\nlattices with zero curvature. In this work, we systematically explore TFBs in a\nclass of two-dimensional non-Euclidean lattices with constant negative\ncurvature, {\\emph i.e.,} the hyperbolic analogs of the kagome lattice. Based on\nthe Abelian hyperbolic band theory, TFBs have been respectively found in the\nheptagon-kagome, the octagon-kagome, the nonagon-kagome and the decagon-kagome\nlattices by introducing staggered magnetic fluxes and the next nearest-neighbor\nhoppings. The flatness ratios of all hyperbolic TFB models are more than 15,\nwhich suggests that the hyperbolic FCIs can be realized in these TFB models. We\nfurther demonstrate the existence of a $\\nu=1/2$ FCI state with open boundary\nconditions when hard-core bosons fill into these hyperbolic TFB models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
