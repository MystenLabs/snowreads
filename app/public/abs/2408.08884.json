Analysis of 2023 Journal Citation Reports\ndata shows that for most journals, the Uniq-JIF is less than 20% lower than the\nJIF, though some journals show a drop of over 75%. The Uniq-JIF also highlights\nsignificant reductions for journals suppressed due to citation issues,\nindicating its effectiveness in identifying problematic journals. The Uniq-JIF\noffers a more nuanced view of a journal's influence and can help reveal\njournals needing further scrutiny.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hq2I86GijqwGCAgRUTzlDDLo32QgXgMwm5Yq2X_PFvk","pdfSize":"1195693"}
