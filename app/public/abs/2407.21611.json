Although some works have achieved\nencouraging results, utilizing boundary information within a single model\nremains an unexplored research topic. In this work, we propose a novel method\ncalled Boundary-aware Attention Mechanism (BAM). Specifically, it consists of\ntwo core modules: Boundary Enhancement and Boundary Frame-wise Attention. The\nformer assembles the intra-frame and inter-frame information to extract\ndiscriminative boundary features that are subsequently used for boundary\nposition detection and authenticity decision, while the latter leverages\nboundary prediction results to explicitly control the feature interaction\nbetween frames, which achieves effective discrimination between real and fake\nframes. Experimental results on PartialSpoof database demonstrate our proposed\nmethod achieves the best performance.
