It was recently proven by\nChen, Sch\\\"orkhuber, and the author that the strong field limit of the\n$(5+1)$-dimensional, co-rotational Skyrme model admits an explicit self-similar\nsolution which is asymptotically stable within backwards light cones. Seeded by\nthe limiting model, we construct an open set of initial data whose evolution\nwithin a backwards light cone, according to the full model, suffers a gradient\nblowup in finite time. Moreover, the singularity develops at the self-similar\nrate and possesses an asymptotic profile given by the self-similar profile of\nthe strong field model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
