Research into laser-liquid metal interactions have\nprimarily focused on the heat and mass transport under large thermal gradients\nimposed by the localized melting conditions. However, little research has been\nconducted into varying input laser frequency and scan rate at fixed absorption\nto understand the effects of laser-light on surface oxide formation. This\narticle conducts laser melting of 304L under Blue (450 nm) and Infrared (IR,\n1064 nm) laser frequencies and examines their impact on laser oxide thickness,\nchemistry, and coloration. We find that laser frequencies induce changes in the\noxide layer thickness and chemistry that cannot be explained using conventional\nthermal absorption shifts and fluid dynamics. We suggest that light coupling\nmay have thermodynamic implications for the chemical potential of the liquid\nmetal which may drive the observed phase behavior.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LRoQV6I74zuQAGtUrDSYmxYuw2C6MpQaJlUSA8xZCnE","pdfSize":"7369856"}
