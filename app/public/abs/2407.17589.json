A\npopulation of agents is more diverse than another population of agents if its\ndistribution over groups is less concentrated: being less concentrated takes a\nspecific mathematical meaning borrowed from the theory of majorization. We\nadapt the standard notion of majorization in order to favor arbitrary\ndistributional objectives, such as population-level distributions over\nrace/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. With school admissions in mind, we\naxiomatically characterize choice rules that are consistent with modified\nmajorization, and constitute a principled method for admitting a diverse\npopulation of students into a school. Two important advantages of our approach\nis that majorization provides a natural notion of diversity, and that our\naxioms are independent of any exogenous priority ordering. We compare our\nchoice rule to the leading proposal in the literature, ``reserves and quotas,''\nand find ours to be more flexible.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
