Conditions are given so that a double\nextension of a Sasakian Lie algebra be Sasakian again. Conditions are also\ngiven for obtaining either a Sasakian or a Frobernius-K\\\"ahler Lie algebra upon\nrespectively extending a Frobernius-K\\\"ahler or a Sasakian Lie algebra by\nadjoining a derivation of the source algebra. Low-dimensional examples are\nincluded.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
