Here, we show that knotting and\nknot complexity increase by orders of magnitude in diblock polymers with a\nfraction $p$ of self-propelled monomers. Remarkably, this enhancement is not\nmonotonic in $p$ with an optimal value independent of the monomer's activity.\nBy monitoring the knot's size and position we elucidate the mechanisms of its\nformation, diffusion, and untying and ascribe the non-monotonic behaviour to\nthe competition between the rate of knot formation and the knot's lifetime.\nThese findings suggest a non-equilibrium mechanism to generate entangled\nfilaments at the nano-scale.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
