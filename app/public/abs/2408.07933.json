By reviewing\ncybersecurity and AI frameworks, we outline three approaches that can help\nidentify gaps in the management of AI-related risks. First, a functional\napproach identifies essential categories of activities (\"functions\") that a\nrisk management approach should cover, as in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework\n(CSF) and AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). Second, a lifecycle approach\ninstead assigns safety and security activities across the model development\nlifecycle, as in DevSecOps and the OECD AI lifecycle framework. Third, a\nthreat-based approach identifies tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nused by malicious actors, as in the MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE ATLAS databases. We\nrecommend that frontier AI developers and policymakers begin by adopting the\nfunctional approach, given the existence of the NIST AI RMF and other\nsupplementary guides, but also establish a detailed frontier AI lifecycle model\nand threat-based TTP databases for future use.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bomA3kjorQA09gzQ8quQ4yIUC8MT6qmdDkUkf6wYNlc","pdfSize":"2529792"}
