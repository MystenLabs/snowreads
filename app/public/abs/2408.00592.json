Under the assumption\nthat sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced,\nwe can prove that the dynamics is attractive toward a unique invariant\nprobability measure with polynomial rate of any power. In order to prove this,\nwe further develop coupling method and establish a sufficiently general\ncriterion for polynomial mixing. The proof of polynomial mixing for KSE is\nobtained by the combination of the coupling criterion and the Foia\\c{s}-Prodi\nestimate of KSE on the whole line.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
