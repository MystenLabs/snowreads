As a test case for this perspective, we compute the gonality of\ncertain families of outerplanar graphs, specifically the strip graphs. The\nJacobians of such graphs are always cyclic of Fibonacci order. As a\nconsequence, we obtain several results on the additive properties of Fibonacci\nnumbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
