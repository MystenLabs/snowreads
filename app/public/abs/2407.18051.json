For the first time at two loops, we\nenable their direct numerical integration by tackling infrared, ultraviolet and\nthreshold singularities simultaneously using local subtractions. We demonstrate\nthe feasibility of our approach by calculating previously unknown perturbative\ncorrections for processes of interest to the Large Hadron Collider.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
