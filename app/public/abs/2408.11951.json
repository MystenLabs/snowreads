The primary\nadvantage of RCTs over observational studies lies in their ability to\nsignificantly reduce noise from individual variance. However, RCTs depend on\nstrong assumptions, such as group independence, time independence, and group\nrandomness, which are not always feasible in real-world applications.\nTraditional inferential methods, including analysis of covariance (ANCOVA),\noften fail when these assumptions do not hold. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach named \\textbf{Sp}ill\\textbf{o}ve\\textbf{r} \\textbf{T}ime\n\\textbf{S}eries \\textbf{Causal} (\\verb+SPORTSCausal+), which enables the\nestimation of treatment effects without relying on these stringent assumptions.\nWe demonstrate the practical applicability of \\verb+SPORTSCausal+ through a\nreal-world budget-control experiment. In this experiment, data was collected\nfrom both a 5\\% live experiment and a 50\\% live experiment using the same\ntreatment. Due to the spillover effect, the vanilla estimation of the treatment\neffect was not robust across different treatment sizes, whereas\n\\verb+SPORTSCausal+ provided a robust estimation.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
