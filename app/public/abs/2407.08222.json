In this study, we proposed a physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)\nnamed PINN-Ray to model complex deformation for a Fin Ray soft robotic gripper,\nwhich embeds the minimum potential energy principle from elastic mechanics and\nadditional high-fidelity experimental data into the loss function of neural\nnetwork for training. This method is significant in terms of its generalisation\nto complex geometry and robust to data scarcity as compared to other\ndata-driven neural networks. Furthermore, it has been extensively evaluated to\nmodel the deformation of the Fin Ray finger under external actuation. PINN-Ray\ndemonstrates improved accuracy as compared with Finite element modelling (FEM)\nafter applying the data assimilation scheme to treat the sim-to-real gap.\nAdditionally, we introduced our automated framework to design, fabricate soft\nrobotic fingers, and characterise their deformation by visual tracking, which\nprovides a guideline for the fast prototype of soft robotics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
