It is a result of Mar\\'echal from 1973 that this\ntopology is Polish as soon as the ambient algebra has separable predual, but\nthe sketch of proof in her research announcement appears to have a small gap.\nOur main goal in this paper is to fill this gap by a careful look at the\ntopologies one can put on the space of weak-$*$ closed subspaces of a dual\nspace. We also indicate how Michael's selection theorem can be used as a step\ntowards Mar\\'echal's theorem, and how it simplifies the proof of an important\nselection result of Haagerup and Winsl{\\o}w for the Mar\\'echal topology. As an\napplication, we show that the space of finite von Neumann algebras is\n$\\mathbf\\Pi^0_3$-complete.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
