We examine different approaches starting from straightforward\nimplementations to more optimized versions. The implementations discussed\ninclude brute-force arithmetic methods, divisibility tricks, and derivation\nfrom a finite automaton. Our contributions include an in-depth look at the\nprocess of implementing a miniKanren relation and observations on benchmarking\n\\texttt{defrel}s. This study aims to provide practical insights for miniKanren\nprogrammers on both performance and implementation techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"68qFu34hV13IJQnt-Cwf3cOI06dXPEg1WAQcMHvtQ6A","pdfSize":"620147"}
