The random walk moves along open edges in $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ (resp., open\nsites in $\\mathcal{T}$) at rate $1$. For the critical regime $p=p_c$, we prove\nthe following two results: on $\\mathcal{T}$, the mean squared displacement of\nthe random walk from $0$ to $t$ is at most $O(t\\mu^{5/132-\\epsilon})$ for any\n$\\epsilon>0$; on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\\geq 11$, the corresponding upper bound\nfor the mean squared displacement is $O(t \\mu^{1/2}\\log(1/\\mu))$. For the\nsupercritical regime $p>p_c$, we prove that the mean squared displacement on\n$\\mathbb{Z}^d$ is at least $ct$ for some $c=c(d)>0$ that does not depend on\n$\\mu$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
