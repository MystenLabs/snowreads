In this paper, we explore data-driven optimal\ncontrol of continuous-time linear systems using input-output data. Based on a\ndensity result, we rigorously derive error bounds for finite-order polynomial\napproximations of elements of the system behavior. To this end, we leverage a\nlink between latent variables and flat outputs of controllable systems.\nCombined with a continuous-time counterpart of the fundamental lemma by Willems\net al., we characterize the suboptimality resulting from polynomial\napproximations in data-driven linear-quadratic optimal control problems.\nFinally, we draw upon a numerical example to illustrate our results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
