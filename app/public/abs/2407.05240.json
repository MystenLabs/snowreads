We further assume that agents' utilities are based\nsolely on their preferences over the assignees of adjacent vertices and that\nthose preferences are binary. Having shown that even this very restricted\nsetting does not guarantee neighborhood stable assignments, we focus on special\ncases that provide such guarantees. We show that when the graph is a cycle or a\npath, a neighborhood stable assignment always exists for any preference\nprofile. Furthermore, we give a general condition under which neighborhood\nstable assignments always exist. For each of these results, we give a\npolynomial-time algorithm to compute a neighborhood stable assignment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pJx2n3fbojpLFEd2NgBsb66WSO3cKsbqQApUWMcZX8c","pdfSize":"521779"}
