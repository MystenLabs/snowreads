With the recent emergence of\nthe high interest in dense plasmas with partially degenerate electrons, new\napproaches have been developed to treat electron-ion collisions in a\nquantum-mechanical way. In this context, gaining a deeper physical\nunderstanding of the criteria for the applicability of classical plasma models\nis crucial. We have analyzed the Coulomb logarithm describing the electron-ion\ncollisions in hydrogen plasmas in a wide range of temperatures and densities\nrelevant to inertial confinement fusion experiments. The electron-ion collision\ncross-sections were computed using both quantum and classical scattering\ntheories. We found that the classical description of the electron-ion\nscattering in plasmas and related plasma models is applicable if the de Broglie\nwavelength of electrons is smaller than the ion charge screening length in\nplasmas. Additionally, we show that the quantum first-order Born approximation\nfor describing the electron-ion collision is accurate only in the regime where\nclassical scattering theory is accurate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
