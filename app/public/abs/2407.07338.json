Such a restriction of the Markov\nequivalence class can be uniquely represented by a restricted essential\nancestral graph. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain\nproperties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from\nAli et al. (2009). Second, we present several new sound graphical orientation\nrules for adding expert knowledge to an essential ancestral graph. We also show\nthat some orientation rules of Zhang (2008b) are not needed for restricting the\nMarkov equivalence class with expert knowledge. Third, we provide an algorithm\nfor including this expert knowledge and show that in certain settings the\noutput of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. Finally,\noutside of the specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether\na graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can\nbe seen as a generalization of Meek (1995) to settings which allow for latent\nconfounding.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
