The\ninteraction between particles is modeled by a non-Coulombian potential. We\nanalyzed both the three-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. We obtained\naccurate analytical results for the particle energy, the particle velocity, the\nground state energy of the system as well as the momentum dependent density of\nstates. The previous classical results for the Coulombian case were reobtained\nas particular cases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
