We first provide estimators of the diffusive and\nadvective parameters in the SPDE using temporal and spatial increments. We then\nconstruct an estimator of the reaction parameter in the SPDE based on an\napproximate coordinate process. We also give simulation results of the proposed\nestimators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
