In this study, we\ndemonstrate tunable hidden orders in the photo-doped two-orbital extended\nHubbard model. Using steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory,\nwe clarify the coexistence and interplay of nonthermal charge, spin, and\norbital order. The hidden state at low effective temperature and sufficiently\nhigh photo-doping is reminiscent of Kugel-Khomskii order in the two-orbital\nHubbard model at $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ filling, but it emerges out of\na nonequilibrium charge ordered state and exhibits a different magnetic\nstructure. A low-energy effective Hamiltonian is used to analyze the exchange\nprocesses which stabilize the nonthermal order.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4GBJVqNc9wKx4N41KjSsTyqpoIE_Row-zGikUmQtsPo","pdfSize":"1404157"}
