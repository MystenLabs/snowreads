By considering an explicitly coupling between an\narbitrary function of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet, G and the Lagrangian density of\nmatter, it is shown that an extra force normal to their four-velocities arises.\nIn this paper, we obtain the extra force and the generalized Raychaudhuri\nequation in F(G) modified theory of gravity in an imperfect fluid for the\nmassive particle by divergence of energy momentum tensor so we earn extra force\nan Raychaudhuri equation in a compared with f(R) modified gravity for perfect\nfluid this conclusion giving the evolution of the kinematical quantities and\ndescribing the relative accelerations of nearby particles .\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
