At high densities and close to\nresonance, we observe a dramatic broadening of the spin noise spectra as well\nas an unexpected extra low-frequency noise component. With the help of a\ntwo-body model and simulations, we show that these features are the hallmark of\na strong, long-range dipole-dipole interaction within the ensemble. The\nadditional low-frequency noise reveals the correlated evolution of pair of\natoms beyond the impact approximation. In this regime, we demonstrate that spin\nnoise can no longer be obtained from one-body dynamics, opening the way for the\ncharacterization of many-body spin noise, atomic entanglement or higher order\nspin correlators in atomic vapors using SNS.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"rKGShaaI8ltm1ZJjcPbjW1zo_nVrRBOXAunbZx7MXig","pdfSize":"817580"}
