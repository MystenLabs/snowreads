Following Kuzmin\nand Vedral (J. Comput. Phys. 487:112153, 2023) and Vedral (arXiv preprint\narXiv:2309.12019), we use WENO shock detectors to determine appropriate amounts\nof low-order artificial viscosity. In contrast to existing WENO methods, our\napproach blends candidate polynomials using residual-based nonlinear weights.\nThe shock-capturing terms of our stabilized Galerkin methods vanish if\nresiduals do. This enables us to achieve improved accuracy compared to weakly\nconsistent alternatives. As we show in the context of steady\nconvection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations, nonlinear local projection\nstabilization terms can be included in a way that preserves the coercivity of\nlocal bilinear forms. For the corresponding Galerkin-WENO discretization of a\nCDR problem, we rigorously derive a priori error estimates. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed method through one- and\ntwo-dimensional numerical experiments for hyperbolic conservation laws and\nsystems thereof. The numerical results for representative test problems are\nsuperior to those obtained with traditional WENO schemes, particularly in\nscenarios involving shocks and steep gradients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
