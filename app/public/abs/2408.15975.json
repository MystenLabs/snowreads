We show that the ring of motivic periods of Mixed Tate motives over\n$\\mathbb{Z}[\\mu_{N},\\frac{1}{N}]$ is spanned by the motivic cyclotomic multiple\nzeta values of level $N$. This implies that the action of the motivic Galois\ngroup of mixed Tate motives over $\\mathbb{Z}[\\mu_{N},\\frac{1}{N}]$ on the\nmotivic fundamental group of $\\mathbb{G}_{m}-\\mu_{N}$ is faithful. This is a\ngeneralization of the known results for $N\\in\\{1,2,3,4,8\\}$ by Deligne and\nBrown. We also discuss cyclotomic multiple zeta values of weight $2$ of other\nlevels.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
