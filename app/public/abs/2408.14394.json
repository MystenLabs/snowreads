In this\nwork, we introduce an analogue of this distance for metric spaces endowed with\ndirected structures. The directed Gromov--Hausdorff distance measures the\ndistance between two new (extended) metric spaces, where the new metric, on the\nsame underlying space, is induced from the length of the zigzag paths. This\ndistance is then computed by isometrically embedding the directed spaces,\nendowed with the zigzag metric, into an ambient directed space with respect to\nsuch zigzag distance. Analogously to the standard Gromov--Hausdorff distance,\nwe propose alternative definitions based on the distortion of d-maps and\nd-correspondences. Unlike the classical case, these directed distances are not\nequivalent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
