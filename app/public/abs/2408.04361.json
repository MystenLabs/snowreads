Here, we present an ultra-bright polarization-entangled photon\nsource based on a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide designed for\npractical quantum communication networks. Using a 780 nm pump laser, the source\nachieves a pair generation rate of 2.4 $\\times 10^{10}$ pairs/s/mW. This work\nhas achieved a directly measured power of 17.9 nW in entangled photon\ngeneration with a 3.2 mW pump power. Based on this, we demonstrate the\npracticality of the source by conducting quantum key distribution experiments\nover long-distance fiber links, achieving the applicable secure key rates of up\nto 440.80 bits/s over 200 km with 62 dB loss and reaching a maximum secure key\ngeneration distance of 404 km. These results demonstrate the potential of\nwavelength-multiplexed polarization-entangled photon sources for high-speed,\nlong-distance quantum communication, positioning them as key components for\nfuture large-scale quantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"u371Yi-bk3fuUPqxP3PqwzyemClXA5NU7VFXmVcWt4M","pdfSize":"3134353"}
