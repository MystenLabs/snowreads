Our study examines how two\nmajor types of viral channels, specifically Direct Messaging (DM) and\nBroadcasting (BC), impact the well-known \"strength of weak ties\" in\ndisseminating novel information across social networks. We conducted a\nlarge-scale empirical analysis, examining the sharing behavior of 500,000 users\nover a two-month period on a major social media platform. Our results suggest a\ngreater capacity for DM to transmit novel information compared to BC, although\nDM typically involves stronger ties. Furthermore, the \"strength of weak ties\"\nis only evident in BC, not in DM where weaker ties do not transmit\nsignificantly more novel information. Our mechanism analysis indicates that the\ncontent selection by both senders and recipients, contingent on tie strength,\ncontributes to the observed differences between these two channels. These\nfindings expand both our understanding of contemporary weak tie theory and our\nknowledge of how to disseminate novel information in social networks.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
