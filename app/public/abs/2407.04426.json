We show\nthat, for small initial data with finite regularity and supported away from the\nnull section, there exist global solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov equations\nwhich weakly converge to an equilibrium of the free transport equation, and\nwhose potential strongly converges to zero, both with exponential speed.\nCentral to our approach are microlocal anisotropic Sobolev spaces, originally\ndeveloped for studying Pollicott-Ruelle resonances, that we further refine to\ndeal with the geometry of the full cotangent bundle, which paves the way to the\nanalysis of nonlinear Vlasov equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
