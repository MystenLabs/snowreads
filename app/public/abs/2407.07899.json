In\nthis paper we address this problem with Spider, a resilient and modular BFT\nreplication architecture for geo-distributed systems that leverages\ncharacteristic features of today's public-cloud infrastructures to minimize\nboth complexity as well as latency. Spider is composed of multiple largely\nindependent replica groups that each are distributed across different\navailability zones of their respective cloud region. This design offers the\npossibility to provide low response times by placing replica groups in close\ngeographic distance to clients, while at the same time enabling intra-group\ncommunication over short-distance links. To handle the interaction between\ngroups that is necessary for strong consistency, Spider uses a novel\nmessage-channel abstraction with first-in-first-out semantics and built-in flow\ncontrol that greatly simplifies system design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
