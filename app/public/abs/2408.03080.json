Similarly to\nthe other cuprates' cases, a gap-like conductivity suppression was observed\nwith reducing the temperature from above $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$, creating a peak in\nthe conductivity spectrum. The conductivity peak energy was insensitive to the\ndoping level, namely $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$, which suggests that this gap is not a\nsuperconducting gap but is related to the pseudogap. Comparing the data of\nvarious mono-, double-, and triple-layer cuprates, we found a clear correlation\nbetween the optimal $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ of each material and the pseudogap-related\nconductivity peak energy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
