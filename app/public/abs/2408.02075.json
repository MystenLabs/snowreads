With its powerful nonlinear modeling\ncapabilities and superior generalization performance, denoising diffusion\nmodels have gradually been applied to medical image segmentation tasks,\nbringing new perspectives and methods to this field. However, existing methods\noverlook the uncertainty of segmentation boundaries and the fuzziness of\nregions, resulting in the instability and inaccuracy of the segmentation\nresults. To solve this problem, a denoising diffusion fusion network based on\nfuzzy learning for 3D medical image segmentation (FDiff-Fusion) is proposed in\nthis paper. By integrating the denoising diffusion model into the classical\nU-Net network, this model can effectively extract rich semantic information\nfrom input medical images, thus providing excellent pixel-level representation\nfor medical image segmentation. ... Finally, to validate the effectiveness of\nFDiff-Fusion, we compare it with existing advanced segmentation networks on the\nBRATS 2020 brain tumor dataset and the BTCV abdominal multi-organ dataset. The\nresults show that FDiff-Fusion significantly improves the Dice scores and HD95\ndistance on these two datasets, demonstrating its superiority in medical image\nsegmentation tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
