We select a\ncase-study sample of 28 type 1 AGN hosted by nearby galaxies from the Galaxy\nAnd Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We perform multi-component spectral\ndecomposition, extract the AGN component and calculate the SMBH mass from the\nbroad H$\\alpha$ emission line width and luminosity. The photometric $g$ and $i$\nband data is decomposed into AGN+spheroid(+disc)(+bar) components with careful\nsurface brightness fitting. From these, the SMBH mass is estimated using its\nrelation with the spheroid S\\'ersic index or effective radius (both used for\nthe first time on ground-based optical imaging of AGN); and the more widely\nused scaling relations based on bulge or galaxy stellar mass. We find no\ncorrelation between the H$\\alpha$-derived SMBH masses and those based on the\nspheroid S\\'ersic index or effective radius, despite these being the most\ndirect methods involving only one scaling relation. The bulge or galaxy stellar\nmass based methods both yield significant correlations, although with\nconsiderable scatter and, in the latter case, a systematic offset. We provide\npossible explanations for this and discuss the requirements, advantages and\ndrawbacks of each method. These considerations will be useful to optimise\nstategies for upcoming high quality ground-based and space-borne sky surveys to\nestimate SMBH masses in large numbers of AGN.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
