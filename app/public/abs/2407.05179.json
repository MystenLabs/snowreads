It is grounded in a Realistic-Enough Philosophy that\nconsists of pursuing the development of the least complex simulation while\nstill ensuring a Satisficing (or good enough) Learning Impact. It also\nintroduces the concept of a Rapid Virtual Simulation Ecosystem as an integrated\nset of technological modules that facilitates the work of health professional\neducators while multiplying educational affordances for learners. Finally, this\nmanuscript presents an argument for technological agility and simplicity as key\nguiding principles for the design of future simulation-based educational\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
