Here we use molecular dynamics simulations and a\ncoarse-grained model of DNA to address the nanopore unzipping of DNA filaments\nthat are knotted. This previously unaddressed problem is motivated by the fact\nthat DNA knots inevitably occur in isolated equilibrated filaments and in vivo.\nWe study how different types of tight knots in the DNA segment just outside the\npore impact unzipping at different driving forces. We establish three main\nresults. First, knots do not significantly affect the unzipping process at low\nforces. However, knotted DNAs unzip more slowly and heterogeneously than\nunknotted ones at high forces. Finally, we observe that the microscopic origin\nof the hindrance typically involves two concurrent causes: the topological\nfriction of the DNA chain sliding along its knotted contour and the additional\nfriction originating from the entanglement with the newly unzipped DNA. The\nresults reveal a previously unsuspected complexity of the interplay of DNA\ntopology and unzipping, which should be relevant for interpreting\nnanopore-based single-molecule unzipping experiments and improving the modeling\nof DNA transactions in vivo.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
