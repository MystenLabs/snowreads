Recently some\ntensor eigenvalue/vector distributions have been computed by expressing them as\npartition functions of zero-dimensional quantum field theories. In this paper,\nusing the method, we compute three cases of complex eigenvalue/vector\ndistributions of symmetric order-three random tensors, where the three cases\ncan be characterized by the Lie-group invariances, $O(N,\\mathbb{R})$,\n$O(N,\\mathbb{C})$, and $U(N,\\mathbb{C})$, respectively. Exact closed-form\nexpressions of the distributions are obtained by computing partition functions\nof four-fermi theories, where the last case is of the \"signed\" distribution\nwhich counts the distribution with a sign factor coming from a Hessian matrix.\nAs an application, we compute the injective norm of the complex symmetric\norder-three random tensor in the large-$N$ limit by computing the edge of the\nlast signed distribution, obtaining agreement with a former numerical result in\nthe literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8-gEBnagxI1h3FiJnnz3v3y_uHbnrTS5FOGVPMd-JkE","pdfSize":"8880003","txDigest":"6Uce6hxRLP3rwFn6N9g3qxsHLuAH25rFqrbAomHYu2xS","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
