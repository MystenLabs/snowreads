The result\napplies in probability theory for random walks as well as in numerical analysis\nfor studying the large time behavior of numerical schemes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
