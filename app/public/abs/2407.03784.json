We\nestablish computable formulas for these backward errors using a class of\nminimization problems involving the Sum of Two generalized Rayleigh Quotients\n(SRQ2). For computational purposes and analysis, we reformulate such\noptimization problems as minimization of a rational function over the joint\nnumerical range of three Hermitian matrices. This reformulation eliminates\ncertain local minimizers of the original SRQ2 minimization and allows for\nconvenient visualization of the solution. Furthermore, by exploiting the\nconvexity within the joint numerical range, we derive a characterization of the\noptimal solution using a Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problem with Eigenvector\ndependency (NEPv). The NEPv characterization enables a more efficient solution\nof the SRQ2 minimization compared to traditional optimization techniques. Our\nnumerical experiments demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of the NEPv\napproach for SRQ2 minimization in computing eigenvalue backward errors of\nRosenbrock systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9I8h5-vqfF1ZxpFpceclqTLXEv7YYv1eyyOewxSWubg","pdfSize":"650086"}
