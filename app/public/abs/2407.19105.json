Tests were\nperformed with both the metallized and insulating sides of the anode facing the\ndrift volume, providing the first evidence of the focusing effect on drift\nelectron trajectories through the PCB holes due to charge accumulation on the\ninsulator surface.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
