The study of these control mechanisms will provide\ninsights into the control of high-dimensional, overactuated systems. The\ncoordination of actuators, known as muscle synergies in neuromechanics, is\nconsidered a presumptive mechanism that simplifies the generation of motor\ncommands. The dynamical structure of a system is the basis of its function,\nallowing us to derive a synergistic representation of actuators. Motivated by\nthis theory, we propose the Dynamical Synergistic Representation (DynSyn)\nalgorithm. DynSyn aims to generate synergistic representations from dynamical\nstructures and perform task-specific, state-dependent adaptation to the\nrepresentations to improve motor control. We demonstrate DynSyn's efficiency\nacross various tasks involving different musculoskeletal models, achieving\nstate-of-the-art sample efficiency and robustness compared to baseline\nalgorithms. DynSyn generates interpretable synergistic representations that\ncapture the essential features of dynamical structures and demonstrates\ngeneralizability across diverse motor tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
