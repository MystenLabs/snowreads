We present Pensieve Discuss, a\nsoftware platform that integrates synchronous editing for scaffolded\nprogramming problems with online human and AI tutors, designed to improve\nstudent collaboration and experience during group tutoring sessions. Our\nsemester-long deployment to 800 students in a CS1 course demonstrated\nconsistently high collaboration rates, positive feedback about the AI tutor's\nhelpfulness and correctness, increased satisfaction with the group tutoring\nexperience, and a substantial increase in question volume. The use of our\nsystem was preferred over an interface lacking AI tutors and synchronous\nediting capabilities. Our experiences suggest that small-group tutoring\nsessions are an important avenue for future research in educational AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XfwCWP2IHE5V7ttahDtPFmW2qP8I9gXqizvyfrIoIHo","pdfSize":"1872885"}
