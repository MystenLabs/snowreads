The proposed\napproach leverages on the non-uniqueness of the inverse source problem\nassociated to the SP-EMS design by decomposing the induced surface current into\npre-image (PI) and null-space (NS) components. Successively, the unknown EMS\nlayout and NS expansion coefficients are determined by means of an alternate\nminimization of a suitable cost function. This latter quantifies the mismatch\nbetween the ideal surface current, which radiates the user-defined target\nfield, and that actually induced on the EMS layout. Results from a\nrepresentative set of numerical experiments, concerned with the design of EMSs\nreflecting pencil-beam as well as contoured target patterns, are reported to\nassess the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method in\nimproving the performance of inexpensive EMS realizations. The measurements on\nan EMS prototype, featuring a conductive ink pattern printed on a standard\npaper substrate, are also shown to prove the reliability of the synthesis\nprocess.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
