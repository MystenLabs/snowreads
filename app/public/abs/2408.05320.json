These are sometimes referred to as equatorial\ntriangulations. We apply these techniques to give purely combinatorial\ndescriptions of previously-unstudied triangulations of Gorensten flow\npolytopes. Further, we prove that the resulting equatorial flow polytope\ntriangulations are usually distinct from the family of triangulations obtained\nby Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy via framings. We find the facet description\nof the reflexive polytope obtained by projecting a Gorenstein flow polytope\nalong a special simplex. Finally, we show that when a partially ordered set is\nstrongly planar, equatorial triangulations of a related flow polytope can be\nused to produce new unimodular triangulations of the corresponding order\npolytope.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
