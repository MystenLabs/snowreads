Since of the difficulties\nrelated to the new partial differential equations, with non constant\ncoefficients and a non divergence-free velocity field, we show the increased\nstability of the rest state by exploring the related Lorenz approximation\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
