Inspired by the fact that the discrete\nFourier transform (DFT) is sampled from the discrete time Fourier transform, a\nfast signal interpolation algorithm based on zero-padding and fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) is presented. This algorithm gives a\ngood approximate of the ideal interpolation, in spite of the windowing effect.\nThe fundamental difference of this algorithm and the ideal sinc interpolation\nis unveiled, and shown to be deeply rooted in the connection of the sinc\nfunction and the Dirichlet function.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
