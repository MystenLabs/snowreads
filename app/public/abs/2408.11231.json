They can be\ncontrolled using low-power actuators to deform the surface profile which is\nthen utilised as a lens or a reflector for beamforming and steering. The\nproposed simulated structural metasurfaces can be used for either beam-steering\nor to generate bespoke contour beams for satellite communication and sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WVIjuCSgwbkPpkmVRzC4vYeOjJvkKcm2IZ9dYNCiNoc","pdfSize":"715146"}
