The recently\ndeveloped SAM 2 has extended this ability to video inputs. This opens an\nopportunity to apply SAM to 3D images, one of the fundamental tasks in the\nmedical imaging field. In this paper, we extensively evaluate SAM 2's ability\nto segment both 2D and 3D medical images by first collecting 21 medical imaging\ndatasets, including surgical videos, common 3D modalities such as computed\ntomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission\ntomography (PET) as well as 2D modalities such as X-ray and ultrasound. Two\nevaluation settings of SAM 2 are considered: (1) multi-frame 3D segmentation,\nwhere prompts are provided to one or multiple slice(s) selected from the\nvolume, and (2) single-frame 2D segmentation, where prompts are provided to\neach slice. The former only applies to videos and 3D modalities, while the\nlatter applies to all datasets. Our results show that SAM 2 exhibits similar\nperformance as SAM under single-frame 2D segmentation, and has variable\nperformance under multi-frame 3D segmentation depending on the choices of\nslices to annotate, the direction of the propagation, the predictions utilized\nduring the propagation, etc. We believe our work enhances the understanding of\nSAM 2's behavior in the medical field and provides directions for future work\nin adapting SAM 2 to this domain.
