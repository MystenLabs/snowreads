Our prior studies have revealed two distinct global wave\nmodes for circumplanetary disks (CPDs) with BLs exhibit opposite behaviors in\nspin modulation.We perform a detailed analysis about the effect of magnetic\nfields on these global modes, highlighting how magnetic resonances and turning\npoints could complicate the wave dynamics. The angular momentum flux becomes\npositive near the BL with increasing magnetic field strength. We also examine\nthe perturbation profile to demonstrate the amplification of magnetic fields\nwithin the BL. The dependence of growth rates on the magnetic field strength,\nand the spin rate are systematically investigated. We find that stronger\nmagnetic fields tend to result in lower terminal spin rates. We stress the\npotential possibility for the formation of angular momentum belts and pressure\nbumps. The implication for the spin evolution and quasi-period oscillations\nobserved in compact objects are also briefly discussed. Our calculations\nadvance the understanding of magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) accretion processes\nand lays a foundation for observational studies and numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
