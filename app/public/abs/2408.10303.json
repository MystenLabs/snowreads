We investigate this phenomenon in the context of a\ngravitational-wave event, specifically when a black hole is settling into its\nfinal state. The deflection angle of photons mimics the ringdown pattern of the\ngravitational wave at intermediate times. At late times it has an inverse cubic\ndependence on observation time. The deviation angle increases exponentially as\nphotons approach the photon ring orbit, reflecting its unstable nature. Our\nfindings are directly applicable to imaging scenarios involving stars against\nthe background of compact binaries, or circumbinary accretion disks,\nparticularly during the merger of two black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
