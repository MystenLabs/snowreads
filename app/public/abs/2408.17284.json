To overcome these issues, we introduce\nDCUDF2, an enhancement over DCUDF--the current state-of-the-art method--for\nextracting zero level sets from UDFs. Our approach utilizes an accuracy-aware\nloss function, enhanced with self-adaptive weights, to improve geometric\nquality significantly. We also propose a topology correction strategy that\nreduces the dependence on hyper-parameter, increasing the robustness of our\nmethod. Furthermore, we develop new operations leveraging self-adaptive weights\nto boost runtime efficiency. Extensive experiments on surface extraction across\ndiverse datasets demonstrate that DCUDF2 outperforms DCUDF and existing methods\nin both geometric fidelity and topological accuracy. We will make the source\ncode publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cFLgIWxhTDc3q8eFOC5r5HhrdgwcIHwp8IouytcW_xQ","pdfSize":"38808309"}
