Combining optical lattices and atom-atom interaction, the\nartificial gauge field can be made density-dependent. In this work, we\ninvestigate a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with spin-orbit coupling,\nwhere a density-dependent gauge field emerges spontaneously in low-energy\nphysics. First, we focus on the two-body quantum walk dynamics and give an\ninterpretation of the phenomena with resonant tunneling. Then, we calculate the\nmean-field phase diagram using the two-site Gutzwiller ansatz. Two types of\nsuperfluid phase and a Mott insulator phase are found. Finally, we discuss the\nexperimental realization protocol with Raman lattices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X5OI-h1wSSj_sG8Twz9aYk2q9F5XK6rO4vMRTTM7meM","pdfSize":"4031017"}
