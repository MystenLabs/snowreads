This misuse\nthreatens the integrity of our digital environment and ethical standards.\nTherefore, understanding the motivations and mechanisms behind LLM-generated\nfake news is crucial. In this study, we analyze the creation of fake news from\na social psychology perspective and develop a comprehensive LLM-based\ntheoretical framework, LLM-Fake Theory. We introduce a novel pipeline that\nautomates the generation of fake news using LLMs, thereby eliminating the need\nfor manual annotation. Utilizing this pipeline, we create a theoretically\ninformed Machine-generated Fake news dataset, MegaFake, derived from the\nGossipCop dataset. We conduct comprehensive analyses to evaluate our MegaFake\ndataset. We believe that our dataset and insights will provide valuable\ncontributions to future research focused on the detection and governance of\nfake news in the era of LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
