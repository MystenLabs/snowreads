The result\ndepends on a structural characterization of such permutations in terms of a new\nnotion of almost-decomposability. In particular, our enumeration verifies half\nof a conjecture of Claesson, Jel\\'inek and Steingr\\'imsson, according to which\n$Av_n^k(1324) \\leq Av_{n+1}^k(1324)$ for all $n$ and $k$. Proving also the\nother half would improve the best known upper bound for the exponential growth\nrate of the number of $1324$-avoiders from $13.5$ to approximately $13.002$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JbcuvRBqkMzYEHcxBcfyg640bOFPo87hTSdLDKsgvjY","pdfSize":"232323"}
