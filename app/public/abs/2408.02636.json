First, we\ndemonstrate that ranging is generally an easier task compared to the\nwell-studied problem of target detection. We then analyze the theoretical\nbounds and advantages of quantum ranging in the context of phase-insensitive\nmeasurements, which is the operational mode of most LiDAR systems.\nAdditionally, we adopt a background noise model more suited to optical\nfrequencies, as opposed to the typical single-mode thermal noise model used in\nquantum target detection theory. Our findings indicate that a significant\nexponential quantum advantage can be achieved using simple photon-counting\nreceivers across a broad range of parameters, thereby validating the efficacy\nof the quantum approach for LiDAR implementations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
