In this work, we contribute to the $T$-count\nreduction problem by proposing efficient $T$-count optimizers with low\nexecution times. In particular, we greatly improve the complexity of TODD, an\nalgorithm currently providing the best $T$-count reduction on various quantum\ncircuits. We also propose some modifications to the algorithm which are leading\nto a significantly lower number of $T$ gates. In addition, we propose another\nalgorithm which has an even lower complexity and that achieves a better or\nequal $T$-count than the state of the art on most quantum circuits evaluated.\nWe also prove that the number of $T$ gates in the circuit obtained after\nexecuting our algorithms on a Hadamard-free circuit composed of $n$ qubits is\nupper bounded by $n(n + 1)/2 + 1$, which is the best known upper bound\nachievable in polynomial time. From this we derive an upper bound of $(n + 1)(n\n+ 2h)/2 + 1$ for the number of $T$ gates in a Clifford$+T$ circuit where $h$ is\nthe number of internal Hadamard gates in the circuit, i.e.\\ the number of\nHadamard gates lying between the first and the last $T$ gate of the circuit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SGhzON9oSV6aSgwQ-rdgwD0VrSepGOYkZ3qC7wKbooM","pdfSize":"1097526","objectId":"0x87d4150e1ef6d28831d104ae4ea3037eccc0489807c264ccb7a1609cf06a9656","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
