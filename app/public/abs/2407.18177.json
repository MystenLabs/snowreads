In this paper, we explore the emergence of thermality in causal\ndiamonds due to the role played by the symmetries of conformal quantum\nmechanics (CQM) as a (0+1)-dimensional conformal field theory, within the de\nAlfaro-Fubini-Furlan model and generalizations. In this context, the hyperbolic\noperator $S$ of the SO(2,1) symmetry of CQM is the generator of the time\nevolution of a diamond observer, and its dynamical behavior leads to the\npredicted thermal nature. Our approach is based on a comprehensive framework of\npath-integral representations of the CQM generators in canonical and\nmicrocanonical forms, supplemented by semiclassical arguments. The properties\nof the operator $S$ are studied with emphasis on an operator duality with the\ncorresponding elliptic operator $R$, using a representation in terms of an\neffective scale-invariant inverse square potential combined with inverted and\nordinary harmonic oscillator potentials.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
