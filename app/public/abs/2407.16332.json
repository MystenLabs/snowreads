It can be harmful to laser-driven inertial\nconfinement fusion because of the reflection of a part of incident laser flux\nand the generation of suprathermal electrons that preheat the fuel. It is\nbelieved that by increasing the laser bandwidth one can suppress the excitation\nof Raman scattering and mitigate its detrimental effects. It is demonstrated in\nthis paper that using a broad bandwidth laser has little effect on stimulated\nRaman scattering in the kinetic inflation regime where Landau damping\ndominates, as the additional bandwidth allows the electron plasma wave to match\na wider range of laser frequencies. As a result, plasma wave saturation and\nRaman backscattering levels remain high even when the laser bandwidth is much\nlarger than the effective instability growth rate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
