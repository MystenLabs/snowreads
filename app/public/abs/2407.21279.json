In this paper, we use random\nforests and convolutional neural networks to identify high-redshift JWST CEERS\ngalaxy mergers. We train these algorithms on simulated $3<z<5$ CEERS galaxies\ncreated from the IllustrisTNG subhalo morphologies and the Santa Cruz SAM\nlightcone. We apply our models to observed CEERS galaxies at $3<z<5$. We find\nthat our models correctly classify $\\sim60-70\\%$ of simulated merging and\nnon-merging galaxies; better performance on the merger class comes at the\nexpense of misclassifying more non-mergers. We could achieve more accurate\nclassifications, as well as test for the dependency on physical parameters such\nas gas fraction, mass ratio, and relative orbits, by curating larger training\nsets. When applied to real CEERS galaxies using visual classifications as\nground truth, the random forests correctly classified $40-60\\%$ of mergers and\nnon-mergers at $3<z<4$, but tended to classify most objects as non-mergers at\n$4<z<5$ (misclassifying $\\sim70\\%$ of visually-classified mergers). On the\nother hand, the CNNs tended to classify most objects as mergers across all\nredshifts (misclassifying $80-90\\%$ of visually-classified non-mergers). We\ninvestigate what features the models find most useful, as well as\ncharacteristics of false positives and false negatives, and also calculate\nmerger rates derived from the identifications made by the models.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y05jCufOjqvUrHxOlMgnoI7dXGMtoWPDHAhKclwsPRI","pdfSize":"4693671"}
