Effective workflow and data management, with\ncorresponding metadata descriptions, helps leverage the full potential of\ndata-driven analyses for computer-aided material design. In this work, we\npropose a research workflow and data management (RWDM) framework to manage\ncomplex workflows and resulting research (meta)data, while following FAIR\nprinciples. Multiphysics multiscale simulations for additive manufacturing\ninvestigations are treated as showcase and implemented on Kadi4Mat: an open\nsource research data infrastructure. The input and output data of the\nsimulations, together with the associated setups and scripts realizing the\nsimulation workflow, are curated in corresponding standardized Kadi4Mat records\nwith extendibility for further research and data-driven analyses. These records\nare interlinked to indicate information flow and form an ontology based\nknowledge graph. Automation scheme for performing high-throughput simulation\nand post-processing integrated with the proposed RWDM framework is also\npresented.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
