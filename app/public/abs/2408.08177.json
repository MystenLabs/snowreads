However, in high-dimensional regimes, naive estimates\nof the principal loadings are not consistent and difficult to interpret. In the\ncontext of time series, principal component analysis of spectral density\nmatrices can provide valuable, parsimonious information about the behavior of\nthe underlying process, particularly if the principal components are\ninterpretable in that they are sparse in coordinates and localized in frequency\nbands. In this paper, we introduce a formulation and consistent estimation\nprocedure for interpretable principal component analysis for high-dimensional\ntime series in the frequency domain. An efficient frequency-sequential\nalgorithm is developed to compute sparse-localized estimates of the\nlow-dimensional principal subspaces of the signal process. The method is\nmotivated by and used to understand neurological mechanisms from high-density\nresting-state EEG in a study of first episode psychosis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
