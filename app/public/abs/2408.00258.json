While recent advances in\nde-raining methods have achieved remarkable performance, the challenge remains\nto produce high-quality and visually pleasing de-rained results. In this paper,\nwe present a reference-guided de-raining filter, a transformer network that\nenhances de-raining results using a reference clean image as guidance. We\nleverage the capabilities of the proposed module to further refine the images\nde-rained by existing methods. We validate our method on three datasets and\nshow that our module can improve the performance of existing prior-based,\nCNN-based, and transformer-based approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
