Assuming sparsity\nof the parameter vector, we examine the statistical behavior of the Lasso\nestimator for the unknown parameter. Our primary contribution is the proof of\nan oracle inequality for the Lasso estimator, which holds on the intersection\nof three specific sets defined for our analysis. We carefully control the\nprobability of these sets, tackling the central challenge of our study. This\napproach allows us to derive error bounds for the $l_1$ and $l_2$ norms,\nassessing the performance of the proposed Lasso estimator. Our results\ndemonstrate that, under certain conditions, the discretization error becomes\nnegligible, enabling us to achieve the same optimal rate of convergence as if\nthe continuous trajectory of the process were observed. We validate our\ntheoretical findings through numerical experiments, which show that the Lasso\nestimator significantly outperforms the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in\nterms of support recovery.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
