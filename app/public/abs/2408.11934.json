Traditional design and\ndeployment of microgrids require significant engineering analysis. Microgrid\nBuilding Blocks (MBB), consisting of modular blocks that integrate seamlessly\nto form effective microgrids, is an enabling concept for faster and broader\nadoption of microgrids. Back-to-Back converter placed at the point of common\ncoupling of microgrid is an integral part of the MBB. This paper presents\napplications of MBB to decouple power quality issues in grid-microgrid network\nserving power quality sensitive loads such as data centers, new grid-edge\ntechnologies such as vehicle-to-grid generation, and serving electric vehicle\ncharging loads during evacuation before disaster events. Simulation results\nshow that MBB effectively decouples the power quality issues across networks\nand helps maintain good power quality in the power quality sensitive network\nbased on the operational scenario.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wPdMF3Rz5S9TECgzeDyvS3uDnlyyEec2_q4B-qN_CbI","pdfSize":"557484"}
