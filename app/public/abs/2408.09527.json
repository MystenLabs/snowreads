In this work, we developed ALS-HAR, a robust wearable light-based\nmotion activity classifier. Although ALS-HAR achieves comparable accuracy to\nother modalities, its natural sensitivity to external disturbances, such as\nchanges in ambient light, weather conditions, or indoor lighting, makes it\nchallenging for daily use. To address such drawbacks, we introduce strategies\nto enhance environment-invariant IMU-based activity classifications through\naugmented multi-modal and contrastive classifications by transferring the\nknowledge extracted from the ALS. Our experiments on a real-world activity\ndataset for three different scenarios demonstrate that while ALS-HAR's accuracy\nstrongly relies on external lighting conditions, cross-modal information can\nstill improve other HAR systems, such as IMU-based classifiers.Even in\nscenarios where ALS performs insufficiently, the additional knowledge enables\nimproved accuracy and macro F1 score by up to 4.2 % and 6.4 %, respectively,\nfor IMU-based classifiers and even surpasses multi-modal sensor fusion models\nin two of our three experiment scenarios. Our research highlights the untapped\npotential of ALS integration in advancing sensor-based HAR technology, paving\nthe way for practical and efficient wearable ALS-based activity recognition\nsystems with potential applications in healthcare, sports monitoring, and smart\nindoor environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NMdZXrZpIUBkY7ixIJwsj6L6PbKaMExUMdZAG4uHGgk","pdfSize":"5260649"}
