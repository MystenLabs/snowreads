This system consists of\ntwo second-order ordinary differential equations for the primal variables and\none first-order ordinary differential equation for the dual variable.By\nutilizing the Lyapunov analysis approach, we obtain the convergence properties\nof the primal-dual gap, the objective function error, the feasibility measure\nand the gradient norm of the objective function along the trajectory. We also\nestablish the strong convergence of the primal trajectory generated by the\ndynamical system towards the minimal norm solution of the separable convex\noptimization problem. Furthermore, we give numerical experiments to illustrate\nthe theoretical results, showing that our dynamical system performs better than\nthose in the literature in terms of convergence rates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
