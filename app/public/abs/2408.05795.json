This field is gaining increasing interest within\nthe robotics community, as it significantly enhances robot's autonomy in\nreal-world applications. Many solutions and formulations exist, but no clear\nstandard representation has emerged. In this paper, we propose a general and\nopen-source framework for modeling and benchmarking TAMP problems. Moreover, we\nintroduce an innovative meta-technique to solve TAMP problems involving moving\nagents and multiple task-state-dependent obstacles. This approach enables using\nany off-the-shelf task planner and motion planner while leveraging a geometric\nanalysis of the motion planner's search space to prune the task planner's\nexploration, enhancing its efficiency. We also show how to specialize this\nmeta-engine for the case of an incremental SMT-based planner. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach across benchmark problems of increasing\ncomplexity, where robots must navigate environments with movable obstacles.\nFinally, we integrate state-of-the-art TAMP algorithms into our framework and\ncompare their performance with our achievements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KU_wE9aUmFwVjZCXgPWehaV6IU1Xw_tL9Bd5kUNxM9o","pdfSize":"817991"}
