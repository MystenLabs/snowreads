We start from the mind\nand discuss the need to better understand how spatial cognition shapes mobility\npatterns. We then move to societies and argue the importance of better\nunderstanding new forms of transportation. We conclude by discussing how\nalgorithms shape mobility behaviour and provide useful tools for modellers.\nFinally, we discuss how progress in these research directions may help us\naddress some of the challenges our society faces today.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
