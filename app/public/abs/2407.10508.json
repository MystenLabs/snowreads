In our study, we explore harmonic analysis on locally\ncompact Spector-Vilenkin groups establishing the $R$-boundedness of a family of\nconvolution operators. Our results enhance the understanding of functional\ncalculi of operators acting on $L^p$-spaces associated to totally disconnected\nspaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the fundamental\nevolution equations associated to the Taibleson operator, relevant in various\nphysical models.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
