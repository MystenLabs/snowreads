We obtain an upper limit of 2% (99%\nconfidence level) on the polarization degree in the 2--8 keV energy band. We\ndetect four type-I X-ray bursts, two of which during the IXPE observation. This\nis the first time that has IXPE observed type-I X-ray bursts, and it allows us\nto place an upper limit on their polarization degree; however, due to the\nlimited total number of counts in each burst, we obtain a relatively high upper\nlimit (80%). We confirm the presence of reflection features in the X-ray\nspectrum, notably a broad iron line. Fitting the data with a relativistic\nreflection model, we derive a disk inclination of 25 deg. The spectral and\npolarization properties are comparable with other atolls observed by IXPE,\nsuggesting a similar accretion geometry, and the relatively low polarization is\nconsistent with the low inclination.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
