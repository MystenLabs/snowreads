Population vulnerability to\nnatural hazards and limited natural resources are deemed problematic,\nparticularly on small tropical islands. Lifestyles and activities are heavily\nreliant on energy consumption. The relationship between climatic variations and\nenergy consumption must be clearly understood. We demonstrate that it is\npossible to determine the impact of climate change on energy consumption. In\nsmall tropical islands, the relationship between climate and energy consumption\nis primarily driven by air conditioner electricity consumption during hotter\nmonths. Temperatures above 26{\\deg}C correlate with increased electricity\nconsumption. Energy consumption is sensitive to: (1) climatic seasonal\nfluctuations, (2) cyclonic activity, (3) temperature warming over the last 20\nyears. On small tropical islands, demographic and wealth variations also have a\nsignificant impact on energy consumption. The relationship between climate and\nenergy consumption suggests reconsidering the production and consumption of\ncarbon-based energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"KrfNoPHMxyJa6_e_uaBymwyseejwTskmP3pM0bdrMFY","pdfSize":"1571203"}
