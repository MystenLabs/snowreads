We are interested in such\na mechanism that is strategyproof (where agents' best strategy is to report\ntheir true preferences) and is expected to ensure fairness and efficiency to a\ncertain degree. We first present an impossibility result that a deterministic\nmechanism does not exist that is strategyproof, fair and efficient for\nallocating indivisible chores. We then utilize randomness to overcome the\nstrong impossibility. For allocating indivisible chores, we propose a\nrandomized mechanism that is strategyproof in expectation as well as ex-ante\nand ex-post (best of both worlds) fair and efficient. For allocating mixed\nitems, where an item can be a good (i.e., with a positive utility) for one\nagent but a chore (i.e., a with negative utility) for another, we propose a\nrandomized mechanism that is strategyproof in expectation with best of both\nworlds fairness and efficiency when there are two agents.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
