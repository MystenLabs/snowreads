However, direct\ntransfer of spin angular momentum to an antiferromagnetic insulator at\npicosecond time scales remains to be demonstrated. Here, studying the ultrafast\nbehaviour of ferromagnetic metal/antiferromagnetic insulator bilayers, we\nevidence the generation of coherent excitations in the antiferromagnet combined\nwith a modulation of the demagnetization behavior of the ferromagnet. This\nconfirms that magnetic information can indeed be propagated into\nantiferromagnetic spin waves at picosecond timescales, thereby opening an\navenue towards ultrafast manipulation of magnetic information.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
