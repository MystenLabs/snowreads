When the objects are categories and the\ndomain of the pseudofunctor is small and filtered it has been known since\nExppose 6 in SGA4 that the pseudocolimit can be computed by taking the\nGrothendieck construction of the pseudofunctor and inverting the class of\ncartesian arrows with respect to the canonical fibration. This paper is a\nreformatted version of a MSc thesis submitted and defended at Dalhousie\nUniversity in August 2022. The first part presents a set of conditions for\ndefining an internal category of elements of a diagram of internal categories\nand proves it is the oplax colimit. The second part presents a set of\nconditions on an ambient category and an internal category with an object of\nweak-equivalences that allows an internal description of the axioms for a\ncategory of (right) fractions and a definition of the internal category of\n(right) fractions when all the conditions and axioms are satisfied. These are\ncombined to present a suitable context for computing the pseudocolimit of a\nsmall filtered diagram of internal categories.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JrMrjUh8Cpmns9uXih9NVJvnbHBFDaA5v1QpUV523n4","pdfSize":"1461951"}
