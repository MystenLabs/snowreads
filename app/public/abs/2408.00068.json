The main parameters of the\nmodified distribution are the average energy and variance of the excitation\nenergy of the electron shell. We derive an expression for the variance taking\ninto account exchange effects and make numerical estimates of the average\nexcitation energy and variance based on the non-relativistic\nRoothaan-Hartree-Fock method and the relativistic Dirac-Hartree-Fock method\nimplemented in the General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package (Grasp2018).\nEstimates are made for eleven isotopes, two-neutrino double-$\\beta$ decay of\nwhich is observed experimentally. The results are determined by the first two\nnegative moments of the electron radii in the parent atom. The values obtained\nfor change in the peak shape can be used to parameterize the energy\ndistribution of $\\beta$ electrons, taking into account the excitation of the\nelectron shell of the daughter atom.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
