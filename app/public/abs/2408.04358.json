This has attracted the\nattention of the communication field, where most existing work mainly focused\non optimizing communication performance (i.e., delay) and ignored the\nperformance of the task (i.e., tracking accuracy). To explore the effectiveness\nof communication in completing a task, in this letter, we propose a\ngoal-oriented communication framework adopting a deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) algorithm with a proactive repetition scheme (DeepP) to optimize C&C data\nselection and the maximum number of repetitions in a real-time target tracking\ntask, where a base station (BS) controls a UAV to track a mobile target. The\neffectiveness of our proposed approach is validated by comparing it with the\ntraditional proportional integral derivative (PID) algorithm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aFmLNk2rcaH2U6kCdYsjeK0B6WGE7nJjEoSyhm34K9k","pdfSize":"617816"}
