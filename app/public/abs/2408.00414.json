The balance equations for the 29\nscalar fields are obtained from a transfer equation derived from the Enskog\nequation where the kinetic and potential parts of the new moments of the\ndistribution function and production terms are calculated from Grad's\ndistribution function for the basic fields. The transition from the 29 field\ntheory to an eight field theory -- with mass density, hydrodynamic velocity,\nabsolute temperature and hydrodynamic angular velocity -- leads to the\ndetermination of the transport coefficients of the Navier-Stokes and Fourier\nlaws. The transport coefficients are functions of the normal and tangential\nrestitution coefficients and of the local equilibrium radial distribution\nfunction. The transport coefficients in the limiting case of elastic rough\nspheres is also determined.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
