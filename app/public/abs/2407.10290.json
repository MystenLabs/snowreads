The new wafer-scale packaging and\nhigh-speed wireline technologies provide high-density, low-latency, and\nhigh-bandwidth connectivity, thus promising to support direct-connected\nhigh-radix interconnection architecture.\n  In this paper, we propose a wafer-based interconnection architecture called\nSwitch-Less-Dragonfly-on-Wafers. By utilizing distributed high-bandwidth\nnetworks-on-chip-on-wafer, costly high-radix switches of the Dragonfly topology\nare eliminated while increasing the injection/local throughput and maintaining\nthe global throughput. Based on the proposed architecture, we also introduce\nbaseline and improved deadlock-free minimal/non-minimal routing algorithms with\nonly one additional virtual channel. Extensive evaluations show that the\nSwitch-Less-Dragonfly-on-Wafers outperforms the traditional switch-based\nDragonfly in both cost and performance. Similar approaches can be applied to\nother switch-based direct topologies, thus promising to power future\nlarge-scale supercomputers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
