Our method is based on piecewise linear\napproximations of the eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator via a\nfinite element framework for discretization and iterative mesh schemes. One key\nelement in our approach is obtaining bounds for the derivatives of these\neigenfunctions, which, besides being essential for the implementation of our\nmethod, are of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
