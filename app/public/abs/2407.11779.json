We consider a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor factorization\nof a general backflow transformation in second quantization for a simple,\ncompact and systematically improvable Fermionic state. This directly encodes\n$N$-body correlations without the ordering dependence of other tensor\ndecompositions. We consider and explicitly demonstrate various controllable\ntruncations, in the rank and range of the backflow correlations or magnitude of\nlocal energy contributions, in order to systematically affect scaling\nreductions to $\\mathcal{O}[N^{3-4}]$. Benchmarking against small Fermi-Hubbard\nand chemical systems reveals an improvement over other NQS-like models, while\nextending towards larger strongly correlated ab initio systems demonstrates\ncompetitive accuracy with more established DMRG techniques on ab initio 2D\nhydrogenic lattices with realistic long-range Coulomb interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
