It was\nshown that an electric voltage of 100 V corresponding to an electric field of E\n~0.3 kV/mm applied to the walls of the piezoelectric component PZT of the\nMnAs/PZT composite contributes to an increase in the maximum adiabatic\ntemperature change by 0.2 K in the temperature range of the magnetostructural\nphase transition of MnAs ~317 K at magnetic field change of 1.8 T. Calculations\nusing the finite element method have shown that an electric field voltage of\n100 V is capable of creating a quasi-isostatic mechanical stress in the region\ninside a cylindrical PZT tube of ~3 MPa. Moreover, in the region of weak\npressures up to 10 MPa, the contribution to the MCE from piezo compression\nlinearly depends on the electrical voltage that can be used for control the MCE\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
