A key bottleneck in semantic type detection is the availability of\nhuman annotation due to the inherent complexity of data lakes. In this paper,\nwe propose using programmatic weak supervision to assist in annotating the\ntraining data for semantic type detection by leveraging labeling functions. One\nchallenge in this process is the difficulty of manually writing labeling\nfunctions due to the large volume and low quality of the data lake table\ndatasets. To address this issue, we explore employing Large Language Models\n(LLMs) for labeling function generation and introduce several prompt\nengineering strategies for this purpose. We conduct experiments on real-world\nweb table datasets. Based on the initial results, we perform extensive analysis\nand provide empirical insights and future directions for researchers in this\nfield.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"t3V2zeIj4srt2V5UdmGBlm8YyCCTyE9XBWdgCm2e0mY","pdfSize":"661835"}
