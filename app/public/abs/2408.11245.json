Irradiation exposures are\nperformed using 40 MeV/u $^{78}$Kr and 10 MeV/u $^4$He particle beams at the\nTexas A&M University Cyclotron Institute. The results show a strong sensitivity\nto high-Z heavy ions, and medium sensitivity to low-Z heavy ions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
