In this work, we introduce\nan approach called `LGGD' (Learned Generalized Geodesic Distances). This method\ninvolves generating node features by learning a generalized geodesic distance\nfunction through a training pipeline that incorporates training data, graph\ntopology and the node content features. The strength of this method lies in the\nproven robustness of the generalized geodesic distances to noise and outliers.\nOur contributions encompass improved performance in node classification tasks,\ncompetitive results with state-of-the-art methods on real-world graph datasets,\nthe demonstration of the learnability of parameters within the generalized\ngeodesic equation on graph, and dynamic inclusion of new labels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7lwB67OK1A4KvCFlzRfSJMKtRFTsQ-NGeARl33PyVsU","pdfSize":"2114610"}
