Breen,\nRiasanovsky, Tait and Urschel recently determined the graph on $n$ vertices\nwith maximum spread for sufficiently large $n$. In this paper, we study a\nrelated question of maximizing the difference $\\lambda_{i+1} - \\lambda_{n-j}$\nfor a given pair $(i, j)$ over all graphs on $n$ vertices. We give upper bounds\nfor all pairs $(i, j)$, exhibit an infinite family of pairs where the bound is\ntight, and show that for the pair $(1, 0)$ the extremal example is unique.\nThese results contribute to a line of inquiry pioneered by Nikiforov aiming to\nmaximize different linear combinations of eigenvalues over all graphs on $n$\nvertices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
