Connect each point\n$x\\in\\eta$ with its radial nearest neighbour, which is the hyperbolically\nnearest vertex to $x$ that is closer to $o$ than $x$. This construction gives\nrise to the hyperbolic radial spanning tree, whose geometric properties are in\nthe focus of this paper. In particular, the degree of the origin is studied.\nFor increasing balls around $o$ as observation windows, expectation and\nvariance asymptotics as well as a quantitative central limit theorem for a\nclass of edge-length functionals are derived. The results are contrasted with\nthose for the Euclidean radial spanning tree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
