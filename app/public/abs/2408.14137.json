The\npreviously introduced Augmented Reality Workflow Modeling Language (ARWFML)\nenables the model-based creation of augmented reality scenarios without\nprogramming knowledge. Building upon the first design cycle of the language's\nspecification, this paper presents two further design iterations for refining\nthe language based on multi-faceted evaluations. These include a comparative\nevaluation of implementation options and workflow capabilities, the\nintroduction of a 3D notation, and the development of a new 3D modeling\nenvironment. On this basis, a comprehensibility study of the language was\nconducted. Thereby, we show how modeling languages for augmented reality can be\nevolved towards a maturity level suitable for empirical evaluations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LEm8LDdvF2QhZQt7AumpM2AJOFenq5YsHHFSWsrKPWk","pdfSize":"1391007"}
