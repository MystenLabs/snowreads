However, the\ndeployment of strain-engineered nanocatalysts faces challenges, particularly in\nmaintaining highly strained nanocrystals under reaction conditions. Here, we\nintroduce a morphology-dependent effect that stabilizes surface strain even\nunder harsh reaction conditions. Employing four-dimensional scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), we discovered that core-shell Au@Pd\nnanoparticles with sharp-edged morphologies sustain coherent heteroepitaxial\ninterfaces with designated surface strain. This configuration inhibits\ndislocation due to reduced shear stress at corners, as molecular dynamics\nsimulations indicate. Demonstrated in a Suzuki-type cross-coupling reaction,\nour approach achieves a fourfold increase in activity over conventional\nnanocatalysts, owing to the enhanced stability of surface strain. These\nfindings contribute to advancing the development of advanced nanocatalysts and\nindicate broader applications for strain engineering in various fields.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PMFfTHzM8s8Y1eZmwtqMe_PV8dSdeIBYDkcdNHusRnU","pdfSize":"4118697"}
