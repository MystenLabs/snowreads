How to cover massive\nIoT devices (IDs), which require diverse quality-of-service (QoS), is a crucial\nchallenge. For UAV-assisted IoT, this paper studies the deployment scheme with\nQoS guarantee to place multiple UAVs for covering all ground IDs and maximizing\nthe average data rate of UAVs. First, for the ground ID, we propose the QoS\ndemand based power allocation (QDPA) algorithm to solve the diversity of QoS\nwith respect to data rate demand. Then, the data rate maximization placement\n(DRMP) algorithm is proposed to optimize the placement of single UAV. Finally,\nbased on QDPA and DRMP algorithms, we propose the joint power allocation and\nplacement (JPAP) scheme with QoS guarantee, which can cover massive IDs, to\ndeploy multiple UAVs for maximizing the average UAV data rate. Simulation\nexperiments are conducted to verify the superiority of our proposed JPAP\nscheme, which can minimize the UAV number and maximize the average data rate of\nUAVs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
