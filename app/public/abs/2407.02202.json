A class of reduced-order\nmodels are generated by the projection framework based on graph clustering,\nwhich not only preserve the network structure but also ensure absolute\nstability. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound on the input-output\napproximation error between the original and reduced-order Lur'e network\nsystems, which is expressed as a function of the characteristic matrix of graph\nclustering. Finally, the results are illustrated via a numerical example.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
