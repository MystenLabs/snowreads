By fabricating functionally graded materials (FGMs) that\nincorporate additional elements like Ni in the transition region between these\nterminal alloy classes, the hot cracking can be reduced. In the present work,\nthe joining of stainless steel 316L (SS316L) and Monel400 by modifying the Ni\nconcentration in the gradient region was studied. A new hot cracking criterion\nbased on hybrid Scheil-equilibrium approach was developed and validated with\nmonolithic multi-layer samples within the SS316L-Ni-Monel400 three-alloy system\nand an SS316L to 55/45 wt% SS316L/Ni to Monel400 FGM sample fabricated by\ndirect energy deposition (DED) process. The new hot cracking criterion, based\non the hybrid Scheil-equilibrium approach, is expected to help design FGM paths\nbetween other Fe-alloys and Cu-containing alloys as well.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
