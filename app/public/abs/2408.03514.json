We show that the associated\nFourier extension operator maps $L^2$ to $L^{r}$ for $r > \\frac{24}{7} \\approx\n3.428$. Previously this was known (in the case of prime order fields) for $r >\n\\frac{188}{53} \\approx 3.547$. In contrast with much of the recent progress on\nthis problem, our argument does not use state-of-the-art incidence estimates\nbut rather proceeds by obtaining estimates on a related bilinear operator.\nThese estimates are based on a geometric result that, roughly speaking, states\nthat a set of points in the finite plane $F^2$ can be decomposed as a union of\nsets each of which either contains a controlled number of rectangles or a\ncontrolled number of trapezoids.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
