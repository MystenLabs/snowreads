It effectively compensates for the phase\nvelocity mismatch between optical harmonics by introducing a periodic spatial\nmodulation to the nonlinear optical medium. Such a mechanism has been further\ngeneralized to the spatiotemporal domain, where a non-stationary spatial QPM\ncan induce a frequency shift of the generated light. Here we demonstrate how a\nspatiotemporal QPM grating, consisting in a concurrent spatial and temporal\nmodulation of the nonlinear response, naturally emerges through all-optical\npoling in silicon nitride microresonators. Mediated by the coherent\nphotogalvanic effect, a traveling space-charge grating is self-organized,\naffecting momentum and energy conservation, resulting in a quasi-phase-matched\nand Doppler-shifted second harmonic. Our observation of the photoinduced\nspatiotemporal QPM expands the scope of phase matching conditions in nonlinear\nphotonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
