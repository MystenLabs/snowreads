We use Gaia data to place constraints\non the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with\nmeasured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting\nfrom 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia.\nAlthough limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection\nexperiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark\nmatter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the\nentire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of\nthe TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the\neffects of dark matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
