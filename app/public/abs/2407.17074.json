In this case,\nperturbations in the inflaton field and in a thermal plasma coexist from a\ngiven moment onwards. We derive a gauge-invariant set of three coupled\nequations governing the time evolution of such a system. Despite singular\ncoefficients, a reliable numerical solution can be obtained for a long time\nperiod, starting from phase oscillations inside the Hubble horizon, and\nextending until acoustic oscillations in a radiation-dominated universe.\nBenchmarks are illustrated from a ``weak regime'', where perturbations have a\nquantum-mechanical origin but get dissipated by interactions with the plasma.\nAmong applications of our formalism could be inhomogeneity-induced nucleations\nin post-inflationary phase transitions, and the production of scalar-induced\ngravitational waves.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
