This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent and\nanticipated Earth-Moon missions, and ongoing space domain awareness\ninitiatives. An introduction to the dynamics as well as periodic trajectories\nin the Cislunar realm is presented. Then, a review of modern Cislunar programs\nas well as smaller missions are compiled to provide insights into the key\nplayers pushing towards the Moon. Trends of Cislunar missions and practices are\nidentified, including the identification of regions of interest, such as the\nSouth Pole and the Near-rectilinear halo orbit. Finally, a review of the\ncurrent state and short-comings of space domain awareness (SDA) in the region\nis included, utilizing the regions of interest as focal points for required\nimprovement. The SDA review is completed through the analysis of the Artemis 1\ntrajectory.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DtPdnDNB55IfwPDTt77yD9vz0ueR4yEYvsxbEfGS5IQ","pdfSize":"2621620"}
