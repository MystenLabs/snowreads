However, it is crucial to recognize that the quality of various cells\nwithin a single data point can vary greatly in practice. For example, even in\nthe case of an abnormal data point, not all cells are necessarily noisy. The\nsingle scalar valuation assigned by existing methods blurs the distinction\nbetween noisy and clean cells of a data point, thereby compromising the\ninterpretability of the valuation. In this paper, we propose 2D-OOB, an\nout-of-bag estimation framework for jointly determining helpful (or\ndetrimental) samples, as well as the particular cells that drive them. Our\ncomprehensive experiments demonstrate that 2D-OOB achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple use cases, while being exponentially faster. 2D-OOB\nexcels in detecting and rectifying fine-grained outliers at the cell level, as\nwell as localizing backdoor triggers in data poisoning attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
