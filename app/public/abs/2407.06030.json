Outgoing proton\nyields and momenta were analyzed by the Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph in\nconjunction with the CeBrA demonstrator located at the John D. Fox Laboratory\nat Florida State University. Angular distributions were compared with Distorted\nWave Born Approximation calculations in order to extract single-neutron\nspectroscopic overlaps.\n  Results: Spectroscopic overlaps and strengths were determined for states in\n$^{35}$S up through 6 MeV in excitation energy. Each orbital was observed to\nhave fragmented strength where a single level carried the majority. The\nsingle-neutron centroids of the $0f_{7/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, $1p_{1/2}$ and\n$0f_{5/2}$ orbitals were determined to be $2360^{+90}_{-40}$ keV,\n$3280^{+80}_{-50}$ keV, $4780^{+60}_{-40}$ keV, and $\\gtrsim7500$ keV,\nrespectively.\n  Conclusion: A previous discrepancy in the literature with respect to\ndistribution of the neutron $1p_{1/2}$ strength was resolved. The integration\nof the normalized spectroscopic strengths, up to 5.1 MeV in excitation energy,\nrevealed fully-vacant occupancies for the $0f_{7/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, and\n$1p_{1/2}$ orbitals, as expected. The spacing in the single-neutron energies\nhighlighted a reduction in the traditional $N=28$ shell-gap, relative to both\nthe $1p$ spin-orbit energy difference ($N=32$) and the lower limit on the\n$N=34$ shell spacing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
