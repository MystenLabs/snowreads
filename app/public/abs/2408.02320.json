In this work, we develop non-asymptotic convergence theory\nfor a popular diffusion-based sampler (i.e., the probability flow ODE sampler)\nin discrete time, assuming access to $\\ell_2$-accurate estimates of the (Stein)\nscore functions. For distributions in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, we prove that\n$d/\\varepsilon$ iterations -- modulo some logarithmic and lower-order terms --\nare sufficient to approximate the target distribution to within $\\varepsilon$\ntotal-variation distance. This is the first result establishing nearly linear\ndimension-dependency (in $d$) for the probability flow ODE sampler. Imposing\nonly minimal assumptions on the target data distribution (e.g., no smoothness\nassumption is imposed), our results also characterize how $\\ell_2$ score\nestimation errors affect the quality of the data generation processes. In\ncontrast to prior works, our theory is developed based on an elementary yet\nversatile non-asymptotic approach without the need of resorting to SDE and ODE\ntoolboxes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X4bYNxu3YppHt7bDERMWV2y7u7y3mgc1ApoiFqSKa84","pdfSize":"729319","txDigest":"7STdSj3JVpgvNMoQt48L1g2n7DJ6pgs9Grqoy77MZ4XJ","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
