The problem that is addressed is of importance in the teaching of\nsocial sciences since it discusses one of the solutions proposed almost\nunanimously to solve the problem of multicollinearity. For a better\nunderstanding and illustration of the contribution of this paper, two empirical\nexamples are presented and not highly technical developments are used.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LtKd3bsyv4Zd-g6p0cc8p2ZI98vvySzFYkIKOvWd4fk","pdfSize":"178477"}
