Automating query resolution\ncan alleviate the burden on traditional call centers, providing farmers with\nimmediate and contextually relevant information. The integration of Agriculture\nand Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a transformative opportunity to empower\nfarmers and bridge information gaps. Language models like transformers, the\nrising stars of AI, possess remarkable language understanding capabilities,\nmaking them ideal for addressing information gaps in agriculture. This work\nexplores and demonstrates the transformative potential of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) in automating query resolution for agricultural farmers, leveraging\ntheir expertise in deciphering natural language and understanding context.\nUsing a subset of a vast dataset of real-world farmer queries collected in\nIndia, our study focuses on approximately 4 million queries from the state of\nTamil Nadu, spanning various sectors, seasonal crops, and query types.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
