Working on the phase space level for finite regions,\nwe pay close attention to the corner piece of the generators, discuss various\npossible charge brackets, relative definitions of the charges, coupling to\nspinors and relations to other charges. What emerges is a picture of the\nsymmetries and edge modes of gravity that bears local resemblance to a Poincare\ngroup $SO(1,3)\\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, but possesses structure functions. In\nparticular, we argue that the symmetries and charges presented here are more\namenable to discretisation, and sketch a strategy for this charge algebra,\ngeared toward quantum gravity applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
