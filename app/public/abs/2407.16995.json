Based on the grid-based particle method (GBPM) [18], the method can\nnaturally resample the surface even under large deformation from the motion\nlaw. We introduce a new component in the local reconstruction step of the\nalgorithm and demonstrate numerically that the modification can improve\ncomputational accuracy when a large curvature region is developed during\nevolution. The method also incorporates a recently developed constrained\nleast-squares ghost sample points (CLS-GSP) formulation, which can lead to a\nbetter-conditioned discretized matrix for computing some surface differential\noperators. The proposed framework can incorporate many methods and link various\napproaches to the same problem. Several numerical experiments are carried out\nto show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5CMOma5tMTY9pBlKkkWs-Yh2kUwyDbbxdcLo4vbt3DE","pdfSize":"3520481","objectId":"0x99b4612f4d6f85526427497b57b3905e0512f8b3f1771a24edad3b42ad4916fb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
