The matter and radiation perfect\nfluids are modeled using the Sorkin-Schutz formalism. We identify scaling\nregimes of the field during both the radiation and matter eras. Additionally,\nwe discovered a field-dominated scaling attractor; however, it does not exhibit\naccelerated expansion, making it unsuitable for describing dark energy.\nNevertheless, we find two attractor solutions that do exhibit accelerated\nexpansion: one is a quintessence-like fixed point, and the other is a de Sitter\nfixed point.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
