The excess energy, the Loschmidt echo, and\nthe density imbalance are analyzed using bosonization and exact\ndiagonalization. The energy becomes complex valued, despite the instantaneous\nHamiltonian having the same real spectrum throughout. The adiabatic limit is\napproached very slowly through damped oscillations. The decay scales with\n$\\tau^{-1}$ with $\\tau$ the ramp duration, while the oscillation period is\n$2L/v$ with $v$ the Fermi velocity and $L$ the system length. Yet, without the\nneed for auxiliary controls, a shortcut to adiabaticity is found for ramp times\ncommensurate with the period. Our work highlights the intricate interplay of\nadiabaticity and non-Hermitian many-body physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
