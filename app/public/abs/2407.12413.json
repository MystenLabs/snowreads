We employ both\n$\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ and on-shell renormalisation for the quark masses and\nprovide a thorough comparison. Furthermore, we explore alternative treatments\nof quark masses, in particular in the four-flavour scheme, and investigate\ntheir impact on the cross section. Our work also presents novel predictions for\ndifferential cross sections in the Higgs rapidity. The results lead to a\nsignificant reduction of scale uncertainties, and our analysis enables us to\noffer well-grounded recommendations for future research in this area.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BMIEHwr9LFgs-Sw5KJmesHfqNKvVD0q_LJzAXAOeTpg","pdfSize":"765801"}
