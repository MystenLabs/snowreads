The\ndissipation of tidally excited gravity waves alter their rotational evolution\nthroughout the sdB lifetime. While many sdB binaries have well-measured\nrotational and orbital frequencies, there have been few theoretical efforts to\naccurately calculate the tidal torque produced by gravity waves. In this work,\nwe directly calculate the tidal excitation of internal gravity waves in\nrealistic sdB stellar models, and integrate the coupled spin-orbit evolution of\nsdB binaries. We find that for canonical sdB ($M_\\mathrm{sdB}=0.47\\,M_\\odot$)\nbinaries, the transitional orbital period below which they could reach tidal\nsynchronization in the sdB lifetime is $\\sim \\! 0.2\\;\\mathrm{days}$, with weak\ndependence on the companion masses. For low-mass sdBs\n($M_\\mathrm{sdB}=0.37\\,M_\\odot$) formed from more massive progenitor stars, the\ntransitional orbital period becomes $\\sim \\! 0.15\\;\\mathrm{days}$. These values\nare very similar to the tidal synchronization boundary ($\\sim \\!\n0.2\\;\\mathrm{days}$) evident from observations. We discuss the dependence of\ntidal torques on stellar radii, and we make predictions for the rapidly\nrotating white dwarfs formed from synchronized sdB binaries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
