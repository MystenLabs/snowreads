The renormalized loop\ncorrections are finite, independent of regularization and perturbatively\nexpandable. They are suppressed as powers of the external momentum to the mass\n(of the field in the loop) ratio, according to the Appelquist-Carazzone\ndecoupling theorem which we complete for the case of the scalar mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
