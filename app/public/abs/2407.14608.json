This is largely unexplored in the context of non-linear\nHiggs physics, which is naturally described in Higgs Effective Field Theory\n(HEFT). Relevant new higher-dimensional operators modify the production rate\nand branching ratios of the Higgs boson, de-correlating different Higgs\nmultiplicities. In this work, we consider single Higgs and Higgs pair\nproduction via weak boson fusion from the perspective of gauge-Higgs CP\nviolation through the lens of Higgs non-linearity. This generalizes existing\nrate-based searches and analyses by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Particular\nfocus is given to the phenomenological differences in the expected BSM\nsensitivity pattern when comparing HEFT constraints with Standard Model\nEffective Field Theory (SMEFT) limits.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
