This paper\nexplores the innovative applications of generative AI in enhancing\ncommunication protocols, optimizing traffic management, and bolstering security\nframeworks within vehicular networks. By examining current technologies and\nrecent advancements, we identify key challenges such as scalability, real-time\ndata processing, and security vulnerabilities that come with AI integration.\nAdditionally, we propose novel applications and methodologies that leverage\ngenerative AI to simulate complex network scenarios, generate adaptive\ncommunication schemes, and enhance predictive capabilities for traffic\nconditions. This study not only reviews the state of the art but also\nhighlights significant opportunities where generative AI can lead to\ngroundbreaking improvements in vehicular network efficiency and safety. Through\nthis comprehensive exploration, our findings aim to guide future research\ndirections and foster a deeper understanding of generative AI's role in the\nnext generation of vehicular technologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
