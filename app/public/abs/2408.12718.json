M. Moutuou in \\cite{Elhamdadi}. We establish a correspondence\nbetween the irreducible strong representations of a finite and connected rack\nwith the irreducible representation of its finite enveloping group which allows\nto use techniques of the latter topic in the other setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
