A necessary and sufficient condition for the\nKoszul dual algebra $A^{!}$ to be an $H$-module algebra is given. Then we\nprovide all the PBW-deformations of the smash product algebra $A^! \\# H_{2n^2}$\nfor a given $H_{2n^2}$-module algebra $A$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
