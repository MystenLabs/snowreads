This effect provides a unique probe of the\ntransverse components of the peculiar velocity field, but has not yet been\ndetected due to its small size. We implement and validate a stacking estimator\nfor the moving lens signal using a galaxy catalog as a tracer of massive haloes\ncombined with reconstructed velocities from the galaxy number density field.\nUsing simulations, we forecast detection prospects for the moving lens signal\nfrom current and upcoming microwave background and galaxy surveys. We\ndemonstrate a new foreground mitigation strategy sufficient for current data\nsets, and discuss various sources of systematic error and noise. Upcoming\ngalaxy surveys will provide high-significance statistical detections of the\nmoving lens effect.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
