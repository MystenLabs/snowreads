In this article in particular we focus on\nprinciples encapsulating the existence of large families of objects that are in\nsome sense mutually independent. More precisely, we study the principle MAD\nstating that a maximal family of pairwise almost disjoint sets exists; and the\nprinciple MED expressing the existence of a maximal family of functions that\nare pairwise eventually different. We investigate characterisations of and\nrelations between these principles and some of their variants. It will turn out\nthat induction strength is an essential parameter in this context.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
