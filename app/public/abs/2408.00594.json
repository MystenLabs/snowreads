We find that the capturing enhanced for the positive\nvelocity and momentum transfer dependent DM-nucleon scattering in comparison\nwith the constant cross-section case. Further, a large capture of the DM\nparticles can be thermalized and lead to black hole formation and, therefore,\ndestroy the neutron star. Using the observation of the old neutron star in the\nDM-dominated region, we obtain strong constraints on massive DM parameters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
