While the theory is well understood, we are the\nfirst to study the whole cap-and-trade mechanism as a financial market.\nAnalyzing the universe of transactions in 2005-2020 (more than one million\nrecords of granular transaction data), we show that this market features\nsignificant inefficiencies undermining its goals. First, about 40% of firms\nnever trade in a given year. Second, many firms only trade during surrendering\nmonths, when compliance is immediate and prices are predictably high. Third, a\nnumber of operators engage in speculative trading, exploiting private\ninformation.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FTHCuqvMGPaVSL6-j0OUhFIfzYPpuYDHOTzWnYJVATY","pdfSize":"516911"}
