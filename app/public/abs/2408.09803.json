The third one separating the massive\nhomogeneous phase from the kink crystal is non-perturbative and could so far\nonly be inferred from the full solution of the model. We show that this phase\nboundary can also be obtained via a modified stability analysis, based on the\nthermodynamic potential of a single kink or baryon. The same method works for\nthe massive Gross-Neveu model, so that all phase boundaries of the Gross-Neveu\nmodel could have been predicted quantitatively without prior knowledge of the\nfull crystal solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
