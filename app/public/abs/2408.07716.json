We solve the parametrization equations\nfor the Dirac matrix structure to yield the explicit GTMD expressions for\nscalar as well as vector diquark configurations for active $u$ and $d$ quarks.\nThis analysis addresses the multi-dimensional nature of GTMDs by exploring\ntheir dependencies on one or two variables while keeping others fixed.\nAdditionally, we extract transverse momentum dependent form factors (TMFFs)\nfrom GTMDs by integrating over the longitudinal momentum fraction $x$. The\nstudy uses $3$-dimensional plots to illustrate the variation of TMFFs with the\nquark's transverse momentum $p_{\\perp}$ and the transverse momentum transfer to\nthe proton $\\Delta_{\\perp}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
