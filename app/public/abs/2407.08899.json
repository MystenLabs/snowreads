We control the expression of Lamin-A, an\nimportant organizer protein of the chromatin and nucleus structure. By\nsimultaneously tracking tens of chromosomal loci (telomeres) in each nucleus,\nwe find that the motion of chromosomal loci in Lamin-A depleted cells is both\nfaster and more directed on a scale of a few micrometers, which coincides with\nthe size of chromosome territories. Moreover, in the absence of Lamin-A we\nreveal the existence of correlations among neighboring telomeres. We show how\nthese pairwise correlations are linked with the intermittent and persistent\ncharacter of telomere trajectories, underscoring the importance of Lamin-A\nprotein in chromosomal organization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r4E6P625rEa3fyXu0zsXI2LLECTiT3svqMGYPJLb_Ps","pdfSize":"1211315"}
