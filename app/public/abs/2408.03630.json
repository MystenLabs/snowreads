Despite the progress in recent studies, it remains unanswered: whether\nthe existing studies have well solved this task (Q1) and whether the emerging\nlarge language models (LLMs) can bring new opportunities to this task (Q2). To\nthis end, we propose a new benchmark PAGED, equipped with a large high-quality\ndataset and standard evaluations. It investigates five state-of-the-art\nbaselines, revealing that they fail to extract optimal procedural graphs well\nbecause of their heavy reliance on hand-written rules and limited available\ndata. We further involve three advanced LLMs in PAGED and enhance them with a\nnovel self-refine strategy. The results point out the advantages of LLMs in\nidentifying textual elements and their gaps in building logical structures. We\nhope PAGED can serve as a major landmark for automatic procedural graph\nextraction and the investigations in PAGED can offer insights into the research\non logic reasoning among non-sequential elements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
