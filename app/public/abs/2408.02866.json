This framework leverages\nconditional diffusion models coupled with the underlying physics of\nwave-propagation and symmetries in the problem, to produce highly accurate\nreconstructions. The framework introduces a factorization of the score function\ninto a physics-based latent representation inspired by the filtered\nback-propagation formula and a conditional score function conditioned on this\nlatent representation. These two steps are also constrained to obey symmetries\nin the formulation while being amenable to compression by imposing the rank\nstructure found in the filtered back-projection formula. As a result,\nempirically, our framework is able to provide sharp reconstructions\neffortlessly, even recovering sub-Nyquist features in the multiple-scattering\nregime. It has low-sample and computational complexity, its number of\nparameters scales sub-linearly with the target resolution, and it has stable\ntraining dynamics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
