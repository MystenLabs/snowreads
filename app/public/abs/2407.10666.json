To\novercome this challenge, we introduce the flow perturbation method, which\nincorporates optimized stochastic perturbations into the flow. By reweighting\ntrajectories generated by the perturbed flow, our method achieves unbiased\nsampling of the Boltzmann distribution with orders of magnitude speedup\ncompared to both brute force Jacobian calculations and the Hutchinson\nestimator. Notably, it accurately sampled the Chignolin protein with all atomic\nCartesian coordinates explicitly represented, which, to our best knowledge, is\nthe largest molecule ever Boltzmann sampled in such detail using generative\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
