It aims to streamline the dissemination of advancements in AI\nresearch by transitioning from traditional, manual community curation, or\notherwise taxonomy-constrained natural language inference (NLI) models, to an\nautomated, generative LLM-based approach. Utilizing the FLAN-T5 model, this\nresearch enhances LLMs' adaptability and reliability in information extraction,\noffering a novel method for structured knowledge representation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pSzxfFuQBobcvxWnUkm4rPD9NdwwKy6aq1DgffBrT9E","pdfSize":"190728"}
