The largest FDI investment realization by sector was led by\nthe Basic Metal, Metal Goods, Non-Machinery, and Equipment Industry sector,\nfollowed by the Mining sector and the Electricity, Gas, and Water sector. The\nuneven amount of FDI investment realization in each industry and the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia are the main issues addressed in this study.\nThis study aims to identify the factors that influence the entry of FDI into\nindustries in Indonesia and measure the extent of these factors' influence on\nthe entry of FDI. In this study, classical assumption tests and hypothesis\ntests are conducted to investigate whether the research model is robust enough\nto provide strategic options nationally. Moreover, this study uses the ordinary\nleast squares (OLS) method. The results show that the electricity factor does\nnot influence FDI inflows in the three industries. The Human Development Index\n(HDI) factor has a significant negative effect on FDI in the Mining Industry\nand a significant positive effect on FDI in the Basic Metal, Metal Goods,\nNon-Machinery, and Equipment Industries. However, HDI does not influence FDI in\nthe Electricity, Gas, and Water Industries in Indonesia.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1vOb2_sR-P-WW-8_zRt_Gn0Ydp2fxyya3C79DqBLqvM","pdfSize":"402873"}
