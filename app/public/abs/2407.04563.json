In this chapter, we contribute our experience in using the V-Model\nas a framework for teaching how to conduct applied research in empirical\nsoftware engineering. The foundational idea of using the V-Model is presented,\nand guidance for using it to frame the research is provided. Furthermore, we\nshow how the framework has been instantiated throughout nearly two decades of\nPhD theses done at the University of Kaiserslautern (RPTU Kaiserslautern) in\npartnership with Fraunhofer IESE, including the most frequent usage patterns,\nhow the different empirical methods fit into the framework, and the lessons we\nhave learned from this experience.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
