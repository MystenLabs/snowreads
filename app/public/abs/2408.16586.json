The AIWolfDial2024\naddresses these challenges by employing the Werewolf Game, an incomplete\ninformation game, to test the capabilities of LLMs in complex interactive\nenvironments. This paper introduces a LLM-based Werewolf Game AI, where each\nrole is supported by situation analysis to aid response generation.\nAdditionally, for the werewolf role, various persuasion strategies, including\nlogical appeal, credibility appeal, and emotional appeal, are employed to\neffectively persuade other players to align with its actions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SvoOglZaY8CvfnWy5GDgRnIJjReprKytIratBS5gjzg","pdfSize":"651830"}
