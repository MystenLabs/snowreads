Specifically, the framework accommodates\nany customized conditional independence (CI) among any number of p variate\nfields at the first stage, alleviating dynamic memory burden. Meanwhile, it\nfacilitates parallel generation of covariance and precision matrix, with the\nlatter's generation order scaling only linearly in p. In the second stage, we\ndemonstrate the multivariate Hammersley-Clifford theorem from a column-wise\nconditional perspective and unearth the existence of cross-MRF. The link of the\nmixed spatial graphical framework and the cross-MRF allows for a mixed\nconditional approach, resulting in the sparsest possible representation of the\nprecision matrix via accommodating the doubly CI among both p and n, with the\nhighest possible exact-zero-value percentage. We also explore the possibility\nof the co-existence of geostatistical and MRF modelling approaches in one\nunified framework, imparting a potential solution to an open problem. The\nderived theories are illustrated with 1D simulation and 2D real-world spatial\ndata.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
