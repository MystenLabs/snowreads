The standard\nmethod of monitoring these wounds involves visual inspection by healthcare\nprofessionals, a practice that could present challenges for patients in remote\nareas with inadequate transportation and healthcare infrastructure. This has\nled to the development of algorithms designed for the analysis and follow-up of\nwound images, which perform image-processing tasks such as classification,\ndetection, and segmentation. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms\nheavily depends on the availability of comprehensive and varied wound image\ndata, which is usually scarce. This paper introduces the CO2Wounds-V2 dataset,\nan extended collection of RGB wound images from leprosy patients with their\ncorresponding semantic segmentation annotations, aiming to enhance the\ndevelopment and testing of image-processing algorithms in the medical field.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
