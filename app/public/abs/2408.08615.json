Traditional methods rely\non bulky optical components and require multiple measurements. Recently,\nmetasurface-based (MS-based) imaging strategies have emerged as a promising\nsolution to address these challenges. However, they have been primarily limited\nto capturing partial information of the three parameters, tailored to specific\noptical fields, which poses challenges when addressing with arbitrary field\ndistributions and achieving three-parameter imaging. In this study, we\nintroduce a MS-based approach for single-shot optical imaging that\nsimultaneously captures all the three parameters of optical fields with\narbitrary intensity, phase, and polarization distributions. We experimentally\nvalidate the versatility of our method by conducting imaging of various types\nof optical fields with arbitrary well-defined distributions. The strategy\npresented in our work is expected to open up promising avenues for diverse\napplications, including imaging, optical communications, and beyond.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
