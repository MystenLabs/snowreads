In terms of these operators, we derive\nthe higher order constraints for the ($\\beta$-deformed) Hermitian matrix\nmodels. We prove that these ($\\beta$-deformed) higher order constraints are\nreducible to the Virasoro constraints. Meanwhile, the Itoyama-Matsuo conjecture\nfor the constraints of the Hermitian matrix model is proved. We also find that\nthrough rescaling variable transformations, two sets of the constraint\noperators become the $W$-operators of $W$-representations for the\n($\\beta$-deformed) partition function hierarchies in the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
