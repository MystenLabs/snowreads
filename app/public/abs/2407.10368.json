Educators and\neducational institutions can create a more accommodating learning environment\nthat takes into account the varied needs and preferences of students by\nrecognizing and implementing these findings, which will ultimately improve the\nquality of education as a whole. Students believe that in-person instruction is\nthe most effective way to learn, with exercise-based learning, group\ninstruction, and pair programming. Our research indicates that, for evaluation\nmethods, there is a preference for practical and written examinations. Our\nfindings also underscore the importance of incorporating real-world scenarios,\nencouraging interactive learning approaches, and creating engaging educational\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
