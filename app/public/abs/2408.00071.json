For a black hole after Page time that is entangled with the early\nradiation we formulate a version of the information puzzle that is well-posed\nin the $G\\to 0$ limit. We then give a description of the information recovery\nprotocol in terms of von Neumann algebras using elements of the Jones index\ntheory of type II$_1$ subfactors. The subsequent evaporation and recovery steps\nare represented by Jones's basic construction, and an operation called the\ncanonical shift. A central element in our description is the Jones projection,\nwhich leads to an entanglement swap and implements an operator algebraic\nversion of a quantum teleportation protocol. These aspects are further\nelaborated on in a microscopic model based on type I algebras. Finally, we\nargue that in the emergent type III algebra the canonical shift may be\ninterpreted as a spacetime translation and, hence, that at the microscopic\nlevel \"translation = teleportation\".\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
