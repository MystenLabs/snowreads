The Larmor precession frequency for a time varying magnetic\nfield, instead of conventionally followed static magnetic field is derived for\nthe first time. With the dispersion relation in Ion Resonance depending on its\nfrequency of gyration, an AC driven electromagnet based particle resonance has\nbeen proposed circumventing the use of Superconducting Permanent Magnets.\nComplete resonance achieved under the proposed conditions results in a\nsustained, fixed-frequency particle trajectory that is independent of its speed\nor drift. Such oscillation is visualized in a D-Shaped Resonant assembly. The\namplitude and the wavelength calculations for the trajectory are demonstrated\nanalytically. Principally noting the objectives of Synchrotron in varying the\nmagnetic field and its frequency to generate high energy particles, the present\ntheory addresses the same. Its applications can be explored in Space Propulsion\nSystems, Magnetic Confinement Fusion, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and\nsub-harmonic heating and cooling. Using this theory one can aptly generate RF\nPower using device specific designed resonant antennas coupling it with with\nPlasma.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
