This\nvibration, in turn, modifies the potential landscape through which the mobile\nions travel. Because the present-time potential depends on past interactions,\nthe coupling is inherently non-local in time, making its numerical and\nanalytical treatment challenging. For sufficiently slow-moving ions, we\nlinearize the phonon spectrum to show that these non-local effects can be\nignored, giving rise to a drag-like force. Unlike the more familiar drag\ncoefficient in liquids, the drag takes on a matrix form due to the crystalline\nstructure of the framework. We numerically simulate trajectories and\ndissipation rates using both the time-local and non-local formulas to validate\nour simplification. The time-local formula dramatically reduces the\ncomputational cost of calculating the motion of mobile particle through a\ncrystalline framework and clearly connects the properties of the material to\nthe drag experienced by the particle.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
