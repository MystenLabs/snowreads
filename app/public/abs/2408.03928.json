We discuss a specific class of\nquasi-realistic string vacua with similar properties that has been known since\nthe late eighties and analyse the vacuum energy in several non-supersymmetric\nexamples that correspond to compactifications of tachyon free ten dimensional\nvacua as well as compactifications of tachyonic ten dimensional vacua. Our\nanalysis uses the Free Fermionic Formalism of the heterotic-string in four\ndimensions and employs asymmetric boundary conditions that project all the\ngeometrical moduli by Generalised GSO projections. This methodology produces\nmodels with both positive and negative spacetime potential at one-loop.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
