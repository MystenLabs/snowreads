Taken together, this turns MAPbBr$_3$ into an excellent\nplatform for probing exciton-polariton nonlinear phenomena at room temperature.\nHere we investigate ultrafast non-equilibrium dynamics of polaritons under\npulsed fs non-resonant excitation. We demonstrate the presence of the\nstimulated acoustic phonon-assisted scattering regime above threshold pump\nfluence, characterized by the explosive growth of emission intensity, a\nredshift of the emission spectral maximum, spectral narrowing, and\nsub-picosecond emission dynamics. Our theoretical findings are well confirmed\nby the results of experimental measurements.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
