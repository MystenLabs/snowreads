The weak limit theorem for quantum walks,\nanalogous to the central limit theorem for random walks, is one of the most\nimportant theorems in this field. In this study, we investigated the weak limit\ntheorem for a two-state discrete-time quantum walk on a two-dimensional square\nlattice. As a result, we derived a two-dimensional probability distribution\nwhose support is the intersection of two ellipses. The probability distribution\nwe obtained resembles the distribution of one-dimensional quantum walks while\npossessing a unique form specific to two dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0gI7v7kupGhg2znqBCFrYyToKNE_vLYLjaNNk56kt0g","pdfSize":"2470284"}
