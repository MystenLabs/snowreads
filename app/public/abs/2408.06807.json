We\npropose that episodic starbursts with quiescent periods longer than $\\sim$100\nMyr should lead to discontinuous tracks in a dwarf galaxy's\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] chemical abundance plane, with metallicity gaps as large\nas 0.3-0.5 dex at [Fe/H] = -2. This occurs due to continued Fe production by\nType Ia supernovae during quiescent periods. We demonstrate that Gaussian\nmixture models can statistically distinguish discontinuous and continuous\ntracks based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Applying this method to\nAPOGEE observations of the Sculptor dSph galaxy suggests an episodic star\nformation history with $\\sim$300 Myr quiescent periods. While current dwarf\ngalaxy datasets are limited by small spectroscopic sample sizes, future surveys\nand extremely large telescopes will enable determining large numbers of precise\nchemical abundances, opening up the investigation of very short timescales in\nearly dwarf galaxy formation. This unprecedentedly high time resolution of\ndwarf galaxy formation in the early Universe has important implications for\nunderstanding both reionization in the early Universe and the episodic star\nformation cycle of dwarf galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BDvJn3djaVzWChXcXtEK-nckic45xGgPncKFKIH7hbY","pdfSize":"2411639"}
