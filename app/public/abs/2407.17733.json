We\nestablish $L_\\infty$ and Schauder estimates of solutions when the leading\ncoefficients and the non-homogeneous term exhibit piecewise Dini mean\noscillation and piecewise H\\\"{o}lder continuity, respectively. To the best of\nour knowledge, our results are new for higher-order elliptic and parabolic\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
