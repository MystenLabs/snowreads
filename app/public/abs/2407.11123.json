Namely,\nif a system evolves unitarily between sequential measurements of dichotomic\nobservables $\\mathscr{O}_{A}$ followed by $\\mathscr{O}_{B}$, then it\nnecessarily follows that\n$\\langle\\mathscr{O}_{A}\\,,\\mathscr{O}_{B}\\rangle=\\langle\\mathscr{O}_{B}\\,,\\mathscr{O}_{A}\\rangle$,\nwhere $\\langle\\mathscr{O}_{A}\\,,\\mathscr{O}_{B}\\rangle$ is the two-time\nexpectation value corresponding to the product of the measurement outcomes of\n$\\mathscr{O}_{A}$ followed by $\\mathscr{O}_{B}$, and\n$\\langle\\mathscr{O}_{B}\\,,\\mathscr{O}_{A}\\rangle$ is the two-time expectation\nvalue associated with the time reversal of the unitary dynamics, where a\nmeasurement of $\\mathscr{O}_{B}$ precedes a measurement of $\\mathscr{O}_{A}$.\nIn this work, we show that a quantum Bayes' rule implies a time symmetry for\ntwo-time expectation values associated with open quantum systems, which evolve\naccording to a general quantum channel between measurements. Such results are\nin contrast with the view that processes associated with open quantum systems\n-- which may lose information to their environment -- are not reversible in any\noperational sense. We give an example of such time-symmetric correlations for\nthe amplitude-damping channel, and we propose an experimental protocol for the\npotential verification of the theoretical predictions associated with our\nresults.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Bkh01Sjd26VG1YhlW3Olab0R04Ac4t9LOoMY6Y3kwec","pdfSize":"4736226","objectId":"0x21a7f482e14568646913888e83d18430595b8597b7ebd486e1baedd9707db600","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
