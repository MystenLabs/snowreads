Grover's algorithm\ncan find the target item with certainty only if searching one out of four.\nGrover's algorithm can be deterministic if the phase of the oracle or the\ndiffusion operator is delicately designed. The precision of the phases could be\na problem. We propose a near-deterministic quantum search algorithm without the\nphase control. Our algorithm has the same oracle and diffusion operators as\nGrover's algorithm. One additional component is the rescaled diffusion\noperator. It acts partially on the database. We show how to improve the success\nprobability of Grover's algorithm by the partial diffusion operator in two\ndifferent ways. The possible cost is one or two more queries to the oracle. We\nalso design the deterministic search algorithm when searching one out of eight,\nsixteen, and thirty-two.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
