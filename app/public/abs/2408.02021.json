In particular, over the past decade, theoretical\nstudies have focused on adapting the Dunkl derivative to quantum mechanical\nproblems. This approach merely seeks to generalize traditional quantum\nmechanical techniques through the utilization of differential-difference\noperators associated with finite reflection groups, thereby providing solutions\nthat are dependent on parity. In this manuscript, we investigate the analytical\nsolution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation for a harmonic oscillator\nwith time-dependent mass and frequency, coupled with angular-dependent\npotential energy by utilizing the Dunkl derivatives. To obtain the solution, we\nemploy the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant methodology. Our approach broadens the\nscope of quantum mechanical analyses, offering exact solutions and new insights\ninto dynamic quantum systems under varying conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
