In this work, we suggest to exploit the nonlinear\nself-phase-modulation effect to increase the overall sensitivity by an\nadditional gain factor appearing when the operational point of the nonlinear\nresonator is chosen just at the cross-over from the mono- to the bistable\nregime. We present the theoretical idea together with a first proof of concept\nexperiment displaying a gain factor of 22 on a chip-integrated silicon-nitride\nresonator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
