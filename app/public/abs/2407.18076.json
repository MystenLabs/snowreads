The capacity of the multi-messenger multi-wavelength\ncommunity to effectively pursue follow-up observations is hindered by the\nsuboptimal localization of numerous transient events and the escalating volume\nof alerts. Thus, we have developed an effective tool to overcome the\nobservational and technical hurdles inherent in the emerging field of\nmulti-messenger astrophysics. We present tilepy, a Python package for the\nautomatic scheduling of follow-up observations of poorly localized transient\nevents. It is ideally suited to tackle the challenge of complex follow-up in\nmid and small-FoV telescope campaigns, with or without human intervention. We\ndemonstrate the capabilities of tilepy in the realm of multi-observatory,\nmulti-wavelength campaigns, to cover the localization uncertainty region of\nvarious events ultimately aiming at pinpointing the source of the\nmulti-messenger emission. The tilepy code is publicly available on GitHub and\nis sufficiently flexible to be employed either automatically or in a customized\nmanner, tailored to collaboration and individual requirements. tilepy is also\naccessible via a public API and through the Astro-COLIBRI platform.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
