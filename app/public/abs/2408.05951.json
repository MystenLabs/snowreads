Of the two, M dwarfs currently offer greater observational advantages\nand are home to many of the most exciting observational discoveries in the last\ndecade. But K dwarfs could offer even better prospects for detecting\nhabitability by combining the advantage of a relatively dim stellar flux with a\nmore stable stellar environment. Here we explore the climate regimes that are\npossible on Earth-like synchronous planets in M- and K-dwarf systems, and how\nthey vary across the habitable zone. We focus on surface temperature patterns,\nwater availability, and implications for habitability. We find that the risk of\nnightside cold-trapping decreases with increased orbital radius and is overall\nlower for K-dwarf planets. With reduced atmospheric shortwave absorption,\nK-dwarf planets have higher dayside precipitation rates and less day-to-night\nmoisture transport, resulting in lower nightside snow rates. These results\nimply a higher likelihood of detecting a planet with a moist dayside climate in\na habitable \"eyeball\" climate regime orbiting a K-dwarf star. We also show that\n\"terminator habitability\" can occur for both M- and K-dwarf land planets, but\nwould likely be more prevalent in M-dwarf systems. Planets in a terminator\nhabitability regime tend to have slightly lower fractional habitability, but\noffer alternative advantages including instellation rates more comparable to\nEarth in regions that have temperatures amenable to life.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
