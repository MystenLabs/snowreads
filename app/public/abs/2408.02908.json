However, the distributional\nevaluation of the performance has been poorly considered. Although many\nuncertainty estimation methods have been advocated, they have not successfully\nestimated highly complex performance distributions under small data. In this\npaper, we propose a method to distributionally evaluate the performance under\ncomplex requirements using small input-trajectory data. To handle the unknown\ncomplex probability distributions under small data, we discretize the\ncorresponding performance measure, yielding a discrete random process over an\ninput region. Then, we propose a semiparametric Bayesian model of the discrete\nprocess based on a Dirichlet random field whose parameter function is\nrepresented by multiple logistic Gaussian processes (LGPs). The Dirichlet\nposterior parameter function is estimated through the LGP posteriors in a\nreasonable and conservative fashion. We show that the proposed Bayesian model\nconverges to the true discrete random process as the number of data becomes\nlarge enough. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod by simulation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
