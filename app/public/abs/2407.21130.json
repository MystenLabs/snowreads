We give three separate analyses that achieve\nprogressively greater accuracy at the cost of making increasingly strong\nassumptions about musical syntax. Although our method makes almost no use of\nhuman input, we are able to identify both chords and keys with an accuracy of\n85% or greater when compared to an expert human analysis, resulting in\nannotations accurate enough to be used for a range of music-theoretical\npurposes, while also being free of subjective human judgments. Our work bears\non longstanding debates about the objective reality of the structures\npostulated by standard Western harmonic theory, as well as on specific\nquestions about the nature of Western harmonic syntax.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
