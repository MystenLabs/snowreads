However, practical benefits\nrequire further validation. QRL faces challenges like flat solution landscapes,\nwhere traditional gradient-based methods are inefficient, necessitating the use\nof gradient-free algorithms. This work explores the integration of\nmetaheuristic algorithms -- Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony\nOptimization, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Harmony\nSearch -- into QRL. These algorithms provide flexibility and efficiency in\nparameter optimization. Evaluations in $5\\times5$ MiniGrid Reinforcement\nLearning environments show that, all algorithms yield near-optimal results,\nwith Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization performing best. In\nthe Cart Pole environment, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, and\nParticle Swarm Optimization achieve optimal results, while the others perform\nslightly better than random action selection. These findings demonstrate the\npotential of Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing for efficient\nQRL learning, emphasizing the need for careful algorithm selection and\nadaptation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
