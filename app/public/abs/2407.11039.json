However, it\npresents a fundamental trade-off between exploiting the current optimal policy\nto maximize immediate revenue and exploring alternative policies to collect\ndata for future policy improvement via off-policy evaluation (OPE). To balance\nthis trade-off, we propose a novel approach that combines a model-based revenue\nmaximization policy and a randomized exploration policy for data collection.\nOur framework enables flexible adjustment of the mixture ratio between these\ntwo policies to optimize the balance between short-term revenue and future\npolicy improvement. We formulate the problem of determining the optimal mixture\nratio as multi-objective optimization, enabling quantitative evaluation of this\ntrade-off. We empirically verified the effectiveness of the proposed mixed\npolicy using synthetic data. Our main contributions are: (1) Demonstrating a\nmixed policy combining deterministic and probabilistic policies, flexibly\nadjusting the data collection vs. revenue trade-off. (2) Formulating the\noptimal mixture ratio problem as multi-objective optimization, enabling\nquantitative evaluation of this trade-off.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
