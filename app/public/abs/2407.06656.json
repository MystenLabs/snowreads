We derive new\nLipschitz stability estimates for the inversion in terms of the truncation\nparameter. The obtained results show that the Lipschitz constant is of order\none when the truncation parameter is larger than the spatial frequency of the\nfunction, and it grows exponentially when the truncation parameter tends to\nzero. Finally, we present some numerical examples of reconstruction of a\ncompactly supported function from its noisy truncated Fourier transform. The\nnumerical illustrations validate our theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
