However, this\nrobustness is accompanied by a significant decline in accuracy on clean data.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method, called Tangent Direction Guided\nAdversarial Training (TART), that leverages the tangent space of the data\nmanifold to ameliorate the existing adversarial defense algorithms. We argue\nthat training with adversarial examples having large normal components\nsignificantly alters the decision boundary and hurts accuracy. TART mitigates\nthis issue by estimating the tangent direction of adversarial examples and\nallocating an adaptive perturbation limit according to the norm of their\ntangential component. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work\nto consider the concept of tangent space and direction in the context of\nadversarial defense. We validate the effectiveness of TART through extensive\nexperiments on both simulated and benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate\nthat TART consistently boosts clean accuracy while retaining a high level of\nrobustness against adversarial attacks. Our findings suggest that incorporating\nthe geometric properties of data can lead to more effective and efficient\nadversarial training methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
