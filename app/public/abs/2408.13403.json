The datasets we have obtained from the beam profiling and\nthe machine learning model for beamforming are valuable for a broad set of\nnetwork design problems, such as network topology optimization, user equipment\nassociation, power allocation, and beam scheduling, in complex and dynamic\nmmWave networks. We have used two commercial-grade mmWave testbeds with\noperational frequencies on the 27 Ghz and 71 GHz, respectively, for beam\nprofiling. The obtained datasets were used to train the machine learning model\nto estimate the received downlink signal power, and data rate at the receivers\n(user equipment with different geographical locations in the range of a\ntransmitter (base station). The results have shown high prediction accuracy\nwith low mean square error (loss), indicating the model's ability to estimate\nthe received signal power or data rate at each individual receiver covered by a\nbeam. The dataset and the machine learning-based beamforming model can assist\nresearchers in optimizing various network design problems for mmWave networks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
