This compelling vision is challenged by the high level of\nintelligence needed aboard, which clashes against the limited computational and\nstorage resources available on PULP (parallel-ultra-low-power) MCU class\nnavigation and mission controllers that can be hosted aboard. This work moves\nfrom PULP-Dronet, a State-of-the-Art convolutional neural network for\nautonomous navigation on nano-drones. We introduce Tiny-PULP-Dronet: a novel\nmethodology to squeeze by more than one order of magnitude model size (50x\nfewer parameters), and number of operations (27x less multiply-and-accumulate)\nrequired to run inference with similar flight performance as PULP-Dronet. This\nmassive reduction paves the way towards affordable multi-tasking on\nnano-drones, a fundamental requirement for achieving high-level intelligence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
