Previous methods are inefficient in\nattacking MVDMs because they lack the consideration of disrupting the geometric\nand visual consistency among the generated multi-view images. This paper is the\nfirst to address the intellectual property infringement issue arising from\nMVDMs. Accordingly, we propose a novel latent feature and attention dual\nerasure attack to disrupt the distribution of latent feature and the\nconsistency across the generated images from multi-view and multi-domain\nsimultaneously. The experiments conducted on SOTA MVDMs indicate that our\napproach achieves superior performances in terms of attack effectiveness,\ntransferability, and robustness against defense methods. Therefore, this paper\nprovides an efficient solution to protect 3D assets from MVDMs-based 3D\ngeometry reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
