First, given\na time step of the flow, methods from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) are\nleveraged to extract the geometry of the vortices. Specifically, the enstrophy\nof the flow is simplified by topological persistence, and the vortices are\nextracted by collecting the basins of the simplified enstrophy's Morse complex.\nNext, the local kinetic energy power spectrum is computed for each vortex. We\nintroduce a set of indicators based on the kinetic energy power spectrum to\nestimate the correlation between the vortex's behavior and that of an idealized\nturbulent vortex. Our preliminary experiments show the relevance of these\nindicators for distinguishing vortices which are turbulent from those which\nhave not yet reached a turbulent state and thus known as laminar.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
