However, unifying NAS for a wide range of edge devices presents\nchallenges due to the variety of hardware designs, supported operations, and\ncompilation optimizations. Existing methods often fix the search space of\narchitecture choices (e.g., activation, convolution, or self-attention) and\nestimate latency using hardware-agnostic proxies (e.g., FLOPs), which fail to\nachieve proclaimed latency across various edge devices. To address this issue,\nwe propose SCAN-Edge, a unified NAS framework that jointly searches for\nself-attention, convolution, and activation to accommodate the wide variety of\nedge devices, including CPU-, GPU-, and hardware accelerator-based systems. To\nhandle the large search space, SCAN-Edge relies on with a hardware-aware\nevolutionary algorithm that improves the quality of the search space to\naccelerate the sampling process. Experiments on large-scale datasets\ndemonstrate that our hybrid networks match the actual MobileNetV2 latency for\n224x224 input resolution on various commodity edge devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
