However, current popular spatial\ntranscriptomics techniques either have shallow sequencing depth or low\nresolution. We present stEnTrans, a deep learning method based on Transformer\narchitecture that provides comprehensive predictions for gene expression in\nunmeasured areas or unexpectedly lost areas and enhances gene expression in\noriginal and inputed spots. Utilizing a self-supervised learning approach,\nstEnTrans establishes proxy tasks on gene expression profile without requiring\nadditional data, mining intrinsic features of the tissues as supervisory\ninformation. We evaluate stEnTrans on six datasets and the results indicate\nsuperior performance in enhancing spots resolution and predicting gene\nexpression in unmeasured areas compared to other deep learning and traditional\ninterpolation methods. Additionally, Our method also can help the discovery of\nspatial patterns in Spatial Transcriptomics and enrich to more biologically\nsignificant pathways.
