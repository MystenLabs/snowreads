In\nparticular, the focus is dynamics outside the injection-locking region.\nPermutation entropy (P.E.) and chaos bandwidth (CBW) are used to quantify\ncomplexity. Various numerically simulated system outputs across the frequency\ndetuning range and for different injection strengths are considered.\nNumerically simulated outputs from a single-mode injection system in the\nabsence of comb injection are compared to comment on the origin of the reported\ncomplexity. Furthermore, experimental outputs are used to confirm the findings.\nDespite the presence of periodic dynamics originating from the frequency comb,\nthe presented system generates remarkably high complex outputs with P.E. up to\n0.99 maintained over an extended period of observation and long timescales with\nCBW up to 25 GHz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
