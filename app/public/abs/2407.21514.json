Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation\nhas emerged as a promising solution; however, its high equalization complexity,\nif performed in the delay-Doppler domain, limits its universal application.\nThis article explores domain-adaptive system design, dynamically selecting\nbest-fit domains for modulation, pilot placement, and equalization based on\nchannel conditions, to enhance performance across diverse environments. We\nexamine domain classifications and connections, signal designs, and\nequalization techniques with domain adaptivity, and finally highlight future\nresearch opportunities.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MnBuhGGGCzaE8L7m5SH-lOClurEqYcBTNjkimotiAS4","pdfSize":"1525543"}
