We present a robust derivation of the Wilson\nspool by providing a new group-theoretic perspective of the quasinormal mode\nmethod for one-loop determinants. We test our proposal on Euclidean BTZ and\n$S^3$ backgrounds. We also evaluate explicitly the quantum corrections to the\npath integral on $S^3$, and report on how $G_N$ and the mass are renormalized\nto leading order in perturbation theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9nFidcC01g7izMCmF755Xy-FgrVccZFJZ_XOyMZrRKE","pdfSize":"546531"}
