The complex nature of prions, with respect to\ntheir conformations and aggregations, has been an important area of research\nfor quite some time. Here, we develop a model of prion dynamics prior to the\nformation of oligomers and subsequent development of prion diseases within a\nstochastic framework, based on the analytical Master Equation and Stochastic\nSimulation Algorithm by Gillespie. The results that we obtain shows that\nsolvent water molecules act as driving agents in the dynamics of prion\naggregation. Further, it is found that aggregated and non-aggregated proteins\ntend to co-exist in an equilibrium state, depending upon the reaction rate\nconstants. These results may provide a theoretical and qualitative contexts of\npossible therapeutic strategies in the treatment of prion diseases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JPcNBrkMdozlt4eHihAEWLNaepumJ-Di10YZ4iRknPU","pdfSize":"1358691"}
