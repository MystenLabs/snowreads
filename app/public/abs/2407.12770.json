The\nnature and experimental realizations of DQCPs are crucial issues of importance.\nWe illustrate the potential for DQCPs between the valence bond solid state and\nthe antiferromagnetic phase to arise in optical lattices containing frustrated\ndipolar bosons subject to hard-core constraints. The emergence of DQCPs is\ncomprehended through the fusion of two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)\ntransitions. The DQCPs and the BKTs are confirmed by the finite-size scaling of\nground-state fidelity susceptibilities. The numerical analysis reveals varying\ncritical exponents of the correlation length in DQCPs and the logarithmic\nscaling in BKTs, respectively. This work offers a promising platform for\nrealizing DQCPs and provides valuable insights into their nature within the\nframework of topological phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
