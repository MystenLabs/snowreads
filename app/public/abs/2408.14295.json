This provides an important benchmark\nfor future experiments which will explore the dynamics of such models. As would\nbe expected, the spectrum is gapped away from the critical point, and can be\nunderstood in terms of the elementary excitations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
