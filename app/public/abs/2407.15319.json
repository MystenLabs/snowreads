However, current\nmethods to approach the ultimate spatial resolution ($<500\\,$nm) are\nimpractical for routine use as they require time-consuming fabrication or\ntransfer techniques to precisely interface the diamond sensor with the sample\nto be imaged. To address this challenge, we have designed a co-axial sensor\nholder that enables simple, repeatable sensor-sample interfacing while being\ncompatible with high numerical aperture (NA) optics. With our new design we\ndemonstrate low standoffs $<500\\,$nm with a millimetre sized sensor. We also\nexplore the relationship between spatial resolution and NA spanning from 0.13\nto 1.3. The spatial resolution shows good agreement with the optical\ndiffraction limit at low NA but deviates at high NA, which is shown to be due\nto optical aberrations. Future improvements to our design are discussed, which\nshould enable magnetic imaging with $<500\\,$nm resolution in an accessible,\neasy-to-use instrument.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
