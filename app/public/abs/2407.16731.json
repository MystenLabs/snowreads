For each incident beam with a given wavelength, the\ncascaded DOE forms a different specified intensity distribution. The problem of\nDOE design is formulated as the problem of minimizing a functional that depends\non the functions of diffractive microrelief height of the cascaded DOE and\nrepresents the deviations of the intensity distributions generated at the\noperating wavelengths from the specified ones. Explicit expressions are\nobtained for the derivatives of the functional, and on this basis, a gradient\nmethod for calculating a cascaded DOE is formulated. The proposed gradient\nmethod is used for the calculation of cascaded DOEs focusing radiation of three\ndifferent wavelengths into different areas. In particular, the calculation of a\ncascaded DOE generating a complex color image of parrots is considered. The\npresented numerical simulation results demonstrate high performance of the\nproposed method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
