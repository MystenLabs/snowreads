We show that, although the longitudinal momentum of the final\n$\\nu$ escapes detection, the mass of the heavy lepton can be reconstructed.\nThis possibility has been overlooked in recent LHC searches. For $m_N\\approx\n90$--$130$ GeV and the current luminosity (138 fb$^{-1}$ at 13 TeV), we\nestimate that the reconstruction could set bounds on $|V_{\\ell N}|^2$ around\n$4\\times 10^{-4}$, versus the $2\\times 10^{-3}$ limit obtained at CMS or\n$|V_{\\ell N}|^2< 10^{-3}$ from flavor and electroweak precision data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
