With a parallel processing\nmechanism, diarisation and ASR can be applied simultaneously, helping to\nprevent the accumulation of errors from one sub-system to the next in a\ncascaded system. This is achieved by the use of ASR, trained using a serialised\noutput training method, together with segment-level discriminative neural\nclustering (SDNC) to assign speaker labels. With SDNC, our system does not\nrequire an extra non-neural clustering method to assign speaker labels, thus\nallowing the entire system to be based on neural networks. Experimental results\non the AMI meeting dataset demonstrate that SDNC outperforms spectral\nclustering (SC) by a 19% relative diarisation error rate (DER) reduction on the\nAMI Eval set. When compared with the cascaded system with SC, the parallel\nsystem with SDNC gives a 7%/4% relative improvement in cpWER on the Dev/Eval\nset.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
