This necessitates the timely\nidentification of authentic content. However, most advanced detection methods\nare computationally heavy, hindering their real-time application. In this\npaper, we describe an efficient two-stream architecture for real-time image\nmanipulation detection. Our method consists of two-stream branches targeting\nthe cognitive and inspective perspectives. In the cognitive branch, we propose\nefficient wavelet-guided Transformer blocks to capture the global manipulation\ntraces related to frequency. This block contains an interactive wavelet-guided\nself-attention module that integrates wavelet transformation with efficient\nattention design, interacting with the knowledge from the inspective branch.\nThe inspective branch consists of simple convolutions that capture fine-grained\ntraces and interact bidirectionally with Transformer blocks to provide mutual\nsupport. Our method is lightweight ($\\sim$ 8M) but achieves competitive\nperformance compared to many other counterparts, demonstrating its efficacy in\nimage manipulation detection and its potential for portable integration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
