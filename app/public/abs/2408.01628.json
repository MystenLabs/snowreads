It provides a unified approach and notation to compare\nthe main approaches used in applied research. The primary focus is on methods\nthat utilise the actual values of observations, rather than their ranks. We\nconcentrate on such desirable properties of covariograms as bias,\npositive-definiteness and behaviour at large distances. The paper discusses\nseveral theoretical properties and demonstrates some surprising drawbacks of\nwell-known estimators. Numerical studies provide a comparison of\nrepresentatives from different methods using various metrics. The results\nprovide important insight and guidance for practitioners who use estimated\ncovariograms in various applications, including kriging, monitoring network\noptimisation, cross-validation, and other related tasks.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
