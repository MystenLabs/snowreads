Set\n$(-)^{(n)}$ to be the $n$-th Veronese functor. We compute the Bass numbers of\n$M^{(n)}$ over the ring $R^{(n)}$ for all prime ideals of $R^{(n)}$ that are\nnot the homogeneous maximal ideal in terms of the Bass numbers of $M$ over $R$.\nAs an application to local cohomology modules, we determine the Bass numbers of\n$H_{I\\cap R^{(n)}}^i(R^{(n)})$ over the ring $R^{(n)}$ in the case where\n$H_I^i(R)$ has finite Bass numbers over $R$ and $I$ is a graded ideal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
