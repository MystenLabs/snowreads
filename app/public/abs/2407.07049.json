Here, we observe quantized\ncurrents that survive the addition of bounded local disorder beyond the closing\nof the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper\nchain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. We explain the robustness\nusing a local picture in \\textit{configuration-space} based on Landau-Zener\ntransitions, which rests on the Anderson localisation of the eigenstates.\nMoreover, we propose a protocol, directly realizable in for instance cold atoms\nor photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological\nmany-body states with high Chern numbers and opens new experimental avenues for\nthe study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
