We focus on the specific scenario where one of\nthe DM candidates remains completely invisible, having only hidden sector\ninteractions with the other dark matter constituent referred to as ``dark\nannihilation\". The possible effect of non-standard expansion of the universe on\nthe dark matter abundance is also taken into account.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
