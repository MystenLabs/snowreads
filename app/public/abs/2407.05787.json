We discuss the classification of factorizable diagrams and\ntheir renormalization. Compact analytic results for the renormalized form\nfactors are presented in a computer-readable form.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
