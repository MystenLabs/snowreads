Specifically, multiple distributed access points\n(APs) equipped with MAs collaboratively transmit confidential information to\nthe primary user (PU), in the meanwhile the backscatter device (BD) transmits\nits own information to the secondary user (SU) by reflecting incident signals\nfrom the APs. The MAs deployed at the APs can adjust their positions flexibly\nto improve channel conditions between the APs and the PU/SU/BD and suppress the\neavesdropping from the Eve on confidential information at the PU. Under this\nsetup, we maximize the secrecy rate of primary transmission through jointly\noptimizing the APs' transmission beamforming vectors and the positions of the\nMAs, while adhering to the quality of service constraints at the SU. To address\nthe challenges caused by the non-convexity and find a near-optimal solution, an\nalternating optimization (AO) framework is proposed, utilizing the successive\nconvex approximation method, the semi-definite relaxation technology and a\ngenetic algorithm modified particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO) algorithm.\nNumerical results demonstrate the secrecy rate enhancement provided by\nutilizing the MAs and show the impact of the GA-PSO algorithm for improving the\nsolving accuracy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
