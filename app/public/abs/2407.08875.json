Firstly, a semiclassical\nmethod is discussed which is corrected based on known quantum constraints, and\nsecondly, a direct computation of the density-density response function within\nthe molecular dynamics. The wave packet models are compared to PIMC and DFT-MD\nfor the static and low-frequency behaviour. For the high-frequency behaviour\nthe models recover the expected behaviour in the limits of small and large\nmomentum transfers and show the characteristic flattening of the plasmon\ndispersion for intermediate momentum transfers due to interactions, in\nagreement with commonly used models for X-ray Thomson scattering. By modelling\nthe electrons and ions on an equal footing, both the ion and free electron part\nof the spectrum can now be treated within a single framework where we\nsimultaneously resolve the ion-acoustic and plasmon mode, with a\nself-consistent description of collisions and screening.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
