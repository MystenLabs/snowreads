Moreover, we\nprove that the solution of DRPDEs can converge to that of RPDEs in sense of\nsome distance as the delay tends to zero. As applications, we employ the main\nresults to the study of a class of delay stochastic partial differential\nequations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter\n$\\alpha\\in(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{2}]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
