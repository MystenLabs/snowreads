These networks harness the\ndistinctive characteristics of physical systems to carry out computations\neffectively, potentially surpassing the constraints of conventional digital\nneural networks. A recent advancement known as ``physical self-learning'' aims\nto achieve learning through intrinsic physical processes rather than relying on\nexternal computations. This article offers a comprehensive review of the\nprogress made in implementing physical self-learning across various physical\nsystems. Prevailing learning strategies are discussed that contribute to the\nrealization of physical self-learning. Despite challenges in understanding\nfundamental mechanism of learning, this work highlights the progress towards\nconstructing intelligent hardware from the ground up, incorporating embedded\nself-organizing and self-adaptive dynamics in physical systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n-xfgP5ZzY2nMota62RGn9waeSXCsBMAYHQSSujLtl8","pdfSize":"5001425"}
