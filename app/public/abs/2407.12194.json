Rev. E 57(2) (1998)] that correctly describes the statistics of\nlongitudinal velocity increments not only in the inertial range but also for\nlarger scales up to the system length scale L. Two additional parameters are\nintroduced to the original equation for the probability density function of\nvelocity increments. These parameters can be motivated by physical arguments\nand their values are fixed by large scale boundary conditions. The resultant\nmodel ensures correct convergence of structure functions at the system length\nscale, including vanishing slopes at L, and shows good agreement with\nexperimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
