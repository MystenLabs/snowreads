We assess these approaches\nacross diverse datasets, including CURE-OR, CURE-TSR, SSID+, Set-12, and\nChest-Xray, each presenting unique noise challenges. Our analysis employs seven\nImage Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics and examines the impact on object\ndetection performance. We find that while BM3D excels in scenarios like blur\nchallenges, NBNet is more effective in complex noise environments such as\nunder-exposure and over-exposure. The study reveals the strengths and\nlimitations of each method, providing insights into the effectiveness of\ndifferent denoising strategies in varied real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
