In this work, we focus\non the criteria of lumpability and decomposability, previously established for\nassessing RCs, and propose a new flow matching approach for the analysis and\noptimization of reaction coordinates based on these criteria. This method\neffectively utilizes data to quantitatively determine whether a given RC\nsatisfies these criteria and enables end-to-end optimization of the reaction\ncoordinate mapping model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nrelationship between the loss function used in our approach and the operator\nerror induced by dimension reduction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
