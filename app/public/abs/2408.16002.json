This book begins with\nessential concepts in descriptive statistics and probability theory, laying a\nsolid groundwork for understanding data and probability distributions. As the\nreader progresses, they are introduced to matrix calculus and gradient\noptimization, crucial for training and fine-tuning neural networks. The book\ndelves into multilayer feed-forward neural networks, explaining their\narchitecture, training processes, and the backpropagation algorithm. Key\nchallenges in neural network optimization, such as activation function\nsaturation, vanishing and exploding gradients, and weight initialization, are\nthoroughly discussed. The text covers various learning rate schedules and\nadaptive algorithms, providing strategies to optimize the training process.\nTechniques for generalization and hyperparameter tuning, including Bayesian\noptimization and Gaussian processes, are also presented to enhance model\nperformance and prevent overfitting. Advanced activation functions are explored\nin detail, categorized into sigmoid-based, ReLU-based, ELU-based,\nmiscellaneous, non-standard, and combined types. Each activation function is\nexamined for its properties and applications, offering readers a deep\nunderstanding of their impact on neural network behavior. The final chapter\nintroduces complex-valued neural networks, discussing complex numbers,\nfunctions, and visualizations, as well as complex calculus and backpropagation\nalgorithms. This book equips readers with the knowledge and skills necessary to\ndesign, and optimize advanced neural network models, contributing to the\nongoing advancements in artificial intelligence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LwXULt_f8YS33P2QM2C_8NBc_JsCcUvLSpVkC3OBF58","pdfSize":"19446346"}
