Additionally, we identify the\nuniversal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a\nnon-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic\nelectronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the\nuniversality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental\nsymmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through\nextensive numerical simulations across different types of models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CGDycEZxwWc41HKFzk0SAvaPT0U_3Kv48E3E5qCrTg8","pdfSize":"4460207"}
