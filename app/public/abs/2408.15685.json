This disagreement has led to a paradigm in which such\nscreening lengths are referred to as 'anomalous underscreening', while others -\npredominantly those predicted by theory and molecular simulation - are referred\nto as 'normal underscreening'. Herein we use discrete Fourier analysis of the\nradial charge density obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to reveal\nthe origin of anomalous underscreening in concentrated electrolytes. Normal\nunderscreening above the Kirkwood point arises from low-frequency decay modes\nof the electrostatic potential, while anomalous underscreening arises from\nhigh-frequency decay modes that are observed only at high concentrations. The\nscreening length associated with a particular decay mode is in turn determined\nby the degree of short-range interference between ion-ion correlation\nfunctions. The long-range decay associated with anomalous underscreening is\nthus ultimately determined by short range structure in the bulk electrolyte.\nThese results reconcile the disagreement between experimental measurements and\ntheoretical predictions of screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
