While some of these sources, like\norbiting massive black hole binaries, have well-defined waveform models, there\ncould also be signals present with unknown morphology. This motivates the\nsearch for generic gravitational-wave bursts in a signal-agnostic way. However,\nthese searches are computationally prohibitive due to the expansive parameter\nspace. In this paper we present QuickBurst, an algorithm with a re-defined\nlikelihood that lets us expedite Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for a subset\nof the signal parameters by avoiding repeated calculations of costly inner\nproducts. This results in an overall speedup factor of $\\sim$200 on realistic\nsimulated datasets, which is sufficient to make generic gravitational-wave\nburst searches feasible on current and growing pulsar timing array datasets.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
