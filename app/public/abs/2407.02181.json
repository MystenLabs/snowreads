Zipf about the principle of least effort, an\nintuitive idea which is nowadays informally widespread in complex systems\nmodeling. We call generalized evolution principle this mathematical notion of\ninteraction spaces theory. Formalizing and generalizing Mandelbrot's ideas, we\nalso prove that a large class of these systems satisfy a power law. We finally\nillustrate the notion of complex adaptive system with theorems describing a Von\nTh\\\"unen-like model. The latter can be easily generalized to other complex\nsystems and describes the appearance of emergent patterns. Every notion is\nintroduced both using an intuitive description with lots of examples, and using\na modern mathematical language.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
