We compute these\nparameters for the endomorphism monoid $End(C)$ of a chain $C$. Specifically,\nif $C$ is infinite then the left diameter of $End(C)$ is 2, while the right\ndiameter is either 2 or 3, with the latter equal to 2 precisely when $C$ is a\nquotient of $C{\\setminus}\\{z\\}$ for some endpoint $z$. If $C$ is finite then so\nis $End(C),$ in which case the left and right diameters are 1 (if $C$ is\nnon-trivial) or 0.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vQ83gR1CPZRyoshtl8DURcAUDrk2oi6n2x92saIwilw","pdfSize":"222695","txDigest":"FxbrvjHdcV2sMsxuyWR1RiLC1Y67YH8SFMMa57HHybwY","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
