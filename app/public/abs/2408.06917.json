We prove that if $\\mathcal{C}$ is a rational stable\npresentably symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category, the enveloping Hopf algebra\nfunctor is fully faithful. We conclude that Lie algebras in $\\mathcal{C}$ are\nalgebras over the monad underlying the adjunction $T \\simeq \\mathcal{U} \\circ\n\\mathrm{Lie}: \\mathcal{C} \\rightleftarrows\n\\mathrm{Alg}_{\\mathrm{Lie}}(\\mathcal{C}) \\to \\mathrm{Hopf}(\\mathcal{C}), $\nwhere $\\mathrm{Lie}$ is the free Lie algebra and $\\mathrm{T}$ is the tensor\nalgebra. For general $\\mathcal{C}$ we introduce the notion of restricted\n$L_\\infty$-algebra as an algebra over the latter adjunction. For any field $K$\nwe construct a forgetful functor from restricted Lie algebras in connective\n$H(K)$-modules to the $\\infty$-category underlying a right induced model\nstructure on simplicial restricted Lie algebras over $K $.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
