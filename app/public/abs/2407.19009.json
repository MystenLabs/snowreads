This abundance pattern is almost never seen in lower redshift\ngalaxies but is commonly observed in globular cluster stars. We have recently\ndemonstrated that this peculiar abundance pattern appears in a compact ($\\simeq\n20$ pc) metal-poor galaxy undergoing a strong burst of star formation. This\ngalaxy was originally selected based on strong CIV emission, indicating a hard\nradiation field rarely seen locally. In this paper, we present JWST/NIRSpec\nobservations of another reionization-era galaxy known to power strong CIV\nemission, the $z=7.04$ gravitationally-lensed galaxy A1703-zd6. The emission\nline spectrum reveals this is a metal poor galaxy ($12+\\log(\\rm O/H) =\n7.47\\pm0.19$) dominated by a young stellar population ($1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ Myr)\nthat powers a very hard ionizing spectrum (CIV EW = 19.4 $\\unicode{x212B}$, He\nII EW = 2.2 $\\unicode{x212B}$). The ISM is highly-enriched in nitrogen\n($\\log(\\rm N/O)=-0.6$) with very high electron densities ($8-19\\times10^4$\ncm$^{-3}$) and extreme ionization conditions rarely seen at lower redshift. We\nalso find intense CIV emission (EW$\\gtrsim20$ $\\unicode{x212B}$) in two new\n$z\\gtrsim 6$ metal poor galaxies. To put these results in context, we search\nfor UV line emission in a sample of 737 $z\\gtrsim 4$ galaxies with NIRSpec\nspectra, establishing that 40(30)% of systems with [OIII]+H$\\beta$ EW\n$>2000\\unicode{x212B}$ have NIV] (CIV) detections with EW$>5$ $\\unicode{x212B}$\n($>10$ $\\unicode{x212B}$). These results suggest high N/O ratios and hard\nionizing sources appear in a brief phase following a burst of star formation in\ncompact high density stellar complexes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
