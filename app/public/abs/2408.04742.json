We also give\nexplicit constructions of various double $(\\infty,n-1)$-categories implementing\nvarious join constructions, slice constructions and cone constructions, and\nstudy their properties. We further prove that key examples of\n$(\\infty,n)$-categories are (co)complete.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
