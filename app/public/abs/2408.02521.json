However, the large number\nof existing datasets, the discovery of previously unknown flaws therein, and\nthe frequent publication of new datasets make it hard to select suitable\noptions and sufficiently understand their respective limitations. Hence, there\nis a great risk of drawing invalid conclusions from experimental results with\nrespect to detection performance of novel methods in the real world. While\nthere exist various surveys on intrusion detection datasets, they have\ndeficiencies in providing researchers with a profound decision basis since they\nlack comprehensiveness, actionable details, and up-to-dateness. In this paper,\nwe present COMIDDS, an ongoing effort to comprehensively survey intrusion\ndetection datasets with an unprecedented level of detail, implemented as a\nwebsite backed by a public GitHub repository. COMIDDS allows researchers to\nquickly identify suitable datasets depending on their requirements and provides\nstructured and critical information on each dataset, including actual data\nsamples and links to relevant publications. COMIDDS is freely accessible,\nregularly updated, and open to contributions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
