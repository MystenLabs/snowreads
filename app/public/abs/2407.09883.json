Decision problems have an underlying\n(graphical) causal structure, which may sometimes be used to evaluate certain\nobservations as immaterial. For soluble graphs - ones where important past\nobservations are remembered - there is a complete graphical criterion; one that\nrules out materiality whenever this can be done on the basis of the graphical\nstructure alone. In this work, we analyse a proposed criterion for insoluble\ngraphs. In particular, we prove that some of the conditions used to prove\nimmateriality are necessary; when they are not satisfied, materiality is\npossible. We discuss possible avenues and obstacles to proving necessity of the\nremaining conditions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
