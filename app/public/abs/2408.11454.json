In this\nwork, we have investigated the validity of the process $\\bar{B}_s^0\\to\nK^0D^0\\pi^0$ as the promising process to confirm the existence of\n$T_{c\\bar{s}}(2900)^0$ resonance. Taking into account the tetraquark state\n$T_{c\\bar{s}}(2900)$, as well as intermediate resonances $K^*(892)$,\n$K_0^*(1430)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$, it has been shown that a clear peak of the\nopen-flavor tetraquark $T_{c\\bar{s}}(2900)$ appears in the $K^0D^0$ invariant\nmass distribution of the process $\\bar{B}_s^0\\to K^0D^0\\pi^0$, which could be\ntested by future experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rIYvYL6oIBGOb9wQIHOqhmPfDegL6HrNUar6f3oZBKc","pdfSize":"2027036"}
