Our model comprises a binary mixture\nof ellipses interacting via the Gay-Berne potential and decorated by surface\npatches, with the binary components being mirror-image variants of each other -\nreferred to as left-handed and right-handed ellipses according to the position\nof their patches. The surface patches are designed so as in the first stage of\nthe assembly the monomers form bent-cores units, i.e. V-shaped dimers with a\nspecific bent angle. The Gay-Berne interactions, which act between the\nellipses, drive the dimers to subsequently form the characteristic phase\nobserved in bent-core liquid crystals. We numerically investigate -- by means\nof both Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations -- the described\ntwo-step process: we first optimize a target bent-core unit and we then fully\ncharacterize its state diagram in temperature and density, defining the regions\nwhere the different liquid crystalline phases dominate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
