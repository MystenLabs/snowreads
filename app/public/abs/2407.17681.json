A well-designed website can engage audiences and deliver\ninformation effectively, yet it remains challenging for BLV developers to\nreview their web designs. We conducted interviews with BLV developers (N=9) and\nanalyzed 20 websites created by BLV developers. BLV developers created highly\naccessible websites but wanted to assess the usability of their websites for\nsighted users and follow the design standards of other websites. They also\nencountered challenges using screen readers to identify illegible text,\nmisaligned elements, and inharmonious colors. We present DesignChecker, a\nbrowser extension that helps BLV developers improve their web designs. With\nDesignChecker, users can assess their current design by comparing it to visual\ndesign guidelines, a reference website of their choice, or a set of similar\nwebsites. DesignChecker also identifies the specific HTML elements that violate\ndesign guidelines and suggests CSS changes for improvements. Our user study\nparticipants (N=8) recognized more visual design errors than using their\ntypical workflow and expressed enthusiasm about using DesignChecker in the\nfuture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
