The randomness introduced by these sources poses significant\nchallenges, leading to the failure of classical direct sampling methods that\nrely on scattered field measurements. To address this issue, we introduce the\nDoubly Cross-Correlating Method (DCM), a novel direct imaging scheme that\nconsists of two major steps. Initially, DCM creates a cross-correlation between\ntwo passive measurements. This specially designed cross-correlation effectively\nhandles the uncontrollability of incident sources and connects to the active\nscattering model via the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff identity. Subsequently, this\ncross-correlation is used to create a correlation-based imaging function that\ncan qualitatively identify the obstacle. The stability and resolution of DCM\nare theoretically analyzed. Extensive numerical examples, including scenarios\nwith two closely positioned obstacles and multiscale obstacles, demonstrate\nthat DCM is computationally efficient, stable, and fast.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
