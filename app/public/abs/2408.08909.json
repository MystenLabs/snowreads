Setting the same privacy budget for each\nround will result in reduced accuracy in training. The existing methods of the\nadjustment of privacy budget consider fewer influencing factors and tend to\nignore the boundaries, resulting in unreasonable privacy budgets. Therefore, we\nproposed an adaptive differential privacy method based on federated learning.\nThe method sets the adjustment coefficient and scoring function according to\naccuracy, loss, training rounds, and the number of datasets and clients. And\nthe privacy budget is adjusted based on them. Then the local model update is\nprocessed according to the scaling factor and the noise. Fi-nally, the server\naggregates the noised local model update and distributes the noised global\nmodel. The range of parameters and the privacy of the method are analyzed.\nThrough the experimental evaluation, it can reduce the privacy budget by about\n16%, while the accuracy remains roughly the same.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
