A promising solution to alleviate performance degradation is using\npower electronics interfaced energy resources, such as renewable generators and\nbattery energy storage for primary frequency control, by adjusting their power\noutput set-points in response to frequency deviations. However, designing a\nfrequency controller under time-varying inertia is challenging. Specifically,\nthe stability or optimality of controllers designed for time-invariant systems\ncan be compromised once applied to a time-varying system. We model the\nfrequency dynamics under time-varying inertia as a nonlinear switching system,\nwhere the frequency dynamics under each mode are described by the nonlinear\nswing equations and different modes represent different inertia levels. We\nidentify a key controller structure, named Neural Proportional-Integral\n(Neural-PI) controller, that guarantees exponential input-to-state stability\nfor each mode. To further improve performance, we present an online\nevent-triggered switching algorithm to select the most suitable controller from\na set of Neural-PI controllers, each optimized for specific inertia levels.\nSimulations on the IEEE 39-bus system validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed online switching control method with stability guarantees and\noptimized performance for frequency control under time-varying inertia.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
