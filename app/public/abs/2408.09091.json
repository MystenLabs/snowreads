As a corollary,\nwe get a version of Girth Alternative for groups acting geometrically: any such\ngroup is either {locally finite}-by-{virtually abelian} or it has infinite\ngirth. We produce counterexamples to show that the alternative fails in the\ngeneral class of groups acting cocompactly on finite dimensional CAT(0) cube\ncomplexes by obtaining examples of non virtually solvable groups which satisfy\na law.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RSCiOFtXREjRwoew2Lvrt2RHFoHobiM0SviqQ4J0zMI","pdfSize":"269518"}
