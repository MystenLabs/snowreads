For example, in approaches based on\nimaginary-time evolution, the spectrum falls off exponentially with the energy,\nensuring rapid convergence. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate\nmatrix product state ground states, such as those obtained with the density\nmatrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states,\ncontributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high\nenergy, with an increase in bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the\nextent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra, which appear to be a\ngeneral feature of compressed wavefunctions, have a strong effect on\nsampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. For example, estimating\nthe energy variance using sampling performs much more poorly than one might\nexpect. Bounding the most extreme samples makes the variance estimate much less\nnoisy but introduces a strong bias. However, we find that this biased variance\nestimator is an excellent surrogate for the variance when extrapolating the\nground-state energy, and this approach outperforms competing extrapolation\nmethods in both accuracy and computational cost.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
