We show that\na major portion of this logarithmic window can be ruled-out based on the Solar\nSystem ephemeris, given that the external mass enclosed within 50 au from the\nSun did not change by more than $\\sim 5\\times 10^{-14}$ solar masses per year\nin recent decades.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
