By assuming a neutrino factory\nas a staging scenario of a muon collider at the J-PARC site, we find that the\n${\\nu}_e \\to {\\nu}_{\\mu}$ oscillation probabilities can be measured with a good\naccuracy at the Hyper-Kamiokande detector. By comparing with the probability of\nthe time-reversal process, ${\\nu}_{\\mu} \\to {\\nu}_e$, measured at the T2K/T2HK\nexperiments, one can determine the CP phase $\\delta$ in the neutrino mixing\nmatrix if $| \\sin(\\delta)|$ is large enough. The determination of $\\delta$ can\nbe made with poor knowledge of the matter density of the earth as T violation\nis almost insensitive to the matter effects. The comparison of CP and\nT-violation measurements, ${\\it \\`a\\ la}$ the CPT theorem, provides us with a\nnon-trivial check of the three neutrino paradigm based on the quantum field\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
