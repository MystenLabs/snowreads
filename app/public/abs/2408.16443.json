We study how\nAI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where\nproduction requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production\nby matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use\nknowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where\nmachines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in\ndimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially\nunderperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor\nincome initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that\nmaximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge\ndimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all\ndimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously\nperforms as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively\nstrong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively\nweak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can\ncreate significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
