In this study, we calculate the\ncontribution of TDEs to the diffuse neutrino by employing the outflow-cloud\nmodel within the TDE framework. Our analysis indicates that the contribution of\nTDEs becomes negligible when the redshift $Z$ exceeds 2. Employing a set of\nfiducial values, which includes outflow energy $E_{\\rm kin}=10^{51}$ erg, a\nproton spectrum cutoff energy $E_{\\rm p,max}=100$ PeV, a volume TDE rate\n$\\dot{N}=8 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\rm Mpc^{-3}\\ year^{-1}$, covering fraction of\nclouds $C_V=0.1$, energy conversion efficiency in the shock $\\eta =0.1$, and a\nproton spectrum index $\\Gamma=-1.7$, we find that TDEs can account for\napproximately 80\\% of the contribution at energies around 0.3 PeV.\nAdditionally, TDEs still contribute around 18\\% to the IceCube data below 0.1\nPeV and the total contribution is $\\sim 24^{+2}_{-15}\\%$. In addition, we also\ndiscuss the potential influence of various parameter values on the results in\ndetail. With the IceCube data, we impose constraints on the combination of the\nphysical parameters, i.e., $C_{f}=\\dot{N}E_{\\rm kin}C_{\\rm v}\\eta$. Future\nobservations or theoretical considerations would fix some physical parameters,\nwhich will help to constrain some individual parameters of TDEs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
