Using\nnitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we implement $T_2$ (spin-decoherence)\nnoise magnetometry to study critical dynamics in a 2D Van der Waals magnet\nCrSBr. By analyzing NV decoherence on time scales approaching the\ncharacteristic correlation time $\\tau_c$ of critical fluctuations, we extract\nthe critical exponent $\\nu$ for the correlation length. Our result deviates\nfrom the Ising prediction and highlights the role of long-range dipolar\ninteractions in 2D CrSBr. Furthermore, analyzing the divergence of the\ncorrelation length suggests the possibility of 2D-XY criticality in CrSBr in a\ntemperature window near $T_C$ where static magnetic domains are absent. Our\nwork provides a first demonstration of $T_2$ noise magnetometry to\nquantitatively analyze critical scaling behavior in 2D materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6dJqfqmFxE9dG55OSN3Ek6utqmWy1MezyXJ8M3Nm_nE","pdfSize":"22918692"}
