Leveraging adversarial debate and a novel dual entropy theory,\nEVINCE improves prediction accuracy, robustness, and stability in LLMs by\nintegrating statistical modeling, information theory, and machine learning to\nbalance diverse perspective exploration with strong prior exploitation. The\nframework's effectiveness is demonstrated through consistent convergence of\ninformation-theoretic metrics, particularly improved mutual information,\nfostering productive LLM collaboration. We apply EVINCE to healthcare, showing\nimproved disease diagnosis, and discuss its broader implications for\ndecision-making across domains. This work provides theoretical foundations and\nempirical validation for EVINCE, paving the way for advancements in LLM\ncollaboration and AGI development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
