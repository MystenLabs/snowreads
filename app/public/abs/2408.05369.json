The proposed eye-tracking system is based on machine\nlearning algorithms, a standard webcam, and two personal computers that\nconstitute, respectively, the \"Measurement Sub-System\" performing the test on\nthe patients and the \"Test Management Sub-System\" used by medical staff for\nconfiguring the test protocol, recording the patient data, monitoring the test\nand storing the test results. The system also integrates an stress estimator\nbased on the measurement of heart rate variability obtained with\nphotoplethysmography.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
