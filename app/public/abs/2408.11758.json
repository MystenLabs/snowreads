Particularly, the\nscanning strategies of Mamba are crucial for effective contextual knowledge\nmodeling in the restoration process despite it relying on selective state space\nmodeling for all tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient dual-interleaved\nscanning paradigm (DIS) for CSR, which is composed of two scanning strategies:\n(i) hierarchical interleaved scanning is designed to comprehensively capture\nand utilize the most potential contextual information within an image by\nsimultaneously taking advantage of the local window-based and sequential\nscanning methods; (ii) horizontal-to-vertical interleaved scanning is proposed\nto reduce the computational cost by leaving the redundancy between the scanning\nof different directions. To overcome the non-uniform compression artifacts, we\nalso propose position-aligned cross-scale scanning to model multi-scale\ncontextual information. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks have shown\nthe great performance of our MambaCSR in the compressed image super-resolution\ntask. The code will be soon available\nin~\\textcolor{magenta}{\\url{https://github.com/renyulin-f/MambaCSR}}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"M2rFtHfesEI2hhYOuLSE2PJNjQGB-rf-5oJjqnZBkQg","pdfSize":"1776521"}
