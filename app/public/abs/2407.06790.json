Combined with nuclear physics\nconstraints from chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT), and masses and\ntidal deformabilities inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary\nneutron star mergers, this has lead to a steady improvement in our\nunderstanding of the dense matter equation of state (EOS). Here we consider the\nimpact of several new results: the radius measurement for the 1.42$\\,M_\\odot$\npulsar PSR J0437$-$4715 presented by Choudhury et al. (2024), updates to the\nmasses and radii of PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, and new $\\chi$EFT\nresults for neutron star matter up to 1.5 times nuclear saturation density.\nUsing two different high-density EOS extensions -- a piecewise-polytropic (PP)\nmodel and a model based on the speed of sound in a neutron star (CS) -- we find\nthe radius of a 1.4$\\,M_\\odot$ (2.0$\\,M_\\odot$) neutron star to be constrained\nto the 95\\% credible ranges $12.28^{+0.50}_{-0.76}\\,$km\n($12.33^{+0.70}_{-1.34}\\,$km) for the PP model and $12.01^{+0.56}_{-0.75}\\,$km\n($11.55^{+0.94}_{-1.09}\\,$km) for the CS model. The maximum neutron star mass\nis predicted to be $2.15^{+0.14}_{-0.16}\\,$$M_\\odot$ and\n$2.08^{+0.28}_{-0.16}\\,$$M_\\odot$ for the PP and CS model, respectively. We\nexplore the sensitivity of our results to different orders and different\ndensities up to which $\\chi$EFT is used, and show how the astrophysical\nobservations provide constraints for the pressure at intermediate densities.\nMoreover, we investigate the difference $R_{2.0} - R_{1.4}$ of the radius of\n2$\\,M_\\odot$ and 1.4$\\,M_\\odot$ neutron stars within our EOS inference.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
