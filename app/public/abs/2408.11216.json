Using light-dimerizable\nkinesin motors to spatially control the formation and contraction of a\nmicrotubule network, we deliberately photobleach a grid pattern onto the\nfilament network serving as a transient and dynamic coordinate system to\nobserve the deformation and translation of the remaining fluorescent squares of\nmicrotubules. We find that the network contracts at a rate set by motor speed\nbut is accompanied by a diffusive-like spread throughout the bulk of the\ncontracting network with effective diffusion constant two orders of magnitude\nlower than that for a freely-diffusing microtubule. We further find that on\nmicron scales, the diffusive timescale is only a factor of approximately 3\nslower than that of advection regardless of conditions, showing that the global\ncontraction and long-time relaxation from this diffusive behavior are both\nmotor-driven but exhibit local competition within the network bulk.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
