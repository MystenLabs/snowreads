Traditional Hebrew\ncontains Diacritics, which dictate the way individuals should pronounce given\nwords, however, modern Hebrew rarely uses them. The lack of diacritics in\nmodern Hebrew results in readers expected to conclude the correct pronunciation\nand understand which phonemes to use based on the context. This imposes a\nfundamental challenge on TTS systems to accurately map between text-to-speech.\nIn this work, we propose to adopt a language modeling Diacritics-Free approach,\nfor the task of Hebrew TTS. The model operates on discrete speech\nrepresentations and is conditioned on a word-piece tokenizer. We optimize the\nproposed method using in-the-wild weakly supervised data and compare it to\nseveral diacritic-based TTS systems. Results suggest the proposed method is\nsuperior to the evaluated baselines considering both content preservation and\nnaturalness of the generated speech.
