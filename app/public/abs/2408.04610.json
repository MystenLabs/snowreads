One of the main barriers is the challenge of domain\ngeneralisation, which requires segmentation models to maintain high performance\nacross a wide distribution of image data. This challenge is amplified by the\nmany factors that contribute to the diverse appearance of medical images, such\nas acquisition conditions and patient characteristics. The impact of shifting\npatient characteristics such as age and sex on segmentation performance remains\nrelatively under-studied, especially for abdominal organs, despite that this is\ncrucial for ensuring the fairness of the segmentation model. We perform the\nfirst study to determine the impact of population shift with respect to age and\nsex on abdominal CT image segmentation, by leveraging two large public\ndatasets, and introduce a novel metric to quantify the impact. We find that\npopulation shift is a challenge similar in magnitude to cross-dataset shift for\nabdominal organ segmentation, and that the effect is asymmetric and\ndataset-dependent. We conclude that dataset diversity in terms of known patient\ncharacteristics is not necessarily equivalent to dataset diversity in terms of\nimage features. This implies that simple population matching to ensure good\ngeneralisation and fairness may be insufficient, and we recommend that fairness\nresearch should be directed towards better understanding and quantifying\nmedical image dataset diversity in terms of performance-relevant\ncharacteristics such as organ morphology.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
