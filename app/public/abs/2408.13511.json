The cut-off function technique is employed\nto construct trial functions that precisely satisfy the homogeneous boundary\nconditions. This approach eliminates the error caused by the standard boundary\npenalty method, improves the overall accuracy of the method, as demonstrated by\nthe typical numerical examples. Under the assumption that the eigenfunctions\nbelong to a spectral Barron space, we derive an explicit convergence rate of\nthe generalization error of the proposed method, which does not suffer from the\ncurse of dimensionality. We verify the assumption by proving a new regularity\nshift result for the eigenfunctions when the potential function belongs to an\nappropriate spectral Barron space. Moreover, we extend the generalization error\nbound to the normalized penalty method, which is widely used in practice.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
