Our analysis reveals that reducing the rank by one results in a\nsubstantial increase in the number of regular polytopes ($33$ distinct families\nare discovered) covering all possible ranks (even and odd).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ePx6e4SqEX-J1RMigV2fE6fptQNGSgfwyid6aKobfrM","pdfSize":"385499","objectId":"0x9ba64de50641c20f43a02df38c6535cbe62a0db52813e1b1f6b58d838412fb41","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
