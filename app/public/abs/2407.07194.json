If $X$ is a smooth\nvariety over a field of characteristic $p \\geq 0$, then a positive answer to\nthis question follows up to $p$-torsion from resolution of singularities by\nalterations. However, if $X$ is singular, then this is no longer necessarily\nso: we give examples of motivic cohomology classes of a singular scheme $X$\nthat are not $p$-torsion and are not expressible as such pushforwards. A\nconsequence of our result is that the Chow ring of a singular variety cannot be\nexpressed as a quotient of its algebraic cobordism ring, as suggested by the\nfirst-named-author in his thesis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
