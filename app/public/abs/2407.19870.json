We give an upper bound for\nanti-canonical volumes of $d$-dimensional $\\frac{1}{q}$-lc toric Fano\nvarieties, which corresponds to an upper bound for the dual normalized volumes\nof the associated $d$-dimensional $\\frac{1}{q}$-lc Fano polytopes. And we also\nconstruct examples to show that these upper bounds are optimal. Besides, we\nprovide an optimal upper bound for volumes of $d$-dimensional lattice simplices\n$S$ such that $\\frac{1}{q}S$ has exactly one interior lattice point.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
