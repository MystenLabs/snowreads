A prominent example is two parallel 1D Bose gases, which simulate 1D\nquantum field theories through the phase difference probed by interference.\nHere we introduce a method to extract the total phase of the combined system\nbased on a general principle of reconstructing phase gradient from density\ndynamics using continuity equation. This approach reveals the previously hidden\nsector of the sum mode of the two 1D Bose gases. We validate our technique\nnumerically and demonstrate its effectiveness by analysing data from selected\nexperiments, showcasing how our method expands the scope and capabilities of\ncold-atomic quantum simulators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GwmeOAi2DVuRup-_-qRwACrf39spcoZTMONcxM_JtDU","pdfSize":"2932367"}
