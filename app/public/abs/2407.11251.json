We develop a prototype that collects soil in\nheterogeneous terrain. If mounted to a mobile robot, it can be used to perform\nsoil collection and analysis without human intervention. Unique among soil\nsampling robots, we use a general-purpose robotic arm rather than a soil core\nsampler.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
