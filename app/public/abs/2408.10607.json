Quantum resource advantages offer significant enhancements to the\nsensitivity of gravitational wave observatories. While squeezed states for\nground-based gravitational wave detection have received marked attention, the\ngeneration of squeezed states suitable for mid-to-low-frequency detection has\nremained unexplored. To address the gap in squeezed state optical fields at\nultra-low frequencies, we report on the first direct observation of a squeezed\nvacuum field until Fourier frequency of 4 millihertz with the quantum noise\nreduction of up to 8 dB, by the employment of a multiple noise suppression\nscheme. Our work provides quantum resources for future gravitational wave\nobservatories, facilitating the development of quantum precision measurement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
