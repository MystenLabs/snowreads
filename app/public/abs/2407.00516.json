We\ncompute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive\nregime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative\nderivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result\ndoes not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum\nrelaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this\nnature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may\nalso provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the\nspin Hall effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
