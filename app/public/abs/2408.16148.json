We generalize and\nresolve the Pan-Xu conjecture on generalized Mneimneh-like sums and present\ntheir transformation. As an application, we deduce new reduction formulas for\nspecific multiple polylogarithms enabling lowering their depth, and provide\nadditional findings on arithmetic means of multiple harmonic-star values,\nresulting in new representations of arbitrary multiple zeta-star values.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
