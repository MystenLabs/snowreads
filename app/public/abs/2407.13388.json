Here we explore the impact of nightside thermal emission on\nhigh-resolution infrared transmission spectroscopy, which should not be\nneglected, especially for UHJs. We present a general equation for the\nhigh-resolution transmission spectrum that includes planetary nightside thermal\nemission. This provides a new way to infer the thermal structure of the\nplanetary nightside with high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. Using the\ncross-correlation technique, we find evidence for the presence of an H$_2$O\nemission signature on the UHJ WASP-33b during the transit, indicating an\ninverted temperature structure on its nightside. Such a result suggests a\nstronger heat transport through the circulation than currently expected. An\nalternative explanation is that the rotating visible hemisphere during transit\nleads to the potential contribution of the limb and dayside atmospheres to the\ndetected emission signature. In the future, the combination of high-resolution\nfull-phase curve spectroscopic observations and general circulation models will\nhopefully solve this puzzle and provide a complete picture of the\nthree-dimensional nature of the chemistry, circulation, and thermal structure\nof UHJs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
