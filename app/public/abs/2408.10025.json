The\nresults show that with fixed collision energies, the total cross-sections for\nleptonic and hadronic productions in final states depend strongly on the\nparameters of the unparticle physics and muon beam polarization. The total\ncross-sections achieve the maximum value when both of muon beams polarize left\nor right and the minimum value when the $\\mu^{-}$ beam polarizes left, the\n$\\mu^{+}$ beam polarizes right and vice versa. In case of the different\npolarization, the cross-section increases as the collision energy increases and\nit changes insignificantly in case of the unpolarized muon beams. In\nparticular, the cross-section for leptonic productions in final states is much\nlarger than that of hadronic productions under same conditions. With the\nbenchmark background $(\\Lambda_{U}, d_{U})$ $= (1 $TeV$, 1.9)$, the\ncross-sections reach the maximum value. The integrated luminosity value is\nshown to correspond to a significance larger than $5\\sigma$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wf-n2qcJBnkqIHOC6EKWehAS15Eowy39lrTGt4iaq1E","pdfSize":"639154"}
