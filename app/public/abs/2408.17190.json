More precisely, we discuss an approach for\nreasoning with inconsistent information using maximal consistent subsignatures,\nwhere a maximal consistent subsignature is a maximal set of propositions such\nthat forgetting the remaining propositions restores consistency. We analyse\nmaximal consistent subsignatures and the corresponding minimal inconsistent\nsubsignatures in-depth and show, among others, that the hitting set duality\napplies for them as well. We further analyse inference relations based on\nmaximal consistent subsignatures wrt. rationality postulates from non-monotonic\nreasoning and computational complexity. We also consider the relationship of\nour approach with inconsistency measurement and paraconsistent reasoning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pwj1Zcsebw2H8U8Jd1f68Sw2mNEnVIUmebA6FtfqxJ0","pdfSize":"268025"}
