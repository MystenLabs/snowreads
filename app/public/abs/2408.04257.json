For every integer $n\n\\geq |G|$, let $f(n,G|F)$ denote the smallest integer $k$ such that any edge\ncoloring of the complete graph $K_n$ with at least $k$ colors forces a copy of\n$G$ in which each color class induces a member of $F$. Observe that in\nanti-Ramsey problems each color class is a single edge; i.e., $F=\\{K_2\\}$.\n  In our previous paper [arXiv:2405.19812], attention was given mostly to the\ncase where $F$ is hereditary under subgraph inclusion. In the present work we\nconsider coloring problems inspired by odd-coloring and conflict-free coloring.\nAs we shall see, dealing with these problems requires distinct additional tools\nto those used in our first paper on the subject.\n  Among the many results introduced in this paper, we mention:\n  (1) For every graph $G$, there exists a constant $c=c(G)$ such that in any\nedge coloring of $K_n$ with at least $cn$ colors there is a copy of $G$ in\nwhich every vertex $v$ is incident with an edge whose color appears only once\namong all edges incident with $v$.\n  (2) In sharp contrast to the above result we prove that if $F$ is the class\nof all odd graphs (having vertices with odd degrees only) then\n$f(n,K_k|F)=(1+o(1))$ex$(n,K_{\\lceil k/2 \\rceil})$, which is quadratic for $k\n\\geq 5$.\n  (3) We exactly determine $f(n,G|F)$ for small graphs when $F$ belongs to\nseveral families representing various odd/even coloring constraints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
