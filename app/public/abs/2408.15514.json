In particular, we obtain\nintegral Shi-type estimates for the flow by adapting a integration-by-parts\ntype argument instead of the usual maximum principle techniques. Following\nthis, we prescribe a sufficient smallness condition on $\\alpha'$ in order to\nextend the flow on $[0,\\tau)$ to $[0,\\tau + \\epsilon)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
