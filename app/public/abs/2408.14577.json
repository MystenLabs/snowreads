With it,\nnew methodologies are being developed and implemented to improve the accuracy\nof simulations while reducing the computational cost. In particular, specific\nmachine-learning techniques have been applied to build interatomic potential\nfrom ab initio results. Here, We report an energy-free machine-learning\ncalculator that combines three individually trained neural networks to predict\nthe energy and atomic forces of particulate matter. Three structures were\ninvestigated: a monometallic nanoparticle, a bimetallic nanoalloy, and a\nsupported metal crystallites. Atomic energies were predicted via a graph neural\nnetwork, leading to a mean absolute error (MAE) within 0.004 eV from Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) calculations. The task of predicting atomic forces was\nsplit over two feedforward networks, one predicting the force's norm and\nanother its direction. The force prediction resulted in a MAE within 0.080 eV/A\nagainst DFT results. The interpretability of the graph neural network\npredictions was demonstrated by underlying the physics of the monometallic\nparticle in the form of cohesion energy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
