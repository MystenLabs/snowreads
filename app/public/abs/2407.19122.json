A Clifford-Bianchi group is a group of the form\n$\\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathcal{O})$ with $\\mathcal{O}$ as above. The present\npaper is about the actions of $\\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathcal{O})$ acting on\nhyperbolic space $\\mathcal{H}^{n+1}$ via M\\\"{o}bius transformations $x\\mapsto\n(ax+b)(cx+d)^{-1}$.\n  We develop the general theory of orders exhibiting explicit orders in low\ndimensions of interest. These include, for example, higher-dimensional analogs\nof the Hurwitz order. We develop the abstract and computational theory for\ndetermining their fundamental domains and generators and relations\n(higher-dimensional Bianchi-Humbert Theory). We make connections to the\nclassical literature on symmetric spaces and arithmetic groups and provide a\nproof that these groups are $\\mathbb{Z}$-points of a $\\mathbb{Z}$-group scheme\nand are arithmetic subgroups of $\\operatorname{SO}_{1,n+1}(\\mathbb{R})^{\\circ}$\nwith their M\\\"{o}bius action. We report on our findings concerning certain\nClifford-Bianchi groups acting on $\\mathcal{H}^4$, $\\mathcal{H}^5$, and\n$\\mathcal{H}^6$ .\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
