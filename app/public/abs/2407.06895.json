To that purpose we analytically calculated the free area\nof a frozen oriented or freely rotating particle inside the cavity formed by\nits neighbours in a chiral configuration of their orientations. From the most\nsuccessful versions of the theory we predict an equation of state which,\ndespite being derived from a crystal configuration of particles, describes very\nreasonably the equation of state of the 6-atic liquid-crystal phase at packing\nfractions not very close from the isotropic-6-atic bifurcation. Also, the same\nequation of state performs well when compared to that from MC simulations for\nthe stable crystal phase. The agreement can even be improved by selecting\nadequate values for the angle of chirality.Despite the success of two of the\nversions of the theory for the pressure, we show that the free-energy is an\nincreasing function of the angle of chirality, implying that the most stable\nphase is the achiral phase. Furthermore, we show that possible clustering\neffects, such as the formation of perfect chiral hexagonal clusters, which in\nturn crystallize into an hexagonal lattice, cannot explain the presence of the\nchirality observed in simulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
