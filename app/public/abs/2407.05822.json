Their design, implementation\nand their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from the correctness of software to\nthe properties of formal systems, have been the focus of considerable research\nover the last three decades.\n  The LFMTP workshop brought together designers, implementors and practitioners\nto discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical\nframeworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and\nco-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressiveness and lucidity of the\nreasoning process.\n  The 2024 instance of LFMTP was organized by Florian Rabe and Claudio\nSacerdoti Coen in Tallinn, Estonia, the 8th July, as a satellite event of the\nFSCD conference. The workshop received 8 submissions, of which 6 were presented\nat the workshop. Of these, 2 were work-in-progress presentations, and 4 were\naccepted for these formal proceedings. Additionally, Carsten Sch\\\"urmann of IT\nUniversity of Copenhagen gave an invited talk on Nominal State Separating\nProofs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
