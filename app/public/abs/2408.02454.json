Our goal is to\ncompute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific\ntraversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating\nin crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational\nAutoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to\ngenerate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and\na visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic\nunderstanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the\ncontextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various\noutdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other\nglobal navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35%\nimprovement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like\nnavigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
