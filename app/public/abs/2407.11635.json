We analyze the data\nusing QCD perturbation theory at NNLO accuracy, employing approximations\nprovided by the threshold resummation formalism in cases where full NNLO\nresults for partonic hard-scattering functions are not readily available. Our\nnumerical results suggest a remarkable perturbative stability of the extracted\nhelicity PDFs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IJsIcmf9dYRiTWYLOlvDYl1qfFvOoJvkqXETMNpR9fU","pdfSize":"227625"}
