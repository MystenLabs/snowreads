The\ncharacterization of the $k$-smoothness of operators between Hilbert spaces\nfollows as a direct consequence of our study. We also investigate the\n$k$-smoothness of operators between polyhedral Banach spaces. In particular, we\nshow that the $k$-smoothness of rank $1$ operators between polyhedral spaces\ndepends heavily on the dimension of the corresponding spaces rather than the\ngeometry of the spaces. The results obtained in this article generalize and\nimprove upon the existing results in the $k$-smoothness of operators between\nBanach spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
