Our approach\nuses a singular value decomposition of a conditional expectation operator,\nfollowed by a saddle-point optimization problem, which, in the context of IV\nregression, can be thought of as a neural net generalization of the seminal\napproach due to Darolles et al. [2011]. Saddle-point formulations have gathered\nconsiderable attention recently, as they can avoid double sampling bias and are\namenable to modern function approximation methods. We provide experimental\nvalidation in various settings, and show that our approach outperforms existing\nmethods on common benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
