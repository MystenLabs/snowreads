We show\nthe connection between these factorizations and the essential norm of the\nadjoint operator. As a consequence of our results, we conclude that the\nessential norm is minimal for the Calkin algebra of these spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
