The purpose of this paper is to provide a\nbetter scheme of identification for extragalactic SNRs and, in particular, to\ndistinguish between HII regions and SNRs. For that we have used diagrams which\ninvolve both the [SII]/H$\\alpha$ ratio and the velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$).\nWe also introduce a new parameter, $\\xi = {[SII] \\over H\\alpha} \\times \\sigma$,\nwhich enhances still the contrast between SNRs and the rest of the ionised gas.\nMore than 90\\% of the SNRs in our entire sample show an integrated\n[SII]/H$\\alpha$ ratio larger than the canonical value (0.4). 86\\% of the SNRs\npresent in our field show a significant velocity dispersion. The spectral\nresolution of our observations allows us to observe the complex velocity\nstructure of some SNRs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
