Symplectic Bregman\ndivergences are derived from a symplectic generalization of the Fenchel-Young\ninequality which relies on the notion of symplectic subdifferentials. The\nsymplectic Fenchel-Young inequality is obtained using the symplectic Fenchel\ntransform which is defined with respect to the symplectic form. Since\nsymplectic forms can be generically built from pairings of dual systems, we get\na generalization of Bregman divergences in dual systems obtained by equivalent\nsymplectic Bregman divergences. In particular, when the symplectic form is\nderived from an inner product, we show that the corresponding symplectic\nBregman divergences amount to ordinary Bregman divergences with respect to\ncomposite inner products. Some potential applications of symplectic divergences\nin geometric mechanics, information geometry, and learning dynamics in machine\nlearning are touched upon.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
