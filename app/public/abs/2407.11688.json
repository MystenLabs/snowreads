We prove a\nuniform spectral gap estimate for the transfer operator corresponding to the\nderivative cocycle and every given self-conformal measure. Building on this\nresult, we establish polynomial Fourier decay for any such measure. Our\ntechnique is based on a refinement of a method of Oh-Winter (2017) where we do\nnot require separation from the IFS or the Federer property for the underlying\nmeasure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
