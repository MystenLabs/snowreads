In this paper, we\nintroduce Scalable and Adaptive Spectral Embedding (SASE), a simple attributed\ngraph clustering method devoid of parameter learning. SASE comprises three main\ncomponents: node features smoothing via $k$-order simple graph convolution,\nscalable spectral clustering using random Fourier features, and adaptive order\nselection. With these designs, SASE not only effectively captures global\ncluster structures but also exhibits linear time and space complexity relative\nto the graph size. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of SASE. For\nexample, on the ArXiv dataset with 169K nodes and 1.17M edges, SASE achieves a\n6.9\\% improvement in ACC and a $5.87\\times$ speedup compared to the runner-up,\nS3GC.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
