A common approach to privacy preservation is to\nremove personally identifiable information from a captured image, but there is\na risk of the original image being leaked. In this paper, we propose a\npre-capture privacy-aware imaging method that captures images from which the\ndetails of a pre-specified anonymized target have been eliminated. The proposed\nmethod applies a single-pixel imaging framework in which we introduce a\nfeedback mechanism called an aperture pattern generator. The introduced\naperture pattern generator adaptively outputs the next aperture pattern to\navoid sampling the anonymized target by exploiting the data already acquired as\na clue. Furthermore, the anonymized target can be set to any object without\nchanging hardware. Except for detailed features which have been removed from\nthe anonymized target, the captured images are of comparable quality to those\ncaptured by a general camera and can be used for various computer vision\napplications. In our work, we target faces and license plates and\nexperimentally show that the proposed method can capture clear images in which\ndetailed features of the anonymized target are eliminated to achieve both\nprivacy and utility.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
