It follows that two knots of\nconstant curvature in $R^3$ are isotopic, resp. homotopic, through curves of\nconstant curvature if and only if they are isotopic, resp. homotopic, and their\nself-linking numbers, resp. self-linking numbers mod $2$, are equal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
