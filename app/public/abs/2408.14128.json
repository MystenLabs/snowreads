They have effective diameters of (3.6-10.0)\nkpc and effective surface brightness of (26.2--27.3)$^m/$sq.arcsec. We note\nthat the LDD galaxies tend to occur in small groups with a very low dispersion\nof radial velocities. The total (orbital) mass of the triplets approximately\nequals to their integral stellar mass within velocity measurement errors. The\npresence of LDD galaxies in cold multiple systems seems mysterious.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
