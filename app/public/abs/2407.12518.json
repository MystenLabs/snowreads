Second-order systems that only rely on a\nviscous damping may suffer from oscillation problems towards the minima, while\nthe inclusion of a Hessian-driven damping term is known to reduce this effect\nwithout explicit construction of the Hessian in practice. There are essentially\ntwo ways to introduce the Hessian-driven damping term: explicitly or\nimplicitly. For each setting, we provide conditions on the damping coefficients\nto ensure convergence of the gradient towards zero. Moreover, if the objective\nfunction is definable, we show global convergence of the trajectory towards a\ncritical point as well as convergence rates. Besides, in the autonomous case,\nif the objective function is Morse, we conclude that the trajectory converges\nto a local minimum of the objective for almost all initializations. We also\nstudy algorithmic schemes for both dynamics and prove all the previous\nproperties in the discrete setting under proper choice of the step-size.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
