However, many\nsingle-stage models still lag behind in audio quality, particularly when\nhandling Kurdish text and speech. There is a critical need to enhance\ntext-to-speech conversion for the Kurdish language, particularly for the Sorani\ndialect, which has been relatively neglected and is underrepresented in recent\ntext-to-speech advancements. This study introduces an end-to-end TTS model for\nefficiently generating high-quality Kurdish audio. The proposed method\nleverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) that is pre-trained for audio\nwaveform reconstruction and is augmented by adversarial training. This involves\naligning the prior distribution established by the pre-trained encoder with the\nposterior distribution of the text encoder within latent variables.\nAdditionally, a stochastic duration predictor is incorporated to imbue\nsynthesized Kurdish speech with diverse rhythms. By aligning latent\ndistributions and integrating the stochastic duration predictor, the proposed\nmethod facilitates the real-time generation of natural Kurdish speech audio,\noffering flexibility in pitches and rhythms. Empirical evaluation via the mean\nopinion score (MOS) on a custom dataset confirms the superior performance of\nour approach (MOS of 3.94) compared with that of a one-stage system and other\ntwo-staged systems as assessed through a subjective human evaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"txeOMtDwg9IZdRT5b3aNW2OHiNln9JVIIDX_LeCrD4Q","pdfSize":"1219884"}
