It is\nbased on a three-year action research conducted during the implementation of\nthe Microsoft Teams collaborative platform at a university. The aim is to\nunderstand how groups of students organize themselves to carry out complex\nprojects over a long period of time and with varying distance constraints.\nDifferences in the appropriation of the new tool appeared depending on whether\nthe mode of work was cooperative or collaborative. To understand these\ndifferent dynamics, we mobilize Vygotsky's activity theories (TA), more\nprecisely Engestr{\\\"o}m's 2nd generation TA model (2000). The results reveal\nthe role of leaders through the cooperation versus collaboration tension. In\nteams, a leader emerges who organizes cooperation but slows down the\nappropriation of collaborative features of the new information system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
