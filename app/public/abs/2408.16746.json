Significant\ncontributions to both linear and nonlinear OAC and RIC are observed. Our\nfindings reveal that variations of the mass parameter modify the intersubband\ndipole matrix elements and energy intervals, leading to noticeable shifts in\noptical properties. The results show that higher {\\gamma} values shift\nresonance peaks towards higher energies, while changes in the oscillator\nfrequency result in abrupt shifts and peak diminutions. These insights provide\na deeper understanding of the optical behaviors in the quantum systems under\nconsideration, paving the way for designing devices with optimal efficiency\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
