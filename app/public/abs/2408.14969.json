To evaluate the proposed wireless scenario, we first introduce the\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF)\nof the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each node, using the central limit\ntheorem and the Gaussian copula function. We then derive a compact analytical\nexpression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP). Our numerical results\nreveal how the incorporation of FAS and RIS can significantly enhance the\nperformance of secure communications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
