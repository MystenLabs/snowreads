In this Letter, we demonstrate the\nencoding of information in 32 time bins or dimensions of a single photon. A\npractical scheme for manipulating the single photon in high dimensions is\nexperimentally realized to implement a compiled version of Shor's algorithm on\na single photon. Our work demonstrates the powerful information processing\ncapacity of a high-dimensional quantum system for complex quantum information\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
