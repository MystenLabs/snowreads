We present a new covariant expression to set the scale that arises\nwhen examining the field equations. Considering the renormalization group\nequations and imposing energy-momentum tensor conservation, we arrive at two\nmodels of running of the gravitational and cosmological constants. In the\ncosmological setting, we found that in one model the Big Bang singularity is\navoided, while in the other the Hubble tension can be alleviated. At the level\nof cosmological perturbations, we derived the basic solutions and qualitatively\ndiscussed the impacts of this scenario on structure formation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
