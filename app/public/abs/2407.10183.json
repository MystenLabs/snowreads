In this paper, we prove in\n$\\mathsf{ZF}$ (without the axiom of choice) several results concerning this\nnotion, among which are the following:\n  (1) For each infinite set $A$ and natural number $n$, there is no boundedly\nfinite-to-one function from $\\mathcal{S}(A)$ to $\\mathcal{S}_{\\leq n}(A)$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{S}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ and\n$\\mathcal{S}_{\\leq n}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ moving at most\n$n$ points.\n  (2) For each infinite set $A$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function\nfrom $\\mathcal{B}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{fin}(A)$, where $\\mathcal{B}(A)$ is the set\nof all partitions of $A$ whose blocks are finite and $\\mathrm{fin}(A)$ is the\nset of all finite subsets of $A$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
