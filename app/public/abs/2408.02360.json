With high probability, the\niterates' empirical distribution approximates the solution to the primal\nversion of the Auffinger-Chen SDE [Auffinger et al., Communications in\nMathematical Physics, 335, 2015]. The per-iterate change in the modified\nobjective is bounded via a Taylor expansion, where the derivatives are\ncontrolled through Gaussian concentration bounds and smoothness properties of a\nsemiconcave regularization of the Fenchel-Legendre dual to the Parisi PDE.\n  These results lay the groundwork for (possibly) demonstrating low-degree\nsum-of-squares certificates over high-entropy step distributions for a relaxed\nversion of the Parisi formula [Open Question 1.8, arXiv:2401.14383].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TKk39muAS3VPzaPOWIvqORUIOyl_iW1q0OKQL2352AY","pdfSize":"854438"}
