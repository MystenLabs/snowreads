The physical mechanism of this drag relies on the intervalley\nscattering of charge carriers in graphene by the time-dependent potential of\nthe moving crystalline layer. The drag current exhibits a nonlinear Hall\neffect, which can be used for the experimental measurement of the Berry\ncurvature. In turn, the drag of electrons in graphene exerts a back-action on\nthe crystalline layer, which can be expressed in terms of increased dynamic\nviscosity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
