The coupling between the layers is crucial for\nthe resulting physical properties and depends not just on the twist angle but\nalso on the details of the fabrication process. Here, we present an approach\nfor the analysis of this interlayer coupling via Raman spectroscopy. By\nexciting the C-exciton resonance of the TMDCs, optical (high-frequency)\ninterlayer Raman modes are activated that are too weak in intensity at\nexcitation energies far below the C exciton. This is due to the wave function\nof the C exciton, which expands - in contrast to A and B excitons - over both\nlayers and, therefore, couples the layers electronically. We present optical\ninterlayer Raman modes in twisted 2L TMDCs and show that they can be used as a\nmeasure of the interlayer coupling between the individual layers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
