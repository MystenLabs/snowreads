Using data directly collected from the Ethereum\nblockchain, we examine voter activity.\n  We find that in most votes, the \"minimal quorum,\" i.e., the smallest number\nof active voters who could swing the vote is quite small.\n  To understand who is actually driving these DAOs, we use data from the\nEthereum Name Service (ENS), Sybil.org, and Compound, to divide voters into\ndifferent categories.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
