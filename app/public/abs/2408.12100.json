Based on the proximal gradient method, some theoretical results of\nPnP have appeared, where appropriate step size is crucial for convergence\nanalysis. However, in practical applications, applying PnP methods with\ntheoretically guaranteed step sizes is difficult, and these algorithms are\nlimited to Gaussian noise. In this paper,from a perspective of split convex\nfeasibility problems (SCFP), an adaptive PnP algorithm with Projected Landweber\nOperator (PnP-PLO) is proposed to address these issues. Numerical experiments\non image deblurring, super-resolution, and compressed sensing MRI experiments\nillustrate that PnP-PLO with theoretical guarantees outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods such as RED and RED-PRO.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
