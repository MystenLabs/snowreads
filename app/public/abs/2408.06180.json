Sub-stoichiometric Nb$_\\mathrm{2}$O$_\\mathrm{5}$ was deposited\nvia magnetron sputtering and patterned in microscale (2$\\times$2 - 15$\\times$15\n$\\mu$m$^2$) cross-bar Au/Ru/NbO$_\\mathrm{x}$/Pt devices and electroformed at\n3-5 V to make NbO$_\\mathrm{2}$ filaments. At cryogenic temperatures, the\nthreshold voltage ($V_\\mathrm{th}$) increased by more than a factor of 3. The\nhold voltage ($V_\\mathrm{h}$) was significantly lower than the threshold\nvoltage for fast voltage sweeps (200 ms per measurement). If the sample is\nallowed to cool between voltage measurements, the hold voltage increases, but\nnever reaches the threshold voltage, indicating the presence of non-volatile\nNb$_\\mathrm{2}$O$_\\mathrm{5}$ in the filament. The devices have an activation\nenergy of $E_a \\approx 1.4$ eV, lower than other NbO$_\\mathrm{2}$ devices\nreported. Our works shows that even nominally ``bad\" memristive devices can be\nimproved by reducing the leakage current and increases the sample resistance at\ncryogenic temperatures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
