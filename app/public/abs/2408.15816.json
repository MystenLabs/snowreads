Here, we\npresent a methodology to automatically mine species labels from public forest\ninventory data, using available pretrained tree detection models. We identify\ntree instances in aerial imagery and match them with field data with close to\nzero human involvement. We conduct a series of experiments on the resulting\ndataset, and show a beneficial effect when adding noisy or even unlabeled data\npoints, highlighting a strong potential for large-scale individual species\nmapping.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HnjslWxNTciEDvb4SHJRHh9iq4ZmeILIQp6_VDcaMUE","pdfSize":"901339"}
