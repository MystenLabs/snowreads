Our solution is\nbased on the labeled random finite set (LRFS) filtering approach, which in\nprinciple, addresses disappearance, appearance, reappearance, and occlusion via\na single Bayesian recursion. However, in practice, existing numerical\napproximations cause reappearing objects to be initialized as new tracks,\nespecially after long periods of being undetected. In occlusion handling, the\nfilter's efficacy is dictated by trade-offs between the sophistication of the\nocclusion model and computational demand. Our contribution is a novel modeling\nmethod that exploits object features to address reappearing objects whilst\nmaintaining a linear complexity in the number of detections. Moreover, to\nimprove the filter's occlusion handling, we propose a fuzzy detection model\nthat takes into consideration the overlapping areas between tracks and their\nsizes. We also develop a fast version of the filter to further reduce the\ncomputational time.
