Our research underscores the significant\nrole of ray-tracing in enhancing obstacle detection and avoidance capabilities.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating GAIL in\ncoordinating the flight paths of two UAVs, showcasing improved collision\navoidance capabilities. Extending our methodology, we apply our combined PPO,\nBC, GAIL, and ray-tracing framework to scenarios involving four UAVs,\nillustrating its scalability and adaptability to more complex scenarios. The\nfindings indicate that our approach not only improves the reliability of basic\nPPO based obstacle avoidance but also paves the way for advanced autonomous UAV\noperations in crowded or dynamic environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
