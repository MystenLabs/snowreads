However,\nthese tasks are challenging due to the high variability in speech signals.\nEnsemble learning has shown promising results when multiple classifiers are\ncombined to improve performance. With recent advancements in hardware\ndevelopment, combining several models is not a limitation in deep learning\nresearch and applications. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based\nensemble learning approach for speech classification. Specifically, we train a\nset of base features on the same classifier and quantify the uncertainty of\ntheir predictions. The predictions are combined using variants of uncertainty\ncalculation to produce the final prediction. The visualization of the effect of\nuncertainty and its ensemble learning results show potential improvements in\nspeech classification tasks. The proposed method outperforms single models and\nconventional ensemble learning methods in terms of unweighted accuracy or\nweighted accuracy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
