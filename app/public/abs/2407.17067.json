As it is an\nintegrable system, it possesses an extensive number of conserved quantities and\nits evolution on macroscopic scale can be described by generalised\nhydrodynamics. Using a microscopic approach, we compute the evolution of the\nconserved densities starting from non-equilibrium initial conditions of both\nquenched and annealed type. In addition to getting reduced to the Euler\nsolutions of the hydrodynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the microscopic\nsolutions can also capture effects of the Navier-Stokes terms and thus go\nbeyond the Euler solutions. We demonstrate this feature in two problems -\nfirst, tracer diffusion in a background of hard rods and second, the evolution\nfrom a domain wall initial condition in which the velocity distribution of the\nrods are different on the two sides of the interface. We supplement our\nanalytical results using extensive numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RTzmedfwic-AFgIlKHw0PmJ1OO5SZT5X9Y1RdIfyVhM","pdfSize":"5189576"}
