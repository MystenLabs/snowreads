However, effectively generating high-quality periodic structures\nof materials on limited but diverse datasets remains an ongoing challenge. Here\nwe propose a novel approach for periodic structure generation which fully\nrespect the intrinsic symmetries, periodicity, and invariances of the structure\nspace. Namely, we utilize differentiable, physics-based, structural descriptors\nwhich can describe periodic systems and satisfy the necessary invariances, in\nconjunction with a denoising diffusion model which generates new materials\nwithin this descriptor or representation space. Reconstruction is then\nperformed on these representations using gradient-based optimization to recover\nthe corresponding Cartesian positions of the crystal structure. This approach\ndiffers significantly from current methods by generating materials in the\nrepresentation space, rather than in the Cartesian space, which is made\npossible using an efficient reconstruction algorithm. Consequently, known\nissues with respecting periodic boundaries and translational and rotational\ninvariances during generation can be avoided, and the model training process\ncan be greatly simplified. We show this approach is able to provide competitive\nperformance on established benchmarks compared to current state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
