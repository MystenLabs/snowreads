In this study, we\npresent a new sample of 46 low-redshift, low-mass star-forming galaxies at\n$M_*\\sim 10^{8-10}M_{\\odot}$ along with two quiescent galaxies at $M_*\\sim\n10^{8.8}M_{\\odot}$ observed with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI), aiming to\ninvestigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in the transition zone between\nLocal Group satellites and massive field galaxies. We develop a novel method to\nsimultaneously determine stellar abundances of iron and magnesium in\nstar-forming galaxies. With the gas-phase oxygen abundance (O/H)$_{\\rm g}$\nmeasured using the strong line method, we are able to make the first-ever\napples-to-apples comparison of $\\alpha$ elements in the stars and the ISM. We\nfind that the [Mg/H]$_*$-[O/H]$_{\\rm g}$ relation is much tighter than the\n[Fe/H]$_*$-[O/H]$_{\\rm g}$ relation, which can be explained by the similar\nproduction processes of $\\alpha$ elements. Most galaxies in our sample exhibit\nhigher [O/H]$_{\\rm g}$ than [Fe/H]$_*$ and [Mg/H]$_*$. In addition, we\nconstruct mass-metallicity relations (MZRs) measured as three different\nelements (Fe$_*$, Mg$_*$, O$_{\\rm g}$). Compared to the gas O-MZR, the stellar\nFe- and Mg-MZRs show larger scatter driven by variations in specific star\nformation rates (sSFR), with star-forming galaxies exhibiting higher sSFR and\nlower stellar abundances at fixed mass. The excess of [O/H]$_{\\rm g}$ compared\nto stellar abundances as well as the anti-correlation between sSFR and stellar\nabundance suggests that galaxy quenching of intermediate-mass galaxies at\n$M_*\\sim 10^{8-10}M_{\\odot}$ is primarily driven by starvation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
