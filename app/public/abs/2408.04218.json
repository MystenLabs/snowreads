A\ngeneralized local criterion is given, which is an abstract criterion for a\nmapping to be $m$-to-$1$. By employing the generalized local criterion, three\nconstructions of $m$-to-$1$ mapping are proposed, which unify and generalize\nall the previous constructions of $2$-to-$1$ mappings and $n$-to-$1$ mappings.\nThen the $m$-to-$1$ property of polynomials $f(x) = x^r h(x^s)$ on\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*}$ is studied by using these three constructions. A series of\nexplicit conditions for~$f$ to be an $m$-to-$1$ mapping on $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*}$\nare found through the detailed discussion of the parameters $m$, $s$, $q$ and\nthe polynomial $h$. These results extend many conclusions in the literature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
