It is proven the\nexistence of a solution such that if $|\\nabla u(x,0)|\\in L^r(\\Omega)$ for some\n$r\\geq \\max\\{2,\\max p(z)\\}$, then the gradient preserves the initial order of\nintegrability in time, gains global higher integrability, and the solution\nacquires the second-order regularity in the following sense: \\[ \\text{$|\\nabla\nu(x,t)|\\in L^r(\\Omega)$ for a.e. $t \\in (0,T)$}, \\qquad \\text{$|\\nabla\nu|^{p(z)+\\rho+r-2} \\in L^1(Q_T)$ for any $\\rho \\in \\left(0,\n\\frac{4}{N+2}\\right)$}, \\] and \\[ |\\nabla u|^{\\frac{p(z)+r}{2}-2}\\nabla u\\in\nL^2(0,T;W^{1,2}(\\Omega))^N. \\] The exponent $r$ is arbitrary and independent of\n$p(z)$ if $f\\in L^{N+2}(Q_T)$, while for $f\\in L^\\sigma(Q_T)$ with $\\sigma \\in\n(2,N+2)$ the exponent $r$ belongs to a bounded interval whose endpoints are\ndefined by $\\max p(z)$, $\\min p(z)$, $N$, and $\\sigma$. An integration by parts\nformula is also proven, which is of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
