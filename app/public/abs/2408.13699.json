Prior works explored\nsurface-level tissue abnormalities or single layered tissue-tumor embeddings\nwith more than 300 palpations for dense 2D stiffness mapping. Our approach\nfocuses on 3D reconstructions of sub-dermal tumor surface profiles in\nmulti-layered tissue (skin-fat-muscle) using a visually-guided novel tactile\nnavigation policy. A robotic palpation probe with tri-axial force sensing was\nleveraged for tactile exploration of the phantom. From a surface mesh of the\nsurgical region initialized from a depth camera, the policy explores a\nsurgeon's region of interest through palpation, sampled from bayesian\noptimization. Each palpation includes contour following using a contact-safe\nimpedance controller to trace the sub-dermal tumor geometry, until the\nunderlying tumor-tissue boundary is reached. Projections of these contour\nfollowing palpation trajectories allows 3D reconstruction of the subdermal\ntumor surface profile in less than 100 palpations. Our approach generates\nhigh-fidelity 3D surface reconstructions of rigid tumor embeddings in tissue\nlayers with isotropic elasticities, although soft tumor geometries are yet to\nbe explored.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
