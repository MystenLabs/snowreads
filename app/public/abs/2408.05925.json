This derivation uses random S-matrix theory,\nwhich allows us to describe the surface effect in a unified way from the\nspecular to the diffuse limit within the quasiclassical theory framework of\nsuperconductivity. We find that $\\Gamma$ in the chiral states with $m \\geq 2$\nis larger than that in the chiral $p$-wave state ($m = 1$) because of the\nmultiple edge mode branches in former superconducting states (the number of\nwhich equals $m$). Diffuse scattering between the different branches causes a\nsignificant broadening of SDOS. In contrast, the edge mode in the chiral\n$p$-wave state is robust to diffuse scattering because only a single edge mode\nbranch exists. We also discuss SDOS at the diffuse limit, where the description\nin terms of $\\Gamma$ is not useful. The diffuse scattering effect on SDOS can\nbe understood qualitatively in terms of destructive interference analogous to\nthat caused by impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
