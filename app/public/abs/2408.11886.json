The current study\naimed to validate and evaluate bioimpedance as a diagnostic tool for\ntobacco-induced oral lesions. Methodology: The study comprised 50 OSCC and OPMD\ntissue specimens for in-vitro study and 320 subjects for in vivo study.\nBioimpedance device prepared and calibrated. EIS measurements were done for the\nhabit and control groups and were compared. Results: The impedance value in the\ncontrol group was significantly higher compared to the OPMD and OSCC groups.\nDiagnosis based on BIS measurements has a sensitivity of 95.9% and a\nspecificity of 86.7%. Conclusion: Bioimpedance device can help in\ndecision-making for differentiating OPMD and OSCC cases and their management,\nespecially in primary healthcare settings.\n  Keywords: Impedance, Cancer, Diagnosis, Device, Community\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
