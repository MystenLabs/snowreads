The physical layout obtained during placement determines\nkey performance metrics of the chip, such as power consumption, area, and\nperformance. Existing learning-based methods typically fall short because of\ntheir reliance on reinforcement learning, which is slow and limits the\nflexibility of the agent by casting placement as a sequential process. Instead,\nwe use a powerful diffusion model to place all components simultaneously. To\nenable such models to train at scale, we propose a novel architecture for the\ndenoising model, as well as an algorithm to generate large synthetic datasets\nfor pre-training. We empirically show that our model can tackle the placement\ntask, and achieve competitive performance on placement benchmarks compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aJjgR6z_9-E9i7F9349xqC17MYKc5OqvtP9qIFHpNiE","pdfSize":"4797750","objectId":"0x786b25f1e7deca9f6b945ffebc39260c2732a9749b4e27a7b742db46ea4a3984","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
