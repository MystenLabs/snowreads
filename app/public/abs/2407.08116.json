To\nproceed further to the study of projective (or spin) representations of $G$ and\ntheir characters (called spin characters), it is necessary to construct\nexplicitly a representation group $R(G)$ of $G$, a certain central extension of\n$G$ by $M(G)$, since projective representations of $G$ correspond bijectively\nto linear representations of $R(G)$. We propose here a practical method to\nconstruct $R(G)$ by repetition of one-step efficient central extensions\naccording to a certain choice of a series of elements of $M(G)$. This method is\nalso helpful for constructing linear representations of $R(G)$ and accordingly\nfor calculating spin characters. Actually, we will apply this method to several\nexamples of $G$ with prime number 3 in $M(G)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
