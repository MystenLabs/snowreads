The need to provide a solid foundation for timing correctness and\nscheduling mechanisms is therefore growing rapidly. Although there are some\npioneering studies conducted on formally analyzing the response time of\nprocessing chains in ROS 2, the focus has been limited to single-threaded\nexecutors, and multi-threaded executors, despite their advantages, have not\nbeen studied well. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we propose a\ncomprehensive response-time analysis framework for chains running on ROS 2\nmulti-threaded executors. We first analyze the timing behavior of the default\nscheduling scheme in ROS 2 multi-threaded executors, and then present\npriority-driven scheduling enhancements to address the limitations of the\ndefault scheme. Our framework can analyze chains with both arbitrary and\nconstrained deadlines and also the effect of mutually-exclusive callback\ngroups. Evaluation is conducted by a case study on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and\nschedulability experiments using randomly-generated chains. The results\ndemonstrate that our analysis framework can safely upper-bound response times\nunder various conditions and the priority-driven scheduling enhancements not\nonly reduce the response time of critical chains but also improve analytical\nbounds.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Operating Systems","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cDAi4C3aph0M436j5agxGlCa77EORhVmojU2ILzpRcE","pdfSize":"1728879"}
