Direct human takeover can pose significant\nrisks, especially given the close-following strategy employed by CACC, which\nmight cause drivers to feel unsafe and execute hard braking, potentially\nleading to collisions. This research aims to develop a CACC takeover controller\nthat ensures a smooth transition from automated to human control. The proposed\nCACC takeover maneuver employs an indirect human-machine shared control\napproach, modeled as a Stackelberg competition where the machine acts as the\nleader and the human as the follower. The machine guides the human to respond\nin a manner that aligns with the machine's expectations, aiding in maintaining\nfollowing stability. Additionally, the human reaction function is integrated\ninto the machine's predictive control system, moving beyond a simple\n\"prediction-planning\" pipeline to enhance planning optimality. The controller\nhas been verified to i) enable a smooth takeover maneuver of CACC; ii) ensure\nstring stability within a specific Operational Design Domain (ODD) when human\ncontrol authority is below 32.7%; iii) enhance both perceived and actual safety\nthrough machine interventions; and iv) reduce the impact on upstream traffic by\nup to 60%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
