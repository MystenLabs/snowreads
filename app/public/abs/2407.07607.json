We utilise\nTESS-SPOC data which initially had a cadence of 30 min but reducing to 10 min\nin Cycles 3. In addition, we require each star to be observed in at least 6\nsectors in each North/South Cycle: 1,950 low mass stars meet these criteria.\nStrong evidence was seen in 245 stars for a very stable photometric variation\nwhich we assume to be a signature of the stars rotation period. We did a\nsimilar study for Solar-like stars and found that 194 out of 1432 stars had a\nvery stable modulation. We then searched for evidence of a variation in the\nrotational amplitude. We found 26 low mass stars showed evidence of variability\nin their photometric amplitude and only one Solar-like star. Some show a\nmonotonic trend over 3--4 yrs whilst other show shorter term variations. We\ndetermine the predicted cycle durations of these stars using the relationship\nfound by Irving (2023} using an estimate of the stars Rossby number. Finally we\nfind a marginally statistically significant correlation between the range in\nthe rotational amplitude modulation and the rotation period.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hS3r9DLU1jaCNgX_3iGSittvqUEBdi7MdMzAXyBtqrU","pdfSize":"971852"}
