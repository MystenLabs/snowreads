The theory\nallows us to rigorously determine the asymptotic behavior of $Q$-factor and the\nfar-field polarization. We show that the resonant states near a BIC can be\nnearly circularly polarized if the scattering matrix is subject to a certain\ncondition. Moreover, our theory offers a novel perspective on super-BICs and\nprovides a clear and precise condition to efficiently identify them in both\nsymmetric and asymmetric structures without requiring a merging process. For\npractical applications, we find a super-BIC in a square lattice of cylinders on\na dielectric substrate. Our theory addresses the non-Hermitian nature of the\nsystem, can be generalized to treat other structures that support BICs, and has\npotential applications in resonance and chiral optics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
