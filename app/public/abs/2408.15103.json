This scenario does not reflect real-world conditions where traffic\nsurveillance often captures low-resolution and blurry images. Under these\nconditions, characters tend to blend with the background or neighboring\ncharacters, making accurate LPR challenging. To address this issue, we\nintroduce a novel loss function, Layout and Character Oriented Focal Loss\n(LCOFL), which considers factors such as resolution, texture, and structural\ndetails, as well as the performance of the LPR task itself. We enhance\ncharacter feature learning using deformable convolutions and shared weights in\nan attention module and employ a GAN-based training approach with an Optical\nCharacter Recognition (OCR) model as the discriminator to guide the\nsuper-resolution process. Our experimental results show significant\nimprovements in character reconstruction quality, outperforming two\nstate-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative measures.
