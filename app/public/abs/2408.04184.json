However, elements such as Te, Bi, and Pb are\ncostly and pose environmental hazards. In this study, we introduce a novel\ndesign strategy for thermoelectric materials, focusing on room-temperature,\nlight-element, and high-ZT materials such as coronene-cyclobutadienoid graphene\nnanoribbons (cor4GNRs). This material demonstrates a ZT value exceeding 2.1,\nattributed to its exceptionally low phonon thermal conductivity resulting from\nits unique edge structure. Importantly, its electrical conductance and Seebeck\ncoefficient remain relatively high and nearly unaffected by the edge structure.\nThis distinct behavior in phonon and electronic transport properties leads to a\nremarkably high ZT value. Additionally, we discover that applying strain can\nsignificantly reduce phonon thermal conductivity, potentially increasing the ZT\nvalue to over 3.0. Our findings provide innovative insights for the design and\napplication of advanced thermoelectric materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
