By leveraging detailed real-time data and advanced machine learning\ntechniques, MoveLight overcomes the limitations of traditional traffic signal\ncontrol methods. It employs a lane-level control approach using the FRAP\nalgorithm to achieve dynamic and adaptive traffic signal control, optimizing\ntraffic flow, reducing congestion, and improving overall efficiency. Our\nresearch demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of MoveLight across\nsingle intersections, arterial roads, and network levels. Experimental results\nusing real-world datasets from Cologne and Hangzhou show significant\nimprovements in metrics such as queue length, delay, and throughput compared to\nexisting methods. This study highlights the transformative potential of deep\nreinforcement learning in intelligent traffic signal control, setting a new\nstandard for sustainable and efficient urban transportation systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
