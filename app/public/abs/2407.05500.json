By combining (i) the symmetry reduced approaches\nto spacetime quantization, including loop quantum cosmology or geometrodynamics\nframework, and (ii) the (extension of the) Born-Oppenheimer approximation of\ninteracting fields, one can build a reliable though still\nquasi-phenomenological model for a description of propagation of the e-m\nradiation over a cosmological spacetime. The past works employing such approach\nindicated a pathological behavior - superluminal propagation at low energies.\nWe reexamine the approach via systematic studies (using indicated method) of\ne-m wave propagation over a flat quantum Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\nUniverse using a synthesis of analytical and numerical methods. It turns out,\nthat (i) the e-m wave propagation agrees with the one predicted by general\nrelativity in the low energy limit, and (ii) loop quantum effects actually\nsuppress the modifications to the dispersion relation in comparison with those\npredicted, where the geometry is quantized via geometrodynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
