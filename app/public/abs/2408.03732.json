We present a novel\nQuestion Rephrasing technique to evaluate the input uncertainty of LLMs, which\nrefers to the uncertainty arising from equivalent variations of the inputs\nprovided to LLMs. This technique is integrated with sampling methods that\nmeasure the output uncertainty of LLMs, thereby offering a more comprehensive\nuncertainty assessment. We validated our approach on property prediction and\nreaction prediction for molecular chemistry tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6e0rLS5hcPxcAXAUZJOGDaO2RC6_WGX2wUrDcM6i_GI","pdfSize":"1924222"}
