We introduce CommunityKG-RAG (Community Knowledge\nGraph-Retrieval Augmented Generation), a novel zero-shot framework that\nintegrates community structures within Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with RAG systems\nto enhance the fact-checking process. Capable of adapting to new domains and\nqueries without additional training, CommunityKG-RAG utilizes the multi-hop\nnature of community structures within KGs to significantly improve the accuracy\nand relevance of information retrieval. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat CommunityKG-RAG outperforms traditional methods, representing a\nsignificant advancement in fact-checking by offering a robust, scalable, and\nefficient solution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
