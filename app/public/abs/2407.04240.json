First this problem is expressed as a min-max Markov game. Next, a\ntwo-step Q-learning algorithm for solving Markov decision problem (MDP) is\nsuitably modified to solve this Markov game. Under a suitable assumption, the\nboundedness of the proposed iterates is obtained theoretically. Using results\nfrom stochastic approximation, the almost sure convergence of the proposed\ntwo-step minimax Q-learning is obtained theoretically. More specifically, the\nproposed algorithm converges to the game theoretic optimal value with\nprobability one, when the model information is not known. Numerical simulation\nauthenticate that the proposed algorithm is effective and easy to implement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
