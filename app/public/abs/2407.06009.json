An effective description of a spherically symmetric black hole with\nevolving mass is provided by the Vaidya metric. In our investigation, we\nexplore the dynamics of linear perturbations on this background, assuming a\nconstant rate of change for the mass. Despite the time-dependent background, a\njudicious change of coordinates allows us to treat the perturbations in the\nfrequency domain, and to compute explicitly the quasi-normal modes and the\ntidal Love numbers.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
