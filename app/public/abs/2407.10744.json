One popular\nand well-established method of approximation in these circumstances is provided\nby the polaron master equation (PME). In this work we reevaluate and extend the\nvalidity of the PME to capture the impact of non-Markovian polaron dressing,\ninduced by non-equilibrium open system dynamics. By comparing with numerically\nexact techniques, we confirm that while the standard PME successfully predicts\nthe dynamics of system observables that commute with the polaron transformation\n(e.g. populations in the Pauli z-basis), it can struggle to fully capture those\nthat do not (e.g. coherences). This limitation stems from the mixing of system\nand environment degrees of freedom inherent to the polaron transformation,\nwhich affects the accuracy of calculated expectation values within the polaron\nframe. Employing the Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism, we\nintroduce correction terms that provide an accurate description of observables\nthat do not commute with the transformation. We demonstrate the significance of\nthe correction terms in two cases, the canonical spin-boson model and a\ndissipative time-dependent Landau-Zener protocol, where they are shown to\nimpact the system dynamics on both short and long timescales.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nNXXTJyvNwdgPyB8ZkjQA-fyIzgTcHnNdxngm7HtHzU","pdfSize":"718848"}
