Transcripts are usually pre-processed by substituting\nspecific characters to account for non-semantic differences. As a result of\nthis normalisation, information on the accuracy of punctuation or\ncapitalisation is lost. We present a non-destructive, token-based approach\nusing an extended Levenshtein distance algorithm to compute a robust WER and\nadditional orthographic metrics. Transcription errors are also classified more\ngranularly by existing string similarity and phonetic algorithms. An evaluation\non several datasets demonstrates the practical equivalence of our approach\ncompared to common WER computations. We also provide an exemplary analysis of\nderived use cases, such as a punctuation error rate, and a web application for\ninteractive use and visualisation of our implementation. The code is available\nopen-source.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"na2_K-_nnSyq_2Yi-Npga3_Tgk-JUylDPHq9gez0kXY","pdfSize":"481820"}
