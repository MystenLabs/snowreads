However, gaps remain in\nour understanding of how such AI systems can provide care, especially for\nethnic and racial minority groups who continue to face care disparities.\nThrough interviews with six cancer survivors, we identify critical gaps in\ncurrent healthcare systems such as a lack of personalized care and insufficient\ncultural and linguistic accommodation. AI, when applied to care, was seen as a\nway to address these issues by enabling real-time, culturally aligned, and\nlinguistically appropriate interactions. We also uncovered concerns about the\nimplications of AI-driven personalization, such as data privacy, loss of human\ntouch in caregiving, and the risk of echo chambers that limit exposure to\ndiverse information. We conclude by discussing the trade-offs between\nAI-enhanced personalization and the need for structural changes in healthcare\nthat go beyond technological solutions, leading us to argue that we should\nbegin by asking, ``Why personalization?''\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
