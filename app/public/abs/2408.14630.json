Specifically, Gardner conjectured\nthat for Ising pure $p$-spin glasses with $p\\geq 3,$ there are two phase\ntransitions: the Parisi measure is Replica Symmetric (RS) at high temperatures,\nthen transitions to One-Step Replica Symmetry Breaking (1RSB) at a lower\ntemperature, and finally reaches Full Replica Symmetry Breaking (FRSB) at very\nlow temperatures. Our main results verify the first part of the Gardner\ntransition: for any $p \\geq 3,$ there exists a unique $\\beta^p_1>0$ such that\nthe Parisi measure is RS for $0 < \\beta \\leq \\beta^p_{1}$ and then 1RSB for\n$\\beta^p_1 < \\beta \\leq \\beta^p_1+\\epsilon_p$ with some $\\epsilon_p>0.$ We also\nprovide a computational method to locate $\\beta^p_1$ for any $p \\geq 3.$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
