Specifically, each agent in the game is assumed to be informed a\nsequence of local cost functions and constraint functions, which are known to\nthe agent with time-varying delays subsequent to decision-making at each round.\nThe objective of each agent within a cluster is to collaboratively optimize the\ncluster's cost function, subject to time-varying coupled inequality constraints\nand local feasible set constraints over time. Additionally, it is assumed that\neach agent is required to estimate the decisions of all other agents through\ninteractions with its neighbors, rather than directly accessing the decisions\nof all agents, i.e., each agent needs to make decision under partial-decision\ninformation. To solve such a challenging problem, a novel distributed online\ndelay-tolerant GNE learning algorithm is developed based upon the primal-dual\nalgorithm with an aggregation gradient mechanism. The system-wise regret and\nthe constraint violation are formulated to measure the performance of the\nalgorithm, demonstrating sublinear growth with respect to time under certain\nconditions. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
