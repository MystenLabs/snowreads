If $\\sigma $ is $\\textit{exponential}$, i.e.,\ninduced from a ${\\bf G}_a$-action on $X$, then $\\sigma $ is obviously of order\n$p$. It is easy to see that the converse is not true in general. In fact, there\nexists $X$ which admits an automorphism of order $p$, but admits no non-trivial\n${\\bf G}_a$-actions. However, the situation is not clear in the case where $X$\nis the affine space ${\\bf A}_R^n$, because ${\\bf A}_R^n$ admits various ${\\bf\nG}_a$-actions as well as automorphisms of order $p$.\n  In this paper, we study exponentiality of automorphisms of ${\\bf A}_R^n$ of\norder $p$, where the difficulty stems from the non-uniqueness of ${\\bf\nG}_a$-actions inducing an exponential automorphism. Our main results are as\nfollows.\n  (1) We show that the triangular automorphisms of ${\\bf A}_R^n$ of order $p$\nare exponential in some low-dimensional cases.\n  (2) We construct a non-exponential automorphism of ${\\bf A}_R^n$ of order $p$\nfor each $n\\ge 2$. Here, $R$ is any UFD which is not a field.\n  (3) We investigate the ${\\bf G}_a$-actions inducing an elementary\nautomorphism of ${\\bf A}_R^n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
