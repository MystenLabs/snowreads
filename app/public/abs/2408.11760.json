However, in\nreal-world scenarios, objects or scenes often exhibit perturbations of a\nsymmetric system, specifically a deviation from a symmetric architecture, which\ncan be characterized by a non-trivial action of a symmetry group, known as\nSymmetry-Breaking. Traditional GConv methods are limited by the strict\noperation rules in the group space, only ensuring features remain strictly\nequivariant under limited group transformations, making it difficult to adapt\nto Symmetry-Breaking or non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we\nintroduce a novel Relaxed Rotation GConv (R2GConv) with our defined Relaxed\nRotation-Equivariant group $\\mathbf{R}_4$. Furthermore, we propose a Relaxed\nRotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and further develop the\nSymmetry-Breaking Object Detector (SBDet) for 2D object detection built upon\nit. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed R2GConv in\nnatural image classification tasks, and SBDet achieves excellent performance in\nobject detection tasks with improved generalization capabilities and\nrobustness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
