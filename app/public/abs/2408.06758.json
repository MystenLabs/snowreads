It has long been known that the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem\ncould also be related to a specific Ising model. Therefore, it would be natural\nto attack MIS with various Max-Cut/Ising solvers. It turns out that this\nstrategy greatly improves the approximation for the independence number of\nrandom Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi graphs. It also exhibits perfect performance on a\nbenchmark arising from coding theory. These results pave the way for further\ndevelopment of approximate quantum algorithms on MIS, and specifically on the\ncorresponding coding problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
