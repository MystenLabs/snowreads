We generalise the classic Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa\ntheorem to induced packings of cycles. More specifically, we show that there\nexists a function ${f(k) = \\mathcal{O}(k \\log k)}$ such that for every positive\ninteger ${k}$, every graph $G$ contains either an induced packing of $k$ cycles\nor a set $X$ of at most~${f(k)}$ vertices such that the closed neighbourhood of\n$X$ intersects all cycles in $G$. Our proof is constructive and yields a\npolynomial-time algorithm finding either the induced packing of cycles or the\nset $X$. Furthermore, we show that for every positive integer ${d}$, if a graph\n$G$ does not contain two cycles at distance more than $d$, then $G$ contains\nsets $X_1,X_2\\subseteq V(G)$ with $\\lvert {X_1} \\rvert \\leq12(d+1)$ and $\\lvert\n{X_2} \\rvert \\leq12$ such that after removing the ball of radius $2d$ around\n$X_1$ or the ball of radius $3d$ around $X_2$, the resulting graphs are\nforests.\n  As a corollary, we prove that every graph with no $K_{1,t}$ induced subgraph\nand no induced packing of $k$ cycles has tree-independence number at most\n$\\mathcal{O}(tk\\log k)$, and one can construct a corresponding\ntree-decomposition in polynomial time. This resolves a special case of a\nconjecture of Dallard et al. (arXiv:2402.11222), and implies that on such\ngraphs, many NP-hard problems, such as Maximum Weight Independent Set, Maximum\nWeight Induced Matching, Graph Homomorphism, and Minimum Weight Feedback Vertex\nSet, are solvable in polynomial time. On the other hand, we show that the class\nof all graphs with no $K_{1,3}$ induced subgraph and no two cycles at distance\nmore than $2$ has unbounded tree-independence number.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
