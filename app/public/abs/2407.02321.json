In this study, we introduce significant advancements in reflection\nmatrix processing algorithms, including logical indexing, power iterations, and\nlow-frequency blocking. These enhance the processing speed of aperture\nsynthesis, 3D image reconstruction, and aberration correction by orders of\nmagnitude. Detailed algorithm implementations, along with experimental data,\nare provided to facilitate the widespread adoption of RMM in various\ndeep-tissue imaging applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
