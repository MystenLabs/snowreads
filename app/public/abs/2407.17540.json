Traditional methods for SZ\nclassification often struggle to capture transient EEG features and face high\ncomputational complexity. This study proposes a convolutional autoencoder (CAE)\nto address these challenges by reducing dimensionality and computational\ncomplexity. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach utilizing spectral\nscalograms (SS) combined with EfficientNet (ENB) architectures. The SS,\nobtained through continuous wavelet transform, reveals temporal and spectral\ninformation of EEG signals, aiding in the identification of transient features.\nENB models, through transfer learning (TL), extract discriminative features and\nimprove SZ classification accuracy. Experimental evaluation on a comprehensive\ndataset demonstrates the efficacy of our approach, achieving a five-fold mean\ncross-validation accuracy of 98.5\\% using CAE with a soft voting classifier and\n99\\% employing SS with the ENB7 model. These results suggest the potential of\nour methods to enhance SZ diagnosis, surpassing traditional deep learning (DL)\nand TL techniques. By leveraging CAE and ENBs, this research offers a robust\nframework for objective SZ classification, promoting early intervention and\nimproved patient outcomes.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
