Various diagnostic systems are needed to measure fast\nneutron properties in fusion plasmas. Generally, various types of neutron\ncameras and monitors are used. These systems are sensitive to neutron as well\nas gamma-ray radiation. Therefore, monitor systems that distinguish between\nneutron and gamma rays should be used. In this study, the NE-213 liquid\nscintillation detector was selected, and Pulse Shape Discriminator (PSD) NIM\nunit was used for the neutron/gamma-ray discrimination. True spectrum was found\nby unfolding the spectrum obtained by the reaction of neutrons to the protons\nin the detector with the FERD-PC computer code. In this study, the energy\nspectrum of fast neutrons produced in a neutron generator was measured by the\nunfolding method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
