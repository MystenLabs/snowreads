We characterize the binary triorthogonal codes that are\nminimal or maximal with respect to the CSS-T poset, and we also study how to\nderive new triorthogonal matrices from existing ones. Given a binary\ntriorthogonal matrix, we characterize which of its equivalent matrices are also\ntriorthogonal. As a consequence, we show that a binary triorthogonal matrix\nuniquely determines the parameters of the corresponding triorthogonal quantum\ncode, meaning that any other equivalent matrix that is also triorthogonal gives\nrise to a triorthogonal quantum code with the same parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FYbCygh7rvq8CuAa4RsWyJvHQtkbwOpYhaHwJJa3v2g","pdfSize":"125915"}
