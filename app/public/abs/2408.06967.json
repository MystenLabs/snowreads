Previous protocols ran in time $\\mathrm{exp}(\\Theta(n))$ or\nrequired $\\tau>\\cos^2(\\pi/8)$.\n  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in\ntime $n^3\\cdot(2^t/\\tau)^{O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on\nlearning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which\nonly applied in the realizable setting where $\\tau = 1$ [30, 37, 46, 61].\n  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\\otimes n}$ for some $\\mu$-separated\ndiscrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time\n$(n/\\mu)^{O((1 + \\log (1/\\tau))/\\mu)}/\\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a\nprior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [39]. For stabilizer\nproduct states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time\n$(n^2/\\epsilon^2)\\cdot (1/\\tau)^{O(\\log(1/\\tau))}$.\n  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer\nfidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\\epsilon$\nin $n^3 \\mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\\epsilon)$ time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
