We propose a stabilization strategy for\nthese states in 3D, combining SOC and long-range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions\n(RRI), in the presence of a spatially-periodic potential, that may include a\nparity-time (PT)-symmetric component. ESs of the SV solitons, which carry\ninteger vorticities S and S+1 in their two components, exhibit robustness up to\nS= 4. ESs of MM solitons feature an interwoven necklace-like structure, with\nthe components carrying opposite fractional values of the orbital angular\nmomentum. Regions of the effective stability of the 3D solitons of the SV and\nMM types (both fundamental ones and ESs), are identified as functions of the\nimaginary component of the PT-symmetric potential and strengths of the SOC and\nRRI terms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
