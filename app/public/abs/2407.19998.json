This unresolved\nquestion is particularly crucial when dealing with domain-specific data, where\nthe lexical senses and their meaning can completely differ from what a LLM has\nlearned during its training stage. This paper investigates the following\nquestion: Do LLMs really adapt to domains and remain consistent in the\nextraction of structured knowledge, or do they only learn lexical senses\ninstead of reasoning? To answer this question and, we devise a controlled\nexperiment setup that uses WordNet to synthesize parallel corpora, with English\nand gibberish terms. We examine the differences in the outputs of LLMs for each\ncorpus in two OL tasks: relation extraction and taxonomy discovery. Empirical\nresults show that, while adapting to the gibberish corpora, off-the-shelf LLMs\ndo not consistently reason over semantic relationships between concepts, and\ninstead leverage senses and their frame. However, fine-tuning improves the\nperformance of LLMs on lexical semantic tasks even when the domain-specific\nterms are arbitrary and unseen during pre-training, hinting at the\napplicability of pre-trained LLMs for OL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
