Despite its simplicity,\nthe van Hove model possesses many characterizing features of quantum fields,\nespecially in the infrared region. In particular, the existence of non-Fock\nground and equilibrium states in the presence of infrared singular sources\nmakes a representation-independent algebraic approach of utmost importance. We\nmake use of recent representation-independent techniques of infinite\ndimensional semiclassical analysis to establish the Bohr correspondence\nprinciple for the dynamics, equilibrium states, and long-time asymptotics in\nthe van Hove model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
