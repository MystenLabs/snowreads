This challenge features two tracks: a controlled\nsetting track (CtrSVDD) and an in-the-wild scenario track (WildSVDD). The\nCtrSVDD track utilizes publicly available singing vocal data to generate\ndeepfakes using state-of-the-art singing voice synthesis and conversion\nsystems. Meanwhile, the WildSVDD track expands upon the existing SingFake\ndataset, which includes data sourced from popular user-generated content\nwebsites. For the CtrSVDD track, we received submissions from 47 teams, with 37\nsurpassing our baselines and the top team achieving a 1.65% equal error rate.\nFor the WildSVDD track, we benchmarked the baselines. This paper reviews these\nresults, discusses key findings, and outlines future directions for SVDD\nresearch.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
