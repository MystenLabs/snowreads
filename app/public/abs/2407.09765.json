In this\nconstruction we perform a kind of generalized parabolic induction using a\ndeformed quantum enveloping algebra, whose definition depends on an arbitrary\nchoice of a positive system and corresponds to De Commer's definition for the\nstandard positive system. These algebras define a sheaf of algebras on the\ntoric variety associated to the root system, which contains the moduli of\nequivariant Poisson brackets. This fact finally produces the family of\n2-cocycle. We also obtain a comparison theorem between our module categories\nand module categories induced from our construction for intermediate Levi\nsubalgebras. The construction of deformed quantum enveloping algebras and the\ncomparison theorem are discussed in the integral setting of Lusztig's sense.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
