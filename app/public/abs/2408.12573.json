This parasite is responsable for 35.1%\nof outbreaks of diarrhea caused by contaminated water which and mainly affects\nchildren in whom it can cause physical and cognitive impairment. In this paper,\nwe consider a model of population dynamics to represent the behavior of Giardia\nlamblia in vitro, taking into account its mutation characteristic that\nguarantees to the protozoan resistance to the drug metronidazole. Different\nfrom what is found in the literature, it is pursued as the control objective\nthe extermination of the protozoan considering that the parameters of the model\nare uncertain and only the partial measurement of the state vector is possible.\nOn these assumptions, a control law is designed and the stability of the\nclosed-loop system is rigorously proved. Simulation and experimental results\nillustrate the benefits of the proposed population control method of Giardia\nlamblia.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Hi-P-NgrCnKSGggWEhNCDA4kZMAoyhXoXvqXgqknhLM","pdfSize":"1024737"}
