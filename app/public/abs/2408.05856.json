{"id":"2408.05856","title":"Has the Recession Started?","authors":"Pascal Michaillat and Emmanuel Saez","authorsParsed":[["Michaillat","Pascal",""],["Saez","Emmanuel",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2024 20:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2024 00:44:07 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-09-10","timestamp":1723406473000,"abstract":"  To answer this question, we develop a new Sahm-type recession indicator that\ncombines vacancy and unemployment data. The indicator is the minimum of the\nSahm indicator -- the difference between the 3-month trailing average of the\nunemployment rate and its minimum over the past 12 months -- and a similar\nindicator constructed with the vacancy rate -- the difference between the\n3-month trailing average of the vacancy rate and its maximum over the past 12\nmonths. We then propose a two-sided recession rule: When our indicator reaches\n0.3pp, a recession may have started; when the indicator reaches 0.8pp, a\nrecession has started for sure. This new rule is triggered earlier than the\nSahm rule: on average it detects recessions 0.8 month after they have started,\nwhile the Sahm rule detects them 2.1 months after their start. The new rule\nalso has a better historical track record: it perfectly identifies all\nrecessions since 1929, while the Sahm rule breaks down before 1960. With August\n2024 data, our indicator is at 0.54pp, so the probability that the US economy\nis now in recession is 48%. In fact, the recession may have started as early as\nMarch 2024.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
