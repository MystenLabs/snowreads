Here, we demonstrate the trapping of two\nnanospheres inside a dual optical tweezer generated by two copropagating lasers\noperating at different wavelengths (1064 nm and 976 nm). Due to the chromatic\naberration of the tweezer optics, two focal points are created approximately 9\nmicrons apart, each one acting as an optical trap for a silica nanoparticle. At\nthis distance, the surface charges on the nanospheres produce a Coulomb force\nthat couples their motion along the tweezer axis. The strong coupling regime is\nachieved, as evidenced by the observed avoided crossing of the normal-mode\nfrequencies. These results highlight the potential of our experimental scheme\nfor future studies on systems of strongly coupled oscillators, including their\nimplementation in optical cavities, both in the classical and in quantum\nregime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
