Working with a large basis of carefully constructed,\napproximately-local $q\\bar{q}$-like operators we determine a rich spectrum of\nstates up to $J=4$ in $B, B_s$ and $B_c$, that can be grouped into patterns\nmatching those of the quark model. In addition, hybrid-like states are\nidentified at approximately 1500 MeV above the ground states in each of $B,\nB_s$ and $B_c$, in a multiplet pattern already found in similar computations at\na range of quark masses spanning light to bottom. This study is performed using\nan anisotropic, relativistic Wilson-clover action at a single spatial lattice\nspacing of $a_s\\approx 0.12$ fm and with a light-quark mass corresponding to\n$m_\\pi\\approx 391$ MeV. We find good agreement with experimental results where\nknown and discuss prospects for further work in interesting $J^P$ quantum\nnumbers.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
