Existing setups often employ a reference game,\nwhich limits the range of language emergence phenomena that can be studied, as\nthe game consists of a single, purely language-based interaction between the\nagents. In this paper, we address these limitations and explore the emergence\nand utility of token-based communication in open-ended multi-agent\nenvironments, where situated agents interact with the environment through\nmovement and communication over multiple time-steps. Specifically, we introduce\ntwo novel cooperative environments: Multi-Agent Pong and Collectors. These\nenvironments are interesting because optimal performance requires the emergence\nof a communication protocol, but moderate success can be achieved without one.\nBy employing various methods from explainable AI research, such as saliency\nmaps, perturbation, and diagnostic classifiers, we are able to track and\ninterpret the agents' language channel use over time. We find that the emerging\ncommunication is sparse, with the agents only generating meaningful messages\nand acting upon incoming messages in states where they cannot succeed without\ncoordination.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J4fT5x06H8Vyqitmtae021EY3TedK0F3F9hI9yZ1ayM","pdfSize":"407937"}
