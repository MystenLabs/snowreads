We use this result to provide\nexamples of solutions with some special geometric properties.\n  The gradient $\\nabla h$ is lightlike or spacelike. In the first case, the\nunderlying manifold is a $pp$-wave. In the second case, the Ricci operator is\nnilpotent. Moreover, $2$-step nilpotent solutions are also realized on\n$pp$-waves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
