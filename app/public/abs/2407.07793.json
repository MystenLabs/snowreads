The inverse of zero in a common meadow is an error term\n$\\mathbb{a}$ which is absorbent for addition. We show that, in analogy with\nwhat happens with commutative unital Artinian rings, Artinian meadows decompose\nas a product of local meadows in an essentially unique way. We also provide a\ncanonical way to construct meadows from unital commutative rings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
