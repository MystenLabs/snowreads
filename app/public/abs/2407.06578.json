Our\nfocus is on the renormalized light and strange chiral condensate around the\npseudo-critical temperature. We find that in the confined region the gauge\nsystem is subjected to the chromomagnetic catalysis that turns into the inverse\ncatalysis in the high-temperature regime. We further observe that the chiral\ncondensates are subjected to the so-called thermal hysteresis. Our estimate of\nthe deconfinement temperature indicates that the critical temperature begins to\ndecrease\n  in the small field region, soon after it seems to saturate and finally\nincrease with the strength of the chromomagnetic field.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
