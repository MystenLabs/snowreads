We aim to contribute to the ASTER mission by defining the\nparameters of a multispectral camera system that will be used to study the\nasteroid system 2001 SN263, through software simulations that should help\nplanning the data collection. We inserted the shape model of the objects in the\nsoftware POV-Ray and modeled two cameras, a Wide Angle (WAC) and a Narrow Angle\n(NAC). We inserted the asteroid's parameters and simulated the satellite\nposition. We created various scenes so we could obtain a good view of the\nasteroid. Alpha is entirely visible only in the WAC images, while the NAC is\nexpected to reveal surface details. Beta seems relatively small in the WAC\nimages, whereas we obtain a broad view from the NAC at 100 km distance. Gamma,\nsmaller than Beta, should provide more detailed images through the NAC, whereas\nthe WAC images should be able to show its inclined orbit around Alpha. To see\nGamma behind Alpha in its revolution movement, we would have to elevate the\ncamera's orbit. The method employed to simulate images generated by satellite\ncameras can be applied to other scenarios where the target requires imaging,\nextending beyond the field of planetary geology.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
