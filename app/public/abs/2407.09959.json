Logic helps focus on the essential core to identify the\nfoundations of ideas and provides corresponding longevity with the resulting\napproach to new and old problems. Logic operates symbolically, where each part\nhas a precise meaning and the meaning of the whole is compositional, so a\nsimple function of the meaning of the pieces. This compositionality in the\nmeaning of logical operators is the basis for compositionality in reasoning\nabout logical operators. Both semantic and deductive compositionalities help\nexplain what happens in reasoning. The correctness-critical core of an idea or\nan algorithm is often expressible eloquently and particularly concisely in\nlogic. The opinions voiced in this paper are influenced by the author's\nteaching of courses on cyber-physical systems, constructive logic, compiler\ndesign, programming language semantics, and imperative programming principles.\nIn each of those courses, different aspects of logic come up for different\npurposes to elucidate significant ideas particularly clearly. While there is a\nbias of the thoughts in this paper toward computer science, some courses have\nbeen heavily frequented by students from other majors so that some transfer of\nthe thoughts to other science and engineering disciplines is plausible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
