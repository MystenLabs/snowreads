However, variations in displays diversify\nscatterplot sizes. Such variations can influence the perception of clustering\npatterns, introducing potential biases leading to misinterpretations in cluster\nanalysis. In this research, we explore how scatterplot size affects cluster\nassignment and investigate how we can offset such bias. We first conduct a\ncontrolled study asking participants to perform visual clustering on\nscatterplots of varying sizes. We found that changes in scatterplot size\nsignificantly alter cluster perception in three key features. In our subsequent\nexperiment, we examine how adjusting point sizes can mitigate this bias. As a\nresult, we verify that adjusting point size can effectively counteract the\nperceptual biases caused by varying scatterplot sizes. We wrap up our research\nby discussing the necessity and applicability of our findings in realworld\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nhfB2w-Kqqsvlqy8_HsjjuTfK5waL4iiWTWUQoXkE_M","pdfSize":"1008340","objectId":"0xec533724bcfa2ba3fcac37a8acd4499d6ac9c1c7489f1af3ede2eeb1e9522127","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
