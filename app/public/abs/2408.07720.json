However, state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with complex\nscenarios that demand advanced reasoning capabilities. In the literature, two\nprimary approaches have been proposed for implementing PM using LLMs: providing\ntextual insights based on a textual abstraction of the process mining artifact,\nand generating code executable on the original artifact. This paper proposes\nutilizing the AI-Based Agents Workflow (AgWf) paradigm to enhance the\neffectiveness of PM on LLMs. This approach allows for: i) the decomposition of\ncomplex tasks into simpler workflows, and ii) the integration of deterministic\ntools with the domain knowledge of LLMs. We examine various implementations of\nAgWf and the types of AI-based tasks involved. Additionally, we discuss the\nCrewAI implementation framework and present examples related to process mining.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZhMrm6Vuj66sQV831BINnlvLlJfuGAu0Ht9Yk2bGzaM","pdfSize":"515196"}
