Here we investigate the\npanoply of interaction-induced electronic phases that arise at a total\ncommensurate filling of $\\nu_T=2$ in moir\\'e TMD heterobilayers, focusing\nspecifically on their renormalized band-topology. We carry out a comprehensive\nself-consistent parton mean-field analysis on an interacting mixed-valence\nHamiltonian describing AB-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ to highlight different\ningredients that arise due to \"Mottness\", band-flattening, an enhanced\nexcitonic tendency, and band-inversion, leading to correlated topological\nsemi-metals and insulators. We also propose a possible route towards realizing\nfractionalized insulators with emergent neutral fermionic excitations in this\nand other closely related platforms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
