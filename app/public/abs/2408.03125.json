In this paper, we introduce a code-mixed multilingual\ntext annotation framework, COMMENTATOR, specifically designed for annotating\ncode-mixed text. The tool demonstrates its effectiveness in token-level and\nsentence-level language annotation tasks for Hinglish text. We perform robust\nqualitative human-based evaluations to showcase COMMENTATOR led to 5x faster\nannotations than the best baseline. Our code is publicly available at\n\\url{https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/commentator}.
