In\nenvironments where untrusted third parties, like cloud servers, provide\nCNN-based systems, ensuring the privacy of speech queries becomes essential.\nThis paper proposes encryption methods for speech queries using secret keys and\na model structure that allows for encrypted queries to be accepted without\ndecryption. Our approach introduces three types of secret keys: Shuffling,\nFlipping, and random orthogonal matrix (ROM). In experiments, we demonstrate\nthat when the proposed methods are used with the correct key, identification\nperformance did not degrade. Conversely, when an incorrect key is used, the\nperformance significantly decreased. Particularly, with the use of ROM, we show\nthat even with a relatively small key space, high privacy-preserving\nperformance can be maintained many speech processing tasks. Furthermore, we\nalso demonstrate the difficulty of recovering original speech from encrypted\nqueries in various robustness evaluations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
