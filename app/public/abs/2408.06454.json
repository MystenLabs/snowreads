The Twin Earth SEnsoR Astrophotonic CubesaT\n(TESERACT) was designed to house a correlation spectroscopy chip along with an\nelectrical and optical system for operation. We investigate design challenges\nand considerations in incorporating astrophotonic instrumentation such as\ncomponent integration, thermal management and optical alignment. This work aims\nto be a pathfinder for demonstrating that astrophotonic-based CubeSat missions\ncan perform leading edge, targeted science in lower-cost CubeSat platforms.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
