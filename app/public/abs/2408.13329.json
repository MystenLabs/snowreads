We introduce a slotted coding\nscheme for which each active user chooses a slot at random for transmitting its\nsignal, consisting of a pilot part and a randomly spread polar codeword. The\nproposed decoder operates in two phases. In the first phase, called the RIS\nconfiguration phase, the BS detects the transmitted pilots. The detected pilots\nare then utilized to estimate the corresponding users' channel state\ninformation, using which the BS suitably selects RIS phase shift employing the\nproposed RIS design algorithms. The proposed channel estimator offers the\ncapability to obtain the channel coefficients of the users whose pilots\ninterfere with each other without prior access to the list of transmitted\npilots or the number of active users. In the second phase, called the data\nphase, transmitted messages of active users are decoded. Moreover, we establish\nan approximate achievability bound for the RIS-based URA scheme, providing a\nvaluable benchmark. Computer simulations show that the proposed scheme\noutperforms the state-of-the-art for RIS-aided URA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
