The\ndetections of (1) the double-peaked optical emission lines, and (2) the early\nand ordinary superhumps, established that MASTER OT J030227.28+191754.5 is an\nextremely energetic WZ Sge-type dwarf nova (DN). Based on the superhump\nobservations, we obtained its orbital period and mass ratio as 0.05986(1) d and\n0.063(1), respectively. These are within a typical range of low-mass-ratio DNe.\nAccording to the binary parameters derived based on the thermal-tidal\ninstability model, our analyses showed that (1) the standard disk model\nrequires an accretion rate $\\simeq$ 10$^{20}$ g s$^{-1}$ to explain its peak\noptical luminosity and (2) large mass was stored in the disk at the outburst\nonset. These cannot be explained solely by the impact of its massive ($\\gtrsim$\n1.15 M$_\\odot$) primary white dwarf implied by Kimura et al. (2023). Instead,\nwe propose that the probable origin of this enormously energetic DN outburst is\nthe even lower quiescence viscosity than other WZ Sge-type DNe. This discussion\nis qualitatively valid for most possible binary parameter spaces unless the\ninclination is low ($\\lesssim 40^\\circ$) enough for the disk to be bright\nexplaining the outburst amplitude. Such low inclinations, however, would not\nallow detectable amplitude of early superhumps in the current thermal-tidal\ninstability model. The optical spectra at outburst maximum showed the strong\nemission lines of Balmer, He I, and He II series whose core is narrower than\n$\\sim 800$ km s$^{-1}$. Considering its binary parameters, a Keplerian disk\ncannot explain this narrow component, but the presumable origin is disk winds.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
