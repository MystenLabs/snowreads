The positions of these crossings form\nthe support of a point process. We show that if the expected number of\ncrossings converges to a positive but finite value, this point process\nconverges to a Poisson point process in the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance. We\nfurther show a multivariate central limit theorem between the number of\ncrossings and a second variable called the stress that holds when the expected\nvertex degree in the random geometric graph converges to a positive finite\nvalue.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
