However, they may not always remain neutral, as they can be\nselective in the false news they choose to expose and in how they present the\ninformation. They can deviate from neutrality by being selective in what false\nnews they debunk and how the information is presented. Prompting the now\npopular large language model, GPT-3.5, with journalistic frameworks, we\nestablish a longitudinal measure (2018-2023) for political neutrality that\nlooks beyond the left-right spectrum. Specified on a range of -1 to 1 (with\nzero being absolute neutrality), we establish the extent of negative portrayal\nof political entities that makes a difference in the readers' perception in the\nUSA and India. Here, we observe an average score of -0.17 and -0.24 in the USA\nand India, respectively. The findings indicate how seemingly objective\nfact-checking can still carry distorted political views, indirectly and subtly\nimpacting the perception of consumers of the news.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
