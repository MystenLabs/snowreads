However, it is not only a technical challenge\nbut also a scientific paradox, since in principle the electric and magnetic\ndegrees of freedom obey distinct rules of symmetries. Despite the great\nprogresses obtained in the community of multiferroics during the past decades,\nthe success of magnetoelectricity remains on its way and more alternative\napproaches with conceptual revolution are urgently needed. Here, by introducing\nthe concept of topology into multiferroics, an exotic magnetoelectric\ndouble-leaf Riemann-surface is unveiled based on the mechanism of\nspin-dependent $d-p$ hybridization in a two-dimensional magnet: GdI$_2$\nmonolayer. Protected by the topology, a $180^\\circ$ spin reversal can be\nprecisely achieved by an electric cycle, leading to a robust and\ndissipationless converse magnetoelectric function. Such a topological\nmagnetoelectricity allows the nontrivial manipulation of magnetization by AC\nelectric field. In this category, more candidate materials with better\nperformance are designed targetedly, which pave the road to the potential\napplications with topological magnetoelectrics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
