In this work, we relate the thermodynamic\nproperties to the average speed of sound in the interior of a star. We study\nthe consequences of the restoration of conformal symmetry. In particular, we\nshow that if the trace anomaly vanishes in the centers of maximally massive\nneutron stars, the speed of sound likely exceeds its conformal value and\nexhibits nonmonotonic behavior. We also find that the additional assumption of\npositive definiteness of the trace anomaly naturally induces a local peak of\nthe speed of sound at densities realized in the cores of neutron stars. We also\ndiscuss the stability condition for the hybrid neutron stars Possible\nimplications for the dense matter equation of state and the phenomenology of\nneutron stars are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
