Then applications of convex\nanalysis and generalized differentiation are given to the existence of Nash\nequilibrium and extended versions of von Neumann's minimax theorem in locally\nconvex topological vector spaces. Our analysis in this part combines\ngeneralized differential tools of convex analysis with elements of fixed point\ntheory revolving around Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and related issues.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
