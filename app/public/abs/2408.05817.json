In addition, the horizon is not known to the change detector. A\nvariant of the cumulative sum (CuSum) test with a threshold that increasing\nlogarithmically with time is proposed as a candidate solution to the problem.\nAn information-theoretic lower bound on the minimum value of the latency under\nthe constraints is then developed. This lower bound is used to establish\ncertain asymptotic optimality properties of the proposed test in terms of the\nhorizon and the false alarm probability. Some experimental results are given to\nillustrate the performance of the test.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
