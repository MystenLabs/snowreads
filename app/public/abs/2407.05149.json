However, detecting and tracking these vibrations within a biological\ncontext at the single particle level has remained elusive. In this study, we\ntrack the vibrational motions of single, unlabeled virus particles under\nambient conditions using ultrafast spectroscopy. The ultrasonic spectrum of an\n80-100 nm lentiviral pseudovirus reveals vibrational modes in the 19-22 GHz\nrange sensitive to virus morphology and 2-10 GHz modes with nanosecond\ndephasing times reflecting viral envelope protein interactions. By tracking\nvirus trajectories over minutes, we observe acoustic mode coupling mediated by\nthe local environment. Single particle tracking allows capture of viral\ndisassembly through correlated mode softening and dephasing. The sensitivity,\nhigh resolution, and speed of this approach promise deeper insights into\nbiological dynamics and early-stage diagnostics at the single microorganism\nlevel.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CjbkP9oavst7D9262mUj-8HEmsRFd0qOU6ngnH9mhi4","pdfSize":"8193766"}
