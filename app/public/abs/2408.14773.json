In this paper, our aim is to\ndetermine the sharp improved Bohr radius for the classes of analytic functions\n$f$ satisfying differential subordination relation $zf^{\\prime}(z)/f(z)\\prec\nh(z)$ and $f(z)+\\beta zf^{\\prime}(z)+\\gamma z^2f^{\\prime\\prime}(z)\\prec h(z)$,\nwhere $h$ is the Janowski function. We show that improved Bohr radius can be\nobtained for Janowski functions as root of an equation involving Bessel\nfunction of first kind. Analogues results are obtained in this paper for\n$\\alpha$-convex functions and typically real functions, respectively. All\nobtained results in the paper are sharp and are improved version of [{Bull.\nMalays. Math. Sci.
