While the\ndependence on $n$ is optimal, the correct dependence on $\\gamma$ is unknown;\nall known proofs yield bounds that are polynomial in $\\gamma$, but the best\nknown upper bound, coming from random graphs, is only logarithmic in $\\gamma$.\nIt is a major open problem to narrow this gap.\n  We prove that if $H$ is triangle-free, then the logarithmic behavior of the\nupper bound is the truth. That is, under the assumptions above, $G$ contains a\nblowup of $H$ of order $\\Omega_H (\\log n/{\\log(1/\\gamma)})$. This is the first\nnon-trivial instance where the optimal dependence in Nikiforov's theorem is\nknown.\n  As a consequence, we also prove an upper bound on multicolor Ramsey numbers\nof blowups of triangle-free graphs, proving that the dependence on the number\nof colors is polynomial once the blowup is sufficiently large. This shows that,\nfrom the perspective of multicolor Ramsey numbers, blowups of fixed\ntriangle-free graphs behave like bipartite graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oVnAxNNOwCO_SbGzUrcxX_sekM8thYcu8XB37GERSJc","pdfSize":"508973"}
