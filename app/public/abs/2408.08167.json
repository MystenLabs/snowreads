This answers a\nquestion left open in prior work, and contrasts with the dual setup whereby a\nHopf algebra has injective antipode precisely when it embeds into one with\nbijective antipode. The examples rely on the broader phenomenon of realizing\npre-specified subspace lattices as comodule lattices: for a finite-dimensional\nvector space $V$ and a sequence $(\\mathcal{L}_r)_r$ of successively finer\nlattices of subspaces thereof, assuming the minimal subquotients of the\nsupremum $\\bigvee_r \\mathcal{L}_r$ are all at least 2-dimensional, there is a\nHopf algebra equipping $V$ with a comodule structure in such a fashion that the\nlattice of comodules of the $r^{th}$ dual comodule $V^{r*}$ is precisely the\ngiven $\\mathcal{L}_r$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
