Radioactive gamma-ray lines emitted from neutron star merger remnants\nprovide a unique probe for investigating the nuclide composition and tracking\nits evolution. In this work, we studied the gamma-ray line features arising\nfrom the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei in the merger remnants based on the\n$r$-process nuclear reaction network and the astrophysical inputs derived from\nnumerical relativity simulations. The decay chain of $^{126}_{50}$Sn\n($T_{1/2}=230$ kyr) $\\to$ $^{126}_{51}$Sb ($T_{1/2}=12.35$ days) $\\to$\n$^{126}_{52}$Te (stable) produces several bright gamma-ray lines with energies\nof $415$, $667$, and $695$ keV, making it the most promising decay chain during\nthe remnant phase. The photon fluxes of these bright gamma-ray lines reach\n$\\sim10^{-5}$ $\\gamma$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for Galactic merger remnants with\nages less than $100$~kyr, which can be detected by the high energy resolution\nMeV gamma-ray detectors like the MASS mission.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
