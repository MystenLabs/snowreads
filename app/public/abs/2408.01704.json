This talk will display some selected\nworks of the art of Ian Macdonald, representative of different periods of his\noeuvre, and analyze how they resonate, both for the past development of our\nsubject and for its future.\n  This paper was prepared for the occasion of a lecture in tribute to Ian G.\nMacdonald, delivered at FPSAC 2024 in Bochum, Germany on 22 July 2024. I want\nto express thanks to the Executive Committee of FPSAC, the Organizing Committee\nof FPSAC 2024, and to the whole of our FPSAC 2024 community for making this\nlecture a possibility and for considering me for its delivery. Macdonald is my\nhero, and to be asked to play such a role in his legacy touches me deeply.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/History and Overview","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0jf5AcLQ548DTLl8UquAYhxDNtDmr8Lx8hJo60r8GDw","pdfSize":"8370079"}
