A crucial challenge is the need for multiple\ncontrol inputs, which adds significant complication to the system. We propose a\nnovel concept of single-input control of an actuator composed of interconnected\nbi-stable elements. Dynamic response of the actuator and pre-designed\ndifferences between the elements are exploited to facilitate any desired\nmulti-state transition, using a single dynamic input. We show formulation and\nanalysis of the control system's dynamics and pre-design of its multiple\nequilibrium states, as well as their stability. Then we fabricate and\ndemonstrate experimentally on single-input control of two- and four-element\nactuators, where the latter can achieve transitions between up to 48 desired\nstates. Our work paves the way for next-generation soft robotic actuators with\nminimal actuation and maximal dexterity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
