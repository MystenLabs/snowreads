When addressing\ncompressible flows, in addition to preserving kinetic energy at a discrete\nlevel, as done in the incompressible case, additional properties are sought\nafter, such as the ability to preserve the equilibrium of pressure that can be\nfound at contact interfaces. This paper investigates the general conditions of\nthe spatial numerical discretizations to achieve the pressure equilibrium\npreserving property (PEP). Schemes from the literature are analyzed in this\nrespect, and procedures to impart the PEP property to existing discretizations\nare proposed. Additionally, new PEP numerical schemes are introduced through\nminor modifications of classical ones. Numerical tests confirmed the theory\nhereby presented and showed that the modifications, beyond the enforcement of\nthe PEP property, have a generally positive impact on the performances of the\noriginal schemes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
