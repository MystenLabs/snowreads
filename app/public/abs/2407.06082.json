Nevertheless, extant semantic communication systems face\nsecurity, privacy, and trust challenges in integrating AI technologies for\nintelligent communication applications. This paper presents a comprehensive\nsurvey of security and privacy threats across various layers of semantic\ncommunication systems and discusses state-of-the-art countermeasures within\nboth academic and industry contexts. Finally, we identify critical open issues\nin this burgeoning field warranting further investigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
