Here, we design a\npassive conditional gate between co-propagating photons using an array of only\ntwo-level emitters. The key resource is to harness the effective photon-photon\ninteraction induced by the chiral coupling of the emitter array to two\nwaveguide modes with different resonant momenta at the emitter's transition\nfrequency. By studying the system's multi-photon scattering response, we\ndemonstrate that, in certain limits, this configuration induces a non-linear\n$\\pi$-phase shift between the polariton eigenstates of the system without\ndistorting spectrally the wavepackets. Then, we show how to harness this\nnon-linear phase shift to engineer a conditional, deterministic photonic gate\nin different qubit encodings, with a fidelity arbitrarily close to 1 in the\nlimit of large number of emitters and coupling efficiency. Our configuration\ncan be implemented in topological photonic platforms with multiple chiral edge\nmodes, opening their use for quantum information processing, or in other setups\nwhere such chiral multi-mode waveguide scenario can be obtained, e.g., in\nspin-orbit coupled optical fibers or photonic crystal waveguides.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
