However, identifying compilation errors in configurable systems is\nnot straightforward because traditional compilers are not variability-aware.\nPrevious approaches that detect some of these compilation errors often rely on\nadvanced techniques that require significant effort from programmers. This\nstudy evaluates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically\nChatGPT4, Le Chat Mistral and Gemini Advanced 1.5, in identifying compilation\nerrors in configurable systems. Initially, we evaluate 50 small products in\nC++, Java, and C languages, followed by 30 small configurable systems in C,\ncovering 17 different types of compilation errors. ChatGPT4 successfully\nidentified most compilation errors in individual products and in configurable\nsystems, while Le Chat Mistral and Gemini Advanced 1.5 detected some of them.\nLLMs have shown potential in assisting developers in identifying compilation\nerrors in configurable systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
