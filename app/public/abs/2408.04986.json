Here we study integers represented by integer sequences which\nsatisfy binary recursive relations. In case of non-degenerate sequences we give\nbounds for the highest index for which a term can be 0 and bounds on the growth\norder of the absolute values of the terms, both only in terms of the two\ninitial values, which is a novel feature. Some of these bounds are best\npossible apart from a multiplicative constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
