We give a concrete description of the motive with\ncompact support of $X$ in terms of its Borel--Moore homology, under some mild\nconditions. We give many examples, including rational projective curves and\ntoric varieties of dimension two and three.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
