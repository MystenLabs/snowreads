For a sequence of digraphs $G_n = (V_n,E_n)$, we\ngive sufficient conditions for the limit $\\widehat{\\mu} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\n\\boxplus_{G_n}(\\mu_n)$ to exist whenever the boolean convolution powers\n$\\mu_n^{\\uplus |V_n|}$ converge to some $\\mu$. This in particular includes\ncentral limit and Poisson limit theorems, as well as limit theorems for each\nclassical domain of attraction. The hypothesis on the sequence of $G_n$ is that\nthe normalized counts of digraph homomorphisms from rooted trees into $G_n$\nconverge as $n \\to \\infty$, and we verify this for several families of examples\nwhere the $G_n$'s converge in some sense to a continuum limit. In particular,\nwe obtain a new limit theorems for multiregular digraphs, as well as recovering\nseveral limit theorems in prior work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
