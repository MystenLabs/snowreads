However, this feedback is\nmostly collected by frontier AI labs and kept behind closed doors. In this\nwork, we bring together interdisciplinary experts to assess the opportunities\nand challenges to realizing an open ecosystem of human feedback for AI. We\nfirst look for successful practices in peer production, open source, and\ncitizen science communities. We then characterize the main challenges for open\nhuman feedback. For each, we survey current approaches and offer\nrecommendations. We end by envisioning the components needed to underpin a\nsustainable and open human feedback ecosystem. In the center of this ecosystem\nare mutually beneficial feedback loops, between users and specialized models,\nincentivizing a diverse stakeholders community of model trainers and feedback\nproviders to support a general open feedback pool.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TIfG8vuIOieqmPZMhgTLxUuQumJEDg4KfLh_LQnlRwU","pdfSize":"2120473"}
