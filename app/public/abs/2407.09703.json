In the case of stochastic multiscale systems driven by Brownian\nmotion, it has been shown that in order for the Maximum Likelihood Estimators\nof the parameters of the limiting dynamics to be consistent, data needs to be\nsubsampled at an appropriate rate. Recent advances in extracting effective\ndynamics for fractional multiscale systems make the same question relevant in\nthe fractional diffusion setting. We study the problem of parameter estimation\nof the diffusion coefficient in this context. In particular, we consider the\nmultiscale fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck system (fractional kinetic Brownian\nmotion) and we provide convergence results for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator\nof the diffusion coefficient of the limiting dynamics, using multiscale data.\nTo do so, we derive asymptotic bounds for the spectral norm of the inverse\ncovariance matrix of fractional Gaussian noise.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6--0li_EgXekmz37sTqambe5NiIw6B7Gnl9M-qBIn9I","pdfSize":"686775","objectId":"0x76db0eff832cd98d19da9b11ddee5e56db9dbb9df0d91ab626b37fcf0e0a6ddf","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
