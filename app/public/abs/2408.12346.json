The inspiring\nidea for our framework is the fact that data may reject, possibly to some\ndegree, and possibly by mistake, any given scientific hypothesis. There is no\ngeneral agreement in science about how to do this, which motivates putting\nforward a logical formulation of the problem. We do so by investigating\ndistinct definitions of \"rejection degrees\" each yielding a consequence\nrelation. Our investigation leads to novel variations on the theme of rational\nconsequence relations, prominent among non-monotonic logics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jm7eYOCU3zcD6d34At-kZ2PCM371uHKlfDpmNK9tdKs","pdfSize":"385185"}
