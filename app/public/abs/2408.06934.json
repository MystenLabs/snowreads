Our goal is to identify\nconditions on some spatial sampling system G = {gj: j in J} of H that enable\nstable recovery of the unknown source term w from space-time samples\n{<x(n),g_j>: n >=0,j in J}. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on G\n= {g_j }_{j in J} to ensure stable recovery of any w in W . Additionally, we\nexplicitly construct an operator R, dependent on G, such that\nR{<x(n),g_j>}_n,j} = w.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R4v_IInlrrqprN4b1KtanN4MRMGekTdYSQwt2BWJvSo","pdfSize":"196703"}
