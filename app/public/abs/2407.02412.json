For\n$k\\le 4$, it is known that there exists a finite set $F_k$ of graphs such that\nthe class $L(k)$ of $k$-leaf power graphs is characterized as the set of\nstrongly chordal graphs that do not contain any graph in $F_k$ as an induced\nsubgraph. We prove no such characterization holds for $k\\ge 5$. That is, for\nany $k\\ge 5$, there is no finite set $F_k$ of graphs such that $L(k)$ is\nequivalent to the set of strongly chordal graphs that do not contain as an\ninduced subgraph any graph in $F_k$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
