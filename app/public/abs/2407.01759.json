The near-threshold elastic and charge exchange cross\nsections are evaluated, finding a good agreement with the experimental data.\nFurthermore, the possible existence of $\\bar KN$ bound states are explored,\nfinding two poles in the isoscalar $J^P=\\frac{1}{2}^-$ sector that can be\ninterpreted as the experimental $\\Lambda(1405)$ state.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
