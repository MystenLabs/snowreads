We show that there is a polynomial-time\nalgorithm that, given an instance of \\textsc{Token Jumping}, computes an\nequivalent instance of size $O(g^2 + gk + k^2)$, where $g$ is the genus of the\ninput graph and $k$ is the size of the independent sets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
