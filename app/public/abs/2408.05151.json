However, there is often\nlabel mislabeling in practice, which significantly impacts the performance and\nrobustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose a\nmeta-learning guided label noise distillation method for robust AMC.\nSpecifically, a teacher-student heterogeneous network (TSHN) framework is\nproposed to distill and reuse label noise. Based on the idea that labels are\nrepresentations, the teacher network with trusted meta-learning divides and\nconquers untrusted label samples and then guides the student network to learn\nbetter by reassessing and correcting labels. Furthermore, we propose a\nmulti-view signal (MVS) method to further improve the performance of\nhard-to-classify categories with few-shot trusted label samples. Extensive\nexperimental results show that our methods can significantly improve the\nperformance and robustness of signal AMC in various and complex label noise\nscenarios, which is crucial for securing IoT applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
