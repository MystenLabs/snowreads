This puts the\nsystem operation in the radiative near-field regime of the BS antenna array,\ncharacterized by spherical rather than flat wavefronts. In this paper, we refer\nto such a system as near-field ISAC. Unlike the far-field regime, the\nnear-field regime allows for precise focusing of transmission beams on specific\nareas, making it possible to simultaneously determine a target's direction and\nrange from a single base station and resolve targets located in the same\ndirection. This work designs the transmit symbol vector in near-field ISAC to\nmaximize a weighted combination of sensing and communication performances\nsubject to a total power constraint using symbol-level precoding (SLP). The\nformulated optimization problem is convex, and the solution is used to estimate\nthe angle and range of the considered targets using the 2D MUSIC algorithm. The\nsimulation results suggest that the SLP-based design outperforms the\nblock-level-based counterpart. Moreover, the 2D MUSIC algorithm accurately\nestimates the targets' parameters.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
