We prove several theorems indicating that these notions\nof energy can be used to measure how evenly spread out a set of vertices is.\nFor example, in one setting, a set of vertices of a cycle has minimal energy\namong all sets of vertices of equal size if and only if it is maximally even,\nas defined in Clough and Douthett's work on music theory. Generalizing a\ntheorem of Clough and Douthett, we prove that a finite, simple, connected graph\nis distance degree regular if and only if whenever a set of vertices has\nminimal energy, its complement also has minimal energy. We provide several\ncharacterizations of sets of vertices in finite paths and cycles which have\nmaximal Wiener index. For both finite paths and cycles, we prove that a set $A$\nof vertices has maximal Wiener index, among all sets of the same size, if and\nonly if swapping out any member of $A$ with some adjacent vertex not in $A$\nnever leads to a set with a strictly larger Wiener index; as a consequence, on\npaths and cycles, the usual gradient ascent algorithm provably produces a\nglobal maximizer. Furthermore, generalizing a theorem of Jiang, we prove that a\nset of vertices in a cycle has maximal Wiener index if and only if it satisfies\na certain balanced condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
