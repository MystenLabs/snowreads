This study investigates its fate in the presence of\ndisorder. We find it stable up to moderate disorder by analyzing the surface\nstates and the zero energy bulk density of states using large-scale numerical\nsimulation and the self-consistent Born approximation. The disordered\nChern-Hopf insulator shows reentrant behavior: the disorder initially enhances\nthe topological phase before driving it across an insulator-diffusive metal\ntransition. We examine the associated critical exponents via finite-size\nscaling of the bulk density of states, participation entropy, and two-terminal\nconductance. We estimate the correlation length exponent $\\nu\\simeq 1.0(1)$,\nconsistent with the clean two-dimensional Chern universality and distinct from\nthe integer quantum Hall exponent.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
