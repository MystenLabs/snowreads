When this defining\nfunction is the Airy one, the evaluation of the corresponding Fredholm\ndeterminant yields the notorious Tracy-Widom distribution [hep-th/9211141],\nwhich has found many applications in numerous domains. In this paper, we unveil\na generalization of the Tracy-Widom distribution for a generic class of\ndefining functions. Furthermore, we bring forth a direct application of our\nupshot and survey the relation between the framework which we employ and\nisomonodromic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
