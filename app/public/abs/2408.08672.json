We consider a large family that consists of general ergodic 1-local\n(non-interacting) terms and general 2-local (interacting) terms. Physically, a\nrepeated application of these channels can be seen as a simple model for the\nthermalization process of a many-body system. We study its steady state\nperturbatively by interpolating between the 1-local and 2-local channels with a\nperturbation parameter $\\epsilon$. We prove that under very general conditions,\nthese states are Gibbs states of a quasi-local Hamiltonian. Expanding this\nHamiltonian as a series in $\\epsilon$, we show that the $k$'th order term\ncorresponds to a $(k+1)$-local interaction term in the Hamiltonian, which\nfollows the same interaction graph as the Kraus channel. We also prove a\ncomplementary result suggesting the existence of an interaction strength\nthreshold, under which the total weight of the high-order terms in the\nHamiltonian decays exponentially fast. This result also implies a\nquasi-polynomial classical algorithm for computing the expectation value of\nlocal observables in such steady states. Finally, we also present numerical\nsimulations of various channels that support our theoretical claims.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WjS4KhghGj5XF69sEPbFqzx0SwrFMb6D7pYR9-NG54o","pdfSize":"607177"}
