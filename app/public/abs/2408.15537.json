Our\nresult can be applied to many examples of general minimal rational curves,\nincluding general lines on a smooth hypersurface of degree less than $n$ in the\n$(n+1)$-dimensional projective space. As a key ingredient of our arguments, we\nformulate and prove a generalized version of Tanaka's prolongation procedure\nfor geometric structures subordinate to vector distributions, a result of\nindependent interest. When applied to the universal family of the deformations\nof the compact submanifolds satisfying our geometric conditions, the\ngeneralized Tanaka prolongation gives a natural absolute parallelism on a\nsuitable fiber space. A formal equivalence of embeddings must preserve these\nabsolute parallelisms, which implies its convergence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
