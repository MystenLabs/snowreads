Although causal ML methods are now\nwell established, they still face the significant challenge of\ninterpretability, which is crucial for medical applications. In this work, we\npropose a new algorithm based on the Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI)\nmethod for statistically rigorous variable importance assessment in the context\nof Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation. Our method termed\nPermuCATE is agnostic to both the meta-learner and the ML model used. Through\ntheoretical analysis and empirical studies, we show that this approach provides\na reliable measure of variable importance and exhibits lower variance compared\nto the standard Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) method. We illustrate how this\nproperty leads to increased statistical power, which is crucial for the\napplication of explainable ML in small sample sizes or high-dimensional\nsettings. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of our approach in various\nsimulation scenarios, including previously proposed benchmarks as well as more\ncomplex settings with high-dimensional and correlated variables that require\nadvanced CATE estimators.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CVlhPQwDOcqSLJ78bRqz_eA-h8b621a6CcclU0tVBgI","pdfSize":"394274"}
