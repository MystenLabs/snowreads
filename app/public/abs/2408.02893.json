We first\nestablish the local pointwise gradient estimates when $q$ is subcritical,\ncritical and supercritical with respect to $p$. With these estimates, we can\nprove the parabolic Liouville-type theorems for time-decreasing ancient\nsolutions. Next, we use Gidas-Spruck type integral methods to prove the\nLiouville-type theorem for the entire solutions when $q$ is critical. Finally,\nas an application of the Liouville-type theorem, we use the doubling lemma to\nderive universal priori estimates for local solutions of parabolic equations\nwith general nonlinearities. Our approach relies on a parabolic differential\ninequality containing a suitable auxiliary function rather than Keller-Osserman\ntype inequality, which allows us to generalize and extend the partial results\nof the elliptic equation (Bidaut-V\\'{e}ron, Garcia-Huidobro and V\\'{e}ron\n(2020) \\cite{veron-sum}) to the parabolic case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
