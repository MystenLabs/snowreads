The fundamental understanding of the scattering\nprocesses involved has made it possible to separate atomically localized\nsignals, providing new insights into vibrations at the atomic scale. In this\nLetter, we outline the experimental, conceptual and theoretical advances in\nthis field and also make comparisons with tip-based optical techniques before\ndiscussing future perspectives of this exciting technique. Optimization of\ndark-field signal collection will play a fundamental role in making this\ntechnique more widely applicable to a range of materials problems. The benefits\nof adding momentum-resolution will also be discussed and a novel acquisition\nscheme proposed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ECXHwa-X1PlGAh6GjTpmhtcQutU0uii0TYfuZ5Dzwpo","pdfSize":"1754155"}
