We solve the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem of\nmaximising the expected present value of the difference between taxes received\nand cost of bailouts given. Our class of taxation controls is larger than has\nbeen considered up till now in the literature and makes the problem truly\ntwo-dimensional rather than one-dimensional. Along the way, we define and\ncharacterise a large class of controlled L\\'evy processes to which the optimal\nsolution belongs, which extends a known result for perturbed Brownian motions\nto the case of a general L\\'evy process with no positive jumps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
