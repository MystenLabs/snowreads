Interruptions can be broadly\ndivided into two groups: cooperative (when the listener wants to support the\nspeaker), and competitive (when the listener tries to take control of the\nconversation against the speaker's will). A system that automatically\nclassifies interruptions can be used in call centers, specifically in the tasks\nof customer satisfaction monitoring and agent monitoring. In this study, we\ndeveloped a text-based interruption classification model by preparing an\nin-house dataset consisting of ASR-transcribed customer support telephone\ndialogues in Russian. We fine-tuned Conversational RuBERT on our dataset and\noptimized hyperparameters, and the model performed well. With further\nimprovements, the proposed model can be applied to automatic monitoring\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XH4DAQwO1F8xcyHXMFKBvL_SVqlZwE5mZtUb6XmMJ9o","pdfSize":"678380"}
