Thereafter the proposal of the generalized entropy,\nit becomes important to constrain the corresponding parameters. In the present\nwork, we intend to do this from the perspective of primordial gravitational\nwaves (GWs) generated during inflation. In the background level, the\ngeneralized entropy successfully drives a viable and smooth evolution of the\nuniverse, particularly from inflation to reheating followed by a radiation era,\nfor certain ranges of the entropic parameters. Consequently we investigate\nwhether such viable ranges of the entropic parameters (coming from the\nbackground level) allow the primordial GWs spectrum to pass through the\nsensitivity curves of various GWs observatories. Therefore, if the future\nobservatories can detect the signal of primordial GWs, then our theoretical\nexpectation carried in the present work may provide a possible tool for the\nmeasurement of the generalized entropic parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
