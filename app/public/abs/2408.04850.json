We call these\npolynomials delta factors. They conjectured that delta factors are irreducible\nfor the family $z\\mapsto z^2+c$. One can easily show the irreducibility for\nperiods $1$ and $2$ by reducing it to the irreducibility of cyclotomic\npolynomials. However, for periods $3$ and beyond, this becomes a challenging\nproblem. This paper proves the irreducibility of delta factors for the period\n$3$ and demonstrates the existence of infinitely many irreducible delta factors\nfor periods greater than $3$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
