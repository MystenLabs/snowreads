It\nexamines their differences and relationships while addressing crucial questions\nabout the goals, assumptions, features, and design spaces. It includes\nexamining a potential coexistence of CFI and CFA on the same platform. Through\na comprehensive review of existing defenses, this paper positions CFI and CFA\nwithin the broader landscape of runtime defenses, critically evaluating their\nstrengths, limitations, and trade-offs. The findings emphasize the importance\nof further research to bridge the gaps between CFI and CFA, advancing the field\nof runtime defenses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
