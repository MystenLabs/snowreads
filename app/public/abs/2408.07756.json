As these are typically low energy particles, they pose a\nchallenge in terms of passing energy triggers in traditional searches at the\nLarge Hadron Collider. The MATHUSLA experiment is specifically designed for the\npurpose of detecting long-lived particles. It also has the capability of\ndetecting lower energy particles relative to ATLAS and CMS. In this paper, we\nassess MATHUSLA's potential for effectively probing hidden valley models. As a\nbenchmark, we assume the hidden valley sector communicates with Standard Model\nsectors via a heavy vector propagator that couples to Standard Model quarks as\nwell as hidden valley quarks. We model the showering and hadronization in the\nhidden valley sector using PYTHIA, and study the detector acceptance as a\nfunction of the hidden valley meson's lifetime. We find that MATHUSLA possesses\nsignificant capabilities to explore previously uncharted parameter space within\nhidden valley models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
