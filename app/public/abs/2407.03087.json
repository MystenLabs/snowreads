We consider a\nprepare-and-measure CVQKD protocol, where Alice chooses from a set of four\ncoherent states and Bob performs a heterodyne measurement, the result of which\nis discretised in both key and test rounds. We provide a security proof against\ncoherent attacks in the finite-size regime, and compute the achievable key\nrate. To this end, we employ the generalised entropy accumulation theorem, as\nwell as recent advances in conic optimisation, yielding improved key rates\ncompared to previous works. At metropolitan distances, our method can provide\npositive key rates for the order of $10^8$ rounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
