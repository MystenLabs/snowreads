In other words, the bodies\nundergo a rigid motion. Here we investigate the possibility of partially rigid\nmotions, where some but not all of the distances are constant. In particular, a\n{\\em hinged} solution is one such that exactly one mutual distance varies. The\ngoal of this paper is to show that hinged solutions don't exist when n=3 or\nn=4. For n=3 this means that if 2 of the 3 distances are constant so is the\nthird and for n=4, if 5 of the 6 distances are constant, so is the sixth. These\nresults hold independent of the dimension d of the ambient space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
