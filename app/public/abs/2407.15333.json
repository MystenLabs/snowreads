However, a significant\nchallenge emerges when applying conventional PEPS methodologies to systems with\nperiodic boundary conditions (PBC), attributed to the prohibitive computational\nscaling with the bond dimension. This has notably restricted the study of\nsystems with complex boundary conditions. To address this challenge, we have\ndeveloped a strategy that involves the superposition of PEPS with open boundary\nconditions (OBC) to treat systems with PBC. This approach significantly reduces\nthe computational complexity of such systems while maintaining their\ntranslational invariance and the PBC. We benchmark this method against the\nHeisenberg model and the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, demonstrating its capability to\nyield highly accurate results at low computational costs, even for large system\nsizes. The techniques are adaptable to other boundary conditions, including\ncylindrical and twisted boundary conditions, and therefore significantly\nexpands the application scope of the PEPS approach, shining new light on\nnumerous applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
