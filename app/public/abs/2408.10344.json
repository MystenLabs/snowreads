This result can be\ninterpreted as a uniform rigidity theorem for disk patterns. Our method also\nestablishes a connection between the diameter of the skinning image and certain\ndiscrete extremal width on the Coxeter graph of the reflection group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
