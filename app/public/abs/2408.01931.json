However, a limitation of these methods is that the mapping function is\ntrained on overlapping users across domains, while only a small number of\noverlapping users are available for training. By visualizing the loss landscape\nof the existing CDR model, we find that training on a small number of\noverlapping users causes the model to converge to sharp minima, leading to poor\ngeneralization. Based on this observation, we leverage loss-geometry-based\nmachine learning approach and propose a novel CDR method called Sharpness-Aware\nCDR (SCDR). Our proposed method simultaneously optimizes recommendation loss\nand loss sharpness, leading to better generalization with theoretical\nguarantees. Empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that SCDR\nsignificantly outperforms the other CDR models for cold-start recommendation\ntasks, while concurrently enhancing the model's robustness to adversarial\nattacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
