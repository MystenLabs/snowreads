Here we study the local relaxation process in an isolated\nchain consisting of \\emph{N} three level systems. Though the entropy of the\nfull many body state keeps a constant, it turns out the total correlation of\nthis system approximately exhibits a monotonically increasing behavior. More\nimportantly, a variation analysis shows that, the total correlation entropy\nwould achieve its theoretical maximum when each site stays in a generalized\none-body Boltzmann state, which is not solely determined by the energy but also\ndepends on the spin value of each onsite level. It turns out such a theoretical\ncorrelation maximum is highly coincident with the result obtained from the\nexact time dependent evolution. In this sense, the total correlation entropy\nwell serves as an indicator for the dynamical irreversibility of the\nnonequilibrium relaxation in this isolated system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
