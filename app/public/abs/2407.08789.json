We prove bounds on their\nchromatic numbers (the minimum number of edges required to cover the ground\nset) and their list chromatic numbers. Settling a conjecture of Kiraly and\nBerczi et. al., we prove that the list chromatic number is at most k times the\nchromatic number. Following the footsteps of Edmonds, who considered the case\nk=2, we study three polytopes associated with k-tuples of matroids, and prove\nbounds on the distances between them. The tools used are in part topological.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
