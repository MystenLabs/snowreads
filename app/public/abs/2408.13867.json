For each $2\\leq\\ell\\leq\n4$ we establish a connection between the set $S_l(M,N)$ and a family of\nelliptic curves. When $\\ell=2$ and $3$, we use certain known parametrised sets\n$S_l(M,N)$ and respectively find families of elliptic curves of generic\nrank~$\\geq 5$ and $\\geq 6$, while for $\\ell=4$ we first obtain a parametrised\nset $S_l(M,N)$, then construct a family of elliptic curves of generic rank\n$\\geq 8$. Finally, we perform a computer search within these families to find\nspecific curves with rank~$\\geq 11$. The highest rank examples we found were\ntwo curves of rank~$14$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
