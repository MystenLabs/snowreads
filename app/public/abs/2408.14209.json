While equilibrium values of such HOI-based models have been studied,\nthe dynamics of these models and the stability of their equilibria remain\nunderexplored. Here we present a novel investigation on the effect of the onset\nspeed of a higher-order interaction. In particular, we study the stability of\nthe equilibrium of all configurations of a three-species interaction network,\nincluding transitive as well as intransitive ones. We show that the HOI onset\nspeed has a dramatic effect on the evolution and stability of the ecological\nnetwork, with significant structural changes compared to commonly used HOI\nextensions or pairwise networks. Changes in the HOI onset speed from fast to\nslow can reverse the stability of the interaction network. The evolution of the\nsystem also affects the equilibrium that will be reached, influenced by the HOI\nonset speed. This implies that the HOI onset speed is an important determinant\nin the dynamics of ecological systems, and including it in models of ecological\nnetworks can improve our understanding thereof.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
