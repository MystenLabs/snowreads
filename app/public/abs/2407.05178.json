The primary objectives include revealing\ntrends of algorithms, identifying promising fields for implementations in the\nNISQ era, and identifying the key algorithmic primitives that power quantum\nadvantage.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
