Consuming more similar information about the\nfundamentals can help them coordinate, but it can also exacerbate free-riding.\nOur main result shows that more similar information facilitates (impedes)\nachieving a common goal when achieving the goal is sufficiently challenging\n(easy). We apply this insight to show why insufficiently powerful authoritarian\ngovernments may face larger protests when attempting to restrict press freedom,\nand why informational diversity in committees is beneficial when each vote\ncarries more weight.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AsUXvjKyAkC21pdXBtft6XJ6B44G51KcyvoGQQU7Boc","pdfSize":"634148"}
