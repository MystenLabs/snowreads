The wide-binary fraction of white dwarfs with hydrogen-dominated\natmospheres is about 5%, but the fraction of white dwarfs with helium or\ncarbon-dominated atmospheres is significantly larger. Using spectroscopic\nclassifications, the binary fraction of DA white dwarfs is determined to be\n$0.063\\pm0.002$ and for non-DA white dwarfs is larger at $0.080\\pm0.004$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HEwlzmN42uenSAnqMuC3l6bMQ5i6cNus46VuflOfDnU","pdfSize":"484075"}
