However, there is a\nlimitation in determining appropriate noise parameters that can degrade\nanomalies while preserving normal characteristics. Also, due to the volatility\nof the diffusion model, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during\nreconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a\nmethod to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the\ndegree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems of existing\nmethods. The proposed method is validated on an open dataset for industrial\nanomaly detection, improving the performance of existing methods on a number of\nevaluation criteria. With the ease of combination with existing anomaly\ndetection methods, it provides a tradeoff between computational cost and\nperformance, allowing it high application potential in manufacturing industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"jfMAW80e0kHF9R7hfHHatajfmMlC9GwPGv5qk2ScgOc","pdfSize":"1614183"}
