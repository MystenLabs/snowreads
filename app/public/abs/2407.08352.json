Within the weak turbulence, we\ndemonstrate the existence of the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum $\\propto k^{-3/2}$\nnot only for weak dispersion but in the non-dispersion (ND) case as well. Such\nspectra in the $k$-space are accompanied by jets in the form of narrow cones.\nThese distributions are realized due to small nonlinearity compared with both\ndispersion/diffraction. Increasing pumping in the ND case due to dominant\nnonlinear effects leads to the formation of shocks. As a result, the acoustic\nturbulence turns into an ensemble of random shocks with the\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
