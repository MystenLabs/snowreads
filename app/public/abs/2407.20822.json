We\nprove that if only unary predicates are minimized (or fixed) during\ncircumscription, then decidability of logical consequence is preserved. For\nFO$^2$ the complexity increases from $\\textrm{coNexp}$ to\n$\\textrm{coNExp}^\\textrm{NP}$-complete, for GF it (remarkably!) increases from\n$\\textrm{2Exp}$ to $\\textrm{Tower}$-complete, and for C$^2$ the complexity\nremains open. We also consider querying circumscribed knowledge bases whose\nontology is a GF sentence, showing that the problem is decidable for unions of\nconjunctive queries, $\\textrm{Tower}$-complete in combined complexity, and\nelementary in data complexity. Already for atomic queries and ontologies that\nare sets of guarded existential rules, however, for every $k \\geq 0$ there is\nan ontology and query that are $k$-$\\textrm{Exp}$-hard in data complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"UnlUvfJd8EtHX_II9R9-dfgc5hx_QXB5Gmqf_Pm-cO0","pdfSize":"614864"}
