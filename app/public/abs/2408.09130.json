However, we notice that images captured in dark environments where the\nscenes are not fully illuminated can exhibit considerable brightness variations\nand multi-view inconsistency, which poses great challenges to 3D Gaussian\nSplatting and severely degrades its performance. To tackle this problem, we\npropose Gaussian-DK. Observing that inconsistencies are mainly caused by camera\nimaging, we represent a consistent radiance field of the physical world using a\nset of anisotropic 3D Gaussians, and design a camera response module to\ncompensate for multi-view inconsistencies. We also introduce a step-based\ngradient scaling strategy to constrain Gaussians near the camera, which turn\nout to be floaters, from splitting and cloning. Experiments on our proposed\nbenchmark dataset demonstrate that Gaussian-DK produces high-quality renderings\nwithout ghosting and floater artifacts and significantly outperforms existing\nmethods. Furthermore, we can also synthesize light-up images by controlling\nexposure levels that clearly show details in shadow areas.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
