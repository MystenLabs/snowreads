In this paper, we consider the widely\nused Gaussian regularized Shannon sampling formula in comparison to regularized\nShannon sampling formulas employing alternative window functions, including the\nmodified Gaussian function, the sinh-type window function, and the continuous\nKaiser-Bessel window function. It is shown that the approximation errors of\nthese regularized Shannon sampling formulas possess an exponential decay with\nrespect to the truncation parameter. The main focus of this paper is to\nidentify the optimal variance of the (modified) Gaussian function as well as\nthe optimal shape parameters of the sinh-type window function and the\ncontinuous Kaiser-Bessel window function, with the aim of achieving the fastest\nexponential decay of the approximation error. In doing so, we demonstrate that\nthe decay rate of the sinh-type regularized Shannon sampling formula is\nconsiderably superior to that of the Gaussian regularized Shannon sampling\nformula. Additionally, numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical\nresults.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
