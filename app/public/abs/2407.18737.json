AMEGO aims to bridge the\nspectral gap in sensitivity that currently exists from $\\sim$100 keV to\n$\\sim$100 MeV by being sensitive to both Compton and pair-production events.\nThis is made possible through the use of four subsystems working together to\nreconstruct events: a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) Tracker, a\nvirtual Frisch grid cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) Low Energy Calorimeter, a\nceasium iodide (CsI) High Energy Calorimeter, and an anti-coincidence detector\n(ACD) to reject charged particle backgrounds. Composed of 10 layers of DSSDs,\nComPair's Tracker is designed to measure the position of photons that Compton\nscatter in the silicon, as well as reconstruct the tracks of electrons and\npositrons from pair-production as they propagate through the detector. By using\nthese positions, as well as the absorbed energies in the Tracker and 2\nCalorimeters, the energy and direction of the incident photon can be\ndetermined. This proceeding will present the development, testing, and\ncalibration of the ComPair DSSD Tracker and early results from its balloon\nflight in August 2023.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"K1lBuuaHSGn9CaiD9lydJZ3T0gpeBu7AJXyVAG143pg","pdfSize":"31869905"}
