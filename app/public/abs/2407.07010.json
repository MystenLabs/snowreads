Our calculations are performed using\nthe analogue-gravity description provided by Plebanski and Tamm, according to\nwhich the characterization of the electromagnetic field on a generic curved\nbackground is equivalent to solving Maxwell's equations in flat space with a\nmatter content verifying certain non-trivial constitutive relations. The\nregularity of the electric field in what could be considered the worst\nconceivable physical condition, opens the door to further investigation into\nthe possibility of propagating signals capable of crossing a spacetime\nsingularity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
