By studying a disordered one-dimensional\nspinless fermion system coupled to a single photon mode describing the vacuum\nfluctuation, we find that even though the cavity mode does not qualitatively\nchange the localization behavior for a single-fermion system, it indeed leads\nto delocalization via a vacuum fluctuation-induced correlated hopping mechanism\nfor systems with at least three fermions. A mobility edge separating the\nlow-energy localized eigenstates and the high-energy delocalized eigenstates\nhas been revealed. It is shown that such a one-dimensional three-fermion system\nin with correlated hopping can be mapped to a single-particle system with\nhopping along the face diagonals in a three dimensional lattice. The effect of\nthe dissipation as well as a many-body generalization have also been discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7H6BqZWYrwLMFowOGbpeo5eEa27LggPx4S5PV67rxKs","pdfSize":"3348570"}
