Although the GH shift in optics has been widely observed\nexperimentally, its generalization remains uncovered completely in relativistic\nquantum mechanics for the existence of Klein's paradox. Recently, Wang has\nsolved Klein's paradox based on the different solutions adpoted for Dirac's\nequation with step potential in corresponding energy regions\n\\href{https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2399-6528/abd340}{[J. Phys. Commun. {\\bf 4},\n125010 (2020)]}. In the light of Wang's method, we calculate the GH shift for\nDirac fermions under relativistic conditions when they are incident obliquely\non a three-dimensional infinite potential barrier. Furthermore, we find that\nthe relativistic quantum GH shift can be negative, which is different from the\nnon-relativistic case.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kotlGBvJi1wBnjjhUC1tPratJ-OHWXQZmDDBk3Ak2UE","pdfSize":"471865","objectId":"0xd1de47f7125c3afb4dc14adc8e745a4c58692f8c0989d9602e57d406ba49a398","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
