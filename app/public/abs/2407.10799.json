The catalog provides\ncarefully-curated, high-quality, and uniformly calibrated and analyzed\ntabulated positional, spatial, photometric, spectral, and temporal source\nproperties, as well as science-ready X-ray data products. The latter includes\nmultiple types of source- and field-based FITS format products that can be used\nas a basis for further research, significantly simplifying followup analysis of\nscientifically meaningful source samples. We discuss in detail the algorithms\nused for the CSC Release 2 Series, including CSC 2.0, which includes 317,167\nunique X-ray sources on the sky identified in observations released publicly\nthrough the end of 2014, and CSC 2.1, which adds Chandra data released through\nthe end of 2021 and expands the catalog to 407,806 sources. Besides adding more\nrecent observations, the CSC Release 2 Series includes multiple algorithmic\nenhancements that provide significant improvements over earlier releases. The\ncompact source sensitivity limit for most observations is ~5 photons over most\nof the field of view, which is ~2x fainter than Release 1, achieved by\nco-adding observations and using an optimized source detection approach. A\nBayesian X-ray aperture photometry code produces robust fluxes even in crowded\nfields and for low count sources. The current release, CSC 2.1, is tied to the\nGaia-CRF3 astrometric reference frame for the best sky positions for catalog\nsources.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
