A $k$-uniform\ntight cycle is a $k$-graph with its vertices cyclically ordered so that every\n$k$ consecutive vertices form an edge and any two consecutive edges share\nexactly $k-1$ vertices. A result of Bustamante, Corsten, Frankl, Pokrovskiy and\nSkokan shows that all $r$-edge coloured $K_{n}^{(k)}$ can be partitioned into\n$c_{r,k}$ vertex disjoint monochromatic tight cycles. However, the constant\n$c_{r,k}$ is of tower-type. In this work, we show that $c_{r, k}$ is a\npolynomial in $r$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
