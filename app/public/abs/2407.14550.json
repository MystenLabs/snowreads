Specifically,\nwe present all light quark contributions and contributions from two heavy quark\nloops. We use the method of differential equations to compute all relevant\nthree-loop master integrals. The results for all these contributions are\nexpressed in terms of harmonic polylogarithms and generalized harmonic\npolylogarithms.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
