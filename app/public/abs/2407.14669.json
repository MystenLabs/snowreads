For an unpolarized nucleon, three\nazimuthal modulations arise: $\\cos\\phi_h$ related to the Cahn effect,\n$\\cos2\\phi_h$ linked to the Boer--Mulders function, and $\\sin\\phi_h$ known as\nbeam-spin asymmetry, each revealing insights into combinations of twist-two or\nhigher-twist distribution and fragmentation functions.\n  The COMPASS collaboration at CERN collected semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nscattering events in 2016 and 2017 using a longitudinally polarized 160 GeV/$c$\nmuon beam scattering off a liquid hydrogen target. Data from 2016 corresponding\nto about 1/3 of the full sample have been analyzed to measure the azimuthal\nmodulations of charged hadrons. For the first time, the results were corrected\nfor QED radiative effects using the DJANGOH MC generator.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
