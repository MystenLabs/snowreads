In this work, integrated\nwith the nonlinear structured illumination after the speckle sinusoidally\nmodulated, the second-order auto-correlation imaging can surpass the Rayleigh\nresolution limit by a factor of $2+\\sqrt{2}$. In theory, a higher spatial\nresolution with the surpassing factor $N+\\sqrt{N}$ is available by the\n$N$-order auto-correlation measurement. Our imaging scheme combined two\nsuper-resolution technologies not only enhances the spatial resolution of the\nlens-assisted imaging, but also promotes the practicality of the intensity\ncorrelation imaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
