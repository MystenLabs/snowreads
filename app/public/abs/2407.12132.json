The method is primarily aimed at the\ncharacterization of the goodness-of-fit statistic in the presence of the\nover-dispersion that is induced by sources of systematic error, and is based on\na quasi-maximum-likelihood method that retains the Poisson distribution of the\ndata. We show that the Poisson deviance, which is the usual goodness-of-fit\nstatistic and that is commonly referred to in astronomy as the Cash statistics,\ncan be easily generalized in the presence of systematic errors, under rather\ngeneral conditions. The method and the associated statistics are first\ndeveloped theoretically, and then they are tested with the aid of numerical\nsimulations and further illustrated with real-life data from astronomical\nobservations. The statistical methods presented in this paper are intended as a\nsimple general-purpose framework to include additional sources of uncertainty\nfor the analysis of integer-count data in a variety of practical data analysis\nsituations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
