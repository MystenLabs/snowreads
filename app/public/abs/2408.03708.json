This algorithm, termed cubic Newtonized\nK-SVD (NK-SVD), extends the traditional K-SVD method by incorporating cubic\nregularization into Newton refinements. The proposed Gauss-Seidel scheme not\nonly enhances the accuracy of frequency estimation over the continuum but also\nachieves better convergence by incorporating higher-order derivative\ninformation. We rigorously establish the convergence of the proposed algorithm\nwithin the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) framework. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first convergence analysis of BCD with a higher-order\nregularization scheme. Furthermore, this convergence framework can be applied\nto designing general alternating minimization algorithms with higher-order\nregularization. Extensive simulations demonstrate that cubic NK-SVD outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods in both SMV and MMV settings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
