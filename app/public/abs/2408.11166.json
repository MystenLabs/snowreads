Not only are they rare, but they also can be\nparticularly difficult to find due to the high extinction in the Galactic\nplane. This paper discusses the discovery of three new Galactic WRs previously\nclassified as H$\\alpha$ emission stars, but thanks to Gaia spectra, we were\nable to identify the broad, strong emission lines that characterize WRs. Using\nthe Lowell Discovery Telescope and the DeVeny spectrograph, we obtained spectra\nfor each star. Two are WC9s, and the third is a WN6 + O6.5 V binary. The latter\nis a known eclipsing system with a 4.4 day period from ASAS-SN data. We\ncalculate absolute visual magnitudes for all three stars to be between -7 and\n-6, which is consistent with our expectations of these subtypes. These\ndiscoveries highlight the incompleteness of the WR census in our local volume\nof the Milky Way and suggest the potential for future Galactic WR discoveries\nfrom Gaia low-dispersion spectra. Furthermore, radial velocity studies of the\nnewly found binary will provide direct mass estimates and orbital parameters,\nadding to our knowledge of the role that binarity plays in massive star\nevolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
