It is well-established that the phase stability\nof RMPEAs control their mechanical properties. In this study, we develop a deep\nlearning framework that is trained on a CALPHAD-derived database that is\npredictive of RMPEAs phases with high accuracy up to eight phases within the\nelemental space of Ti, Fe, Al, V, Ni, Nb, and Zr with an accuracy of\napproximately 90%. We further investigate the causes for the low out of domain\nperformance of the deep learning models in predicting phases of RMPEA with new\nelemental sets and propose a strategy to mitigate this performance shortfall.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cGMM8AqKMluHw_BVfPxABwEJb-AZb1CC3XLMlJd2bw0","pdfSize":"2562830"}
