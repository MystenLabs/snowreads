The intrinsically strong electronic\ncorrelations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a\nsensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make\ninteracting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport.\nUtilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral\nproperties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic\ntreatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the\ninteraction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport\nregime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for\ninteracting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight\nyields unexplored 4-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum\nmetric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For\nlong-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight\nreduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
