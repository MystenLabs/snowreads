This novel method allows users to effortlessly\nguide image generation via mouse trajectories. To achieve precise control, we\ndesign a distance awareness energy function to effectively guide latent\nvariables, ensuring that the focus of generation is within the areas defined by\nthe trajectory. The energy function encompasses a control function to draw the\ngeneration closer to the specified trajectory and a movement function to\ndiminish activity in areas distant from the trajectory. Through extensive\nexperiments and qualitative assessments on the COCO dataset, the results reveal\nthat TraDiffusion facilitates simpler, more natural image control. Moreover, it\nshowcases the ability to manipulate salient regions, attributes, and\nrelationships within the generated images, alongside visual input based on\narbitrary or enhanced trajectories.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dmgLNLyNIsEDjven5v2X0FRzGmyjsy6FgkXPwJnO56U","pdfSize":"9756613"}
