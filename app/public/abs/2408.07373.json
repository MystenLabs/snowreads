We use the Fourier\\_Quad shear catalog based on the\nHyper Suprime-Cam Survey and the group catalog from the DESI Legacy Surveys for\nthe measurement of group/cluster lensing and HSSC. Our analysis includes the\noff-centering effects. We obtain the average projected ellipticity of dark\nmatter halos with mass $13.5 < {\\rm log} (M_G h/ M_\\odot) < 14.5$ within 1.3\nvirial radius to be $0.48^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$. We divide the sample into two\ngroups based on mass and redshift, and we find that halos with higher mass tend\nto exhibit increased ellipticity. We also reveal that high-richness halos have\nlarger ellipticities, confirming the physical picture from numerical simulation\nthat high-richiness halos have a dynamical youth and more active mass accretion\nphase.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
