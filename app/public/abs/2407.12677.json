The\nproof goes by translating the question to an algebraic framework, and showing\nthat the languages of regular trees that are recognized by finitary tree\nalgebras whose sorts zero and one are finite are the regular ones, ie. the ones\nexpressible in mu-calculus. This corresponds for trees to a weak form of the\nkey translation of Wilke algebras to omega-semigroup over infinite words, and\nwas also a missing piece in the algebraic theory of regular languages of\ninfinite trees since twenty years.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
