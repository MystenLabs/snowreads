Celestial amplitudes, by virtue of exhibiting\nholographic properties of the S-matrix, appear well-suited for studying this\nquestion. We scatter electrically and magnetically charged massless scalars off\nnon-trivial electromagnetic potentials such as shockwaves, spin-one conformal\nprimary waves, conformally soft modes and their magnetic duals which we\nconstruct. This reveals an intricate relation between conformally soft\nsolutions, descendant CFT three-point functions and, by means of the\ntwo-dimensional shadow transform, CFT two-point functions. By comparing\ncelestial amplitudes on electric and magnetic dual backgrounds, we provide\nevidence that the four-dimensional flat-space holographic dual of S-duality in\nAbelian gauge theory is two-dimensional T-duality. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat for two-dimensional boundary actions describing low-energy sectors of the\nbulk gauge theory, S-duality can be explicitly implemented as a T-duality\ntransformation. We show that the Dirac quantisation condition guarantees gauge\ninvariance in the eikonal re-summation for scattering from potentials which for\nmagnetic scalars can be expressed in terms of 't Hooft loops.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
