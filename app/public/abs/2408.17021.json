We show that the automorphisms of our algebra correspond to\nthe Dehn twists about the curves on $\\Sigma_{1,2}$. We also give the cluster\nalgebraic construction of the the classical limit of the skein algebra, where\nthe Dehn twists are given in terms of the cluster mutations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
