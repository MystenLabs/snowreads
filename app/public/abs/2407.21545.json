However, we show that such results can be deceptive and\nmay not accurately represent true ability of the system to tackle the task at\nhand. In this article, we present an investigation into the robustness and\ngeneralisation capability of a lossy audio identification model. Our\ncontributions are as follows. (1) We show the lack of robustness to codec\nparameter variations of a model equivalent to prior art. In particular, when\nnaively training a lossy compression detection model on a dataset of music\nrecordings processed with a range of codecs and their lossless counterparts, we\nobtain near perfect performance metrics on the held-out test set, but severely\ndegraded performance on lossy tracks produced with codec parameters not seen in\ntraining. (2) We propose and show the effectiveness of an improved training\nstrategy to significantly increase the robustness and generalisation capability\nof the model beyond codec configurations seen during training. Namely we apply\na random mask to the input spectrogram to encourage the model not to rely\nsolely on the training set's codec cutoff frequency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
