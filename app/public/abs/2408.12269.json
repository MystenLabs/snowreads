We\nshow the existence of minimal models for pseudo-effective NQC klt generalized\npairs in dimension three over $\\mathbb{K}$. As a consequence, we prove the\ntermination of flips for pseudo-effective threefold NQC klt generalized pairs\nover $\\mathbb{K}$. This provides a new proof on the termination of flips for\npseudo-effective pairs over $\\mathbb{K}$ without using the non-vanishing\ntheorems. A key ingredient of our proof is the ACC for lc thresholds in\ndimension $\\leq 3$ and the global ACC in dimension $\\leq 2$ for generalized\npairs over $\\mathbb{K}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
