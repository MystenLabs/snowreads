The focus is on learning the analysis\nstep of sequential DA, from state trajectories and their observations, using a\nsimple residual convolutional neural network, while assuming the dynamics to be\nknown. Experiments are performed with the Lorenz 96 dynamics, which display\nspatiotemporal chaos and for which solid benchmarks for DA performance exist.\nThe accuracy of the states obtained from the learned analysis approaches that\nof the best possibly tuned ensemble Kalman filter, and is far better than that\nof variational DA alternatives. Critically, this can be achieved while\npropagating even just a single state in the forecast step. We investigate the\nreason for achieving ensemble filtering accuracy without an ensemble. We\ndiagnose that the analysis scheme actually identifies key dynamical\nperturbations, mildly aligned with the unstable subspace, from the forecast\nstate alone, without any ensemble-based covariances representation. This\nreveals that the analysis scheme has learned some multiplicative ergodic\ntheorem associated to the DA process seen as a non-autonomous random dynamical\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E5iVHUgbQ60TIuQa-RT5qfUd4391GnGBPs061sEI8AY","pdfSize":"641328"}
