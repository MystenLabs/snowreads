Here, we\npropose a compositional ordering-driven MPB in the specified compositional\nsolid solutions. By preforming machine-learning potential based molecular\ndynamics simulations on lead zirconate titanate, we find a phase transition\nfrom the rhombohedral to tetragonal phase with the decrease of compositional\nordering, leading to the MPB on temperature-ordering phase diagram. The\ncompositional ordering-driven MPB can enhances the piezoelectricity with a\nmagnitude comparable to that at the composition-driven MPB. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the mechanism of high piezoelectricity is polarization\nrotation driven by external field. This work provides an additional degree of\nfreedom, compositional ordering, to design the high-performance piezoelectric\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
