The level\ncrossing can take place at the QCD phase transition critical temperature or\nslightly before it, depending on the ratio of the axion decay constants\n$\\sim1.69$. The cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues in these two\ncases is similar, however, the transition of axion energy density is completely\ndifferent. Finally, we estimate the relic density of the QCD axion dark matter.\nThis level crossing may also have some cosmological implications.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EsKFN_TC1ycGFL3RzBjOxZoUb-ZwE_8Bza5-sO33xAo","pdfSize":"465827"}
