The embedded\ncontrol system needs to facilitate autonomous functionality, including\nperception, localization, and by-wire actuation, at high speeds and dynamic\nlimits of the vehicle. Rapid maneuvering during the race, however, excites\ntransient dynamics of the vehicle and the actuators. Compared to current\nautonomous driving focused on highway cruising and urban traffic, transient\nvehicle control imposes new challenges to the algorithm and system design. The\npresented work introduces the cascaded control structure employed by the IAC\nprototype to fully exploit the time scale separation between different control\ntasks. It is demonstrated by example way how the model-based control strategies\nand simulation are utilized to inform the decisions in the actuation,\ncomputation, perception, and software pipeline design decisions for the\nfirst-of-its-kind IAC racecar.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Fu5eBgVDvKvaTiiua8m-9Wa_YScjDL_Uq8iGjblqzbg","pdfSize":"778398"}
