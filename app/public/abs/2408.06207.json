Efficiently creating end-to-end entanglements over long\ndistances is a key objective. In our prior study on asynchronous routing, we\nenhanced these entanglement rates by leveraging solely the local knowledge of\nthe entanglement links of a node. This was achieved by creating a tree\nstructure, particularly a destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG)\nor a spanning tree, eliminating synchronous operations and conserving unused\nentanglement links. In this article, we present a multi-tree approach with\nmultiple DODAGs designed to improve end-to-end entanglement rates in\nlarge-scale networks, specifically catering to a range of network topologies,\nincluding grids and barbells, as well as realistic topologies found in research\ntestbeds like ESnet and Internet2. Our simulations show a marked improvement in\nend-to-end entanglement rates for specific topologies compared to the\nsingle-tree method. This study underscores the promise of asynchronous routing\nschemes in quantum networks, highlighting the effectiveness of asynchronous\nrouting across different network topologies and proposing a superior routing\ntactic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
