One of the characteristics of the period before major\neconomic fluctuations is the emergence of new financial products; the situation\nprior to the 2008 financial crisis is a prominent example of this. During that\nperiod, a variety of structured bonds, including securitized products,\nappeared. Because of the high returns on such financial products, many economic\nagents were involved in them for speculative purposes, even if they were\nriskier, producing macro-scale effects.\n  With this motivation, we present a simple macroeconomic model with financial\nspeculation. Our model illustrates two points. First, stochastic fluctuations\nin asset prices and macroeconomic activity are driven by the repeated\nappearance and disappearance of risky financial assets, rather than expansions\nand contractions in credit availability. Second, in an economy with sufficient\nborrowing and lending, the appearance of risky financial assets leads to\ndecreased productive capital, while in an economy with severely limited\nborrowing and lending, it leads to increased productive capital.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
