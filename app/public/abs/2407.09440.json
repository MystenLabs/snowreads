The\nself-organized state is found to be the superposition of three distinct\nBeltrami fields known as triple Beltrami (TB) state. In general, the\neigenvalues associated with the multiscale self-organized vortices may be a\npair of complex conjugate and real one. It is shown that all the eigenvalues\nbecome real when thermal energy increases or the positron density decreases.\nThe impact of relativistic temperature and positron density on the formation of\nself-organized structures is investigated. The self-organized field and flow\nvortices may vary simultaneously on vastly different length scales. The\ndisparate variation of self-organized vortices is important in the context of\ndynamo theory. The present work is useful to study the formation of multiscale\nvortices and dynamo mechanisms in multi-species thermally relativistic plasmas.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0CDndV9JuP3QR29yMiJsY5TcfbKy889vCmKcbC_U4iY","pdfSize":"358461","objectId":"0x7cf9cb0b715b738204ca916657a423c078b4609b91ca517d08332a26b21a0271","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
