We sharpen prior\nwork, proving that accurate recovery in the Wasserstein distance is possible\nwith more noise than previously known.\n  As a main application, our result yields a simple \"linear query\" algorithm\nfor constructing a differentially private synthetic data distribution with\nWasserstein-1 error $\\tilde{O}(1/n)$ based on a dataset of $n$ points in\n$[-1,1]$. This bound is optimal up to log factors and matches a recent\nbreakthrough of Boedihardjo, Strohmer, and Vershynin [Probab. Theory. Rel.,\n2024], which uses a more complex \"superregular random walk\" method to beat an\n$O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ accuracy barrier inherent to earlier approaches.\n  We illustrate a second application of our new moment-based recovery bound in\nnumerical linear algebra: by improving an approach of Braverman, Krishnan, and\nMusco [STOC 2022], our result yields a faster algorithm for estimating the\nspectral density of a symmetric matrix up to small error in the Wasserstein\ndistance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tYRW-SB5qh20-f1ARM9Z1uq86wnrVOSp34TDF4pwSUI","pdfSize":"818084"}
