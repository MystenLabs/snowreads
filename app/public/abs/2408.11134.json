The weak electron-phonon\ncoupling, as evidenced by a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.74, renders it a promising\nsingle-photon emitter, with the zero-phonon line predicted at 1.6 $\\mu$m,\nwithin the telecom range. These insights into defect-engineered electronic\nstructure and exciton dynamics offer promising opportunities for improving the\nperformance of carbon nanotube-based quantum light sources and optoelectronic\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
