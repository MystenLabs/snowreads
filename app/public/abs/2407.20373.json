Our result improves the classical estimate in terms of the diameter,\nfirst stated in a seminal paper by Payne and Weinberger: we add in the lower\nbound an extra term depending on the second largest John semi-axis of $\\Omega$\n(equivalent to a power of the width in the special case $N = 2$). The power\nexponent in the extra term is sharp, and the constant in front of it is\nexplicitly tracked, thus enlightening the interplay between space dimension,\nnonlinearity and power-concavity. Moreover, we attack the stability question:\nwe prove that, if $\\mu _ p (\\Omega, \\varphi)$ is close to the lower bound, then\n$\\Omega$ is close to a thin cylinder, and $\\varphi$ is close to a function\nwhich is constant along its axis. As intermediate results, we establish a sharp\n$L^ \\infty$ estimate for the associated eigenfunctions, and we determine the\nasymptotic behaviour of $\\mu _ p (\\Omega, \\varphi)$ for varying weights and\ndomains, including the case of collapsing geometries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
