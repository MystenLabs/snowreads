We prove that this graph is connected if\nand only if $n\\geq 3$, with $n$ neither prime nor a power of $p$. We also prove\nthat in the case of $p=2$ and $n=2q$ for $q$ a prime with $q\\geq 7$, the\ncommuting graph has the maximum possible diameter of $6$; these are the first\nknown such examples independent of the axiom of choice. We also find choices of\n$p$ and $n$ yielding diameter $4$ and diameter $5$ commuting graphs, and prove\ngeneral bounds depending on $p$ and $n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
