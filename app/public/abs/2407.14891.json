However, it is necessary to know there behavior at finite values of\nthe parameter and, moreover, their behavior at asymptotically large coupling\nparameters is also important. The problem of extrapolation of weak-coupling\nexpansions to the region of finite and even infinite coupling parameters is\nconsidered. A method is suggested allowing for such an extrapolation. The\nbasics of the method are described and illustrations of its applications are\ngiven for the examples where its accuracy and convergence can be checked. It is\nshown that in some cases the method allows for the exact reconstruction of the\nwhole functions from their weak-coupling asymptotic expansions. Gell-Mann-Low\nfunctions in multicomponent field theory, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum\nchromodynamics are extrapolated to their strong-coupling limits.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
