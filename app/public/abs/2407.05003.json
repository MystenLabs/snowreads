As we dive into these interactive\nprocesses, a challenge arises of discerning authentic intentions and validating\nperspectives. This exploration extends to evaluating the sustainability of\nfuture interactions and scrutinising biases impacting engaged communities. The\ncommitment is to ensure future outcomes align with genuine community needs and\naddress the ethical imperative of a considerate departure strategy. This\ndialogue encourages future researchers and practitioners to integrate ethical\nconsiderations and community-centric principles, fostering a more sustainable\nand responsible approach to technology-driven interventions in future urban\nregeneration and beyond.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UVe7PI8UfnCZK1IZ1Qi7SJqpZet6QxZkMyinYFPnh-I","pdfSize":"17255254"}
