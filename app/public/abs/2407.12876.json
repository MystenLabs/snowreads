This has\nled to the emergence of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) social platforms, such as\nCivitai. These distinctive social platforms allow users to build and share\ntheir own generative AI models, thereby enhancing the potential for more\ndiverse artistic expression. Designed in the vein of social networks, they also\nprovide artists with the means to showcase their creations (generated from the\nmodels), engage in discussions, and obtain feedback, thus nurturing a sense of\ncommunity. Yet, this openness also raises concerns about the abuse of such\nplatforms, e.g., using models to disseminate deceptive deepfakes or infringe\nupon copyrights. To explore this, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical\nstudy of an AIGC social platform, focusing on its use for generating abusive\ncontent. As an exemplar, we construct a comprehensive dataset covering Civitai,\nthe largest available AIGC social platform. Based on this dataset of 87K models\nand 2M images, we explore the characteristics of content and discuss strategies\nfor moderation to better govern these platforms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
