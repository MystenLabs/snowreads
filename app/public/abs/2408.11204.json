Contrary to other discretizations, it\npreserves the underlying geometric structure, namely that the Euler equations\ndescribe Riemannian geodesics on a Lie group. Here we show how to extend\nZeitlin's approach to the axisymmetric Euler equations on the 3-sphere. It is\nthe first discretization of the 3-D Euler equations that fully preserves the\ngeometric structure. Thus, this finite-dimensional model admits Riemannian\ncurvature and Jacobi equations, which are discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
