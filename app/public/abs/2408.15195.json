However,\nquantitative understanding on the differences between measured and actual\ntransport coefficients, especially the Hall effects, in inhomogeneous systems\nis lacking. In this work we use homogenization theory to find exact bounds of\nthe measured or homogenized anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in inhomogeneous\nconductors under minimal assumptions. In particular, we prove that the\nhomogenized AHC cannot exceed the bounds of the local AHC. However, in common\nexperimental setups, anomalies that appear to violate the above bounds can\noccur, with a popular example being the \"humps\" or \"dips\" of the Hall\nhysteresis curves usually ascribed to the topological Hall effect (THE). We\ngive two examples showing how such apparent anomalies could be caused by\ndifferent types of inhomogeneities and discuss their relevance in experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7tAAUtmeKz0CORE4kmn69wf_rmKh9QoOYfcJvY4RprA","pdfSize":"880333"}
