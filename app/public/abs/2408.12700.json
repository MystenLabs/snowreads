The atom\ncomprises a ground level and two excited states coupled with two laser fields,\nforming a V subsystem where the upper states exclusively decay to a common\nfourth state via two channels. By investigating various initial states of the\natom and considering the presence or absence of quantum interference in\nspontaneous emission channels, we analyze how the characteristics of the\nOAM-carrying vortex beam imprint onto the emission spectrum. The interplay\nbetween the optical vortex and the quantum system, including its environment\nmodes, induces a wide variety of spatio-spectral behaviour, including\ntwo-dimensional spectral-peak narrowing, spectralpeak enhancement,\nspectral-peak suppression, and spontaneous emission reduction or quenching in\nthe spatial azimuthal plane. Our findings shed light on the dynamics of\natom-vortex beam light interactions and offer insights into the manipulation of\nemission properties at the quantum level.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zjWmS3wTswoNnkIr8Eb7eWKFGy6HFMJrNsnLGGZ7EBA","pdfSize":"1003711"}
