This was\npreviously known for $F=\\mathbb{Q}$ by work of Rubin as a consequence of his\nproof of the Mazur--Swinnerton-Dyer ``main conjecture'' for rational CM\nelliptic curves, but the problem remained wide open for general $F$.\n  The approach in this paper, based on a novel application of an idea of\nBertolini--Darmon--Prasanna to consider a carefully chosen decomposable\nRankin--Selberg convolution of two CM modular forms having the Hecke\n$L$-function of interest as one of the factors, circumvents the use of $p$-adic\nheights and Bertrand's $p$-adic transcendence results in previous approaches.\nIt also yields a proof of similar results for CM abelian varieties $A/K$, and\nfor CM modular forms of higher weight.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1bakZyC_R3CStK6ySfb5jnyNA1o5op1-GZvNdHMVkdE","pdfSize":"555076"}
