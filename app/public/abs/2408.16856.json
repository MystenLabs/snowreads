We first summarize\nthe classical models that are used to describe the accretion disks in the\nsuper-Eddington regime with an emphasis on the key uncertainties in these\nmodels. Then we show that radiation-driven outflows are ubiquitously found by\nnumerical simulations of super-Eddington accretion disks. Some key physical\nprocesses on energy transport inside the disk are also identified by numerical\nsimulations. Radiative and mechanical output as a function of mass accretion\nrates, black hole mass, spin, and magnetic field topology are summarized.\nApplications of super-Eddington accretion disks to different astrophysical\nsystems, particularly tidal disruption events, are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"08WhFsg7vrnDmpkXz1Pn6irzC8WYOx7B6zD2NO_qKFE","pdfSize":"2119044"}
