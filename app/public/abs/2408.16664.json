The precision of such a quantum thermometer is limited by\nthe degree to which temperature can be estimated by quantum measurements. More\nprecisely, the maximal precision is given by the inverse of the quantum Fisher\ninformation. In the present analysis, we show that quantum thermometers that\nare described by nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations allow for a significantly\nenhanced precision, that means larger quantum Fisher information. This is\ndemonstrated for a variety of pedagogical scenarios consisting of single and\ntwo-qubits systems. The enhancement in precision is indicated by non-vanishing\nquantum speed limits, which originate in the fact that the thermal, Gibbs state\nis typically not invariant under the nonlinear equations of motion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
