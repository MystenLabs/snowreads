These clusters range in size from 6-25 monomers.\nThese are all in very good agreement with each other, as shown in a recent\nPerspective by Herman and Xantheas. To the best of our knowledge, we present\nfor the first time results for the De per monomer. To our surprise this\nquantity appears to be converging to a value close to 12 kcal/mol. An estimate\nof 1.5 - 2 kcal/mol for the {\\Delta}ZPE for these clusters puts the value of D0\nat 10 to 10.5 kcal/mol. This value is remarkably (and probably fortuitously)\nclose to the reported sublimation enthalpy of 10.2 kcal/mol at 10 K. However,\ngiven that these De energies correspond to dissociation of the cluster to N\nisolated monomers the interpretation of ``vaporization\" of these ``solid\"\nclusters is qualitatively reasonable.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
