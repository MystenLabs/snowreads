It is completely open access and will remain free. It is\ncurrently illustrated with examples that we have actually encountered in\ngeophysics, but will eventually evolve to address problems in biology. The main\nidea is to develop this material over time (probably every six months) and\nthroughout our careers. Therefore, it is not yet complete and some minor points\nneed to be corrected in this English version. A French version is also\navailable.
