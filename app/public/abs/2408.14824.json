Recently, large MTS with nonvolatility has been observed in Sn-Pb\nsolders [H. Arima et al., Commun. Mater. 5, 34 (2024)] where phase separation,\ndifferent superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of Sn and Pb, and\nmagnetic-flux trapping are the causes of the nonvolatile MTS. To further\nunderstand the mechanism and to obtain the strategy for enhancing switching\nratio, exploration of new phase-separated superconductors with nonvolatile MTS\nis needed. Here, we show that the In52-Sn48 commercial solder is a\nphase-separated superconducting composite with two Tc and traps vortices after\nfield cooling. A clear signature of nonvolatile MTS was observed at T = 2.5 K.\nFrom specific heat analyses, we conclude that the vortices are mainly trapped\nin the lower-Tc phase ({\\gamma}-phase) after field cooling, which is the\nevidence that vortex trapping also works on achieving nonvolatile MTS in\nphase-separated superconducting composites.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wTrn8GMUaoHjXy3eVcetE4LXD3twn4grfoLhG1Y2U1c","pdfSize":"1191800"}
