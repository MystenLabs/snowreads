Early detection and assessment of forest fires are crucial\nfor effective management and conservation efforts. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\n(UAVs) equipped with advanced computer vision algorithms offer a promising\nsolution for forest fire detection and assessment. In this paper, we optimize\nan integrated forest fire risk assessment framework using UAVs and multi-stage\nobject detection algorithms. We introduce improvements to our previous\nframework, including the adoption of Faster R-CNN, Grid R-CNN, Sparse R-CNN,\nCascade R-CNN, Dynamic R-CNN, and Libra R-CNN detectors, and explore\noptimizations such as CBAM for attention enhancement, random erasing for\npreprocessing, and different color space representations. We evaluate these\nenhancements through extensive experimentation using aerial image footage from\nvarious regions in British Columbia, Canada. Our findings demonstrate the\neffectiveness of multi-stage detectors and optimizations in improving the\naccuracy of forest fire risk assessment. This research contributes to the\nadvancement of UAV-based forest fire detection and assessment systems,\nenhancing their efficiency and effectiveness in supporting sustainable forest\nmanagement and conservation efforts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
