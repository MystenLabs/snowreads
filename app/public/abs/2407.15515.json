This new\nframework allows the analysis of ``almost stochastic\" equations, whose\ncoefficients vary in very large chaotic sets. The results also apply to the\nanalysis of the occurrence of critical transitions for a range of models much\nlarger than in previous approaches.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"dia5nzg09qOcdjm3iDXyn-yFJXb8RkXAAMGb8r7Yl3o","pdfSize":"1622622","objectId":"0x4aa826e24c5a524e5748642fefcb773c6fa143f78cf16c10146f70bf4acb1790","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
