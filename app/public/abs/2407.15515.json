This new\nframework allows the analysis of ``almost stochastic\" equations, whose\ncoefficients vary in very large chaotic sets. The results also apply to the\nanalysis of the occurrence of critical transitions for a range of models much\nlarger than in previous approaches.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
