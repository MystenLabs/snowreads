We begin by analyzing FHE algorithms\nand then develop systolic or systolic-esque units for each major kernel.\nConnecting units is challenging due to the different data access and\ncomputational patterns of the kernels. We overcome this by proposing a new data\ntiling technique that we name limb interleaving. Limb interleaving creates a\ncommon data input/output pattern across all kernels that allows the entire\narchitecture, named Osiris, to operate in lockstep. Osiris is capable of\nprocessing key-switches, bootstrapping, and full neural network inferences with\nhigh utilization across a range of FHE parameters. To achieve high performance,\nwe propose a new giant-step centric (GSC) dataflow that efficiently maps\nstate-of-the-art FHE matrix-vector product algorithms onto Osiris by optimizing\nfor reuse and parallelism. Our evaluation of Osiris shows it outperforms the\nprior state-of-the-art accelerator on all standard benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
