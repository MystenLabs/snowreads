This article\ndiscusses the perfect matching complex of polygonal line tiling and the\n$\\left(2 \\times n\\right)$-grid graph in particular. We use tools from discrete\nMorse theory to show that the perfect matching complex of any polygonal line\ntiling is either contractible or homotopically equivalent to a wedge of\nspheres. While proving our results, we also characterise all the matchings that\ncan not be extended to form a perfect matching.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
