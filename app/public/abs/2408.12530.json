We observe an algebraic, not exponential,\nrelaxation rate to the terminal velocity, validating the solution to the\nBasset-Boussinesq-Oseen equation. Unlike in steady Stokes theory, our\nexperiments and theory reveal a vortex ring forming around the sphere and\ndrifting away. As the Reynolds number nears unity, the vortex ring lags behind\nthe sphere, departing from Stokesian theory, though the sphere's algebraic\nresponse persists. These findings are critical for interactions in the Stokes\nlimit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
