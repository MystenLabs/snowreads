The method is based on\nthe effective operator formalism and consists of the direct substitution of the\nFS CC Ansatz for a wave operator into the effective operator expression with\nthe subsequent truncation of expansion at the terms quadratic in cluster\namplitudes. The final density matrix is defined by active-space density\nmatrices of different ranks \"dressed\" with contributions from cluster\noperators. The method gives a connected expression for pure-state density\nmatrices, provided that the intermediate normalization condition is fulfilled.\nMoreover, under some additional assumptions, the connectivity can also be\nensured for calculated transition property matrix elements and natural\ntransition spinors. The developed technique allows for fast and accurate\ncalculations of one-particle reduced density matrices for a wide range of\nelectronic states. A pilot application of the new technique to construct\naveraged atomic natural orbital (ANO) basis sets for fully relativistic\nelectronic structure calculations is presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
