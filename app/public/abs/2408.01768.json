Current software systems are static and\ninflexible, leading to significant challenges in translating human goals into\ncomputational actions. \"Living software systems\" powered by generative AI offer\na solution to this fundamental problem in computing. Traditional software\ndevelopment involves multiple layers of imperfect translation, from business\nrequirements to code, resulting in rigid systems that struggle to adapt to\nchanging user needs and contexts. Generative AI, particularly large language\nmodels, can serve as a universal translator between human intent and computer\noperations. This approach enables the creation of more flexible, context-aware\nsystems that can dynamically evolve to meet user goals. Two pathways for\nimplementing living software systems are explored: using generative AI to\naccelerate traditional software development, and leveraging agentic AI to\ncreate truly adaptive systems. New skills like Prompt Engineering are\nnecessary. By reimagining software as a living, adaptable entity, we can create\ncomputing interfaces that are more intuitive, powerful, and responsive to human\nneeds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
