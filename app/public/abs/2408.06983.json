A key technical element\nis our novel MILP encoding of the STL semantics; it follows the idea of stable\npartitioning from the recent work on SMT-based STL model checking. Assuming\nthat our (continuous-time) system models can be encoded to MILP -- typical\nexamples are rectangular hybrid automata (precisely) and hybrid dynamics with\nclosed-form solutions (approximately) -- our MILP encoding yields an\noptimization-based model checking algorithm that is scalable, is\nanytime/interruptible, and accommodates parameter mining. Experimental\nevaluation shows our algorithm's performance advantages especially for complex\nSTL formulas, demonstrating its practical relevance e.g. in the automotive\ndomain.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
