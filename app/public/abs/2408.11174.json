Such tools should provide objective and subjective\naspects at different granularity levels to make the analyses useful in\npractice. Existing methods produce interesting insights for objective aspects,\nbut are limited for subjective ones, are often limited to national contexts,\nand have limited explainability. We introduce a text analysis framework which\nintegrates both perspectives and provides a fine-grained processing of\nsubjective aspects. Information retrieval techniques and knowledge bases\ncomplement powerful natural language processing components to allow a flexible\naggregation of results at different granularity levels. Importantly, the\nproposed bottom-up approach facilitates the explainability of the obtained\nresults. We illustrate its functioning with insights on news outlets, political\norientations, topics, individual entities, and demographic segments. The\napproach is instantiated on a large corpus of French news, but is designed to\nwork seamlessly for other languages and countries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
