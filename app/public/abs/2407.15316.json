This paper presents two case studies centred on Malta`s\nmedia market featuring technical novelty. Despite its relatively small scale,\nMalta offers invaluable insights applicable to both similar and broader media\ncontexts. These two projects focus on media monitoring and present tools\ndesigned to analyse potential biases in news articles and television news\nsegments. The first project uses Computer Vision and Natural Language\nProcessing techniques to analyse the coherence between images in news articles\nand their corresponding captions, headlines, and article bodies. The second\nproject employs computer vision techniques to track individuals` on-screen time\nor visual exposure in news videos, providing queryable data. These initiatives\naim to contribute to society by providing both journalists and the public with\nthe means to identify biases. Furthermore, we make these tools accessible to\njournalists to improve the trustworthiness of media outlets by offering robust\ntools for detecting and reducing bias.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
