The interest in the 1983\nextension of GCM by Reinhard, Cusson and Goeke, which includes internal\nexcitations, was revived in recent years, but unfortunately this new\ntime-dependent GCM (TDGCM) framework has a serious flaw, which prevents it from\ndescribing correctly many anticipated features in a properly formulated TDGCM\nframework, such as interference and entanglement. I present here an alternative\nformulation, the extended GCM (eGCM), which is free of difficulties encountered\nin previous TDGCM implementations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZM_tULbceb3FJqU1bQaA_Iw0IGNqrUGvntEkjUtg5WQ","pdfSize":"473778"}
