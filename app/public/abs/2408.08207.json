This approach involved the concept of biderivation and certain reduction\nalgorithm. In this paper we generalize the results of \\cite{pr} and \\cite{kk04}\nand present complete algorithm for computation of \\tm module structure on\n$\\Ext^1(\\Phi,\\Psi )$ for \\tm modules $\\Phi $ and $\\Psi$ such that $\\rk \\Phi >\n\\rk \\Psi.$ The last condition is not sufficient for our algorithm to be\nexecutable. We show that it can be applied when the matrix at the biggest power\nof $\\tau$ in $\\Phi_t$ is invertible. We also introduce a notion of\n${\\tau}$-composition series which we find suitable for the additive category of\n\\tm modules and show that under certain assumptions on the composition series\nof $\\Phi $ and $\\Psi$ our algorithm is also executable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WJ4eKUHj8Cu2dYespxXEn-MrRtfc1e09JdJD67W617w","pdfSize":"341404"}
