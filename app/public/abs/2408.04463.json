It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing\nthe need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd\nintelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize\nthat the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore,\nwe hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular\npositions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ\nQ-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep\nQ-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and\neffectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a\ntransformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both\ncontent and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays\nattention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's\ncontent. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter\ncorpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies.\nIn experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an\nimprovement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error\nanalysis to validate our proposed model's performance.
