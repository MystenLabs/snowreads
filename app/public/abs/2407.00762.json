In contrast to previous studies, the attackers herein\nare assumed to be heterogeneous in the sense that they have not only different\nspeeds but also different weights representing their respective degrees of\nimportance (e.g., the amount of allocated resources). The objective of the\nattacker team is to jointly minimize the weighted sum of their final levels of\nproximity to the target area, whereas the defender aims to maximize the same\nvalue. Using geometric arguments, we construct candidate equilibrium control\npolicies that require the solution of a (possibly nonconvex) optimization\nproblem. Subsequently, we validate the optimality of the candidate control\npolicies using parametric optimization techniques. Lastly, we provide numerical\nexamples to illustrate how cooperative behaviors emerge within the attacker\nteam due to their heterogeneity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
