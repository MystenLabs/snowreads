The uses of particle beams are constantly growing in\nnumber including in medicine, industry, security, environment, and cultural\nheritage preservation. This lecture aims to give a broad sweep of the many uses\nof particle accelerators, covering technologies ranging in size from a few\ncentimetres for industrial electron linacs through to large synchrotron light\nsources of hundreds of metres circumference operating as national and\ninternational facilities. We finish by discussing some of the challenges facing\naccelerators used in wider society.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
