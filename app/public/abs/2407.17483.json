By helping teachers in underserved areas develop\nCS curriculum and helping them become certified to teach CS courses, more young\npeople in underserved areas are aware of IT-career opportunities, and prepared\nfor CS education at the university level, which ultimately helps tackle the IT\nworkforce deficit in the United States.\n  This paper discusses a successful implementation of a Google CS4HS grant to a\nrural underserved area, as well as lessons learned through the implementation\nof the program. Key elements in the implementation included a face-to-face\nhands-on workshop, followed by a seven week graduate-level online summer course\nfor the teachers to learn and develop curriculum that covers the CS concepts\nthey will be teaching. The teachers were supported with an online community of\npractice for the year as they implemented the curriculum.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
