This instability may\nbecome active when small deviations from chemical equilibrium are sustained\nover decades, driven by the star's gradual spin-down or residual heat loss. Our\nfindings suggest that this mechanism can produce strong, large-scale magnetic\nfields consistent with models that align with observational data. Additionally,\nthis instability naturally generates magnetic helicity in the star's crust,\nwhich is crucial for forming and maintaining strong dipolar toroidal fields,\noften invoked to explain magnetar observational phenomena. Our results offer a\nmicrophysically-based alternative to classical hydrodynamical dynamos for the\norigin of magnetar magnetic fields, addressing a long-standing debate in the\nfield.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
