For example, the Sigmoid activation is the\nde-facto activation in balanced classification tasks, however, in imbalanced\nclassification, it proves inappropriate due to bias towards frequent classes.\nIn this work, we delve deeper in this phenomenon by performing a comprehensive\nstatistical analysis in the classification and intermediate layers of both\nbalanced and imbalanced networks and we empirically show that aligning the\nactivation function with the data distribution, enhances the performance in\nboth balanced and imbalanced tasks. To this end, we propose the Adaptive\nParametric Activation (APA) function, a novel and versatile activation function\nthat unifies most common activation functions under a single formula. APA can\nbe applied in both intermediate layers and attention layers, significantly\noutperforming the state-of-the-art on several imbalanced benchmarks such as\nImageNet-LT, iNaturalist2018, Places-LT, CIFAR100-LT and LVIS and balanced\nbenchmarks such as ImageNet1K, COCO and V3DET.
