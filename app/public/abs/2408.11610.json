However, these\ninvestigations overlook the inherent sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrix\nof the SPP. Moreover, the existing techniques are not applicable when the block\nmatrices have Circulant, Toeplitz, or symmetric-Toeplitz structures and do not\neven provide structure preserving minimal perturbation matrices for which the\nBE is attained. To overcome these limitations, we investigate the structured\nBEs of SPPs when the perturbation matrices exploit the sparsity pattern as well\nas Circulant, Toeplitz, and symmetric-Toeplitz structures. Furthermore, we\nconstruct minimal perturbation matrices that preserve the sparsity pattern and\nthe aforementioned structures. Two applications of the obtained results are\ndiscussed: (i) deriving structured BEs for the weighted regularized least\nsquares problem and (ii) finding an effective and reliable stopping criterion\nfor numerical algorithms. Finally, numerical experiments validate our findings,\nshowcasing the utility of the obtained structured BEs in assessing the strong\nstability of numerical algorithms\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
