Here, we overcome current barriers\nto the successful integration of quantum emitters such as quantum dots (QDs)\ninto valley-Hall (VH) topological waveguides, utilising photonic defects at the\ntopological interface to stabilise the local charge environment and inverse\ndesign for efficient topological-conventional mode conversion. By incorporating\nQDs within defects of VH-photonic crystals, we demonstrate the first instances\nof single-photon resonant fluorescence and resonant transmission spectroscopy\nof a quantum emitter at a topological waveguide interface. Our results bring\ntogether topological photonics with optical nonlinear effects at the\nsingle-photon level, offering a new avenue to investigate the interaction\nbetween topology and quantum nonlinear systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1tJo1m3x6yImgqVhHE_K34bJ8z1eoayftfa6CzEbfrc","pdfSize":"17329663"}
