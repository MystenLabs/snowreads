Additionally the study explores the different user behaviours\nand practices regarding whether, how, when, and why different gender groups\nengage in and with AI driven spaces. By examining how data and content can\nknowingly or unknowingly be used to drive certain social norms in the AI\necosystems, this study argues that ontonorms shape how AI engages with the\ncontent that relates to women. Ontonorms specifically shape the image,\nbehaviour, and other media, including how gender identities and perspectives\nare intentionally or otherwise, included, missed, or misrepresented in building\nand training AI systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fysNtlP6hJfJpKbJgJQTcNdKg3fkp54Hki6siT2DDvY","pdfSize":"331155"}
