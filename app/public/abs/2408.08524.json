Illumination decomposition is an ill-posed problem facing three\nmain challenges: 1) priors for geometry and material are often lacking; 2)\ncomplex illumination conditions involve multiple unknown light sources; and 3)\ncalculating surface shading with numerous light sources is computationally\nexpensive. To address these challenges, we first introduce intrinsic diffusion\npriors to estimate the attributes for physically based rendering. Then we\ndivide the illumination into environmental and direct components for joint\noptimization. Last, we employ deferred rendering to reduce the computational\nload. Our framework uses a learnable environment map and Spherical Gaussians\n(SGs) to represent light sources parametrically, therefore enabling\ncontrollable and photorealistic relighting on Gaussian Splatting. Extensive\nexperiments and applications demonstrate that GS-ID produces state-of-the-art\nillumination decomposition results while achieving better geometry\nreconstruction and rendering performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
