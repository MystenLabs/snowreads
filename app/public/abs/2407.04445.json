In the standard model one computes the currents at the\nantennas for given voltages using the impedance matrix of the antennas, which\nis only possible if the determinant of the impedance matrix is non-zero. We\nconsider Hertzian group antennas, its relative corresponding impedance and two\napproximations (mid and far) of it. For the approximations we show that for\nmany situations the determinant is zero.\n  We find three antenna configurations for three antennas, i.e., on a line, on\na right triangle, and an isosceles triangle, which result in a zero determinant\nof the impedance for the far-field approximation. This means that with existing\nmethods, one cannot determine the behavior of this antenna system. For the\nbetter mid approximation, we find a configuration of 15 triangular-positioned\nantennas resulting in a singular impedance matrix.\n  Furthermore, we investigate $n\\times n$ grid placed antennas in the more\naccurate Hertzian impedance model and find that for $d \\approx 0.65$\nwavelengths of grid distance for n = 2, ..., 8 the absolute value of the\ndeterminant of the corresponding impedance matrix decreases by an order of\nmagnitude with each increased grid size.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
