The time is\nchanged using random processes such as the stable subordinator, inverse stable\nsubordinator, and their composition, tempered stable subordinator, gamma\nsubordinator $etc.$ Several distributional properties that include the\nprobability generating function, probability mass function and their governing\ndifferential equations are obtained for these variants. It is shown that some\nof these time-changed processes are L\\'evy and for such processes we have\nderived the associated L\\'evy measure. The explicit expressions for the\ncovariance and codifference of the component processes for some of these\ntime-changed variants are obtained. An application of the multivariate\ngeneralized space fractional counting process to shock models is discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
