One of the mechanisms postulated for metallicity redistribution in\ngalaxies is gas flows induced by AGN, but the details of this process remain\nelusive. We report the discovery of a positive radial gradient in the gas-phase\nmetallicity of the narrow line region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7130, which\nis not found when considering the star-forming components in the galaxy disk.\nTo determine gas-phase metallicities for each kinematic component, we use both\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming (SF) strong-line abundance\nrelations, as well as BPT diagnostic diagrams. These relations involve\nsensitive strong emission lines, namely [OIII]5007, [NII]6584, H$\\alpha$,\nH$\\beta$, [SII]6716, and [SII]6731, observed with the adaptive-optics-assisted\nmode of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large\nTelescope (VLT). The presence of a positive radial metallicity gradient only in\nthe AGN ionized component suggests that metals may be transported from central\nareas to its purlieus by AGN activity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
