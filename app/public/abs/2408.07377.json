However, results\nare partly contradicting in expression and magnitude of these latent traits,\nyet agree on the worrisome tendencies to score high on the Dark Triad of\nnarcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, which, together with a track\nrecord of derailments, demands more rigorous research on safety of these\nmodels. We provided a state of the art language model with the same personality\nquestionnaire in nine languages, and performed Bayesian analysis of Gaussian\nMixture Model, finding evidence for a deeper-rooted issue. Our results suggest\nboth interlingual and intralingual instabilities, which indicate that current\nlanguage models do not develop a consistent core personality. This can lead to\nunsafe behaviour of artificial intelligence systems that are based on these\nfoundation models, and are increasingly integrated in human life. We\nsubsequently discuss the shortcomings of modern psychometrics, abstract it, and\nprovide a framework for its species-neutral, substrate-free formulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
