The phenomenon of irreversible energy transfer from a linear\nprimary system to a nonlinear absorber has driven great attention to the\noptimal design of vibration absorbers both for stationary and transient\nregimes. Recently, the same principle has also been targeted in acoustics for\nthe absorption of sound waves at high excitation amplitudes. Meanwhile,\nacoustic absorption by electro-active means has found great success for noise\nreduction in the linear regime. This study uses a method allowing the design of\nnonlinear resonators at amplitudes that typically induce linear behaviors. This\nresearch proposes an analytical study of the implementation of the duffing\nequation as a nonlinear electroacoustic resonator coupled to an acoustic mode\nof a tube. Experiments are carried out and compared to the analytical results.\nThe experimental implementation is done using a real-time-based algorithm\nretrieving the measured pressure from a microphone and giving the electrical\ncurrent to send to a loudspeaker as an output thanks to a Runge-Kutta-like\nalgorithm.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
