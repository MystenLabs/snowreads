Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime\nincidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time\nperiods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with\nthis sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian\nnature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and\nover-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\napproach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial\nGraph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and\nconvolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate\ncorrelations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of\ncrime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model,\nSTMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing\nprediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation\non real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models,\nproviding a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
