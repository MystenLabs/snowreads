The gravity model is closely\nrelated to the STU supergravity in five dimensions and admits an analytical\nblack brane solution carrying the conserved charge dual to the magnetic 1-form\nsymmetry of the magnetohydrodynamic system. The black brane solution features a\nfortuitous SO(3) symmetry, providing a new symmetry principle for describing\nthe magnetohydrodynamics. Since the bulk theory contains multiple 2-form gauge\nfields, the resistivity becomes matrix-valued. We find that the antisymmetric\npart of the resistivity matrix exhibits novel features depending on the UV\ncut-off of the theory. We also compute the shear and bulk viscosities and find\nthat the bulk viscosity is proportional to the shear viscosity. Remarkably, the\nproportionality constant is exactly what is required for conformality, despite\nthe zeroth-order energy-momentum tensor not being trace-free.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
