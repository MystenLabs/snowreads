In other words, we consider discrete- and\ncontinuous-time systems of mean-field BSDEs and McKean-Vlasov BSDEs in a\nunified setting. We provide existence and uniqueness results for these BSDEs\nusing new a priori estimates that utilize the stochastic exponential. Then, we\nprovide propagation of chaos results for systems of particles that satisfy\nBSDEs, i.e. we show that the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of\nmean-field systems of BSDEs, as the multitude of the systems grows to infinity,\nconverges to I.I.D solutions of McKean-Vlasov BSDEs. We introduce a new\ntechnique for showing the backward propagation of chaos, that makes repeated\nuse of the a priori estimates, inequalities for the Wasserstein distance and\nthe ``conservation of solutions'' under different filtrations, and does not\ndemand the solutions of the mean field systems to be exchangeable or symmetric.\nFinally, we deduce convergence rates for the propagation of chaos, under\nadvanced integrability conditions on the solutions of the BSDEs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
