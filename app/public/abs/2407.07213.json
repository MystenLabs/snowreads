Understanding\ndepartures from single-Maxwell behavior is crucial for fitting and interpreting\nexperimental data, but in some limiting cases numerical methods of solving\nliving polymer models can struggle to produce reliable\npredictions/interpretations. In this work, we develop an analytic solution for\nthe shuffling model of living polymers. The analytic solution is a converging\ninfinite series, and it converges fastest in the fast-breaking limit where\nother methods can struggle.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
