The first one is motivated by the ideas of Artificial Life that are used\nto reproduce stochastic cellular automata with given rules. We test the\nrobustness of quantum implementations of the cellular automata for different\nnumbers of quantum gates The second task deals with the sampling of quantum\ncircuits that generate highly entangled quantum states, which constitute an\nimportant resource for quantum computing. In particular, an evolutionary\nalgorithm is employed to optimize circuits with respect to a fitness function\ndefined with the Mayer-Wallach entanglement measure. We demonstrate that, by\nbalancing the mutation rate between exploration and exploitation, we can find\nentangling quantum circuits for up to five qubits. We also discuss the\ntrade-off between the number of gates in quantum circuits and the computational\ncosts of finding the gate arrangements leading to a strongly entangled state.\nOur findings provide additional insight into the trade-off between the\ncomplexity of a circuit and its performance, which is an important factor in\nthe design of quantum circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qzr-Je32MgfOeF6i5fp6mqh2oePx7GvKRZ5l9a7A__Q","pdfSize":"965059"}
