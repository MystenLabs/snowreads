A\ntwo-phase phase structure is proposed for modeling the\nconfinement-deconfinement phase transition. In the confined phase, the quark\npropagator does not have any pole singularities, while in the deconfined phase,\nthere is a single quark pole.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
