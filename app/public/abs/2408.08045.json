The\nsystem is conceptually similar to the so-called 2-step RACH currently discussed\nin 3GPP standardization. In order to cope with the distributed and CF nature of\nthe network, we propose to partition the network coverage area into zones\n(referred to as ''locations'') and assign an uRA codebook to each location,\nsuch that users in a certain location make use of the associated codebook. The\ncentralized uRA decoder makes use of the multisource AMP algorithm recently\nproposed by the authors. This yields at once the list of active uRA codewords,\nan estimate of the corresponding channel vectors, and an estimate of the active\nusers' position. We show excellent performance of this approach and perfect\nagreement with the rigorous theoretical ''state evolution'' analysis. We also\nshow that the proposed ''location-based'' partitioned codebook approach\nsignificantly outperforms a baseline system with a single non-partitioned uRA\ncodebook.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
