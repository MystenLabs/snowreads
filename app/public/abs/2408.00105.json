By varying the chemical fraction PbTiO$_{3}$, we\ndiscover that these heterostructures' photostrictive behavior can be tuned\nquantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we present simple analytical\nmodels to explain the calculated deformations and predict a critical\nPbTiO$_{3}$ fraction with no photostriction. In addition to the report in [1],\nour results present another way for tuning the photostrictive behavior of\n(PbTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$/(SrTiO$_{3}$)$_{m}$ superlattices, which could be utilized\nfor innovative optomechanical applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
