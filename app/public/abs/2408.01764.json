The model is based on the equation of state (EoS) of the bag model\ntype and the Bose-Einstein dark matter density profile. The derived solutions\nmeet the energy conditions, the causality conditions, and the required\nconditions on the stability factor and adiabatic index, indicating that they\nare physically well-behaved and represent the physical and stable matter\nconfiguration. We also determine the maximum mass, surface redshift, and\ncompactness parameter at the surface. Interestingly, all of these numbers fall\nwithin the specified range, supporting the physical viability of our proposal.\nAdditionally, the various masses that are derived for varying the model\nparameter $k$ correspond to five compact, realistic compact objects, including\nLMC X-4, Her X-1, 4U 1538-52, SAX J1808.4-3658, and Cen X-3. We have also\nillustrated the radially symmetric profiles of energy density and the moment of\ninertia for non-rotating stars.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
