We give two different proofs. The first one\ndepends on the fact that wave fronts are related to discriminants of map germs\nand we then use the analogous result proved by Damon and Mond in this context.\nThe second one is based on ideas by Fern\\'andez de Bobadilla,\nNu\\~no-Ballesteros and Pe\\~nafort Sanchis and by Nu\\~no-Ballesteros and\nFern\\'andez-Hern\\'andez. The advantage of the second approach is that most\nresults are valid for any frontal, not only wave fronts, and thus give\nimportant tools which may be useful to prove the conjecture for frontals in\ngeneral.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
