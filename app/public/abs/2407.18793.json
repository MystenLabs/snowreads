The deformation values were computed\nusing DD-PC1 and DD-ME2 interactions in the Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov\nmodel. Yet another set of deformation was adopted from the Finite Range Droplet\nModel (FRDM). The model-dependent deformation values were used as a free\nparameter in the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation model\nto calculate the $\\beta$-decay properties under terrestrial and stellar\nconditions. The Gamow-Teller strength distributions, branching ratios,\nhalf-lives and stellar weak rates of selected nuclei were later investigated.\nIt was concluded that the $\\beta$-decay properties of neutron-rich nuclei\nchanged with nuclear deformation. The FRDM computed deformation values provided\nthe best predictions for calculated half-lives followed by the DD-ME2\nfunctional. The terrestrial $\\beta$-decay half-lives changed up to 3 orders of\nmagnitude and the stellar $\\beta$-rates within a factor of 2 as the\nneutron-rich nuclei switched their geometrical configurations. For magic number\nnucleus $^{138}$Sn, the stellar rates changed substantially by more than 1\norder of magnitude as the nucleus transitioned away from the spherical shape.\nOur investigation might prove useful for a realistic modeling of\nnucleosynthesis calculation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
