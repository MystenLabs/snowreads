The dynamics have been studied for a wide range\nof impact Weber numbers and two different interfacial shell liquids of varying\nvolumes. The core drop, upon impact, dragged the interfacial liquid into the\nhost liquid, forming an interfacial liquid column with an air cavity inside the\nhost liquid bath. The dynamics is resolved into cavity expansion and rapid\ncontraction, followed by thinning of the interfacial liquid. The interplay of\nviscous dissipation, interfacial pull, and core drop inertia influenced the\nnecking dynamics. The viscous dissipation increases with the thickness of the\ninterfacial layer, which depends on its volume and lateral spread over the\nwater. The necking dynamics transitioned from inertia-dominated deep seal\nclosure at higher spread, lower interfacial film volumes, and higher Weber\nnumbers, into inertia-capillary dominated deep seal closure with an increase in\nfilm volumes, decrease in the spread of the interfacial fluid or decrease in\nWeber number, and finally transitioned into a no seal closure at high volumes,\nlow spread, and low Weber numbers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
