Here, we report on the first follow-up \\nustar{} observation of the\nsource, performed on April 23, 2023, around ten days after the peak of the\noutburst. The \\nustar{} spectrum of the persistent emission ($3-60$ \\kev{}\nband) is well described by an absorbed blackbody with a temperature of\n$kT_{bb}=1.61\\pm 0.04$\\kev{}, most likely arising from the NS surface and a\nComptonization component with power-law index $\\Gamma=1.79\\pm0.02$, arising\nfrom a hot corona at $kT_{e}=16\\pm 2$ keV. The X-ray spectrum of the source\nshows robust reflection features which have not been observed before. We use a\ncouple of self-consistent reflection models, {\\tt relxill} and {\\tt relxillCp},\nto fit the reflection features. We find an upper limit to the inner disc radius\nof $ 6\\: R_{ISCO}$ and $ 9\\: R_{ISCO}$ from {\\tt relxill} and {\\tt relxillCp}\nmodel, respectively. The inclination of the system is estimated to be $\\simeq\n40\\degr$ from both reflection models. Assuming magnetic truncation of the\naccretion disc, the upper limit of magnetic field strength at the pole of the\nNS is found to be $B\\lesssim 1.8\\times 10^{8}$ G. Furthermore, the \\nustar{}\nobservation revealed two type I X-ray bursts and the burst spectroscopy\nconfirms the thermonuclear nature of the burst. The blackbody temperature\nreaches nearly $2.2$ keV at the peak of the burst.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
