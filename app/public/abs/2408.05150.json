The states of the\ndouble-heavy hadron are constrained by a Born-Oppenheimer exclusion principle\nfrom the identical heavy quarks. The states of a pair of identical heavy\nhadrons are constrained by exclusion principles from identical particles. The\ntransitions are also constrained by conservation of angular momentum and\nparity. From these constraints, we derive model-independent selection rules for\ndecays of double-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons. The coupling\npotentials are expressed as sums of products of Born-Oppenheimer transition\namplitudes and angular-momentum coefficients. If there is a single dominant\nBorn-Oppenheimer transition amplitude, it factors out of the coupling\npotentials between double-heavy hadrons in the same Born-Oppenheimer multiplet\nand pairs of heavy hadrons in specific heavy-quark-spin-symmetry multiplets and\nout of the corresponding partial decay rates. As examples, we discuss the\nBorn-Oppenheimer potentials and multiplets for conventional double-heavy\nbaryons and for double-heavy tetraquark mesons. We also discuss the relative\npartial decay rates for conventional double-heavy baryons into pairs of heavy\nhadrons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
