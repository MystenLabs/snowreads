The algorithms\noutperform conventional free-space planners such as A* especially when the\nqueried points are far apart. The thesis presents novel search methods to speed\nup vector-based algorithms in non-convex obstacles by delaying line-of-sight\nchecks. The \"best hull\" is a notable method that allows for monotonically\nincreasing path cost estimates even without verifying line-of-sight, utilizing\n\"phantom points\" placed on non-convex corners to mimic future turning points.\nBuilding upon the methods, the algorithms R2 and R2+ are formulated, which\noutperform other vector-based algorithms when the optimal path solution is\nexpected to have few turning points. Other novel methods include a novel and\nversatile multi-dimensional ray tracer for occupancy grids, and a description\nof the three-dimensional angular sector for future works.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MQQVSEhu-cDk7QzT-cIlXBM9PoHuXBONZBtDptS_U5Q","pdfSize":"2560756"}
