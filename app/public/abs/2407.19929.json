Analytic insights into eigenstate\ncorrelations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form\nfactor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary\nquantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite\nsubsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial\ntimes, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity\nimplies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the\nlinear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we\nprove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result\nup to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical\nresults by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as\nwell as with numerics for finite-size systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8---0L2AedZrwHyYW9zqBLD4yl-wyV9M2Qm-vNnHaMk","pdfSize":"870017","objectId":"0xdfd06084e27b09ea746f01f6bff691945fa7971f985e0d234b5afb8b69708723","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
