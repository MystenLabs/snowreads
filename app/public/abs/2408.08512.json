Unlike other approaches, we use magnetostatic\nequations and assume only a relatively rapid decrease in the axial magnetic\nfield at infinity. For the first time we obtain a new nonlinear equation for\nthe axial current density, the derivation of which does not require any\nphenomenological assumptions. From the resulting nonlinear equation, we\nanalytically find the radial profiles of the components of the magnetic field\nstrength and current density.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
