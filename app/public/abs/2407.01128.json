As illustrative cases to reveal the\nimportant role played by the coupled channels, we focus on the $\\phi$p and\n$\\rho^0$p systems given their complex dynamics and the presence of quasi-bound\nstates or resonances in the vicinity of their thresholds. We show that the\n$\\phi$p femtoscopic data provide novel information about a $N^*$ state present\nin the experimental region and anticipate the relevance of a future $\\rho^0$p\ncorrelation function measurement in order to pin down the $S=0, Q=+1$ vector\nmeson-baryon interaction as well as to disclose the characterizing features of\nthe $N^*(1700)$ state.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
