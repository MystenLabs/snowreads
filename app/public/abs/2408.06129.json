This conjecture was\nproved by Symonds in 1998. In this paper, we suggest a generalisation of Webb's\nconjecture for finite reductive groups. This is done by associating to each\nirreducible character a new simplicial complex defined in terms of\nDeligne--Lusztig theory. We then show that our conjecture follows from a\ncondition, called ($e$-HC-conj) below, related to generalised Harish-Chandra\ntheory. In particular, using earlier results of the author, we prove our\nconjecture and recover Symonds result for finite reductive groups under mild\nrestrictions on the prime $\\ell$. Finally, we show that the condition\n($e$-HC-conj) is implied by the contractibility of the orbit spaces associated\nto our newly defined complex offering an unexplored topological approach to\nproving the uniqueness of $e$-cuspidal pairs up to conjugation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
