This generalizes the corresponding result of\nBezrukavnikov and Kaledin to the super case. We relate the equivalence classes\nof quantizations of supervarieties with that of their even reduced symplectic\nvarieties. Finally, we prove that certain nilpotent orbits of basic Lie\nsuperalgebras are admissible and splitting, and classify their deformation\nquantizations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
