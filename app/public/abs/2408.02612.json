We formulate the traffic accident\nintensity as a log-Gaussian Cox Process and model it as a spatiotemporal point\nprocess with and without fixed and random effect components that incorporate\npossible covariates and spatial correlation information. The covariate includes\npopulation density and distance of accident locations from schools, from\nmarkets, from bus stops and from worship places. We estimate the posterior of\nthe state variables using integrated nested Laplace approximations with\nstochastic partial differential equations approach by considering Mat\\`ern\nprior. Deviance and Watanabe - Akaike information criteria are used to check\nthe performance of the models. We implement the methodology to map traffic\naccident intensity over Addis Ababa entirely and on its road networks and\nvisualize the potential traffic accident hotspot areas. The comparison of the\nobservation with the model output reveals that the covariates considered has\nsignificant effect for the accident intensity. Moreover, the information\ncriteria results reveal the model with covariate performs well compared with\nthe model without covariates. We obtained temporal correlation of the\nlog-intensity as 0.78 indicating the existence of similar traffic fatality\ntrend in space during the study period.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
