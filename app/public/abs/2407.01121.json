A graph is equimatchable if every maximal matching is maximum. We\nstudy these concepts on strong product graphs. We fully characterize\nwell-edge-dominated and equimatchable strong product graphs of nontrivial\ngraphs, and identify a large family of graphs whose strong products with any\nwell-dominated graph are well-dominated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
