Most of the key science goals require the joint analysis of datasets\nfrom multiple surveys to break parameter degeneracies and calibrate\nsystematics. To realize such analyses, a large set of mock simulations that\nrealistically model correlated observables is required. In this paper we\npresent the N-body component of the HalfDome cosmological simulations, designed\nfor the joint analysis of Stage-IV cosmological surveys, such as Rubin LSST,\nEuclid, SPHEREx, Roman, DESI, PFS, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD.\nOur 300TB initial data release includes full-sky lightcones and halo catalogs\nbetween $z$=0--4 for 11 fixed cosmology realizations, as well as an additional\nrun with local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{\\rm NL}$=20). The simulations\nevolve $6144^3$ particles in a 3.75$\\,h^{-1} {\\rm Gpc}$ box, reaching a minimum\nhalo mass of $\\sim 6 \\times 10^{12}\\,h^{-1} M_\\odot$ and maximum scale of $k\n\\sim 1\\,h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.
