Traditional Hierarchical Bayesian\ninference techniques employed to discern these properties often entail\nsubstantial time investments, and consensus regarding the spin distribution of\nBinary Black Hole (BBH) systems remains elusive. In this study, leveraging\nobservations from GWTC-3, we adopt a machine learning approach to infer the\nspin distribution of black holes within BBH systems. Specifically, we develop a\nDeep Neural Network (DNN) and train it using data generated from a Beta\ndistribution. Our training strategy, involving the segregation of data into 10\nbins, not only expedites model training but also enhances the DNN's versatility\nand adaptability to accommodate the burgeoning volume of gravitational wave\nobservations. Utilizing Monte Carlo-bootstrap (MC-bootstrap) to generate\nobservation-simulated samples, we derive spin distribution parameters:\n$\\alpha=1.3^{+0.25}_{-0.18},\\beta=1.70^{+0.24}_{-0.29}$ for the larger BH\nsample and $\\alpha=1.37^{+0.31}_{-0.20},\\beta=1.63^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$ for the\nsmaller BH sample. Within our constraints, the distributions of component spin\nmagnitudes suggest the likelihood of both black holes in the BBH merger\npossessing non-zero spin.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
