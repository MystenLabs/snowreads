We performed\ndeep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of two star-forming clusters in Digel Cloud\n2, a star-forming region in the Outer Galaxy ($R_G \\gtrsim 15$ kpc). The very\nhigh sensitivity and spatial resolution of JWST enable us to resolve cluster\nmembers clearly down to a mass detection limit of 0.02 $M_\\odot$, enabling the\nfirst detection of brown dwarfs in low-metallicity clusters. Fifty-two and\nninety-one sources were extracted in mass-$A_V$-limited samples in the two\nclusters, from which Initial mass functions (IMFs) were derived by\nmodel-fitting the F200W band luminosity function, resulting in IMF peak masses\n(hereafter $M_C$) $\\log M_C / M_\\odot\n  \\simeq -1.5 \\pm 0.5$ for both clusters. Although the uncertainties are rather\nlarge, the obtained $M_C$ values are lower than those in any previous study\n($\\log M_C / M_\\odot \\sim -0.5$). Comparison with the local open clusters with\nsimilar ages to the target clusters ($\\sim$$10^6$-$10^7$ yr) suggests a\nmetallicity dependence of $M_C$, with lower $M_C$ at lower metallicities, while\nthe comparison with globular clusters, similarly low metallicities but\nconsiderably older ($\\sim$$10^{10}$ yr), suggests that the target clusters have\nnot yet experienced significant dynamical evolution and remain in their initial\nphysical condition. The lower $M_C$ is also consistent with the theoretical\nexpectation of the lower Jeans mass due to the higher gas density under such\nlow metallicity. The $M_C$ values derived from observations in such an\nenvironment would place significant constraints on the understanding of star\nformation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eBo7eOBmsrhVC1opvBt2UIyckZQJR1fiIvakps-M138","pdfSize":"16680154"}
