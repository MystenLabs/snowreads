Computing relevant scattering quantities from ab\ninitio methods is extremely difficult on classical devices because of the\nsubstantial computational resources needed. This work reports the development\nof an algorithm that makes it possible to obtain phase shifts for generic\nnon-relativistic elastic scattering processes on a quantum computer. This\nalgorithm is based on extracting phase shifts from the direct implementation of\nthe real-time evolution. The algorithm is improved by a variational procedure,\nmaking it more accurate and resistant to the quantum noise. The reliability of\nthe algorithm is first demonstrated by means of classical numerical simulations\nfor different potentials, and later tested on existing quantum hardware,\nspecifically on IBM quantum processors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
