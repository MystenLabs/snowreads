To effectively train deep learning models like YOLO for real-time fruit\ndetection, high-quality image datasets are essential. However, such datasets\nare often lacking in agriculture. Generative AI models can help create\nhigh-quality images. In this study, we used MidJourney and Firefly tools to\ngenerate images of melon greenhouses and post-harvest fruits through\ntext-to-image, pre-harvest image-to-image, and post-harvest image-to-image\nmethods. We evaluated these AIgenerated images using PSNR and SSIM metrics and\ntested the detection performance of the YOLOv9 model. We also assessed the net\nquality of real and generated fruits. Our results showed that generative AI\ncould produce images very similar to real ones, especially for post-harvest\nfruits. The YOLOv9 model detected the generated images well, and the net\nquality was also measurable. This shows that generative AI can create realistic\nimages useful for fruit detection and quality assessment, indicating its great\npotential in agriculture. This study highlights the potential of AI-generated\nimages for data augmentation in melon fruit detection and quality assessment\nand envisions a positive future for generative AI applications in agriculture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
