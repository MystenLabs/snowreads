Although Large Language Models (LLMs)\ndemonstrate personality traits, the relationship between personality traits and\nsafety abilities in LLMs still remains a mystery. In this paper, we discover\nthat LLMs' personality traits are closely related to their safety abilities,\ni.e., toxicity, privacy, and fairness, based on the reliable MBTI-M scale.\nMeanwhile, the safety alignment generally increases various LLMs' Extraversion,\nSensing, and Judging traits. According to such findings, we can edit LLMs'\npersonality traits and improve their safety performance, e.g., inducing\npersonality from ISTJ to ISTP resulted in a relative improvement of\napproximately 43% and 10% in privacy and fairness performance, respectively.\nAdditionally, we find that LLMs with different personality traits are\ndifferentially susceptible to jailbreak. This study pioneers the investigation\nof LLM safety from a personality perspective, providing new insights into LLM\nsafety enhancement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
