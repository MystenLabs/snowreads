Yet,\nextensive empirical studies exploring these unique patterns and indoor\npollutions extent are missing. To fill this gap, we carried out a six months\nlong field study involving over 30 households, uncovering the complexity of\nindoor air pollution in developing countries, such as the longer lingering time\nof VOCs in the air or the significant influence of air circulation on the\nspatiotemporal distribution of pollutants. We introduced an innovative IoT air\nquality sensing platform, the Distributed Air QuaLiTy MONitor (DALTON ),\nexplicitly designed to meet the needs of these nations, considering factors\nlike cost, sensor type, accuracy, network connectivity, power, and usability.\nAs a result of a multi-device deployment, the platform identifies pollution\nhot-spots in low and middle-income households in developing nations. It\nidentifies best practices to minimize daily indoor pollution exposure. Our\nextensive qualitative survey estimates an overall system usability score of\n2.04, indicating an efficient system for air quality monitoring.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
