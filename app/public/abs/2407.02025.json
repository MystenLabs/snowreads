Recent work has shown that\nsuch models can separate generic pairs of non-equivalent geometric graphs,\nthough they may fail to separate some rare and complicated instances. However,\nthese results assume a fully connected graph, where each node possesses\ncomplete knowledge of all other nodes. In contrast, often, in application,\nevery node only possesses knowledge of a small number of nearest neighbors.\nThis paper shows that generic pairs of non-equivalent geometric graphs can be\nseparated by message-passing networks with rotation equivariant features as\nlong as the underlying graph is connected. When only invariant intermediate\nfeatures are allowed, generic separation is guaranteed for generically globally\nrigid graphs. We introduce a simple architecture, EGENNET, which achieves our\ntheoretical guarantees and compares favorably with alternative architecture on\nsynthetic and chemical benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
