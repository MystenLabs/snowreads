Up to\ndate, this spin chain model remains unfathomable; the coordinate Bethe Ansatz\ndoes not lead to a solution from three magnons on, as the Yang-Baxter equation\nis not satisfied by the two-magnon scattering coefficients. In this paper, we\nfind a long-range solution to the eigenvalue problem for three magnons.\nRemarkably, the scattering coefficients of our solution together with the\nposition-dependent corrections, obey an infinite tower of Yang-Baxter\nequations. Our method of solving the three-magnon problem is interesting in its\nown right and generalizes the coordinate Bethe Ansatz approach to cases where\nthe permutation symmetry is broken.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
