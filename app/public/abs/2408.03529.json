We\nintroduce the concepts of sL-approximation spaces, L-approximation spaces and\nbc-approximation spaces, which are special types of CF-approximation spaces. We\nprove that the collection of CF-closed sets in an sL-approximation space\n(resp., an L-approximation space, a bc-approximation space) ordered by\nset-theoretic inclusion is an sL-domain (resp., an L-domain, a bc-domain);\nconversely, every sL-domain (resp., L-domain, bc-domain) is order-isomorphic to\nthe collection of CF-closed sets of an sL-approximation space (resp., an\nL-approximation space, a bc-approximation space). Consequently, we establish an\nequivalence between the category of sL-domains (resp., L-domains) with Scott\ncontinuous mappings and that of sL-approximation spaces (resp., L-approximation\nspaces) with CF-approximable relations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
