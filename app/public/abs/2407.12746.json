In the first of these invoking two additonal\nconditions were needed, while in the second an explicit, fully general result\nwas obtained. Subsequently, Frederik Broucke and Gregory Debruyne obtained, via\na different method, a general Carlson type density theorem with an even better\nexponent, and recently Frederik Broucke improved this further, getting\n$N(\\sigma,T) \\le T^{a(1-\\sigma)}$ with any $a>\\dfrac{4}{1-\\theta}$. Broucke\nemployed a new mean value estimate of the Beurling zeta function, while he did\nnot use the method of Hal\\'asz and Montgomery.\n  Here we elaborate a new approach of the first author, using the classical\nzero detecting sums coupled with a kernel function technique and Hal\\'asz'\nmethod, but otherwise arguing in an elementary way avoiding e.g. mean value\nestimates for Dirichlet polynomials. We will make essential use of the\nadditional assumptions that the Beurling system of integers consists of natural\nnumbers, and that the system satisfies the Ramanujan condition, too. This way\nwe give a new variant of the Carlson type density estimate with similar\nstrength as Tur\\'an's 1954 result for the Riemann $\\zeta$ function, coming\nclose even to the Density Hypothesis for $\\sigma$ close to 1.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
