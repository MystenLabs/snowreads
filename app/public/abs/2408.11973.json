We present results from the CalVision consortium studying\nthe collection of Cerenkov and scintillation signals in PbWO$_4$ and BGO\ncrystal samples exposed to 120\\,GeV proton beams at the Fermilab Test Beam\nFacility, including proof-of-principle measurements aimed at demonstrating the\nidentification of a sufficiently large Cerenkov signal in homogeneous\nscintillating crystals to support dual-readout capability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
