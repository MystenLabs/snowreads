The objective of this research is to develop a robust system\nthat can accurately recognize and classify hand gestures representing numbers.\nThe proposed approach involves collecting a dataset of hand gesture images,\npreprocessing and enhancing the images, extracting relevant features, and\ntraining a machine learning model. The advancement of computer vision\ntechnology and object detection techniques, in conjunction with OpenCV's\ncapability to analyze and comprehend hand gestures, presents a chance to\ntransform the identification of numerical digits and its potential\napplications. The advancement of computer vision technology and object\nidentification technologies, along with OpenCV's capacity to analyze and\ninterpret hand gestures, has the potential to revolutionize human interaction,\nboosting people's access to information, education, and employment\nopportunities.
