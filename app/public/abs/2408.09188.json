We establish\nseveral analytical results and conduct a numerical study to analyze the\nbehavior of the coefficients of these projections as functions of the Hurst\nindex and the number of neighboring elements used for the projection. We derive\nrecurrence relations for the coefficients of the two-sided projection.\nAdditionally, we explore the norms of both types of projections. Certain\nspecial cases are investigated in greater detail, both theoretically and\nnumerically.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
