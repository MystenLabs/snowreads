The new method extends our previous\nSympOCNet framework by introducing a time-dependent symplectic network into the\narchitecture. In addition, we propose a more general latent representation,\nwhich greatly improves model expressivity based on the universal approximation\ntheorem. We demonstrate the efficacy of TSympOCNet in path planning problems\nwith obstacle and collision avoidance, including systems with Newtonian\ndynamics and non-convex environments, up to dimension 512. Our method shows\nsignificant promise in handling efficiently both complex dynamics and\nconstraints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
