The construction of Hermitian, field-dependent, dichotomic operators is\ndevised as well as the Bell-CHSH inequality. Working out the $AB$ part of the\ninequality, the resulting Bell-CHSH correlation function for the quantum field\nnaturally emerges from unitary Weyl operators. Furthermore, introducing a\nJaynes-Cummings type Hamiltonian accounting for the interaction between the\nscalar field and a pair of qubits, the quantum corrections to the Bell-CHSH\ninequality in the vacuum state of the scalar field are evaluated till the\nsecond order in perturbation theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
