However, existing single-shot phase\nreconstruction methods through lensless fiber endomicroscope typically perform\nwell on simple images but struggle with complex microscopic structures. Here,\nwe propose a speckle-conditioned diffusion model (SpecDiffusion), which\nreconstructs phase images directly from speckles captured at the detection side\nof a multi-core fiber (MCF). Unlike conventional neural networks, SpecDiffusion\nemploys iterative phase denoising steps for speckle-driven phase\nreconstruction. The iteration scheme allows SpecDiffusion to break down the\nphase reconstruction process into multiple steps, gradually building up to the\nfinal phase image. This attribute alleviates the computation challenge at each\nstep and enables the reconstruction of rich details in complex microscopic\nimages. To validate its efficacy, we build an optical system to capture\nspeckles from MCF and construct a dataset consisting of 100,000 paired images.\nSpecDiffusion provides high-fidelity phase reconstruction results and shows\npowerful generalization capacity for unseen objects, such as test charts and\nbiological tissues, reducing the average mean absolute error of the\nreconstructed tissue images by 7 times. Furthermore, the reconstructed tissue\nimages using SpecDiffusion shows higher accuracy in zero-shot cell segmentation\ntasks compared to the conventional method, demonstrating the potential for\nfurther cell morphology analysis through the learning-based lensless fiber\nendomicroscope. SpecDiffusion offers a precise and generalized method to phase\nreconstruction through scattering media, including MCFs, opening new\nperspective in lensless fiber endomicroscopic imaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
