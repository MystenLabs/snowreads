We study a specific set of\none-dimensional spin models where each such family forms a one-parameter loop\nin a two-dimensional phase diagram. Foliating the non-critical region by such\nloops identifies \"radial\" and \"angular\" coordinates in the phase diagram that\nrespectively parametrize different families and different members of a single\nfamily. We show that each one-parameter family is a generalized Thouless charge\npump, all with the same topological index, and hence the gapped phase undergoes\none or more nontrivial boundary phase transitions as we vary the angular\ncoordinate in a loop through members of one family. Tuning the radial\ncoordinate generates loci of boundary critical points that terminate at\nendpoints of the bulk unnecessary critical line within the gapped phase. We\ndiscuss broader implications of our results and possible extensions to higher\ndimensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
