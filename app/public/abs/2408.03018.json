Correspondingly, researchers must address the\nchallenge of integrating multiple diverse motion skills into controllers. While\nexisting reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have achieved notable\nsuccess in multi-skill integration for legged robots, these methods often\nrequire intricate reward engineering or are restricted to integrating a\npredefined set of motion skills constrained by specific task objectives,\nresulting in limited flexibility. In this work, we introduce a flexible\nmulti-skill integration framework named Controllable Skills Integration (CSI).\nCSI enables the integration of a diverse set of motion skills with varying\nstyles into a single policy without the need for complex reward tuning.\nFurthermore, in a hierarchical control manner, the trained low-level policy can\nbe coupled with a high-level Natural Language Inference (NLI) module to enable\npreliminary language-directed skill control. Our experiments demonstrate that\nCSI can flexibly integrate a diverse array of motion skills more\ncomprehensively and facilitate the transitions between different skills.\nAdditionally, CSI exhibits good scalability as the number of motion skills to\nbe integrated increases significantly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
