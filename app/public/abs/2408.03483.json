We present the implementation of\nthe $3^{rd}$ order Upwind and the $5^{th}$ order Upwind and WENO reconstruction\nschemes in the TT format. It is shown in detail that the linear upwind schemes\ncan be implemented by directly manipulating the TT cores while the WENO scheme\nrequires the use of TT cross interpolation for the nonlinear reconstruction. In\nthe development of numerical fluxes, we directly compute the flux for the\nlinear SWEs without using TT rounding or cross interpolation. For the nonlinear\nSWEs where the TT reciprocal of the shallow water layer thickness is needed for\nfluxes, we develop an approximation algorithm using Taylor series to compute\nthe TT reciprocal. The performance of the TT finite volume solver with linear\nand nonlinear reconstruction options is investigated under a physically\nrelevant set of validation problems. In all test cases, the TT finite volume\nmethod maintains the formal high-order accuracy of the corresponding\ntraditional finite volume method. In terms of speed, the TT solver achieves up\nto 124x acceleration of the traditional full-tensor scheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
