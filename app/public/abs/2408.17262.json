Here, we study the effects of magnetic\nfrustration in curvilinear (quasi-)1D magnets represented by spin chains\narranged along closed space curves of constant torsion. Considering the cases\nof easy- and hard-axis anisotropy in ferro- and antiferromagnetic samples, we\ndetermine their ground states and analyze the related magnetoelectric\nmultipoles. A constant torsion along the chain results in alternating regions\nof high and low curvature, facilitating the spin spiral state perturbed by the\n(anti)periodic boundary conditions on the magnetic order parameter. While\neasy-axis ferromagnetic chains develop a purely toroidal configuration with the\nmagnetic toroidal moment oriented along the geometry symmetry axis, hard-axis\nantiferromagnetic chains support multiple magnetic toroidal domains. Our\nfindings suggest that tailoring curvature and torsion of a spin chain enables a\nnew physical mechanism for magnetic frustration, which can be observed in the\ninhomogeneity of the magnetic order parameter and in the local ferrotoroidic\nresponses.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
