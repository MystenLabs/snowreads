In this\narticle, we derive distribution of $f(n)$ modulo one for all $n$ with at least\nthree divisors and also we study distribution of $f(n)$ for all square-free $n$\nwith at least two prime factors. We study exponential sums when weighted by\ndivisor functions and exponential sums over square free numbers. In particular,\nwe are interested in evaluating \\begin{align*} \\sum_{n\\leq\nN}\\tau(n)e\\left(f(n)\\right) ~\\text{and}~\\sum_{n\\leq\nN}\\mu^2(n)e\\left(f(n)\\right), \\end{align*} for some polynomial $f$, where\n$\\tau$ is the divisor function and $\\mu$ is the M\\\"{o}bius function. We get\nnon-trivial estimates when the leading co-efficient $\\alpha$ of $f$ belongs to\nthe minor arc.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
