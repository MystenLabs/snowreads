For the Beilinson--Bloch\nheights, we show that for any $g\\ge 2$, there is a Zariski open dense subset\n$U$ of $\\mathcal{M}_g$, the coarse moduli of curves of genus $g$ over\nrationals, such that the heights of Ceresa cycles and Gross--Schoen cycles over\n$U$ satisfy the Northcott property. For the Abel--Jacobi periods, we provide an\nalgebraic criterion for the existence of a Zariski open dense subset of any\nfamily such that all cycles not defined over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ are\nnon-torsion and verify that this criterion holds for Ceresa cycles and\nGross--Schoen cycles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
