Multislice ptychography can achieve deep\nsub-{\\AA}ngstrom resolution in the transverse direction, but the depth\nresolution is limited to 2 to 3 nanometers. In this paper, we propose and\ndemonstrate an end-to-end approach to reconstructing the electrostatic\npotential volume of the sample directly from the 4D-STEM datasets. End-to-end\nmulti-slice ptychographic tomography recovers several slices at each tomography\ntilt angle and compensates for the missing wedge effect. The algorithm is\ninitially tested in simulation with a Pt@$\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ core-shell\nnanoparticle, where both heavy and light atoms are recovered in 3D from an\nunaligned 4D-STEM tilt series with a restricted tilt range of 90 degrees. We\nalso demonstrate the algorithm experimentally, recovering a Te nanoparticle\nwith sub-{\\AA}ngstrom resolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"UXNif8U8e0mIpX0K5Q24JH66Xlp3mULbmY5tIgo1qQI","pdfSize":"8102677"}
