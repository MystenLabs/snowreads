We consider systems where\nthe controller is implemented by a feedforward neural network with ReLU\nactivations. The reachability problem asks, given a set of initial states,\nwhether a set of target states can be reached. We show that this problem is\nundecidable even for trivial plants and fixed-depth neural networks with three\ninputs and outputs. We also show that the problem becomes semi-decidable when\nthe plant as well as the input and target sets are given by automata over\ninfinite words.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
