With the rise of Large Language Models\n(LLM), progressively participating as smart agents to accelerate machine\nlearning development, Hybrid Intelligence is becoming an increasingly important\ntopic for effective interaction between humans and machines. This paper\npresents an approach to leverage Hybrid Intelligence towards sustainable and\nenergy-aware machine learning. When developing machine learning models, final\nmodel performance commonly rules the optimization process while the efficiency\nof the process itself is often neglected. Moreover, in recent times, energy\nefficiency has become equally crucial due to the significant environmental\nimpact of complex and large-scale computational processes. The contribution of\nthis work covers the interactive inclusion of secondary knowledge sources\nthrough Human-in-the-loop (HITL) and LLM agents to stress out and further\nresolve inefficiencies in the machine learning development process.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
