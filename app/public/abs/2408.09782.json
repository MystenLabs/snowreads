By employing the generalized off-shell\nHelmholtz free energy approach, we meticulously compute the thermodynamic\ntopology of these selected black holes. Furthermore, we establish their\ntopological classifications. Our findings reveal that quantum correction terms\ninfluence the topological charges of black holes in Kiselev spacetime, leading\nto novel insights into topological classifications. Our research findings\nelucidate that, in contrast to the scenario in which $\\omega=0$ and $a=0.7$\nwith total topological charge $W=0$ and $\\omega=-4/3$ with total topological\ncharge $W=-1$, in other cases, the total topological charge for the black hole\nunder consideration predominantly stabilizes at +1. This stabilization occurs\nwith the significant influence of the parameters a, c, and $\\omega$ on the\nnumber of topological charges. Specifically, when $\\omega$ assumes the values\nof $\\omega=-1/3$, $\\omega=-2/3$ , $\\omega=-1$, the total topological charge\nconsistently be to W = +1.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h2D8cm8RAiLPTvE-b2z0tI1AiUVm7G_JxKiZohoekik","pdfSize":"870931"}
