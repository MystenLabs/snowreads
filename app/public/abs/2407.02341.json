Surprisingly, very few studies have been published on the comparative\nanalysis of testbeds with different hardware and software elements.\n  In this paper, we first introduce a precise nomenclature to characterize a\n5G-standalone single-cell testbed based on its constituent elements and main\nconfiguration parameters. We then build 30 distinct such testbeds and\nsystematically analyze their performance with an emphasis on element\ninteroperability (by considering different combinations of hardware and\nsoftware elements from different sources), the number and type of User\nEquipment (UE) as well as the Radio Access Network hardware and software\nelements to address the following questions: 1) How is the performance (in\nterms of bit rate and latency) impacted by different elements? 2) How does the\nnumber of UEs affect these results? 3) What is the impact of the user(s)'\nlocation(s) on the performance? 4) What is the impact of the UE type on these\nresults? 5) How far does each testbed provide coverage? 6) And finally, what is\nthe effect of the computing resources available to each open-source software?\nThis study focuses on TDD testbeds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
