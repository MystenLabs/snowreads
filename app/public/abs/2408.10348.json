Operation of most sensors used to-date is\nbased on projective measurement along a single axis combined with computational\nextrapolation. Here, we show that the individually addressable carbon-related\nspin defect in hexagonal boron nitride is a multi-axis spin system for\nvectorial nanoscale magnetometry. We demonstrate how its low symmetry and\nstrongly spin-selective direct and reverse intersystem crossing dynamics\nprovide sub-$\\mu$T/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ magnetic-field sensitivity for both on\nand off-axis bias magnetic field exceeding 50 mT. Alongside these features, the\nroom-temperature operation and the nanometer-scale proximity enabled by the van\nder Waals host material further consolidate this system as an exciting quantum\nsensing platform.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4n8seD2CX5pvVF5YTRhWbxkvr5eGL34UGHYJ7DZQBrk","pdfSize":"9579066"}
