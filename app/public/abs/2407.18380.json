In this\nmedium, a user's avatar (virtual representation) is controlled by the tracked\nmotion of the user's headset and hand controllers. This tracked motion is a\nrich data stream that can leak characteristics of the user or can be\neffectively matched to previously-identified data to identify a user. To better\nunderstand the boundaries of motion data identifiability, we investigate how\nvarying training data duration and train-test delay affects the accuracy at\nwhich a machine learning model can correctly classify user motion in a\nsupervised learning task simulating re-identification. The dataset we use has a\nunique combination of a large number of participants, long duration per\nsession, large number of sessions, and a long time span over which sessions\nwere conducted. We find that training data duration and train-test delay affect\nidentifiability; that minimal train-test delay leads to very high accuracy; and\nthat train-test delay should be controlled in future experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
