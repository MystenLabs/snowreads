In the equivariant setting, this identifies space-valued Tambara\nfunctors with normed algebras with respect to a certain normed monoidal\nstructure on grouplike $G$-commutative monoids in spaces. We then show that the\nlatter is canonically equivalent to the normed monoidal structure on connective\n$G$-spectra given by the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norms. Combining our comparison\nwith results of Elmanto-Haugseng and Barwick-Glasman-Mathew-Nikolaus, we\nproduce normed ring structures on equivariant algebraic K-theory spectra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
