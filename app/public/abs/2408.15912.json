We perform large-scale\nparameter space scans of the model using two-loop effective potential at\nnext-to-next-to leading order in the high-temperature expansion, greatly\nimproving description of phase transition thermodynamics over existing one-loop\nstudies. We find that 1) two-loop corrections to the effective potential lead\nto narrower regions of strong first-order transitions and significantly smaller\ncritical temperatures, 2) transitions involving a discontinuity in the singlet\nexpectation value are significantly stronger at two-loop order, 3)\nhigh-temperature expansion is accurate for a wide range of parameter space that\nallows strong transitions, although it is less reliable for the very strongest\ntransitions. These findings suggest revisiting past studies that connect the\npossibility of a first-order electroweak phase transition with future collider\nphenomenology.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3AeRtm_Pdl7xlS-bXg6V-wU0pcTjgocimZzBZnrbWvY","pdfSize":"3595832"}
