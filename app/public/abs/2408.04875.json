The positive\nsemidefinite penalty (PSDP) method originated from research on semidefinite\nrelaxation, where the introduction of an exact penalty function improves the\nefficiency and accuracy of problem solving. In this paper, we propose a\nvectorized PSDP method for solving the UBQP problem, which optimizes\ncomputational efficiency by vectorizing matrix variables within a PSDP\nframework. Algorithmic enhancements in penalty updating and initialization are\nimplemented, along with the introduction of two algorithms that integrate the\nproximal point algorithm and the projection alternating BB method for\nsubproblem resolution. Properties of the penalty function and algorithm\nconvergence are analyzed. Numerical experiments show the superior performance\nof the method in providing high-quality solutions and satisfactory solution\ntimes compared to the semidefinite relaxation method and other established\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"taqqNphEODTBOUYX_tGHfDLehystycQe-tNb2rYOgQo","pdfSize":"480644"}
