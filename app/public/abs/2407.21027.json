Each camera in the setup has a field of view (FOV). Multi-view\nanalysis requires overlap of the FOVs of all cameras, or a significant subset\nof them. However, the success of such methods is not guaranteed, because the\nFOVs may not sufficiently overlap. The reason is that pointing of a camera from\na mount or platform has some randomness (noise), due to imprecise platform\ncontrol, typical to mechanical systems, and particularly moving systems such as\nsatellites. So, success is probabilistic. This paper creates a framework to\nanalyze this aspect. This is critical for setting limitations on the\ncapabilities of imaging systems, such as resolution (pixel footprint), FOV, the\nsize of domains that can be captured, and efficiency. The framework uses the\nfact that imprecise pointing can be mitigated by self-calibration - provided\nthat there is sufficient overlap between pairs of views and sufficient visual\nsimilarity of views. We show an example considering the design of a formation\nof nanosatellites that seek 3D reconstruction of clouds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RoCDd2-Xsfl2ZY82CK2uWixbgAwJby-sFv5UdXPUpgU","pdfSize":"1623982"}
