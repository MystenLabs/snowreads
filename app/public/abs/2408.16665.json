The strong coupling expansion\nis based on a canonical Schrieffer-Wolff transformation of the Hamiltonian,\nwhich is performed after $1/S$ expansion of the local moments and determined\niteratively by requiring that spin-flip terms are removed at each order. We\ndemonstrate that the canonical transformation can be viewed as an\norder-by-order diagonalization of the quantum Kondo coupling -- the dominant\nterm in the strong coupling regime. A consequence is that the transformed\nelectron operators correspond to electrons in a state of total spin $S\\pm 1/2$\nwith the local moments, and the transformed boson operators describe spin wave\nexcitations of the total local spin. We show that the electron degrees of\nfreedom can be thought of as tightly bound spin polarons. We further show that\nthe strong coupling spin wave expansion is readily extended to include the\neffects of spin-orbit coupling or electron pairing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
