We conduct a series of experiments examining various\nrepresentations of tabular data interspersed with text to understand the\nrelative benefits of different representations. We choose a corpus of $3^{rd}$\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) documents since they are heavily\ninterspersed with tables. We create expert curated dataset of question answers\nto evaluate our approach. We conclude that row level representations with\ncorresponding table header information being included in every cell improves\nthe performance of the retrieval, thus leveraging the structural information\npresent in the tabular data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
