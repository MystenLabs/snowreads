We propose a\nsensing-centric (SC) approach for target detection using communication signals\nwith or without sensing signals. Power allocation is optimized to maximize the\nsensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed SC scheme while ensuring a\nrequired quality-of-service (QoS) for the communication user equipment (UEs),\nand adhering to each access points (APs) power budget. Numerical results show\nthat the proposed SC scheme vastly outperforms a communication-centric method\nthat minimizes the total power consumed at the APs subject to the same\nconstraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lolH1ifs6aInTowXMxgXxg4fLLqCN9UcPyjE3-hTrPo","pdfSize":"1020799"}
