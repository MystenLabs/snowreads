This tool\nidentifies all CV subtypes, including magnetic and low-accretion rate systems,\nin contrast to most previous surveys. We find 23 CVs, 3 of which are AM CVns,\nout to 150 pc in the Western Galactic Hemisphere. Our 150 pc sample is\nspectroscopically verified and complete down to $L_X = 1.3\\times 10^{29}\n\\;\\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.2--2.3 keV band, and we also present CV\ncandidates out to 300 pc and 1000 pc. We discovered two previously unknown\nsystems in our 150 pc sample: the third nearest AM CVn and a magnetic period\nbouncer. We find the mean $L_X$ of CVs to be $\\langle L_X \\rangle \\approx\n4.6\\times 10^{30} \\;\\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$, in contrast to previous surveys which\nyielded $\\langle L_X \\rangle \\sim 10^{31}-10^{32} \\;\\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We\nconstruct X-ray luminosity functions that, for the first time, flatten out at\n$L_X\\sim 10^{30} \\; \\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We find average number, mass, and\nluminosity densities of $\\rho_\\textrm{N, CV} = (3.7 \\pm 0.7) \\times 10^{-6}\n\\textrm{pc}^{-3}$, $\\rho_M = (5.0 \\pm 1.0) \\times 10^{-5} M_\\odot^{-1}$, and\n$\\rho_{L_X} = (2.3 \\pm 0.4) \\times 10^{26} \\textrm{erg s}^{-1}M_\\odot^{-1}$,\nrespectively, in the solar neighborhood. Our uniform selection method also\nallows us to place meaningful estimates on the space density of AM CVns,\n$\\rho_\\textrm{N, AM CVn} = (5.5 \\pm 3.7) \\times 10^{-7} \\textrm{pc}^{-3}$.\nMagnetic CVs and period bouncers make up $35\\%$ and $25\\%$ of our sample,\nrespectively. This work, through a novel discovery technique, shows that the\nobserved number densities of CVs and AM CVns, as well as the fraction of period\nbouncers, are still in tension with population synthesis estimates.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
