The tool seamlessly combines code display,\ncompile- and run-time error messages, and stack frame read-outs alongside an AI\ninterface, leveraging compiler error context for improved explanations. We\nanalyse usage data from a large Australian CS1 course, where 959 students\nengaged in 11,222 DCC Sidekick sessions, resulting in 17,982 error explanations\nover seven weeks. Notably, over 50% of interactions occurred outside business\nhours, underscoring the tool's value as an always-available resource. Our\nfindings reveal strong adoption of AI-assisted debugging tools, demonstrating\ntheir scalability in supporting extensive CS1 courses. We provide\nimplementation insights and recommendations for educators seeking to\nincorporate AI tools with appropriate pedagogical safeguards.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
