Our approach\ngathers and extends fully- and semi-device independent methods for this\npurpose. We study the effect of different models of dephasing noise, some of\nwhich are shown to generate nonlocality and entanglement in special cases. In\nthe extreme case of complete dephasing, the measurement protocols discussed\nyield particularly simple tests to certify nonlocality. These are based on the\nrelations between bipartite quantum channels and their classical analogs:\nbipartite stochastic matrices defining conditional distributions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
