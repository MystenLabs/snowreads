In this direction, recently $f(\\phi, T)$\ngravity has been proposed in literature where the non-minimal coupling of the\nscalar field $\\phi$ with the trace of energy-momentum tensor $T$ has been\nintroduced in the Einstein-Hilbert action. Considering the Hilltop potential,\nwe have studied the slow-roll inflation in the framework of $f(\\phi, T)$\ngravity. It is found that Hilltop inflationary models in $f(\\phi, T)$ gravity\nare viable when seen in the light of latest Planck data.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ceXuR2xxEAGKiqpTSoDlmNsop0fHBGCLwPKnCko-SoI","pdfSize":"533822","txDigest":"2M9cosBUEYeTYAsUCf4YCY5PeRkAdAoaFFLvtf5MEdGj","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
