In this\nletter, we focus on a TR scheme facilitated by a reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS) which, due to the higher frequency and large array aperture,\noperates in the near-field region. The proposed scheme enriches the propagation\nenvironment for the TR in such weak scattering conditions and does not need\nchannel knowledge for the RIS configuration. Specifically, the RIS is employed\nto create multiple virtual propagation paths that are required to efficiently\napply the TR. We derive a performance bound for the proposed scheme under\nnear-field modeling through the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and we\nexamine how various system design parameters affect the performance. We observe\nthat a linear RIS topology maximizes the number of resolvable paths. It is also\ndemonstrated that the proposed scheme improves the SNR, while for a large\nnumber of elements it can outperform the conventional passive beamforming at\nthe RIS.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WvJvEQ_mz_HdCJI_kPq4s8IleF-Pa4fw0qLsnrZc5qA","pdfSize":"2456720"}
