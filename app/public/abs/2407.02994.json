Moreover, the recent rising of Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLM) leads to a need for multimodal medical datasets, where\nclinical reports and findings are attached to the corresponding CT or MR scans.\nThis paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the data set MedPix\n2.0. Starting from the well-known multimodal dataset\nMedPix\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}, mainly used by physicians, nurses and\nhealthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic\npipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual\ncuring procedure where noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB\ndatabase. Along with the dataset, we developed a GUI aimed at navigating\nefficiently the MongoDB instance, and obtaining the raw data that can be easily\nused for training and/or fine-tuning MLLMs. To enforce this point, we also\npropose a CLIP-based model trained on MedPix 2.0 for scan classification tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
