In contrast to a single-chain, a\ncommensurate supersolid emerges, and based on the Luttinger parameter, we\nclassify them into two types. The latter leads to a reentrant gapless behavior\nas the onsite interaction is increased while keeping all other parameters\nintact. A reentrant gapped transition is also found as a function of\nnearest-neighbor interactions. Further, we show that the string order\ncharacterizing the Haldane phase vanishes for a finite inter-chain hopping\namplitude, however small it is. Finally, we propose two experimental platforms\nto observe our findings, using either dipolar atoms or polar molecules and\nRydberg admixed atoms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
