The new proposed method is based on the following ingredients:\nidentical single photons, Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks, single-photon\ndetectors and post-selection. In particular, by using dual-rail path encoding\ntogether with auxiliary paths and single photons, we improve the success\nprobabilities of such gates. This result further proves the complexity and\nrichness of Reck and Clements schemes beyond the usual notions and practices of\nBoson Sampling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
