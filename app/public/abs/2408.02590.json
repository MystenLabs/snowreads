A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit\nthermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in\nthe behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in\nrandom and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase\nin the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic\nsystems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency\ntowards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the\nexistence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase\ntransition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our\nunderstanding of many-body dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oH7y634ierhxvPGwnM683G0XA_8O8_yYrpp-lkJDwhU","pdfSize":"1365790"}
