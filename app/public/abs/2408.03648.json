Despite numerous\nproposals on automated depression detection using recorded clinical interview\nvideos, limited attention has been paid to considering the hierarchical\nstructure of the interview questions. In clinical interviews for diagnosing\ndepression, clinicians use a structured questionnaire that includes routine\nbaseline questions and follow-up questions to assess the interviewee's\ncondition. This paper introduces HiQuE (Hierarchical Question Embedding\nnetwork), a novel depression detection framework that leverages the\nhierarchical relationship between primary and follow-up questions in clinical\ninterviews. HiQuE can effectively capture the importance of each question in\ndiagnosing depression by learning mutual information across multiple\nmodalities. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used clinical\ninterview data, DAIC-WOZ, where our model outperforms other state-of-the-art\nmultimodal depression detection models and emotion recognition models,\nshowcasing its clinical utility in depression detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QbtwBaCnq1pc96L3sWTcBRe4_rk5ntrKYTARtcMor-c","pdfSize":"2920339"}
