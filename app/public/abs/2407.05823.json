In the spirit of Costabel and Stephan, we use the transmission\nconditions to reduce the number of unknown densities and to formulate a system\nof coupled boundary integral equations describing the scattered and transmitted\nwaves. The system is transformed into the Laplace domain where it is proven to\nbe stable and uniquely solvable. The Laplace domain stability estimates are\nthen used to establish the stability and unique solvability of the original\ntime domain problem. Finally, we show how the bounds obtained in both Laplace\nand time domains can be used to derive error estimates for semi discrete\nGalerkin discretizations in space and for fully discrete numerical schemes that\nuse Convolution Quadrature for time discretization and a conforming Galerkin\nmethod for discretization of the space variables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
