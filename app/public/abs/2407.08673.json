In many theoretical frameworks these\nparticles can explain observed physical phenomena which are in tension with the\ncurrent model. \\textsc{ALPiNIST} is a simplified Monte Carlo framework aimed at\nevaluating past, present, and future, short and long baseline experiments for\ntheir sensitivities to different models of Axion-Like Particles. We present the\nextension of this framework to accommodate new classes of Feebly Interacting\nParticles with emphasis on Heavy Neutral Leptons. This extension is especially\nwell motivated, solving multiple of the standing issues with the Standard Model\nat the same time. The fundamental importance of inputs on the resulting\nparameter sensitivity, and thus the need for a unified simulation set-up, is\nhighlighted.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
