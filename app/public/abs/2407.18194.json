This finding of an entirely new class of astronomical object\nrevolutionized pulsar astronomy and provided inspiration for novel scientific\ninvestigation for decades to come, continuing to the current day and beyond.\nHere we review the events leading to the discovery, based on archival material,\npersonal correspondence, and first-hand accounts of several of the\nparticipants. We also briefly review the enormous impact that MSPs have had on\nphysics and astronomy by highlighting major MSP-related science of the past 40\nyears.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
