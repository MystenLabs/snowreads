Such\nspacetimes arise via holographic braneworlds and are exact solutions to an\ninduced higher-derivative theory of gravity consistently coupled to a large$-c$\nquantum field theory with an ultraviolet cutoff, accounting for all orders of\nsemi-classical backreaction. Notably, such quantum-corrected black holes are\nmuch larger than the Planck length. We describe the geometry and horizon\nthermodynamics of a host of asymptotically (anti-) de Sitter and flat quantum\nblack holes. A summary of higher-dimensional extensions is given. We survey\nmultiple applications of quantum black holes and braneworld holography.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
