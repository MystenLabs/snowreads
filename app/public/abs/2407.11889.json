In our maps, we mostly focus on\ndatasets of synthetic elections, but we also show an example of a map over\nreal-life ones. To measure similarities, we would have preferred to use, e.g.,\nthe isomorphic swap distance, but this is infeasible due to its high\ncomputational complexity. Hence, we propose polynomial-time computable\npositionwise distance and use it instead. Regarding the representations in 2D\nEuclidean space, we mostly use the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, but we also show two\nalternatives.\n  We develop the necessary theoretical results to form our maps and argue\nexperimentally that they are accurate and credible. Further, we show how\ncoloring the elections in a map according to various criteria helps in\nanalyzing results of a number of experiments. In particular, we show colorings\naccording to the scores of winning candidates or committees, running times of\nILP-based winner determination algorithms, and approximation ratios achieved by\nparticular algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
