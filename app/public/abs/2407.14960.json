Alongside this, similarities in disease\nprogression across patients can be utilized to improve prediction models in\nsurvival analysis. The need for patient privacy and the utility of prediction\nmodels can be simultaneously addressed in the framework of Federated Learning\n(FL). This paper outlines an approach in the domain of federated survival\nanalysis, specifically the Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model, with a\nspecific focus on mitigating data heterogeneity and elevating model\nperformance. We present an FL approach that employs feature-based clustering to\nenhance model accuracy across synthetic datasets and real-world applications,\nincluding the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.\nFurthermore, we consider an event-based reporting strategy that provides a\ndynamic approach to model adaptation by responding to local data changes. Our\nexperiments show the efficacy of our approach and discuss future directions for\na practical application of FL in healthcare.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
