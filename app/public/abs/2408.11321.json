Based on our current understanding of the\ntemperature and pressure conditions for complete miscibility of silicate and\nhydrogen, we find that the silicate-hydrogen binary solvus will dictate the\nnature of atmospheres and internal layering in rocky planets that garnered\nH$_2$-rich primary atmospheres. The temperatures at the surfaces of\nsupercritical magma oceans will correspond to the silicate-hydrogen solvus. As\na result, the radial positions of supercritical magma ocean-atmosphere\ninterfaces, rather than their temperatures and pressures, should reflect the\nthermal states of these planets. The conditions prescribed by the solvus\ninfluence the structure of the atmosphere, and thus the transit radii of\nsub-Neptunes. Separation of iron-rich metal to form metal cores in sub-Neptunes\nand super-Earths is not assured due to prospects for neutral buoyancy of metal\nin silicate melt induced by dissolution of H, Si, and O in the metal at high\ntemperatures.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
