Our result considers the three\nabove-mentioned leapers and replicates for each of them the recent discovery of\nEuclidean knight's tours for the same set of $2 \\times 2 \\times \\cdots \\times\n2$ grids, opening a new research path on the topic by studying different fairy\nchess leapers that perform jumps of fixed Euclidean length on given regular\ngrids, visiting all their vertices exactly once before coming back to the\nstarting one.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
