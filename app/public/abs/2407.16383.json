By systematically comparing the droplet\nproperties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional\ndescription, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling,\nas a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size\nof the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets can\nbecome substantially extended when their binding energies become small upon\ntransitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. To\nexplore fundamental dynamical properties in the cross-over region, we study\ninteraction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing\nmotion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to\ncontinuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that\nit is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic\ngeometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic\nparameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental\nrealizations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
