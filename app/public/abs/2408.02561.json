The\npredicted boxes with high classification scores but poor localization positions\nor low classification scores but accurate localization positions will worsen\nthe performance of detectors after Non-Maximum Suppression. Furthermore, when\nobject detectors collaborate with Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), we observe\nthat the task inharmony problem will be further exacerbated, which is\nconsidered one of the main causes of the performance degradation of quantized\ndetectors. To tackle this issue, we propose the Harmonious Quantization for\nObject Detection (HQOD) framework, which consists of two components. Firstly,\nwe propose a task-correlated loss to encourage detectors to focus on improving\nsamples with lower task harmony quality during QAT. Secondly, a harmonious\nIntersection over Union (IoU) loss is incorporated to balance the optimization\nof the regression branch across different IoU levels. The proposed HQOD can be\neasily integrated into different QAT algorithms and detectors. Remarkably, on\nthe MS COCO dataset, our 4-bit ATSS with ResNet-50 backbone achieves a\nstate-of-the-art mAP of 39.6%, even surpassing the full-precision one.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
