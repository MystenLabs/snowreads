PyamilySeq is\ndistinctive in its ability to integrate new sequences into existing clusters,\nproviding a robust framework for iterative analysis while preserving the\noriginal clusters, useful when reannotating genomes. In addition to the\nstandard Species mode which as with other tools performs core-gene analysis\nacross a species range, PyamilySeq can be run in Genus mode where it detects\nthe presence of gene families shared across multiple genera. These features\nenhance the tools applicability for ongoing and past genomic studies and\ncomparative analyses. PyamilySeq generates comprehensive outputs, including\ngene presence-absence matrices and aligned sequence data, enabling downstream\nanalysis and interpretation of the identified gene groups and pangenomic data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
