It also helps reduce the cost and risk\nassociated with collecting real-world IR data. This survey paper aims to\nprovide a comprehensive overview of the conventional mathematical\nmodelling-based methods and deep learning-based methods used for generating\nsynthetic IR scenes and targets. The paper discusses the importance of\nsynthetic IR scene and target generation and briefly covers the mathematics of\nblackbody and grey body radiations, as well as IR image-capturing methods. The\npotential use cases of synthetic IR scenes and target generation are also\ndescribed, highlighting the significance of these techniques in various fields.\nAdditionally, the paper explores possible new ways of developing new techniques\nto enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of synthetic IR scenes and target\ngeneration while highlighting the need for further research to advance this\nfield.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
