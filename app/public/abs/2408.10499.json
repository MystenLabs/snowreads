Drawing from prior work on DIY assistive technology, this\npaper investigates end-user programming as a means for users to create and\ncustomize visual access programs to meet their unique needs. We introduce\nProgramAlly, a system for creating custom filters for visual information, e.g.,\n'find NUMBER on BUS', leveraging three end-user programming approaches: block\nprogramming, natural language, and programming by example. To implement\nProgramAlly, we designed a representation of visual filtering tasks based on\nscenarios encountered by blind people, and integrated a set of on-device and\ncloud models for generating and running these programs. In user studies with 12\nblind adults, we found that participants preferred different programming\nmodalities depending on the task, and envisioned using visual access programs\nto address unique accessibility challenges that are otherwise difficult with\nexisting applications. Through ProgramAlly, we present an exploration of how\nblind end-users can create visual access programs to customize and control\ntheir experiences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
