This study introduces a novel approach to visual sentiment\nanalysis by integrating attitudinal differences into visual sentiment\nclassification. Recognizing that societal divides, such as partisan\ndifferences, heavily influence sentiment labeling, we developed a dataset that\nreflects these divides. We then trained a deep learning multi-task multi-class\nmodel to predict visual sentiment from different ideological viewpoints.\nApplied to immigration-related images, our approach captures perspectives from\nboth Democrats and Republicans. By incorporating diverse perspectives into the\nlabeling and model training process, our strategy addresses the limitation of\nlabel ambiguity and demonstrates improved accuracy in visual sentiment\npredictions. Overall, our study advocates for a paradigm shift in decoding\nvisual sentiment toward creating classifiers that more accurately reflect the\nsentiments generated by humans.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
