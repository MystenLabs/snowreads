The\nrealization of an all-silicon QKD transmitter supplied by a light source that\nis native to silicon integration platforms is seen as a disruptive step towards\nthe pervasive introduction of QKD in new applications, which up to now have not\nbeen explored due to the missing credentials of quantum optics as a\ncost-effective and highly miniaturized technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
