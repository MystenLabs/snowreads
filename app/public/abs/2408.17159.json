Ru-Al\nalloys are a prominent class of high-temperature structural materials, but the\nexperimentally reported crystal structure of the intermetallic Ru2Al5 phase\nremains elusive and debatable. To resolve this controversy, we extensively\nexplored the crystal structures of Ru2Al5 using first-principles calculations\ncombined with crystal structure prediction technique. Among the calculated\nX-ray diffraction patterns and lattice parameters of five candidate Ru2Al5\nstructures, those of the orthorhombic Pmmn structure best aligned with recent\nexperimental results. The structural stabilities of the five Ru2Al5 structures\nwere confirmed through formation energy, elastic constants, and phonon spectrum\ncalculations. We also comprehensively analyzed the mechanical and electronic\nproperties of the five candidates. This work can guide the exploration of novel\nordered intermetallic compounds in Ru-Al alloys.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oQMWGvQuVyrXSnonNTP9OUWIolvGMzgSu5JLTIcrD-4","pdfSize":"1283048"}
