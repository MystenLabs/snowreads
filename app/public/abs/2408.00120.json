This method, referred to as model-consistent\ntraining, ensures that input features are derived directly from physics-based\nmodels, such as Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, to\naccurately represent the current state of the flow. Autoencoders have been\nselected for this task due to their capability to capture essential information\nfrom large datasets, making them particularly suitable for handling\nhigh-dimensional data with numerous discretization points in both spatial and\ntemporal dimensions. This innovative approach integrates the ensemble Kalman\nmethod to enhance the training process, providing a robust framework for\nimproving model accuracy and performance in turbulent flow predictions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
