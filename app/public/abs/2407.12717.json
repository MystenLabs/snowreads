The unsmearing corrections are known to leading order in the large\nvolume, weak coupling limit. However, first-order perturbative approximations\nof non-linear problems can often produce spurious solutions, which are only\nweeded out by additional consistency conditions imposed at higher orders. In\nthis work, we revisit the unsmearing procedure and present consistency\nconditions obtained from the second order warp factor and dilaton equations.\nThis requires proper treatment of the near-source singularities. The resulting\nconditions appear as integral constraints on various non-linear combinations of\nthe first order corrections, which we argue can generally be satisfied by\nappropriate choice of integration constants of the leading-order solutions.\nThis provides a non-trivial consistency check for the perturbative unsmearing\nprocedure and supports the existence of scale-separated AdS vacua in string\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
