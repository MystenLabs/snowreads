It builds on the\nstandard Dynamical Low Rank Approximations in their Dynamically Orthogonal\nformulation. It allows to seamlessly build-in many standard and well-studied\nstabilisation techniques that can be framed as either generalised Galerkin\nmethods, or Petrov-Galerkin methods. The framework is subsequently applied to\nthe case of Streamine Upwind/Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) stabilisation of\nadvection-dominated problems with small stochastic perturbations of the\ntransport field. The norm-stability properties of two time discretisations are\nanalysed. Numerical experiments confirm that the stabilising properties of the\nSUPG method naturally carry over to the DLR framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
