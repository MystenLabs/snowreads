Using this, we combine ideas of\nCasson-Long with the theory of train tracks to give an algorithm using bordered\nFloer homology to detect whether a mapping class extends over any compression\nbody.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
