The proposed\nestimator of the asymptotic Mean Square Error (MSE) of PC factors is based on\nadaptive thresholding the sample covariances of the id iosyncratic residuals\nwith the threshold based on their individual variances. We compare the nite\nsample performance of condence regions for the PC factors obtained using the\nproposed asymptotic MSE with those of available extant asymptotic and bootstrap\nregions and show that the former beats all alternative procedures for a wide\nvariety of idiosyncratic cross-correlation structures.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
