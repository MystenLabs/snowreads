These\nGenAI models range from text generation - such as two-way chat systems - to the\ngeneration of image or video from textual descriptions input by a user. These\nadvancements in AI have impacted Dentistry in multiple aspects. In dental\neducation, the student now has the opportunity to solve a plethora of questions\nby only prompting a GenAI model and have the answer in a matter of seconds.\nGenAI models can help us deliver better patient healthcare by helping\npractitioners gather knowledge quickly and efficiently. Finally, GenAI can also\nbe used in dental research, where the applications range from new drug\ndiscovery to assistance in academic writing. In this review, we first define\nGenAI models and describe their multiple generation modalities; then, we\nexplain and discuss their current and potential applications in Dentistry; and\nfinally, we describe the challenges these new technologies impose in our area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Fttp7B_JijIo446wWihb4MrEGaOQIANAmKQ_zec6rv4","pdfSize":"2880311"}
