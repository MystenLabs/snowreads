Yet, it constitutes a challenging problem due to the combined\neffect of Coulombic interactions, hydrodynamics, and thermal fluctuations.\nHere, we study the frequency-dependent conductivity of ionic solutions using a\nstochastic density functional theory. In the limit of small concentrations, we\nrecover the classical Debye and Falkenhagen (DF) result, predicting an increase\nin conductivity with field frequency. At higher concentrations, we use a\nmodified Coulomb interaction potential that accounts for the hard-core\nrepulsion between the ions, which was recently employed in the zero-frequency\ncase. Consequently, we extend the DF result to concentrated electrolytes. We\ndiscuss experimental and numerical studies and the complexity of observing the\nDF effect in such setups.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
