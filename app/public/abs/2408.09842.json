Given this, can we measure the impact of a database in the\nsame way that we measure an author's or journal's impact? To do this, we need\nsomehow to represent a database as a set of publications, and databases\ntypically allow a large number of possible decompositions into parts, any of\nwhich could be treated as a publication.\n  We show that the definition of the h-index naturally extends to hierarchies,\nso that if a database admits some kind of hierarchical interpretation we can\nuse this as one measure of the importance of a database; moreover, this can be\ncomputed as efficiently as one can compute the normal h-index. This also gives\nus a decomposition of the database that might be used for other purposes such\nas giving credit to the curators or contributors to the database. We illustrate\nthe process by analyzing three widely used databases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
