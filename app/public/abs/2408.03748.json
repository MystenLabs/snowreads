Nevertheless,the efficacy of thermal vision algorithms driven by\ndeep learning models remains constrained by the paucity of available training\ndata samples. To this end,this paper introduces a novel approach termed the\nedge guided conditional diffusion model. This framework aims to produce\nmeticulously aligned pseudo thermal images at the pixel level,leveraging edge\ninformation extracted from visible images. By utilizing edges as contextual\ncues from the visible domain,the diffusion model achieves meticulous control\nover the delineation of objects within the generated images. To alleviate the\nimpacts of those visible-specific edge information that should not appear in\nthe thermal domain,a two-stage modality adversarial training strategy is\nproposed to filter them out from the generated images by differentiating the\nvisible and thermal modality. Extensive experiments on LLVIP demonstrate ECDM s\nsuperiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of image\ngeneration quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
