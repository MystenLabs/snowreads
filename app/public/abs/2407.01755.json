A major difficulty comes from the\ndemand of perceiving and handling liquid with different properties. This paper\npresents a robot system that mixes batter and makes pancakes out of it, where\nunderstanding and handling the viscous liquid is an essential component. The\nsystem integrates Haptic Sensing and control algorithms to autonomously stir\nflour and water to achieve the desired batter uniformity, estimate the batter's\nproperties such as the water-flour ratio and liquid level, as well as perform\nprecise manipulations to pour the batter into any specified shape. Experimental\nresults show the system's capability to always produce batter of desired\nuniformity, estimate water-flour ratio and liquid level precisely, and\naccurately pour it into complex shapes. This research showcases the potential\nfor robots to assist in kitchens and step towards commercial culinary\nautomation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
