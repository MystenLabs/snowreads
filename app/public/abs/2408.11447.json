First, traditional methods for\nself-supervised 3D occupancy estimation still require ground truth 6D poses\nfrom sensors during training. To address this limitation, we propose Gaussian\nSplatting for Projection (GSP) module to provide accurate scale information for\nfully self-supervised training from adjacent view projection. Additionally,\nexisting methods rely on volume rendering for final 3D voxel representation\nlearning using 2D signals (depth maps, semantic maps), which is both\ntime-consuming and less effective. We propose Gaussian Splatting from Voxel\nspace (GSV) to leverage the fast rendering properties of Gaussian splatting. As\na result, the proposed GaussianOcc method enables fully self-supervised (no\nground truth pose) 3D occupancy estimation in competitive performance with low\ncomputational cost (2.7 times faster in training and 5 times faster in\nrendering).
