A significant challenge\nwith slate recommendation is managing the complex combinatorial choice space.\nTraditional methods often simplify this problem by assuming users engage with\nonly one item at a time. However, this simplification does not reflect the\nreality, as users often interact with multiple items simultaneously. In this\npaper, we address the general slate recommendation problem, which accounts for\nsimultaneous engagement with multiple items. We propose a generative approach\nusing Diffusion Models, leveraging their ability to learn structures in\nhigh-dimensional data. Our model generates high-quality slates that maximize\nuser satisfaction by overcoming the challenges of the combinatorial choice\nspace. Furthermore, our approach enhances the diversity of recommendations.\nExtensive offline evaluations on applications such as music playlist generation\nand e-commerce bundle recommendations show that our model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both relevance and diversity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
