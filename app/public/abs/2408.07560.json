Here we ground analyses\nof variant-specific effects on a formal framework for causal inference. This\nallows us to clarify the interpretation of existing methods and define new\nestimands. Unlike most of the existing literature, we explicitly consider the\n(realistic) setting with interference in the target population: even if\nindividuals can be sensibly perceived as iid in randomized trial data, there\nwill often be interference in the target population where treatments, like\nvaccines, are rolled out. Thus, one of our contributions is to derive explicit\nconditions guaranteeing that commonly reported vaccine efficacy parameters\nquantify well-defined causal effects, also in the presence of interference.\nFurthermore, our results give alternative justifications for reporting\nestimands on the relative, rather than absolute, scale. We illustrate the\nfindings with an analysis of a large HIV1 vaccine trial, where there is\ninterest in distinguishing vaccine effects on viruses with different genome\nsequences.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oT12BOsbT2xuO7mVSXZMkE2_Lv2lmw52YnhLISClXuo","pdfSize":"714238"}
