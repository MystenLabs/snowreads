We address this problem in a data-based\nsetting when we cannot avail ourselves of the dynamics of the actual system,\nbut only of data generated by it under unknown bounded noise. For all dynamics\nconsistent with data, we derive sum-of-squares programs to design an\ninput-to-state stabilizing controller, an input-to-state Lyapunov function and\nthe corresponding comparison functions. This numerical design for\ninput-to-state stabilization seems to be relevant not only in the considered\ndata-based setting, but also in a model-based setting. Illustration of\nfeasibility of the provided sum-of-squares programs is provided on a numerical\nexample.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
