Based on the obtained\nrelations, we derive a formula for estimating the speed $U^*$ of a virtual\nparticle in indirect measurements. We applied the theory of indirect\nmeasurements and the derived formula to estimate the module of the group\nvelocity of virtual photons from the DIS HERA data. The HERA data indicate that\nthe speed of virtual photons exceeds the speed of light $c$ in free space,\n$U^*>c$. The properties of virtual photons and a hypothetical tachyon particle\nare almost identical. It is found that in the realm of particle interaction,\nthe new angular parameters are closely related to the type of the phase-space\ngeometry and dimensionality of the space-time continuum. It is suggested that\nthe problem of the normalization condition $U^* =c$ at $Q^2=0\\, \\rm{GeV}^2$ can\nbe solved naturally within the framework of ``Two-Time Physics'' developed by\nI.
