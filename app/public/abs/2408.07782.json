From recent results on proton number fluctuations in Au + Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$~GeV obtained by the HADES experiment at GSI,\nwe suggest that measuring the multiplicity distributions heavy-ion collisions\ncan be used to probe density fluctuations associated with correlation\nphenomena. By using the combinant analysis, one can obtain new information\ncontained in them and otherwise unavailable, which may broaden our knowledge of\nthe particle interactions mechanism.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
