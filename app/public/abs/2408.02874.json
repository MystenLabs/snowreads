We develop a theory of quantum supersymmetric pairs associated\nto the super Satake diagrams. We establish the quantum Iwasawa decomposition\nand construct quasi $K$-matrix associated with the quantum supersymmetric\npairs. We also formulate a Schur duality between an $\\imath$quantum supergroup\n(which is a new $q$-deformation of an ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebra) and\nthe $q$-Brauer algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
