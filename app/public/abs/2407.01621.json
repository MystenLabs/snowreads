However, causal studies on\nnon-intervention systems attract much attention but remain extremely\nchallenging. To address this challenge, we propose a framework named\nInterventional Dynamical Causality (IntDC) for such non-intervention systems,\nalong with its computational criterion, Interventional Embedding Entropy (IEE),\nto quantify causality. The IEE criterion theoretically and numerically enables\nthe deciphering of IntDC solely from observational (non-interventional)\ntime-series data, without requiring any knowledge of dynamical models or real\ninterventions in the considered system. Demonstrations of performance showed\nthe accuracy and robustness of IEE on benchmark simulated systems as well as\nreal-world systems, including the neural connectomes of C. elegans, COVID-19\ntransmission networks in Japan, and regulatory networks surrounding key\ncircadian genes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"thBPyWV3aKZYoZlyGFPsR3KKnR2xclANYnlsthlS6f4","pdfSize":"7809480"}
