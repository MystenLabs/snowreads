Using this representation-theoretic\nframework, we show that the local Euler factors appearing in the construction\nof the motivic Rankin-Selberg Euler system for a product of modular forms are\nintegrally optimal; i.e. any construction of this type with any choice of\nintegral input data would give local factors appearing in tame norm relations\nat $p$ which are integrally divisible by the Euler factor\n$\\mathcal{P}_p^{'}(\\mathrm{Frob}_p^{-1})$ modulo $p-1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
