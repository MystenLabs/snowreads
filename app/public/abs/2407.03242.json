The\ncurvature is identified to the value of the cosmological constant, either\npositive or negative. The physical Hilbert space is given by the\n$\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{su}(2))$ intertwiner space. We show that the quantum\ntrace of quantum monodromies, defining the quantum length operators, form a\nfusion algebra and describe their representation theory. We also construct the\ncoherent states in the physical Hilbert space labeled by the length and twist\ncoordinates. These coherent states describe quantum curved tetrahedra and peak\nat points of the tetrahedron phase space. This works is closely related to 3+1\ndimensional Loop Quantum Gravity with a non-vanishing cosmological constant.\nThe coherent states constructed herein serve as good candidates for the\napplication to the spinfoam model with a cosmological constant.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
