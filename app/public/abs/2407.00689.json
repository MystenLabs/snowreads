After decades of laboratory\ndevelopment, several types of quantum sensors are now commercially available or\nare part-way through the commercialization process. This article provides a\nbrief description of the operation of a selection of quantum sensors that\nemploy the principles of atom-light interactions and discusses progress toward\npackaging those sensors into products. This article covers quantum inertial and\ngravitational sensors, including gyroscopes, accelerometers, gravimeters, and\ngravity gradiometers that employ atom interferometry, nuclear magnetic\nresonance gyroscopes, atomic and spin-defect magnetometers, and Rydberg\nelectric field sensors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JC7ncQ9Q1LINZPER_p3ChIeWqh07M1mHR62o5mQWv9M","pdfSize":"1169287","objectId":"0xdd91511f828fa9e51aeea4f8bbfc4c2e863a0b800d68e3eedb36ceeca5954abc","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
