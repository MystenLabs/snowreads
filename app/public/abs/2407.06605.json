However, despite their suitability, physical\nmodels have some shortcomings. On the one hand, simple models suffer from\nlarger model errors and more restrictive assumptions. On the other hand,\ncomplex models are computationally more demanding and depend on environmental\nand operational parameters. In each case, the drawbacks can be associated to a\ncertain degree to the physical modeling of the yaw rate dynamics. Therefore,\nthis paper investigates the yaw rate prediction based on conditional neural\nprocesses (CNP), a data-driven meta-learning approach, to simultaneously\nachieve low errors, adequate complexity and robustness to varying parameters.\nThus, physical models can be enhanced in a targeted manner to provide accurate\nand computationally efficient predictions to enable safe planning in autonomous\nvehicles. High fidelity simulations for a variety of driving scenarios and\ndifferent types of cars show that CNP makes it possible to employ and transfer\nknowledge about the yaw rate based on current driving dynamics in a human-like\nmanner, yielding robustness against changing environmental and operational\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
