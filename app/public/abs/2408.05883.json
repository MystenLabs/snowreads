Despite its ubiquity, the mechanics\nof low-rank approximation and its application in adaptation can sometimes be\nobscure, leaving practitioners and researchers with questions about its true\ncapabilities and limitations. This paper seeks to clarify low-rank\napproximation and adaptation by offering a comprehensive guide that reveals\ntheir inner workings and explains their utility in a clear and accessible way.\nOur focus here is to develop a solid intuition for how low-rank approximation\nand adaptation operate, and why they are so effective. We begin with basic\nconcepts and gradually build up to the mathematical underpinnings, ensuring\nthat readers of all backgrounds can gain a deeper understanding of low-rank\napproximation and adaptation. We strive to strike a balance between informal\nexplanations and rigorous mathematics, ensuring that both newcomers and\nexperienced experts can benefit from this survey. Additionally, we introduce\nnew low-rank decomposition and adaptation algorithms that have not yet been\nexplored in the field, hoping that future researchers will investigate their\npotential applicability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
