They do this by accounting for the\nmotion of the robot itself, the motion of dynamic objects, and the geometry of\nstatic objects in the scene, and they generate a range of possible future\nstates of the environment. These prediction algorithms are software-optimized\nfor real-time performance for navigation in crowded dynamic scenes, achieving\n10 times faster inference speed and 3 times less memory usage than the original\nengines. Three simulated and real-world datasets collected by different robot\nmodels are used to demonstrate that these proposed prediction algorithms are\nable to achieve more accurate and robust stochastic prediction performance than\nother algorithms. Furthermore, a series of simulation and hardware navigation\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed predictive uncertainty-aware\nnavigation framework with these stochastic prediction engines is able to\nimprove the safe navigation performance of current state-of-the-art model- and\nlearning-based control policies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
