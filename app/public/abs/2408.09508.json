Our focus lies in studying the phase transition\nof the system from an isotropic phase to a nematic phase as we increase either\nthe rod length or the rod concentration. Our simulations confirm the presence\nof long-range ordering in the ordered phase. Furthermore, we identify a phase\ncharacterized by a periodic ordering profile that disrupts translation\nsymmetry. We also provide a detailed analysis of the translational and\nrotational diffusive dynamics of the rods. Interestingly, the translational\ndiffusivity of the rods is found to increase with the rod concentration.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vuak-whgEZlsiQ8ZVo8mcCfDKFbIccMlVVC_F1AUY6c","pdfSize":"19916672"}
