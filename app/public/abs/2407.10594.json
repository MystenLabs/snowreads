In the background of these stochastic models, we introduce stochastic\nVlasov equations which gives additional information on the fluctuations and\noscillations of solutions: we prove convergence to non-trivial Young measures\nsatisfying limit PDEs with suitable diffusion terms. In the case of a passive\nvector field the background Vlasov equation adds completely new statistical\ninformation to the stochastic advection equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XtLvzWIWq0DVKbc87HUxTggQGwyYcH54yEzAKTSXtm0","pdfSize":"504903"}
