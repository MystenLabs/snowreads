Compared to previous challenges, the ASVspoof 5 database is built\nfrom crowdsourced data collected from a vastly greater number of speakers in\ndiverse acoustic conditions. Attacks, also crowdsourced, are generated and\ntested using surrogate detection models, while adversarial attacks are\nincorporated for the first time. New metrics support the evaluation of\nspoofing-robust automatic speaker verification (SASV) as well as stand-alone\ndetection solutions, i.e., countermeasures without ASV. We describe the two\nchallenge tracks, the new database, the evaluation metrics, baselines, and the\nevaluation platform, and present a summary of the results. Attacks\nsignificantly compromise the baseline systems, while submissions bring\nsubstantial improvements.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
