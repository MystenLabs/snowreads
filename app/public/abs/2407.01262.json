It has attracted increasing attentions and has been\nwidely used as a basic service in navigation systems and intelligent\ntransportation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the ETA\nestimation problem, which is an ensemble on tree models and neural networks. We\nproved the accuracy and robustness of the solution on the A/B list and finally\nwon first place in the SIGSPATIAL 2021 GISCUP competition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
