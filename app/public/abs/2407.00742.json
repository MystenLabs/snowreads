While recent years have seen considerable\nadvancements in this field, much of the focus has been on single polygons,\noverlooking the intricate inner- and inter-polygonal relationships inherent in\nmultipolygons. To address this gap, our study introduces a comprehensive\nframework specifically designed for learning representations of polygonal\ngeometries, particularly multipolygons. Central to our approach is the\nincorporation of a heterogeneous visibility graph, which seamlessly integrates\nboth inner- and inter-polygonal relationships. To enhance computational\nefficiency and minimize graph redundancy, we implement a heterogeneous spanning\ntree sampling method. Additionally, we devise a rotation-translation invariant\ngeometric representation, ensuring broader applicability across diverse\nscenarios. Finally, we introduce Multipolygon-GNN, a novel model tailored to\nleverage the spatial and semantic heterogeneity inherent in the visibility\ngraph. Experiments on five real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate its\nability to capture informative representations for polygonal geometries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
