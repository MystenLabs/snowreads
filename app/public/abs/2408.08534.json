A quantum walk is a quantum version of a random walk that demonstrates\na faster propagation than a random walk on a graph. We focus on the fact that\nthe effect of the depth-first search process is dominant when a quantum walk\nwith a superposition state is applied to graphs. Simply using a quantum walk\nwith its superposition state leads to insufficient performance since balancing\nthe depth-first and breadth-first search processes is essential in node\nclassification tasks. To overcome this disadvantage, we formulate novel coin\noperators that determine the movement of a quantum walker to its neighboring\nnodes. They enable QWalkVec to integrate the depth-first search and\nbreadth-first search processes by prioritizing node sampling. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of QWalkVec in node classification tasks conducted on four\nsmall-sized real datasets. As a result, we demonstrate that the performance of\nQWalkVec is superior to that of the existing methods on several datasets.
