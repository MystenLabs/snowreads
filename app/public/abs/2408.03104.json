The period functions are a generalization of those for the classical\nMaass cusp forms, being solutions of a finite-term functional equation or,\nequivalently, eigenfunctions with eigenvalue $1$ of a transfer operator deduced\nfrom the geodesic flow on the modular surface. We apply this result to deduce a\nnotion of period functions and related linear isomorphism for Jacobi Maass\nforms of weight $k+1/2$ for the semi-direct product of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with\nthe integer points $Hei(\\mathbb{Z})$ of the Heisenberg group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
