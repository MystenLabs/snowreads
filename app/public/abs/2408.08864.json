This seemingly\nsimple aerodynamic system displays an impressive variety of steady and unsteady\nmotions that are familiar from fluttering leaves, tumbling seeds and gliding\npaper planes. Here, we explore the space of flight behaviors using a nonlinear\ndynamical model rooted in a quasi-steady description of the fluid forces.\nEfficient characterization is achieved by identification of the key\ndimensionless parameters, assessment of the steady equilibrium states, and\nlinear analysis of their stability. The structure and organization of the\nstable and unstable flight equilibria proves to be complex, and seemingly\nrelated factors such as mass and buoyancy-corrected weight play distinct roles\nin determining the eventual flight patterns. The nonlinear model successfully\nreproduces previously documented unsteady states such as fluttering and\ntumbling while also predicting new types of motions, and the linear analysis\naccurately accounts for the stability of steady states such as gliding and\ndiving. While the conditions for dynamic stability seem to lack tidy formulas\nthat apply universally, we identify relations that hold in certain regimes and\nwhich offer mechanistic interpretations. The generality of the model and the\nrichness of its solution space suggest implications for small-scale\naerodynamics and related applications in biological and robotic flight.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
