Our result\nprovides the first\n  uniqueness statement for self-similar profiles of inelastic\n  Boltzmann models allowing for strong inelasticity besides the\n  explicitly solvable case of Maxwell interactions (corresponding to\n  $\\gamma=0$). Our approach relies on a perturbation argument from the\n  corresponding Maxwell model and a careful study of the\n  associated linearized operator recently derived in the companion paper\n\\cite{maxwel}. The results can be seen as a\n  first step towards a complete proof, in the one-dimensional setting, of\n  a conjecture in \\cite{ernst} regarding the determination of the\n  long-time behaviour of solutions to inelastic Boltzmann equation, at least,\nin a regime of moderately hard potentials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
