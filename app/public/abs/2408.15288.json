We have found that the\nFeshbach-Villars spin-$1/2$ equations can be formulated as spin-coupled\nFeshbach-Villars spin-$0$ equations, that results in a Hamiltonian eigenvalue\nproblem. We adopted an integral equation formalism. The potential operators are\nrepresented in a discrete Hilbert space basis and the relevant Green's operator\nhas been calculated by a matrix continued fraction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eYd2K4UsLQKS1VlLC4z5tPi-kzWQ9O-jaY9MGgnNynI","pdfSize":"92354"}
