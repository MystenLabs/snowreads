A main challenge of\nutilizing contour trees for large-scale scientific data is their computation at\nscale using high-performance computing. To address this challenge, recent work\nhas introduced distributed hierarchical contour trees for distributed\ncomputation and storage of contour trees. However, effective use of these\ndistributed structures in analysis and visualization requires subsequent\ncomputation of geometric properties and branch decomposition to support contour\nextraction and exploration. In this work, we introduce distributed algorithms\nfor augmentation, hypersweeps, and branch decomposition that enable parallel\ncomputation of geometric properties, and support the use of distributed contour\ntrees as query structures for scientific exploration. We evaluate the parallel\nperformance of these algorithms and apply them to identify and extract\nimportant contours for scientific visualization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
