Existing\nmethods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the\npre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these\nresults to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only\nby their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and\npost-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in\ntwo disjoint sets. This work employs a pair of \"least-favorable\" distributions\nto robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the\nproperties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable\ndistributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the\nleast-favorable distributions for common constructions. Simulation results are\nprovided demonstrating the performance of our robust change detection\nalgorithm.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
