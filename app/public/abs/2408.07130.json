Using Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and photometry, we\nexamine the stellar population local to the Crab in a cylinder with a projected\nradius of 100 pc and parallax range $0.427 < \\varpi < 0.619$ mas set by the\nuncertainties in the Crab's parallax. We also individually model the most\nluminous stars local to the Crab. The two most luminous stars are blue, roughly\nmain sequence stars with masses of $\\sim11 M_{\\odot}$. We estimate the stellar\npopulation's age distribution using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. The\nestimated age distribution of the 205 $M_{G} < 0$ stars modestly favor lower\nmass stars consistent with an AGB star or a lower mass binary merger as the\nprogenitor, but we cannot rule out higher masses. This may be driven by\ncontamination due to the $\\sim700$ pc length of the cylinder in distance.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
