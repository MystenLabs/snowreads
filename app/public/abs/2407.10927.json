In this paper, we propose\nthe concept of puzzle ideals whose varieties one-one correspond to the tilings\nof puzzles and present an algebraic framework to construct the puzzle ideals\nwhich works with the Knutson-Tao-Woodward puzzle and its $T$-equivariant and\n$K$-theoretic variants for Grassmannians. For puzzles for which one side is\nfree, we propose the side-free puzzle ideals whose varieties one-one correspond\nto the tilings of side-free puzzles, and the elimination ideals of the\nside-free puzzle ideals contain all the information of the structure constants\nfor Grassmannians with respect to the free side.\n  Besides the underlying algebraic importance of the introduction of these\npuzzle ideals is the computational feasibility to find all the tilings of the\npuzzles for Grassmannians by solving the defining polynomial systems,\ndemonstrated with illustrative puzzles via computation of Gr\\\"obner bases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
