By extending the state of the art\nauction mechanisms, we aim to develop an efficient approach for allocating\npollution abatement resources in a multi-pollutant setting with pollutants\naffecting each other's reduction costs. We modify the Combinatorial Multi-Round\nAscending Auction for the auction of escape permits of pollutants with\nco-dependent reduction processes, specifically, greenhouse gas emissions and\nnutrient runoff in Finnish agriculture. We show the significant advantages of\nthis mechanism in pollution control through experiments on the bid prices and\namount of escape permits sold in multiple auction simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fkOt4en88bkM6c_6iOqcUiuHknxvhDJYGwtZWlXpffU","pdfSize":"978734"}
