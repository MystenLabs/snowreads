This paper explores the intricate\nlandscape of LLM infrastructure, software, and data management. By analyzing\nthese core components, we emphasize the pivotal considerations and safeguards\ncrucial for successful LLM development. This work presents a concise synthesis\nof the challenges and strategies inherent in constructing a robust and\neffective LLM infrastructure, offering valuable insights for researchers and\npractitioners alike.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
