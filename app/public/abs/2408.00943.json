Using real-world tracking data collected\nover an extended period of time, we train trajectory forecasting models to\nlearn agent interactions and environmental constraints that are difficult to\ncapture conventionally. Trajectories of new agents are first coarsely generated\nby sampling from the spatial and temporal generative distributions, then\nrefined using state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting models. The simulation\ncan run either autonomously, or under explicit human control conditioned on the\ngenerative distributions. We present the experiments for a variety of model\nconfigurations. Under an iterative prediction scheme, the way-point-supervised\nTrajNet++ model obtained 0.36 Final Displacement Error (FDE) in 20 FPS on an\nNVIDIA A100 GPU.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a_Kblwy0amNuX0VGM2MVttgmaZrFi8Tq59VFr-b3Pw4","pdfSize":"14640083","txDigest":"95W1sDjZum5EYsTLThKLYc1B6PZbdL8g8e84qzTqENHe","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
