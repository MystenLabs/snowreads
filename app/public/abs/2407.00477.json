One motivating examples is the\nshape of a point cloud in Euclidean space given by image. Carlsson et al.\nproposed a method to detect topological features in point clouds by first\nfiltering by density and then applying persistent homology. Later more refined\nmethods have been developed, such as the degree Rips complex of Lesnick and\nWright and the multicover bifiltration. In this paper we introduce the dual\nDegree Cech bifiltration, a Prohorov stable bicomplex of a point cloud in a\nmetric space with the point cloud itself as vertex set. It is of the same\nhomotopy type as the Measure Dowker bifiltration of Hellmer and Spali\\'nski but\nit has a different vertex set.\n  The dual Degree Cech bifiltration can be constructed both in an ambient and\nan intrinsic way. The intrinsic dual Degree Cech bifiltration is a\n$(1,2)$-intereaved with the ambent dual Degree Cech bifiltration in the\ndistance parameter. This interleaving can be used to leverage a stability\nresult for the intrinsically defined dual Degree Cech bifiltration. This\nstability result recently occured in work by Hellmer and Spali\\'nski.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KyG5stzdyJs9v9XtPLOEyhrgAvoPfA62q6EB1KAR4lA","pdfSize":"219768"}
