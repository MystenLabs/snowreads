The only\nassumption is that each $\\mathcal{L}_a$ involves only a single jump operator\nwith an efficient implementation available for the evolution $e^{t\n\\mathcal{L}_a}$.\n  A notable application of the randomized method is for quantum Gibbs sampling,\nwhere the Lindblad dynamics is utilized to prepare a specific Gibbs state.\nUnlike existing deterministic methods that require numerous jump operators to\nensure ergodicity, our approach simplifies the implementation by using a single\nrandomly sampled jump operator. As an example, we demonstrate that our method\nensures fast thermalization of Hamiltonian systems characterized by random\nPauli strings, where the spectral density closely adheres to the semi-circle\nlaw.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
