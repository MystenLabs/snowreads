Taking the angular spectrum theory as prior knowledge, we\ngenerate a dataset consisting of a series of diffraction patterns that contain\ninformation about the objects. This dataset, combined with unlabeled data\nmeasured from experiments, are used for the self-training of a physics-informed\nneural network (NN). During the training process, the neural network\niteratively predicts the outcomes of the unlabeled data and reincorporates\nthese results back into the training set. This recursive strategy not only\nreduces noise but also minimizes mutual interference during object\nreconstruction, demonstrating its effectiveness even in data-scarce situations.\nThe method has been validated with both simulated and experimental data,\nshowcasing its significant potential to advance the field of terahertz\nthree-dimensional (3D) imaging. Additionally, it sets a new benchmark for\nrapid, reference-free, and cost-effective power detection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
