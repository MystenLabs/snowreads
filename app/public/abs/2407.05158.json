We use graphs coming from the five Platonic solids to illustrate\ndifferent tools and techniques for studying these games, including independent\nsets, treewidth, scramble number, and Dhar's burning algorithm. In addition to\nshowcasing some previously known results, we present the first proofs that the\ndodecahedron graph has gonality $6$, and that the icosahedron graph has\ngonality~$9$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
