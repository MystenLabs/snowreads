For arbitrary scalar masses $M \\mu$ and\nblack hole spins $a/M$, we numerically determine the quasinormal frequencies\nfor various orbital $\\ell$, azimuthal $m$, and overtone $n$ numbers. In\nparticular, we derive an analytic expression for frequencies of the\nzero-damping modes near the extremal limit $a/M \\rightarrow 1$. For $\\ell=m=1$,\nwe reveal that the fundamental mode becomes a damped mode (rather than a\nzero-damping mode) if the scalar field is sufficiently heavy. By exploring the\nparameter space, we find numerical evidence for level-crossing between the\nlongest-living mode and the first overtone at an exceptional point $(M\\mu)_c\n\\simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\\simeq 0.9994660$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
