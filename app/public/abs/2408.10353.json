However, traditional\nICA approaches struggle with the rotational invariance inherent in Gaussian\ndistributions, often necessitating the assumption of non-Gaussianity in the\nunderlying sources. This may limit their applicability in broader contexts. To\naccommodate Gaussian sources, we develop an identifiability theory that relies\non second-order statistics without imposing further preconditions on the\ndistribution of sources, by introducing novel assumptions on the connective\nstructure from sources to observed variables. Different from recent work that\nfocuses on potentially restrictive connective structures, our proposed\nassumption of structural variability is both considerably less restrictive and\nprovably necessary. Furthermore, we propose two estimation methods based on\nsecond-order statistics and sparsity constraint. Experimental results are\nprovided to validate our identifiability theory and estimation methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
