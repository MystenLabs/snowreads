However, too few solutions have been proposed for\nindoor/outdoor scene classification to ensure scene context adaptability for\ncomputer vision frameworks. We propose the first Lightweight Hybrid Graph\nConvolutional Neural Network (LH-GCNN)-CNN framework as an add-on to object\ndetection models. The proposed approach uses the output of the CNN object\ndetection model to predict the observed scene type by generating a coherent\nGCNN representing the semantic and geometric content of the observed scene.\nThis new method, applied to natural scenes, achieves an efficiency of over 90\\%\nfor scene classification in a COCO-derived dataset containing a large number of\ndifferent scenes, while requiring fewer parameters than traditional CNN\nmethods. For the benefit of the scientific community, we will make the source\ncode publicly available: https://github.com/Aymanbegh/Hybrid-GCNN-CNN.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
