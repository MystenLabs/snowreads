Recent findings show that perfect spatial\nmode demultiplexing (SPADE) into Hermite-Gauss modes followed by photon\ncounting enables one to reach the quantum limit of precision in the task of\nestimation of separation between two weak stationary sources in the\nsub-Rayleigh regime. In order to check the limitations of the method, various\nimperfections such as misalignment or crosstalk between the modes were\nconsidered.\n  Possible applications of the method in microscopy call for the adaptive\nmeasurement scheme, as the position of the measured system can evolve in time,\ncausing non-negligible misalignment. In this paper, we examine the impact of\nBrownian motion of the center of the system of two weak incoherent sources of\narbitrary relative brightness on adaptive SPADE measurement precision limits.\nThe analysis is carried out using Fisher information, from which the limit of\nprecision can be obtained by Cram\\'er-Rao bound. As a result, we find that\nRayleigh's curse is present in such a scenario; however, SPADE measurement can\noutperform perfect direct imaging. What is more, a suitable adjustment of the\nmeasurement time between alignments allows measurement with near-optimal\nprecision.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
