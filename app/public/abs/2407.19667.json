Recent innovations in Natural Language Processing have\nyielded success through the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). We seek to\nimprove the travel-planning capability of such LLMs by extending upon the work\nof the previous paper TravelPlanner. Our objective is to explore a new method\nof using LLMs to improve the travel planning experience. We focus specifically\non the \"sole-planning\" mode of travel planning; that is, the agent is given\nnecessary reference information, and its goal is to create a comprehensive plan\nfrom the reference information. While this does not simulate the real-world we\nfeel that an optimization of the sole-planning capability of a travel planning\nagent will still be able to enhance the overall user experience. We propose a\nsemi-automated prompt generation framework which combines the LLM-automated\nprompt and \"human-in-the-loop\" to iteratively refine the prompt to improve the\nLLM performance. Our result shows that LLM automated prompt has its limitations\nand \"human-in-the-loop\" greatly improves the performance by $139\\%$ with one\nsingle iteration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"de0OXttGaqnBw12x6foyrxCHJRjECUaEEqGRFkrQkgI","pdfSize":"228496"}
