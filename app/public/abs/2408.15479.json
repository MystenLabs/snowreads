Much progress has been made since the first\nsurprising result by the EMC experiment in the late 1980s. However, the\nhelicity distributions of strange quarks and anti-quarks inside the proton are\nstill not well constrained by the experimental data. Measurement of the\nlongitudinal double spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$ of the inclusive jets tagged with a\n$\\pi^{\\pm}/\\pi^-$ carrying high jet momentum fraction, $z$, in $p+p$ collisions\ncan provide further constraints on the gluon helicity distribution in the\nproton. In addition, the $A_{LL}$ of $\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ and\n$K_S^0$ in the longitudinally polarized $p+p$ collisions may shed light on the\nstrange quark and anti-quark helicity distributions. In this contribution, we\nreport the preliminary results on the $A_{LL}$ measurements of inclusive jets\ntagged with a high-$z$ $\\pi^{\\pm}$, and the $\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ and\n$K_S^0$. We utilize the longitudinally polarized $p+p$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=200$ $\\rm{GeV}$ collected by the STAR experiment with an integrated\nluminosity of about 52 $\\rm{pb^{-1}}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
