Unlike semi-supervised learning, one cannot select the\nmost probable label as the pseudo-label in SSMLL due to multiple semantics\ncontained in an instance. To solve this problem, the mainstream method\ndeveloped an effective thresholding strategy to generate accurate\npseudo-labels. Unfortunately, the method neglected the quality of model\npredictions and its potential impact on pseudo-labeling performance. In this\npaper, we propose a dual-perspective method to generate high-quality\npseudo-labels. To improve the quality of model predictions, we perform\ndual-decoupling to boost the learning of correlative and discriminative\nfeatures, while refining the generation and utilization of pseudo-labels. To\nobtain proper class-wise thresholds, we propose the metric-adaptive\nthresholding strategy to estimate the thresholds, which maximize the\npseudo-label performance for a given metric on labeled data. Experiments on\nmultiple benchmark datasets show the proposed method can achieve the\nstate-of-the-art performance and outperform the comparative methods with a\nsignificant margin.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
