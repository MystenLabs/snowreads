To address this need within the banking domain, the Arabic\nFinancial NLP (AraFinNLP) shared task proposes two subtasks: (i) Multi-dialect\nIntent Detection and (ii) Cross-dialect Translation and Intent Preservation.\nThis shared task uses the updated ArBanking77 dataset, which includes about 39k\nparallel queries in MSA and four dialects. Each query is labeled with one or\nmore of a common 77 intents in the banking domain. These resources aim to\nfoster the development of robust financial Arabic NLP, particularly in the\nareas of machine translation and banking chat-bots. A total of 45 unique teams\nregistered for this shared task, with 11 of them actively participated in the\ntest phase. Specifically, 11 teams participated in Subtask 1, while only 1 team\nparticipated in Subtask 2. The winning team of Subtask 1 achieved F1 score of\n0.8773, and the only team submitted in Subtask 2 achieved a 1.667 BLEU score.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aJJIMbAnweiWuTm7IDZkjZyLeMQAd5mCnW-dNtWGsPg","pdfSize":"510331","objectId":"0x4d6402fc56977f3e615bae8e5720fb829fef0dac85714f0833d648b70cda644a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
