However, only a few methods\ntarget the underlying Boltzmann distribution by resampling techniques, where\nproposals are rarely accepted as new states with low efficiency. In this work,\nwe propose a force-guided bridge matching model, FBM, a novel framework that\nfirst incorporates physical priors into bridge matching for full-atom\ntime-coarsened dynamics. With the guidance of our well-designed intermediate\nforce field, FBM is feasible to target the Boltzmann-like distribution by\ndirect inference without extra steps. Experiments on small peptides verify our\nsuperiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability\nto unseen peptide systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Computational Physics","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
