Amiri and\nWiederhake considered $k$-hop domination in graphs of bounded $k$-hop expansion\nand girth at least $4k+3$; the $k$-hop expansion $f(k)$ of a graph family\ndenotes the maximum ratio of edges to nodes that can be achieved by contracting\ndisjoint subgraphs of radius $k$ and deleting nodes. In this setting, these\nauthors to obtain a simple $O(k)$-round algorithm achieving approximation ratio\n$\\Theta(kf(k))$.\n  In this work, we study the same setting but derive tight bounds:\n  - A $\\Theta(kf(k))$-approximation is possible in $k$, but not $k-1$ rounds.\n  - In $3k$ rounds an $O(k+f(k)^{k/(k+1)})$-approximation can be achieved.\n  - No constant-round deterministic algorithm can achieve approximation ratio\n$o(k+f(k)^{k/(k+1)})$.\n  Our upper bounds hold in the port numbering model with small messages, while\nthe lower bounds apply to local algorithms, i.e., with arbitrary message size\nand unique identifiers. This means that the constant-time approximation ratio\ncan be \\emph{sublinear} in the edge density of the graph, in a graph class\nwhich does not allow a constant approximation. This begs the question whether\nthis is an artefact of the restriction to high girth or can be extended to all\ngraphs of $k$-hop expansion $f(k)$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
