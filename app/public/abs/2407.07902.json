To work towards this goal of preparing\nphysics students for a career in the quantum industry, a senior capstone course\ncalled \"Quantum Forge\" was created at the University of Colorado Boulder. This\ncourse aims to provide students a hands-on quantum experience and prepare them\nto enter the quantum workforce directly after their undergraduate studies. Some\nof the course's goals are to have students understand what comprises the\nquantum industry and have them feel confident they could enter the industry if\ndesired. To understand to what extent these goals are achieved, we followed the\nfirst cohort of Quantum Forge students through their year in the course in\norder to understand their perceptions of the quantum industry including what it\nis, whether they feel that they could be successful in it, and whether or not\nthey want to participate in it. The results of this work can assist educators\nin optimizing the design of future quantum-industry-focused courses and\nprograms to better prepare students to be a part of this burgeoning industry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
