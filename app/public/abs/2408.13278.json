This is\nmotivated by the inherent ambiguity of the rules that determine substantial\nsimilarity in copyright precedents. Given that there is no quantifiable measure\nof substantial similarity that is agreed upon, complementary approaches can\npotentially further decrease liability. Similar randomized approaches, such as\ndifferential privacy, have been successful in mitigating privacy risks. This\ndocument focuses on the technical and research perspective on mitigating\ncopyright violation and hence is not confidential. After investigating\npotential solutions and running numerical experiments, we concluded that using\nthe notion of Near Access-Freeness (NAF) to measure the degree of substantial\nsimilarity is challenging, and the standard approach of training a\nDifferentially Private (DP) model costs significantly when used to ensure NAF.\nAlternative approaches, such as retrieval models, might provide a more\ncontrollable scheme for mitigating substantial similarity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lRtLcTdIrssPBmMBMHMTm56TSSghaujZ2rKH-ninHQM","pdfSize":"652703"}
