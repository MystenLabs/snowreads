Federated Learning is a promising distributed computing approach in\nthis context, allowing multiple satellites to collaborate efficiently in\ntraining on-board machine learning models. Though recent works on the use of\nFederated Learning in orbital edge computing have focused largely on\nhomogeneous satellite constellations, Federated Learning could also be employed\nto allow heterogeneous satellites to form ad-hoc collaborations, e.g. in the\ncase of communications satellites operated by different providers. Such an\napplication presents additional challenges to the Federated Learning paradigm,\narising largely from the heterogeneity of such a system. In this position\npaper, we offer a systematic review of these challenges in the context of the\ncross-provider use case, giving a brief overview of the state-of-the-art for\neach, and providing an entry point for deeper exploration of each issue.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B7dY1kOVTIy_hsAokWfNqcasg9O_tpBQ0hRrDiDlYlg","pdfSize":"1685304"}
