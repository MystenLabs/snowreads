In\nparticular, the aim is to browse the more common ROM frameworks, considering\nboth intrusive and data-driven approaches. We present the validation of such\ntechniques against several test cases. The first one is an academic benchmark,\nthe thermal block problem, where a Poisson equation is considered. Here a\nclassic intrusive ROM framework based on a Galerkin projection scheme is\nemployed. The second and third test cases come from real-world applications,\nthe one related to the investigation of the blood flow patterns in a patient\nspecific coronary arteries configuration where the Navier Stokes equations are\naddressed and the other one concerning the granulation process within\npharmaceutical industry where a fluid-particle system is considered. Here we\nemploy two data-driven ROM approaches showing a very relevant trade-off between\naccuracy and efficiency. In the last part of the contribution, two novel\ntechnological platforms, ARGOS and ATLAS, are presented. They are designed to\nprovide a user-friendly access to data-driven models for real-time predictions\nfor complex biomedical and industrial problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
