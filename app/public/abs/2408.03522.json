Serra in 2013, which extended to general\ndimension and the $p$-Laplacian operator an argument proposed by P. L. Lions in\ndimension $2$ for the classical Laplacian.\n  Stability results for the classical Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg symmetry theorem\n(involving the classical Laplacian) via the method of moving planes were\nestablished by Rosset in 1994 and by Ciraolo, Cozzi, Perugini, Pollastro in\n2024.\n  To the authors' knowledge, the present paper provides the first quantitative\nGidas-Ni-Nirenberg-type result involving the $p$-Laplacian for $p \\neq 2$. Even\nfor the classical Laplacian (i.e., for $p=2$), this is the first time that\nintegral identities are used to achieve stability for a Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg-type\nresult.\n  In passing, we obtain a quantitative estimate for the measure of the singular\nset and an explicit uniform gradient bound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
