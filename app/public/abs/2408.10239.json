However, a critical yet often neglected aspect\nof ethical ML is the ethical implications that appear when designing\nevaluations of ML systems. For instance, teams may have to balance a trade-off\nbetween highly informative tests to ensure downstream product safety, with\npotential fairness harms inherent to the implemented testing procedures. We\nconceptualize ethics-related concerns in standard ML evaluation techniques.\nSpecifically, we present a utility framework, characterizing the key trade-off\nin ethical evaluation as balancing information gain against potential ethical\nharms. The framework is then a tool for characterizing challenges teams face,\nand systematically disentangling competing considerations that teams seek to\nbalance. Differentiating between different types of issues encountered in\nevaluation allows us to highlight best practices from analogous domains, such\nas clinical trials and automotive crash testing, which navigate these issues in\nways that can offer inspiration to improve evaluation processes in ML. Our\nanalysis underscores the critical need for development teams to deliberately\nassess and manage ethical complexities that arise during the evaluation of ML\nsystems, and for the industry to move towards designing institutional policies\nto support ethical evaluations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
