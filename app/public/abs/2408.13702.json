While traditional DIF methods rely on single-level\nmodels, multilevel models offer a more suitable alternative for analyzing such\ndata. In this article, we highlight the advantages of multilevel modeling in\nDIF analysis and demonstrate how to apply the DIF framework to self-reported\nhealth survey data using multilevel models. For demonstration, we analyze DIF\nassociated with population density on the probability to answer \"Yes\" to a\nsurvey question on depression and reveal that multilevel models achieve better\nfit and account for more variance compared to single-level models. This article\nis expected to increase awareness of the usefulness of multilevel modeling for\nDIF analysis and assist healthcare researchers and practitioners in improving\nthe understanding of self-reported health survey data validity.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
