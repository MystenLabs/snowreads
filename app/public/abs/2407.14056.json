Our ablation studies reveal that just 1 hour of neutral and\n30 minutes of expressive data can yield a Fair system as indicated by MUSHRA\nscores. Increasing neutral data to 10 hours, with minimal expressive data,\nsignificantly enhances expressiveness. This offers a practical recipe for\nresource-constrained languages, prioritizing easily obtainable neutral data\nalongside smaller amounts of expressive data. We show the importance of\nsyllabically balanced data and pooling emotions to enhance expressiveness. We\nalso highlight challenges in generating specific emotions, e.g., fear and\nsurprise.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
