The approach benefits from the geometric mesh\nflexibility of polytopic discontinuous Galerkin methods to resolve the\nzero-level set accurately and efficiently. Additionally, we employ suitable\nRunge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin methods to update the level-set function on\na fine underlying simplicial mesh. We discuss the construction and\nimplementation of the approach, explaining how to modify shape derivate\nformulas to compute consistent shape gradient approximations using\ndiscontinuous Galerkin methods, and how to recover dG functions into smoother\nones. Numerical experiments on unconstrained and PDE-constrained test cases\nevidence the good properties of the proposed methodology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n3dAyAQ2csLewobH3cSDfVxGlGMkd7iSI2-Dqk4DSHA","pdfSize":"4640113"}
