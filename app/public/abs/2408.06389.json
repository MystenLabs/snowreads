I. Cot\\u aescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2022) 82:86]. These particles are\nproduced by central singularities of the fluid density but without changing the\npressure of the asymptotic FLRW space-times. The principal features of these\nmodels are investigated using a brief graphical analysis for pointing out the\nrole of the new free parameter. The conclusion is that this gives rise to\nfamilies of models which behave as non-rotating black holes in the physical\nspace domain bordered by the black hole and cosmological horizons.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sutrozpMur7-AhWJmacQJEiSGMrx5QUBBMVigzEKCx4","pdfSize":"410672"}
