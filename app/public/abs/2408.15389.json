A particular\nmodel of this extended theory is considered to formulate explicit field\nequations which govern the interaction between matter and geometry. The\nconfiguration of static spherical symmetric structures is examined through the\nFinch-Skea solution. However, the values of unknown constants in the metric\npotentials are evaluated by the Darmois junction conditions. For the viability\nof proposed stellar objects, the physical parameters including density,\npressure, anisotropy, mass, energy constraints, compactness function and\nredshift are analyzed. Furthermore, stability of the proposed stellar objects\nis investigated by causality condition, Herrera cracking approach and adiabatic\nindex. Our findings indicate that the proposed stellar objects are viable as\nwell as stable in the presence of correction terms.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
