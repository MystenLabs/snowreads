Previous\ninvestigations neglected the impact of vibrational modes inherent to this\nquasi-1D geometry, relying instead on a three-dimensional bulk assumption for\nthe phonon modes. However, it has been shown that phonon decoherence has a much\nstronger impact in 1D structures as compared with bulk media. Here, we\nsurprisingly demonstrate the robustness of the photonic hourglass design,\nachieving close-to-unity indistinguishability even by incorporating a detailed\ndescription of the vibrational modes. We explain this unexpected result in\nterms of the large Purcell enhancement of the hourglass single-photon source,\nwhich eliminates the negative effect of phonons. Our findings highlight the key\nrole of high-Q optical cavities in mitigating the detrimental effect of phonon\ndecoherence, even for structures of reduced dimensionality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FmOjHKrjYK96RdIfdPz1AWNLW0-2N1OnfrSyZlOVcKc","pdfSize":"1471273"}
