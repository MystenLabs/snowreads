Each reconstructed 3D tree model corresponds to an image from\nGoogle's Auto Arborist Dataset, comprising street view images and associated\ngenus labels of trees across North America. Our method distills the scores of\ntwo tree-adapted diffusion models by utilizing text prompts to specify a tree\ngenus, thus facilitating shape reconstruction. This process involves\nreconstructing a 3D tree envelope filled with point markers, which are\nsubsequently utilized to estimate the tree's branching structure using the\nspace colonization algorithm conditioned on a specified genus.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7u8EdYB1gamyTVvOfqqbPTFXnOCE-RbAjgmpiUjd704","pdfSize":"9346312"}
