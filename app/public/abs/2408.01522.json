We also prove that the\nZariski tangent space of the moduli space at this canonical solution is same as\nthe Zariski tangent space of the moduli space of locally conformally flat\nstructures at the hyperbolic metric. This space is again same as the space of\ntrace-free Codazzi tensors and carries an injection to $H^1(\\Gamma,\\mathbb\nR^{3,1})$, the first group cohomology of the $\\Gamma$-module $\\mathbb R^{1,3}$.\nIn particular, if $H^1(\\Gamma,\\mathbb R^{3,1})=0$ then the canonical\nirreducible solution is infinitesimally rigid. We also prove that the\n$\\mathrm{Sp}(1)$-Seiberg-Witten equation over $S^1\\times \\Sigma$ has no\nirreducible solutions and the moduli space of reducible solutions is same as\nthe moduli space of flat $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$-connections.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
