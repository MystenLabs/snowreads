Using a comprehensive database of job ads posted by Norwegian\nemployers, we develop a methodology to systematically classify the information\non both pay and non-pay job attributes advertised in vacancy texts. We link\nthis information to measures of employer attractiveness, which we derive from a\njob search model estimated on observed wages and worker mobility flows. About\n55 percent of job ads provide information related to pay and nearly all ads\nfeature information on non-pay attributes. We show that publicly advertised job\nattributes are meaningful predictors of employer attractiveness, and non-pay\nattributes are about as predictive as pay-related attributes. High-pay\nemployers mention pay-related attributes more often, while high-amenity\nemployers are more likely to advertise flexible working hours and contract\nduration.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
