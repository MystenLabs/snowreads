We derive an iterative algorithm to\noptimize this function, prove model convergence within a finite number of\niterations, and analyze its computational complexity. Our experiments on\nvarious real-world graphs demonstrate the superior clustering performance of\nGCCFP compared to well-established methods, manifesting its effectiveness\nacross different scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
