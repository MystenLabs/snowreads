[J. Chem.

In this paper we show that SPA in its original form does work for\nall their data including large jumps of \\Delta T > 20 K. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss different approaches to the extension of the density scaling concept to\nout-of-equilibrium systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
