In this\npaper, a learning-based control policy is proposed to ensure the safety of\nsystems with unknown disturbances through control barrier functions (CBFs).\nFirst, the disturbance is predicted by Gaussian process (GP) regression, whose\nprediction performance is guaranteed by a deterministic error bound. Then, a\nnovel control strategy using GP-based parameterized high-order control barrier\nfunctions (GP-P-HOCBFs) is proposed via a shrunk original safe set based on the\nprediction error bound. In comparison to existing methods that involve adding\nstrict robust safety terms to the HOCBF condition, the proposed method offers\nmore flexibility to deal with the conservatism and the feasibility of solving\nquadratic problems within the CBF framework. Finally, the effectiveness of the\nproposed method is demonstrated by simulations on Franka Emika manipulator.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
