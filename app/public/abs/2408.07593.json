More precisely, it\naddresses the question for which pairs of positive integers $(n,n')$ the\nvariety $Hilb^n_X$ is stably birational to $Hilb^{n'}_X$, when $X$ is a surface\nwith irregularity $q(X)=0$. After general results for such surfaces, we\nrestrict our attention to geometrically rational surfaces, proving that there\nare only finitely many stable birational classes among the $Hilb^n_X$'s. As a\ncorollary, we deduce the rationality of the motivic zeta function $\\zeta(X,t)$\nin $K_0(Var/k)/([\\mathbb{A}^1_k])[[t]]$ over fields of characteristic zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
