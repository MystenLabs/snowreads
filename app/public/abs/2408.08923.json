The main result is that an increase in mineral trade significantly\nincreases the number of conflicts while it has no clear effect on fatalities.\nExploring heterogeneous effects, I find that a specific group of minerals, oil\nand fuels, drives the results on the number of conflicts. Moreover, the group\nof rare minerals such as coltan, precious metals or cobalt has no effect on the\nnumber of conflicts but appears to have an important impact on the number of\nfatalities.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
