Recently, however, electric field switching of stacking\nconfiguration between honeycomb layers, held together by relatively weak van\nder Waals (vdW) attractions, was demonstrated. In response to the external\nfields, the layers slide between commensurate meta-stable configurations with\ndiscrete symmetries and distinct lattice orientations. These 2D vdW polytypes\nhost diverse electronic orders such as ferroelectricity and magnetism,\nproviding multiferroic switching via lubricant sliding of incommensurate\nboundary strips. Ahead, we address recent observations in honeycomb polytypes\nand identify remaining challenges for extending this conceptual \"SlideTronics\"\nmechanism into rapid, local, and practical multiferroic devices. The stacking\nenergies, symmetries, and orbital overlaps that underlie the band structures\nand internal charge distributions are discussed, along with poly-properties\nlike interfacial-ferroelectricity, ladder-like cumulative polarization,\nsuperconductivity, and orbital magnetic orders. Distinct from conventional 3D\nmultiferroic crystals, the 2D vdW assembly and the sliding switching mechanism\nopen poly-opportunities for novel device concepts.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"w9s5qE4OKSvEzbVcZjvYLy_9Z_dFpiN0Z3MaShRTIG4","pdfSize":"1717903"}
