However, topology optimization or inverse design of\nsuch structures in the presence of nonlinearities remains a challenge due to\nthe expense of computational homogenization methods and the complexity of\ndifferentiably parameterizing the microstructural response. A solution to this\nchallenge lies in machine learning techniques that offer efficient,\ndifferentiable mappings between the material response and its microstructural\ndescriptors. This work presents a framework for designing multiscale\nheterogeneous structures with spatially varying microstructures by merging a\nhomogenization-based topology optimization strategy with a consistent machine\nlearning approach grounded in hyperelasticity theory. We leverage neural\narchitectures that adhere to critical physical principles such as\npolyconvexity, objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency to\nsupply the framework with a reliable constitutive model that is dependent on\nmaterial microstructural descriptors. Our findings highlight the potential of\nintegrating consistent machine learning models with density-based topology\noptimization for enhancing design optimization of heterogeneous hyperelastic\nstructures under finite deformations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lmm031DD1S7Xnnj4Vqko4He6cacj24_mP1VVzsfzqkU","pdfSize":"3157798"}
