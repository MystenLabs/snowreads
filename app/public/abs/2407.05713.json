Our method first detects all potential\nactive objects in the last frame of egocentric video by fine-tuning a\npre-trained YOLOv9. Then, we combine these potential active objects as query\nwith transformer encoder, thereby identifying the most promising next active\nobject and predicting its future interaction and time-to-contact. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on the\nchallenge test set, achieving the best performance in predicting next active\nobjects and their interactions. Finally, our proposed ranked the third overall\ntop-5 mAP when including time-to-contact predictions.
