We investigate the use of LLMs to estimate attention states, sleep\nstages, and sleep quality and generate sleep improvement suggestions and\nadaptive guided imagery scripts based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and\nphysical activity data (e.g. waveforms, power spectrogram images, numerical\nfeatures). Our results show that LLMs can estimate sleep quality based on human\ntextual behavioral features and provide personalized sleep improvement\nsuggestions and guided imagery scripts; however detecting attention, sleep\nstages, and sleep quality based on EEG and activity data requires further\ntraining data and domain-specific knowledge.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
