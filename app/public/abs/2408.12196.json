Our approach can be\nused efficiently in solving certain combinatorial problems. We finish the paper\nby considering a tiling problem with black and white dominoes, and we use the\nmethod as a demonstration to find the solution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w0kQc-O4bjPV3fs42jH1J2MEEWCMmYc27mwSE-40UcI","pdfSize":"180551"}
