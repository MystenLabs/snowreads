While the governing equations\nof the systems are unknown, bursts of observation data of the slow variables\nare available. By utilizing the observation data, our proposed method is\ncapable of constructing a generative stochastic model that can accurately\ncapture the effective dynamics of the slow variables in distribution. We\npresent a comprehensive set of numerical examples to demonstrate the\nperformance of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kPhSlhY_zXarOn-9KPlJblOpqnkDKlhwqlATqhpgstk","pdfSize":"1950567"}
