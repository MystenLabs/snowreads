More\nprecisely, our results concern $L(s, \\pi \\otimes \\chi, \\mathrm{Spin})$ for\ncuspidal automorphic representations $\\pi$ associated to a holomorphic Siegel\neigenform on $\\mathrm{GSp}_6$, Dirichlet characters $\\chi$, and critical points\n$s$ to the right of the center of symmetry. We use the strategy of relating the\n$L$-values to properties of Eisenstein series, and a significant portion of the\npaper concerns the Fourier coefficients of these Eisenstein series. Unlike in\nprior algebraicity results following this strategy, our Eisenstein series are\non a group $G$ that has no known moduli problem, and the $L$-functions are\nrelated to the Eisenstein series through a non-unique model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
