For this we use a Weyl gauge covariant\nformulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge\ntheory, in which this geometry is metric. For $d=4$, in a leading order\nexpansion the DBI action becomes the general Weyl quadratic gravity action\nassociated to this geometry, that has the same gauge symmetry; this is broken\nspontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase,\nwith $\\Lambda >0$. The series expansion of the DBI action also contains\nadditional non-polynomial terms that can be generated at quantum level in Weyl\nquadratic gravity in $d=4$, by a regularisation that respects this gauge\nsymmetry. Such a regularisation is automatically provided by the DBI action in\n$d$ dimensions. If the Weyl gauge boson of dilatations is \"pure gauge\", the DBI\naction recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action plus a\nlocally Weyl invariant dilaton action. All fields and scales in the theory have\na geometric origin, with no added matter or Weyl scalar fields compensators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
