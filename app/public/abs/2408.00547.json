This shows that a widely used method to determine the line tension\nfrom the slope of the contact angle cosine dependence on the three-phase\ncontact line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain\ncombination of the line tension, adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the\nmacroscopic contact angle. To extract the leading-order contact-line-related\ncontribution and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique\nusing contact angle size dependences for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets\nat the same conditions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
