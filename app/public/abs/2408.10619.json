Conventional\nchange detection techniques, such as image differencing and ratioing, often\nstruggle with noise and fail to capture complex variations in imagery. Recent\nadvancements in machine learning, particularly generative models like diffusion\nmodels, offer new opportunities for enhancing change detection accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel change detection framework that combines the\nstrengths of Stable Diffusion models with the Structural Similarity Index\n(SSIM) to create robust and interpretable change maps. Our approach, named\nDiffusion Based Change Detector, is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world\nremote sensing datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional differencing\ntechniques and recent deep learning-based methods, particularly in scenarios\nwith complex changes and noise.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
