We study the\nshadow properties of these two objects, finding both to be pathological. In\nparticular, the naked singularity does not cast a shadow, whereas the black\nhole casts a shadow which is too small. We argue that the Event Horizon\nTelescope images of M87$^{\\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\\star}$ rule out the baseline\nversion of mimetic gravity, preventing the theory from successfully accounting\nfor the dark sector on cosmological scales. Our results highlight an\ninteresting complementarity between black hole imaging observations and\nmodified gravity theories of cosmological interest.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
