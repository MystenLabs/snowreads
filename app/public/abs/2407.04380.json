Marklof for real Farey fractions with several variables (2013)\nand adapt a joint equidistribution result in the real $3$-dimensional\nhyperbolic space of J. Parkkonen and F. Paulin (2023) to derive the existence\nof a probability measure describing this asymptotic gap statistic. We obtain an\nintegral formula for the associated cumulative distribution function, and use\ngeometric arguments to find an explicit estimate for its tail distribution in\nthe cases of Gaussian and Eisenstein fractions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
