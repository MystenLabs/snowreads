In this\nmodel, the second-order local Allen-Cahn equation is applied for interface\ncapturing, a general form of the simple scalar transport equation [S. S. Jain,\nJ. Comput. Phys. 515, 113277 (2024)] is adopted for interface-confined\nsurfactant, and the consistent and conservative Navier-Stokes equations with\nthe Marangoni force is used for fluid flows. To solve this model, we further\ndeveloped a mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, in which the LB model for\nsurfactant transport equation is proposed under the general LB framework for\nthe convection-diffusion type equation, and it can correctly recover the\ngoverning equation for surfactant transport. The accuracy of the present LB\nmethod is tested by several benchmark problems, and the numerical results show\nit has a good performance for the transport of the insoluble surfactant in\ntwo-phase flows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
