View planning aims to find a set of near-optimal\nviewpoints for vision-related tasks to achieve the vision coverage goal. This\npaper proposes a new clustering-based two-step computational method using\nspectral clustering, local potential field method, and hyper-heuristic\nalgorithm to find near-optimal views to cover the target building surface. In\nthe first step, the proposed method generates candidate viewpoints based on\nspectral clustering and corrects the positions of candidate viewpoints based on\nour newly proposed local potential field method. In the second step, the\noptimization problem is converted into a Set Covering Problem (SCP), and the\noptimal viewpoint subset is solved using our proposed hyper-heuristic\nalgorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to obtain\nbetter solutions with fewer viewpoints and higher coverage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"400rjacwuxP0OYv7yZ_CSxR9adzfVxo_g2i7fcNmd_g","pdfSize":"5095100","txDigest":"CjqYXmsPkENTDoAPziU4LRwM8GTyfSP4zgokitxUCar4","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
