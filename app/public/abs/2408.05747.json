It occurs when researchers selectively report outcomes\nbased on the significance or direction of results, potentially leading to\ndistorted treatment effect estimates. Despite its critical implications, ORB\nremains an under-recognized issue, with few comprehensive adjustment methods\navailable. The goal of this research is to investigate ORB-adjustment\ntechniques through a selection model lens, thereby extending some of the\nexisting methodological approaches available in the literature. To gain a\nbetter insight into the effects of ORB in meta-analysis of clinical trials,\nspecifically in the presence of heterogeneity, and to assess the effectiveness\nof ORB-adjustment techniques, we apply the methodology to real clinical data\naffected by ORB and conduct a simulation study focusing on treatment effect\nestimation with a secondary interest in heterogeneity quantification.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3ZsC2DSF1ABm4b2wrg8LHyRLJBPofWNGhHSffdbgxKA","pdfSize":"583689"}
