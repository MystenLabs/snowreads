Polarization, probed through decay kinematics, provides a\nunique tool to scrutinize the top quark across its various production modes and\nto explore potential new physics effects. However, the top quark most often\ndecays hadronically, for which unambiguous identification of its decay products\nsensitive to top quark polarization is not possible. In this Letter, we\nintroduce a jet flavor tagging method to significantly improve spin analyzing\npower in hadronic decays, going beyond exclusive kinematic information employed\nin previous studies. We provide parametric estimates of the improvement from\nflavor tagging with any set of measured observables and demonstrate this in\npractice on simulated data using a Graph Neural Network (GNN). We find that the\nspin analyzing power in hadronic decays can improve by approximately 20% (40%)\ncompared to the kinematic approach, assuming an efficiency of 0.5 (0.2) for the\nnetwork.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mal7S70R_K71BMpvL8ENj8yIeAWt2WnzCPdUcvKgSGU","pdfSize":"576486"}
