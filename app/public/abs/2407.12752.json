Here, we\npropose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between\nRydberg atoms, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of\nthe former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in\noptical tweezer arrays. For repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of\na robust supersolid phase accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments on\nthe triangular lattice supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations\nbased on explicitly calculated pair interactions for ${}^{87}$Rb and with a\ncritical entropy per particle $S/N \\approx 0.19$. Such a lattice supersolid is\nlong-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat\ntwo-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles. Its\nthermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger\nscale than hitherto possible.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
