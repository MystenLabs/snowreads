FRMCS is expected to bring in new use cases that demand low latency\nand high reliability. However, from a mobility perspective, it is not clear how\nthe low latency and high reliability will be achieved. This paper investigates\nthe effect of handover procedure on latency and reliability and analyzes which\nuse cases of FRMCS can be satisfied using baseline handover. We also sweep\nthrough different handover parameter configurations and analyze their effect on\nmobility performance. Then, we analyze the effect of mobility performance on\npacket latency and reliability. Our results show that, with baseline handover,\nStandard Data Communications Scenario is met and optimizing for baseline\nhandover performance can reduce latency by up to 18.5%, indicating that\noptimizing for mobility performance is crucial in FRMCS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
