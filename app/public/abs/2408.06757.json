Subsequently, we study $\\theta$-translation invariance properties of this\nnetwork. Unlike the classical case, these networks are not translation\ninvariant. \\par In the second part, we study data approximation problems using\nthe FrFT. More precisely, given a data set $\\fl=\\{f_1,\\cdots, f_m\\}\\subset\nL^2(\\R^n)$, we obtain $\\Phi=\\{\\phi_1,\\cdots,\\phi_\\ell\\}$ such that \\[\nV_\\theta(\\Phi)=\\argmin\\sum_{j=1}^m \\|f_j-P_{V}f_j\\|^2, \\] where the minimum is\ntaken over all $\\theta$-shift invariant spaces generated by at most $\\ell$\nelements. Moreover, we prove the existence of a space of bandlimited functions\nin the FrFT domain which is ``closest\" to $\\fl$ in the above sense.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
