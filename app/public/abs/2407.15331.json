However, the\nunderstanding of entanglement structures and properties near DQPT in models\nwith longer-range hoppings is far from complete. In this work, we study DQPTs\nin the quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Anomalous DQPTs,\nwhere the number of critical momenta exceeds the winding number differences\nbetween the pre-quench and post-quench phases, are observed. We find that the\nentanglement exhibits local maximum (minimum) around the anomalous DQPTs, in\nline with the level crossings (separations) around the middle of the\ncorrelation matrix spectrum. We further categorize the phases in the\nequilibrium model into two classes and distinctive features in the time\nevolution of the entanglement involving quenches within and across the two\nclasses are identified. The findings pave the way to a better understanding of\ntopological models with longer-range hoppings in the out-of-equilibrium regime.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
