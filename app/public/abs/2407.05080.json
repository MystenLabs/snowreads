The setup\nisolates the azimuthal gradients of the fields, eliminating longitudinal and\ncurvature effects. We provide a detailed characterization of the phenomenon by\ndeterministically positioning a single ion across the beams, achieving a signal\nwhich depends on the angular velocity of the ion and the difference of optical\norbital angular momentum between the two beams. The interpretation of the\nmeasurements is supported by numerical simulations and by a simplified\nanalytical model. Our results reveal key properties of the rotational Doppler\neffect, showing that it increases approaching the center of the beam and that\nit is independent of the waist of the beam. This offers insights into the\nfeasibility of super-kicks or super-Doppler shifts for sensing and manipulating\natomic motion transverse to the beams' propagation direction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
