The real analytic interface is\nsubject to surface tension, while gravitational effects are ignored. In\ncontrast to the rotational surface waves, the fluid flow follows the\nincompressible, irrotational Euler equations. This model can provide a\ndescription for tiny water droplets in breaking waves and white caps. The\nprimary tool we use is global bifurcation theory, via a conformal formulation\nof the problem. The obtained fluid domains have $m$-fold discrete rotational\nsymmetry, as well as a reflection symmetry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ANIfhkM8oOdBX5Stb04W0SvuiFJlR2dpUsD05E88mO8","pdfSize":"383756","objectId":"0xa338e58ef872103d2033977fb5b78c3f4c849a711c05ec56a308fe2a657c8daa","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
