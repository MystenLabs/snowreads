While cluster randomized experiments mitigate this bias, they\nencounter limitations in handling network complexity and fail to distinguish\nbetween direct and indirect effects. To address these challenges, we develop a\ndesign-based asymptotic theory for the existing Horvitz--Thompson estimators of\nthe direct, indirect, and global average treatment effects under Bernoulli\ntrials. We assume the heterogeneous additive treatment effect model with a\nhidden network that drives interference. Observing that these estimators are\ninconsistent in dense networks, we introduce novel eigenvector-based regression\nadjustment estimators to ensure consistency. We establish the asymptotic\nnormality of the proposed estimators and provide conservative variance\nestimators under the design-based inference framework, offering robust\nconclusions independent of the underlying stochastic processes of the network\nand model parameters. Our method's adaptability is demonstrated across various\ninterference structures, including partial interference and local interference\nin a two-sided marketplace. Numerical studies further illustrate the efficacy\nof the proposed estimators, offering practical insights into handling network\ninterference.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
