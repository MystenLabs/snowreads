This fact gives rise to unusual propagation phenomena\nsuch as spherical wavefronts and beamfocusing, creating the impression that new\nspatial dimensions -- called degrees-of-freedom (DoF) -- can be exploited in\nthe near field. However, this is a fallacy because the theoretically maximum\nDoF are already achievable in the far field. This paper sheds light on these\nissues by providing a tutorial on spatial frequencies, which are the\nfundamental components of wireless channels, and by explaining their role in\ncharacterizing the DoF in the near and far fields. In particular, we\ndemonstrate how a single propagation path utilizes one spatial frequency in the\nfar field and an interval of spatial frequencies in the near field. We explain\nhow the array geometry determines the number of distinguishable spatial\nfrequency bins and, thereby, the spatial DoF. We also describe how to model\nnear-field multipath channels and their spatial correlation matrices. Finally,\nwe discuss the research challenges and future directions in this field.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
