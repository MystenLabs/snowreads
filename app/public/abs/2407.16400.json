Notably, for the limiting system\n\\eqref{fge} obtained in the low Mach number limit, the variation of the wall\ntemperature is allowed to be independent of the Mach number. It is also worth\npointing out that the velocity field $u_{1}$ acts like a ghost since it appears\nat $\\v$-order in the expansion, but still affects the density and temperature\nat $O(1)$-order. In the proof, we design a new expansion, in which the density,\nvelocity and temperature have different expansion forms with respect to $\\v$,\nso that the density at higher orders is well-defined under the Boussinesq\nrelations and the constraint of zero average. We also introduce a new\n$\\v$-dependent functional space, allowing us to obtain some uniform estimates\nfor high-order normal derivatives near the boundary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
