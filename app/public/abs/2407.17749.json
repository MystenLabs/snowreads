In particular,\nwe consider networks in which the impact of neighbors of agents on their\nopinions is proportional to their in-degree. Agents update their opinions over\ntime to coordinate with their neighbors. However, the frequency of agents'\ninteractions with neighbors in different network layers differs. Consequently,\nthe multilayer network's adjacency matrices are time-varying. We aim to\ncharacterize how the frequency of activation of different layers impacts the\nconvergence of the opinion dynamics process.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
