In our formulation, the magnetic field is evolved in\ntime in terms of face-average values via the constrained-transport method while\nthe remaining variables (density, momentum, energy and electric fields) are\nadvanced as cell volume-averages. Spatial accuracy employs 5th-order accurate\nWENO-Z reconstruction from point values (as described in a companion paper) to\nobtain left and right states at zone interfaces. Explicit flux evaluation is\ncarried out by solving a Riemann problem at cell interfaces, using the\nMaxwell-Harten-Lax-van Leer with contact wave resolution (MHLLC). Time stepping\nis based on the implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) methods, of which we\nconsider both the 3rd-order strong stability preserving SSP3(4,3,3) and a\nrecent 4th-order additive RK scheme, to cope with the stiffness introduced by\nthe source term in Ampere's law. Numerical benchmarks are presented in order to\nassess the accuracy and robustness of our implementation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
