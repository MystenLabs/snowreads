We\nprove that the cohomology of a left-symmetric color algebra $A$ with\ncoefficients in a bimodule $V$ can be computed by a lower degree cohomology of\nthe corresponding Lie color algebra with coefficients in Hom$(A,V)$,\ngeneralizing a result of Dzhumadil'daev in right-symmetric cohomology. We also\nexplore the varieties of two-dimensional and three-dimensional left-symmetric\ncolor algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
