In particular, we\nconstruct smooth initial data such that, the associated global solutions fail\nto be $C^{1}$ at time $t$ in a null set containing all rational numbers, but\nare $C^{1}$ at all times $t$ which are generic irrational numbers. The key\ningredient are to construct linear solutions which exhibit such phenomena and\nto prove nonlinear smoothing estimates for the full nonlinear model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
