However, they are difficult for many students to grasp. In this paper,\nwe outline a concept for how the learning of reductions can be supported by\neducational support systems. We present an implementation of the concept within\nsuch a system, concrete web-based and interactive learning material for\nreductions, and report on our experiences using the material in a large\nintroductory course on theoretical computer science.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
