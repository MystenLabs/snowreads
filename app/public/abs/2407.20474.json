To the existing parallel lexicographic algorithm for the same, we add\ndynamic behavior. The (dimensionwise) dynamic algorithm is parallelized either\nelementwise or factorizationwise, while the parallel lexicographic algorithm is\nmade dynamic with low-dimension tabulation. The tabulation for the parallel\nlexicographic algorithm can itself be performed using the dynamic algorithm.
