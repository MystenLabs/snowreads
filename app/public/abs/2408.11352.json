The $t$-channel $\\rho$ and $\\omega$ exchanges, the $u$- and\n$s$-channel $N$ exchanges, the interaction current, and the possible\n$s$-channel $N^*$ exchanges are taken into account in constructing the reaction\namplitudes to reproduce the data. The results show that the contributions from\neither the $N(2040)3/2^+$ or the $N(2100)1/2^+$ resonance exchange in the $s$\nchannel are necessarily required to describe the LEPS2/BGOegg data and they\ndominate the differential cross sections of $\\gamma p \\to f_0(980) p$. Further\nanalysis shows that the contributions from the $t$-channel $\\rho$ and $\\omega$\nexchanges and the interaction current are rather small to both differential\ncross sections and photo beam asymmetries, and the contributions from\n$u$-channel $N$ exchange are considerable in the case of including\n$N(2040)3/2^+$ in the model while negligible in the case of including\n$N(2100)1/2^+$ in the model. Predictions of target asymmetries $T$ for $\\gamma\np \\to f_0(980) p$ are given, which can be examined by future experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
