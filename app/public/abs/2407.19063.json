We first show that the\nsteady-state intra-cavity field follows the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution.\nThe effective temperature is given by the noise variance, and the equilibration\nrate is the dissipation rate. Next we derive expressions for internal energy,\nwork, heat, and free energy of light in a cavity, and formulate the first and\nsecond laws of thermodynamics for this system. We then analyze fluctuations in\nwork and heat, and show that they obey universal statistical relations known as\nfluctuation theorems. Finite time corrections to the fluctuation theorems are\nalso discussed. Additionally, we show that work fluctuations obey the Crook's\nFluctuation theorem which is a paradigm for understanding emergent phenomena\nand estimating free energy differences. The significance of our results is\ntwo-fold. On one hand, our work positions optical cavities as a unique platform\nfor fundamental studies of stochastic thermodynamics. On the other hand, our\nwork paves the way for improving the energy efficiency and information\nprocessing capabilities of laser-driven optical resonators using a\nthermodynamics based prescription.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
