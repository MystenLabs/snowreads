This work introduces AxiomVision, a novel framework\nthat can guarantee accuracy by leveraging edge computing to dynamically select\nthe most efficient visual models for video analytics under diverse scenarios.\nUtilizing a tiered edge-cloud architecture, AxiomVision enables the deployment\nof a broad spectrum of visual models, from lightweight to complex DNNs, that\ncan be tailored to specific scenarios while considering camera source impacts.\nIn addition, AxiomVision provides three core innovations: (1) a dynamic visual\nmodel selection mechanism utilizing continual online learning, (2) an efficient\nonline method that efficiently takes into account the influence of the camera's\nperspective, and (3) a topology-driven grouping approach that accelerates the\nmodel selection process. With rigorous theoretical guarantees, these\nadvancements provide a scalable and effective solution for visual tasks\ninherent to multimedia systems, such as object detection, classification, and\ncounting. Empirically, AxiomVision achieves a 25.7\\% improvement in accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
