Let\n$L(\\lambda)$ be a highest weight Harish-Chandra module of $G$ with the\ninfinitesimal character $\\lambda$. By using some combinatorial algorithm, we\nobtain a description of the annihilator variety of $L(\\lambda)$. As an\napplication, when $L(\\lambda)$ is unitarizable, we prove that the\nGelfand-Kirillov dimension of $L(\\lambda)$ only depends on the value of\n$z=(\\lambda,\\beta^{\\vee})$, where $\\beta$ is the highest root.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CbBE1VJuctapStjz6XDi8zknVZwkbZkEgVosOBxzoCQ","pdfSize":"312056"}
