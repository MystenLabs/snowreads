We derive it here for the first time in a maximally\nsupersymmetric context in four dimensions. Furthermore, we present the\nnon-linear relations between all the six- and four-dimensional bosonic and\nfermionic fields, that are obtained by comparing the off-shell supersymmetry\ntransformation rules.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
