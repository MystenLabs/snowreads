However, there does not exist a unified evaluation\nframework that can account for the many different settings in which qualitative\nresearchers may employ them. In this paper, we take a first step in this\ndirection by proposing an evaluation framework to study the way in which\ndifferent tools may result in different outcomes depending on the collaboration\nstrategy employed. Specifically, we study the impact of synchronous vs.\nasynchronous collaboration using two different NLP-assisted qualitative\nresearch tools and present a comprehensive analysis of significant differences\nin the consistency, cohesiveness, and correctness of their outputs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
