Along\nthe way, we determine differentials of the Adams spectral sequence for\nclassifying spaces involved in the computation, and we study the cap structure\nof the Adams spectral sequence for sub-hopf algebras of the Steenrod algebra\nrelevant to the computation of connective real and complex k-homology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
