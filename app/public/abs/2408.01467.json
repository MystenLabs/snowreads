If we leave students with this impression, it is\nlikely that students see physics class as useless and irrelevant to life\nsciences. Concepts of physics are vital in oder to understand physics based\ntechnological tools and biophysical topics essential and relevant for life\nsciences. This review summarizes approaches for improving teaching and learning\nin introductory physics courses to life science students in the SCALE- UP\nstyle. We also discuss our experiences in adapting IPLS Courses to better meet\nthe needs of life sciences students. to better meet the needs of life sciences\nstudents.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
