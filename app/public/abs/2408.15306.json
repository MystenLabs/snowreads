This bound is expressed in\nterms of the von Neumann entropies of the mutually orthogonal states derived\nfrom the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the difference operator $(\\rho_1 -\n\\rho_2)$. This yields a novel entropic inequality that implies the well-known\nAudenaert-Fannes inequality. We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform\ncontinuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose\nmarginals on the conditioning system coincide. We additionally use it to derive\na continuity bound for the quantum relative entropy in both variables. Our\nproofs are largely based on majorization theory and convex optimization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
