In this work, a diamond chain with constant magnetic flux\nper plaquette is decorated with several controlled onsite impurities in a\npatterned arrangement, generating an effective system that emerges from the\nflat band. The coupling distribution of the effective system is determined by\nthe relative distance between impurities and the value of the flux, which can\nbe chosen to engineer a wide variety of models. We employ a staggered\ndistribution of impurities that effectively produces the well-known\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show that the topological edge states display\nan enhanced robustness to non-chiral disorder due to an averaging effect over\ntheir extension. Finally, we provide a route to implement the system\nexperimentally using optical waveguides that guide orbital angular momentum\n(OAM) modes. This work opens the way for the design of topologically protected\nimpurity states in other flat-band systems or physical platforms with\nnon-orthogonal bases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
