This work investigates methodologies for generating\ntailored fashion descriptions using two distinct Large Language Models and a\nStable Diffusion model for fashion image creation. Emphasizing adaptability in\nAI-driven fashion creativity, we depart from traditional approaches and focus\non prompting techniques, such as zero-shot and few-shot learning, as well as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), which results in a variety of colors and textures,\nenhancing the diversity of the outputs. Central to our methodology is\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enriching models with insights from\nfashion sources to ensure contemporary representations. Evaluation combines\nquantitative metrics such as CLIPscore with qualitative human judgment,\nhighlighting strengths in creativity, coherence, and aesthetic appeal across\ndiverse styles. Among the participants, RAG and few-shot learning techniques\nare preferred for their ability to produce more relevant and appealing fashion\ndescriptions.
