For\npredicting the ultimate number of refugees, we first established a Logistic\nRegression Model, but due to the limited data points, its prediction accuracy\nwas suboptimal. Consequently, we incorporated Gray Theory to develop the Gary\nVerhulst Model, which provided scientifically sound and reasonable predictions.\nStatistical tests comparing both models highlighted the superiority of the Gary\nVerhulst Model. For formulating refugee allocation schemes, we initially used\nthe Factor Analysis Method but found it too subjective and lacking in rigorous\nvalidation measures. We then developed a Refugee Allocation Model based on the\nAnalytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which absorbed the advantages of the former\nmethod. This model underwent extensive validation and passed consistency\nchecks, resulting in an effective and scientific refugee allocation scheme. We\nalso compared our model with the current allocation schemes and proposed\nimprovements. Finally, we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of our\nmodels, their applicability, and scalability. Sensitivity analysis was\nconducted, and directions for future model improvements were identified.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
