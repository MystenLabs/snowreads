Previously such\nuniversality was known only for Ising spin glasses and random symmetric\nmatrices, the latter being a celebrated result of Bai--Yin. Our methods extend\nto $\\ell^q$ balls for $q>2$, thus resolving a conjecture of Chen-Sen, and to\ntensor PCA.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
