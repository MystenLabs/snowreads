In particular, the intriguing suppression of FQAHE in\nfavor of QAHE with decreasing temperature is explained as arising from the\nlow-temperature localization of the carriers where disorder overcomes the\ninteraction effects. We provide a detailed analysis of the data in support of\nthe crossover scenario.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
