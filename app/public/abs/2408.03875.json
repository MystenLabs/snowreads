Traditional attempts to\nresolve this tension have struggled to maintain consistency with dynamical and\ngeometrical probes at redshifts $0.01 < z \\lesssim 2.5$. We explore a novel\nmodel introducing new degrees of freedom in local physical laws affecting\ncalibrators like Cepheids and Type Ia Supernovae within a distance of $d\n\\lesssim 50$ Mpc ($z \\lesssim 0.01$). Specifically, we incorporate a\ngravitational transition causing a change in the gravitational constant ($G$)\nat a specific distance, affecting the Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation (PLR)\nand the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia. We verify the inverse scaling of SN\nluminosity $L$ with Chandrasekhar Mass $M_C$ in a changed $G$ scenario as\npredicted using a semi-analytical model in a recent theoretical study\n\\cite{Wright2018}. Fixing $\\Delta G/G \\approx 0.04$, our model naturally\nresolves the Hubble tension, yielding a best-fit $H_0$ value consistent with\nthe Planck measurement, even without using Planck data. This approach suggests\na potential resolution to the Hubble tension by aligning $H_0$ with\nhigh-redshift CMB measurements.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
