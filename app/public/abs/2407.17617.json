These\nuncertainties, especially the dynamics of a third-party client satellite,\nsignificantly complicate the stabilization task. This paper introduces a novel\nadaptive detumbling method to handle non-rigid satellites with unknown motion\ndynamics (translation and rotation). The distinctive feature of our approach is\nthat we model the non-rigid tumbling satellite as a two-link serial chain with\nunknown stiffness and damping in contrast to previous detumbling research works\nwhich consider the satellite a rigid body. We develop a novel adaptive robotics\napproach to detumble the satellite by using two space tugs as servicer despite\nthe uncertain dynamics in the post-capture case. Notably, the stiffness\nproperties and other physical parameters, including the mass and inertia of the\ntwo links, remain unknown to the servicer. Our proposed method addresses the\nchallenges in detumbling tasks and paves the way for advanced manipulation of\nnon-rigid satellites with uncertain dynamics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2ukdnePprmQtcgWiGOVq-m5lfEKBnAHk0Lu6UWcoab0","pdfSize":"5772108","objectId":"0x6a4e846e99b7b9566572d306c5cf19d54bcc8738c716870484c816a86b4af279","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
