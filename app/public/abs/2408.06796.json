By\nchirping DFT-s-OFDM in the time domain, the proposed waveform maintains the low\npeak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of DFT-s-OFDM. Thanks to full-band\ntransmission and symbols retransmission enabled by chirping and discrete\nFourier transform (DFT) precoding, the proposed waveform can enhance noise\nsuppression of linear minimum mean square error equalization. Its bit error\nrate (BER) upper bound and diversity order are derived using pairwise error\nprobability. Simulation results confirm that the proposed waveform outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art waveforms in terms of BER, output signal-to-noise-ratio,\nand PAPR.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
