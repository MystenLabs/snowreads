While they have been determined by electron scattering\nexperiments for selected stable nuclei, nuclear contacts are largely unknown\nfor unstable nuclei. In this work, we study nuclear contacts for a number of\nnuclei in the vicinity of the doubly magic $^{132}$Sn from the theoretical\nperspective, with special emphasis on unstable nuclei. We find that the\nproton-proton contact generally gets suppressed by the excess neutrons for the\nSn isotopes, resembling the suppression of $\\alpha$-cluster formation reported\nrecently for the same isotopic chain [J. Tanaka $\\textit{et al}.$, Science\n$\\textbf{371}$, 260 (2021)]. This indicates a hidden universal aspect of SRCs\nand $\\alpha$ clustering, two different kinds of nuclear correlations.\nMeanwhile, a linear relation is found between the proton-proton contact and the\nproton number for the $N=82$ isotones. Our results can be helpful for future\nexperimental studies of SRCs in unstable nuclei at advanced facilities\nworldwide.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
