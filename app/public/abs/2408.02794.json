Our first main result\nclassifies these module categories in the case of generic $k$, i.e. $k$ is\nsufficiently large relative to $N$. As $\\mathcal{C}(\\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$ is a\nbraided tensor category, there is a relative tensor product structure on its\ncategory of module categories. In the generic setting we obtain a formula for\nthe relative tensor product rules between the indecomposable module categories.\nOur second main result classifies the indecomposable module categories over\n$\\mathcal{C}(\\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$ for $N\\leq 7$, with no restrictions on $k$.\nIn this non-generic setting, exceptional module categories are obtained. This\nwork relies heavily on previous results by the two authors. In previous\nliterature, module category classification results were known only for\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\\mathfrak{sl}_3$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
