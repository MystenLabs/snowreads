In this work, drawing upon previous studies on the interplay of flavor\nsymmetries with the potential UV completions from a purely bottom-up\nperspective, three well-motivated discrete flavor groups, suitable for\nportraying the leptonic sector as well as the neutrino masses, specifically\n$A_4$, $A_5$ and $S_4$, are explored within this framework, leading to the\ncomprehensive classification of the NP mediators, along with the tree-level\nmatching relations onto dimension-6 SMEFT operators. Particular emphasis is\nplaced on the discrete leptonic directions, for which a phenomenological\nanalysis is carried out in order to constrain various NP mediators, where\nsignificant focus is directed towards the examination of the cLFV operators,\nwhich, for the wide range of applicable cases, offer the leading constraint.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
