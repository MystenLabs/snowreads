For\nexample, they are used as an ingredient in dairy products such as yogurt with\nadded fruit. The dispersed fruit pieces can be described as soft particles with\nviscoelastic material behavior. The continuous phase is represented by fluids\nwith complex flow behavior depending on the formulation. Characterization has\nshown that this can be described by the Herschel-Bulkley model. Since damage to\nfruit pieces is undesirable in industrial transport processes, the potential\nfor damage to fruit pieces during transport of pipes in cross-sectional\nconstrictions is analyzed. The analysis is performed numerically using the\nhomogenized lattice Boltzmann method and validated by an experiment on\nindustrial fruit preparations at pilot plant scale. The results show a strong\ndependence of the damage potential on the (local) Metzner-Reed Reynolds number.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
