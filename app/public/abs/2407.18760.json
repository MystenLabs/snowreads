We describe the attack,\nprovide a proof-of-concept demonstrating its feasibility, and replicate it in\nthe German Corona-Warn-App server application. The proof-of-concept illustrates\nhow a transitive dependency deep within the dependency tree can hijack a class\nfrom a direct dependency and entirely alter its behavior, posing a significant\nsecurity risk to Java applications. The replication on the Corona-Warn-App\ndemonstrates how compromising a small JSON validation library could result in a\ncomplete database takeover.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
