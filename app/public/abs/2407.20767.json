Here, we show that the phenomena previously attributed to the\neffective axion fields have two distinct physical origins. One of them\ncorresponds to the standard axion electrodynamics, while another provides its\ndual-symmetric version having the same symmetry and featuring similar but\ndistinguishable optical properties. We present an example system described by\nthe dual-symmetric modification of axion electrodynamics, derive the key\npredictions and pinpoint experimentally observable distinctions between the two\nversions of axion-type response.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
