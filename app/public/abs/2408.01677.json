In previous methods, however,\nthe 3D scene is only encoded by the MLPs which do not have an explicit 3D\nstructure. To better represent 3D shapes, we introduce a volume encoding to\nexplicitly encode the spatial information. We further design hierarchical\nvolumes to encode the scene structures in multiple scales. The high-resolution\nvolumes capture the high-frequency geometry details since spatially varying\nfeatures could be learned from different 3D points, while the low-resolution\nvolumes enforce the spatial consistency to keep the shape smooth since adjacent\nlocations possess the same low-resolution feature. In addition, we adopt a\nsparse structure to reduce the memory consumption at high-resolution volumes,\nand two regularization terms to enhance results smoothness. This hierarchical\nvolume encoding could be appended to any implicit surface reconstruction method\nas a plug-and-play module, and can generate a smooth and clean reconstruction\nwith more details. Superior performance is demonstrated in DTU, EPFL, and\nBlendedMVS datasets with significant improvement on the standard metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7-6ATMMCD0swQx-rn5KtAftTdopXi0d-T93nu9U4iZM","pdfSize":"20658490"}
