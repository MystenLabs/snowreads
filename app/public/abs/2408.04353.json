Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation on the Heisenberg\nHamiltonian of the two chains, this system can be expressed in terms of\nnon-interacting spinless fermionic quasiparticles. As a result, the Hamiltonian\nof the whole system is expressed as an Anderson model for spin 1/2 fermions\ninteracting with a spin-1/2 impurity. Thus, we study the scattering of\nfermionic quasiparticles (propagating along spin chains) by a pair of localized\nmagnetic impurities. At low temperature, the localized spin $1/2$ magnets are\nshielded by the chain `spins' via the Kondo effect. We calculate the Kondo\ntemperature $T_K$ and derive the temperature dependence of the entropy, the\nspecific heat, the specific heat and the `magnetic susceptibility' of the dot\nfor $T \\gg T_K$. Our results can be generalized to the case of\nanti-ferromagnetic XX chains.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
