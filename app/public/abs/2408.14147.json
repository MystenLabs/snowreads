Although this cryptocurrency is based on a\ndecentralized system, making transaction details freely accessible, making raw\nblockchain data analyzable is not straightforward due to the Bitcoin protocol\nspecificity and data richness. To address the need for an accessible dataset,\nwe present ORBITAAL, the first comprehensive dataset based on temporal graph\nformalism. The dataset covers all Bitcoin transactions from January 2009 to\nJanuary 2021. ORBITAAL provides temporal graph representations of entity-entity\ntransaction networks, snapshots and stream graph. Each transaction value is\ngiven in Bitcoin and US dollar regarding daily-based conversion rate. This\ndataset also provides details on entities such as their global BTC balance and\nassociated public addresses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
