Commonly, one resorts to computing the maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) estimate, when only a point estimate of the parameters is of\ninterest. We apply MAP estimation in the context of structural dynamic models,\nwhere the system response can be described by the frequency response function.\nTo alleviate high computational demands from repeated expensive model calls, we\nutilize a rational polynomial chaos expansion (RPCE) surrogate model that\nexpresses the system frequency response as a rational of two polynomials with\ncomplex coefficients. We propose an extension to an existing sparse Bayesian\nlearning approach for RPCE based on Laplace's approximation for the posterior\ndistribution of the denominator coefficients. Furthermore, we introduce a\nBayesian optimization approach, which allows to adaptively enrich the\nexperimental design throughout the optimization process of MAP estimation.\nThereby, we utilize the expected improvement acquisition function as a means to\nidentify sample points in the input space that are possibly associated with\nlarge objective function values. The acquisition function is estimated through\nMonte Carlo sampling based on the posterior distribution of the expansion\ncoefficients identified in the sparse Bayesian learning process. By combining\nthe sparsity-inducing learning procedure with the sequential experimental\ndesign, we effectively reduce the number of model evaluations in the MAP\nestimation problem. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented methods\non the parameter updating problem of an algebraic two-degree-of-freedom system\nand the finite element model of a cross-laminated timber plate.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mZaR92SmquYJnEdF46HkTN9SN0a2t2_TPL9JmqIqx84","pdfSize":"387753"}
