In the context of wireless networks, the inherently\nunreliable nature of the transmission channel introduces delays and errors that\ncompromise the regularity of updating the global model. Furthermore, limited\nresources and energy consumption of devices are factors that affect FL\nperformance. Therefore, this work proposes a new FL algorithm called FL-E2WS\nthat considers both the requirements of federated training and a wireless\nnetwork within the scope of the Internet of Things. To reduce the energy cost\nof devices, FL-E2WS schedules communication resources to allocate the ideal\nbandwidth and power for the transmission of models under certain device\nselection and uplink resource block allocation, meeting delay requirements,\npower consumption, and packet error rate. The simulation results demonstrate\nthat FL-E2WS reduces energy consumption by up to 70.12% and enhances the\naccuracy of the global model by up to 10.21% compared to the FL algorithms that\nlacks transmission channel knowledge. Additionally, when compared to FL\nversions that scale communication resources, FL-E2WS achieves up to a 38.61%\nreduction in energy consumption and improves the accuracy of the global model\nby up to 1.61%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
