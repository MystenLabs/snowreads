However,\nrecognizing assembly states poses challenges in scalability, since parts are\nfrequently updated, and the robustness to execution errors remains\nunderexplored. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an approach\nbased on representation learning and the novel intermediate-state informed loss\nfunction modification (ISIL). ISIL leverages unlabeled transitions between\nstates and demonstrates significant improvements in clustering and\nclassification performance for all tested architectures and losses. Despite\nbeing trained exclusively on images without execution errors, thorough analysis\non error states demonstrates that our approach accurately distinguishes between\ncorrect states and states with various types of execution errors. The\nintegration of the proposed algorithm can offer meaningful assistance to\nworkers and mitigate unexpected losses due to procedural mishaps in industrial\nsettings.
