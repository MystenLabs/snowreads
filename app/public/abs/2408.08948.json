These modifications influence Higgs\ninteractions via dimension-6 operators of the form $ \\left(\\partial\n|H|^2\\right)^2$ and $|H|^6$, which are generally expected to be of comparable\nsize. This paper discusses a phenomenon of accidental suppression, where the\n$|H|^6$ coupling is significantly smaller than $\\left(\\partial |H|^2\\right)^2$.\nThis suppression, arising from the truncation of the tree-level effective\npotential, lacks a clear symmetry explanation but persists in portal models.\nThis paper aims to inspire further studies on additional instances of\naccidental suppression without symmetry explanations or a general framework to\ncharacterize such suppression. We also discuss constraints, at the HL-LHC and\nfuture colliders, on the Wilson coefficients of the two dimension-6 operators\nfor various benchmark scenarios of the concrete model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J3Ep-5dt8DghAYsS7TIdV-Bmh8e6VQCbb0xstLHLuFc","pdfSize":"2245353"}
