However, the current methods suffer from\ntime-consuming post-processing to deal with noisy segmentation output. Also,\nthey struggle to provide detailed segmentation, which is important for\nfine-grained manipulation of 3D scenes. In this study, we propose\nClick-Gaussian, which learns distinguishable feature fields of two-level\ngranularity, facilitating segmentation without time-consuming post-processing.\nWe delve into challenges stemming from inconsistently learned feature fields\nresulting from 2D segmentation obtained independently from a 3D scene. 3D\nsegmentation accuracy deteriorates when 2D segmentation results across the\nviews, primary cues for 3D segmentation, are in conflict. To overcome these\nissues, we propose Global Feature-guided Learning (GFL). GFL constructs the\nclusters of global feature candidates from noisy 2D segments across the views,\nwhich smooths out noises when training the features of 3D Gaussians. Our method\nruns in 10 ms per click, 15 to 130 times as fast as the previous methods, while\nalso significantly improving segmentation accuracy.
