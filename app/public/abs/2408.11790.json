Downscaling coarse climate model projections to\nfiner resolutions is key in improving risk and uncertainty assessments. This\nwork develops a new approach to rainfall downscaling by integrating statistics,\nphysics, and machine learning and applies it to assess Bangladesh's extreme\nrainfall risk. Our method successfully captures the observed spatial pattern\nand risks associated with extreme rainfall in the present climate. It also\nproduces uncertainty estimates by rapidly downscaling multiple models in a\nfuture climate scenario(s). Our analysis reveals that the risk of extreme\nrainfall is projected to increase throughout Bangladesh mid-century, with the\nhighest risk in the northeast. The daily maximum rainfall at a 100-year return\nperiod is expected to rise by approximately 50 mm per day. However, using\nmultiple climate models also indicates considerable uncertainty in the\nprojected risk.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
