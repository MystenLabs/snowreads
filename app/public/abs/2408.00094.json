Similarly, it is possible to make a gravitational wave detector which\ncan see the quantum noise induced by certain highly squeezed states of the\ngraviton. However, contrary to some recent arguments in the literature,\nobservation of either or both of these signals would not constitute proof or\neven evidence that the gravitational field is quantized. This is a simple\ntechnical statement: a classical gravitational wave can produce the same output\ndata in a detector. Here we explain this result, presented earlier in\narXiv:2308.12988, which is a straightforward extension of an ancient argument\nin quantum optics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
