The essential ingredient in the\ndevelopment of the Hayes Theory is an orders version of Shimura's Main Theorem\non Complex Multiplication. The section on Real Multiplication for orders uses\nvalues of the quantum modular invariant to generate the Hilbert class field of\na rank 2 order contained in the integral closure of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}[T]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
