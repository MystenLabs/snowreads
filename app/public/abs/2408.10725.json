Our result not\nonly extends the border of ABP estimate, but also provides an effective\nsubstitution of Jacobi fields computation in the non-smooth framework, which\nhas potential applications to many problems in non-smooth geometric analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
