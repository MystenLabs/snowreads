We prove that the\nknowledge of a Cauchy data set of solutions of the fractional Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, given on an open nonempty a priori known subset of the manifold\ndetermines both the Riemannian manifold up to an isometry and the potential up\nto the corresponding gauge transformation, under certain geometric assumptions\non the manifold as well as the observation set. Our method of proof is based\non: (i) studying a new variant of the Gel'fand inverse spectral problem without\nthe normalization assumption on the energy of eigenfunctions, and (ii) the\ndiscovery of an entanglement principle for nonlocal equations involving two or\nmore compactly supported functions. Our solution to (i) makes connections to\nantipodal sets as well as local control for eigenfunctions and quantum chaos,\nwhile (ii) requires sharp interpolation results for holomorphic functions. We\nbelieve that both of these results can find applications in other areas of\ninverse problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
