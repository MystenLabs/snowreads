To address\nthis, this study develops time-series models to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a),\nsuspended solids (SS), and turbidity using Sentinel-2 satellite data and Google\nEarth Engine (GEE) in the coastal regions of Hong Kong. Leveraging Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks, the study incorporates\nextensive temporal datasets to enhance prediction accuracy. The models utilize\nspectral data from Sentinel-2, focusing on optically active components, and\ndemonstrate that selected variables closely align with the spectral\ncharacteristics of Chl-a and SS. The results indicate improved predictive\nperformance over previous methods, highlighting the potential for remote\nsensing technology in continuous and comprehensive water quality assessment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xCh1Ui_h6Ap1nuvKyR7ptdzvbj78y26odl6LLLDT3p4","pdfSize":"293390"}
