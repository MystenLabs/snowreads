This toy model\nincorporates an anisotropic fluid distribution that includes a dark matter\ncomponent. We use the minimal geometric deformation scheme within the framework\nof gravitational decoupling to incorporate anisotropy into the pressure profile\nof the stellar system. In this context, we model the temporal constituent of\nthe $\\Theta$-field sector to characterize the contribution of dark matter\nwithin the gravitational matter source. We present an alternative approach to\nstudying anisotropic self-gravitating structures. This approach incorporates\nadditional field sources arising from gravitational decoupling, which act as\nthe dark component. We explicitly verify whether the proposed model satisfies\nall the requirements for describing realistic compact structures in detail. We\nconclude that the modeling of the Einasto density model with the\nAdler-Finch-Skea metric gives rise to the formation of well-behaved and viable\nastrophysical results that can be employed to model the dark matter stellar\nconfigurations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
