Therefore, in\nthis paper, we describe and experimentally validate an exact classical branch\nand bound solver for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)\nproblems that matches these criteria. Our solver leverages cheap-to-implement\nbounds from the literature previously proposed for Ising models, including that\nof Hartwig, Daske, and Kobe from 1984. We detail a variety of techniques from\nhigh-performance computing and operations research used to boost solver\nperformance, including a global variable reordering heuristic, a primal\nheuristic based on simulated annealing, and a truncated computation of the\nrecursive bound. We also outline a number of simple and inexpensive bound\nextrapolation techniques. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis\nof our solver, comparing its performance to state-of-the-art QUBO and MaxCut\nsolvers, and discuss the challenges of a speedup via quantum branch and bound\nbeyond those faced by any quadratic quantum speedup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
