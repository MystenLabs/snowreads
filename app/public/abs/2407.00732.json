This model aims to explain\nthe mass hierarchy of the third family quark by introducing a vector-like quark\n(VLQ) partner for each quark. In this model, we introduce $\\mathrm{SU(2)_L}$\nand $\\mathrm{SU(2)_R}$ Higgs doublets. We derive explicitly the Lagrangian for\nthe quark sector, Higgs sector, and kinetic terms of the gauge fields, starting\nfrom the Lagrangian, which is invariant under $\\mathrm{SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R\n\\times U(1)_{Y'}}$ gauge symmetry. At each stage of the symmetry breaking, we\npresent the Lagrangian with the remaining gauge symmetry. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of Higgs ($h$) and\n$Z$-boson in the interaction with the top, heavy top, bottom, and heavy bottom\nquark.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
