However,\nforeground contamination poses challenges for detecting this signal, and image\nrecovery will heavily rely on effective mitigation methods. We introduce\n\\texttt{SERENEt}, a deep-learning framework designed to recover the 21-cm\nsignal from SKA-Low's foreground-contaminated observations, enabling the\ndetection of ionized (HII) and neutral (HI) regions during reionization.\n\\texttt{SERENEt} can recover the signal distribution with an average accuracy\nof 75 per cent at the early stages ($\\overline{x}_\\mathrm{HI}\\simeq0.9$) and up\nto 90 per cent at the late stages of reionization\n($\\overline{x}_\\mathrm{HI}\\simeq0.1$). Conversely, HI region detection starts\nat 92 per cent accuracy, decreasing to 73 per cent as reionization progresses.\nBeyond improving image recovery, \\texttt{SERENEt} provides cylindrical power\nspectra with an average accuracy exceeding 93 per cent throughout the\nreionization period. We tested \\texttt{SERENEt} on a 10-degree field-of-view\nsimulation, consistently achieving better and more stable results when prior\nmaps were provided. Notably, including prior information about HII region\nlocations improved 21-cm signal recovery by approximately 10 per cent. This\ncapability was demonstrated by supplying \\texttt{SERENEt} with ionizing source\ndistribution measurements, showing that high-redshift galaxy surveys of similar\nobservation fields can optimize foreground mitigation and enhance 21-cm image\nconstruction.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GZRHF0_NdMeIN7Uw3QDOdfQbe5m5gFoqpaMIdISI5tI","pdfSize":"6957211"}
