By integrating photon-assisted\ntunneling (PAT) technique with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we achieve resonance\ntransitions between the predefined energy levels of the atom, thereby enabling\nfurther precise control of the atom's dynamics. We observe that such\nphoton-like resonance can induce a transition from a localized state to atomic\nRabi oscillation between two wells, or effectively reduce tunneling as\nmanifested by a quantum beating phenomenon. Moreover, such resonance\ntransitions have the potential to induce spin flipping in a spin-orbit coupled\natom. Additionally, the SOC-mediated transition from multiphoton resonance to\nfundamental resonance and the SOC-induced resonance suppression are also\ndiscovered. In these cases, the analytical results of the effective coupling\ncoefficients of the resonance transition derived from a four-level model can\naccount for the entire dynamics, demonstrating surprisingly good agreement with\nthe numerically exact results based on the realistic continuous model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
