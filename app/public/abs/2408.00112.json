However, due to sperm's slim shape, their\nsegmentation suffers from large context loss and feature distortion due to\nbounding box cropping and resizing during ROI Align. Moreover, morphology\nmeasurement of sperm tail is demanding because of the long and curved shape and\nits uneven width. This paper presents automated techniques to measure sperm\nmorphology parameters automatically and quantitatively. A novel attention-based\ninstance-aware part segmentation network is designed to reconstruct lost\ncontexts outside bounding boxes and to fix distorted features, by refining\npreliminary segmented masks through merging features extracted by feature\npyramid network. An automated centerline-based tail morphology measurement\nmethod is also proposed, in which an outlier filtering method and endpoint\ndetection algorithm are designed to accurately reconstruct tail endpoints.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed network outperformed the\nstate-of-the-art top-down RP-R-CNN by 9.2% [AP]_vol^p, and the proposed\nautomated tail morphology measurement method achieved high measurement\naccuracies of 95.34%,96.39%,91.2% for length, width and curvature,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OtrwaOjOD_9UIw4d70_eDEfQtA-jOXqXTfdzEGajtGQ","pdfSize":"6289755","txDigest":"Gy1mzEb5RAqbbjbYQJ1TBzy1eqTnvhFstJteLBc794T1","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
