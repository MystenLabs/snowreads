In contrast, the turbine controller\ncalibrations generally remain constant, leading to suboptimal performance and\npotential stability issues. The calibration of wind turbine controller\nparameters is therefore of high interest. To this end, several adaptive control\nschemes based on extremum seeking control (ESC) have been proposed in the\nliterature. These schemes have been successfully employed to maximize turbine\npower capture by optimization of the $K\\omega^2$-type torque controller. In\npractice, ESC is performed using electrical generator power, which is easily\nobtained. This paper analyses the feasibility of torque gain optimization using\naerodynamic and generator powers. It is shown that, unlike aerodynamic power,\nusing the generator power objective limits the dither frequency to lower\nvalues, reducing the convergence rate unless the phase of the demodulation ESC\nsignal is properly adjusted. A frequency-domain analysis of both systems shows\ndistinct phase behavior, impacting ESC performance. A solution is proposed by\nconstructing an objective measure based on an estimate of the aerodynamic\npower.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
