We introduce an integrated\nframework that harnesses the advantages of different models to attain an\noptimal outcome. More specifically, we fuse the learned features from\nconvolutional and transformer models for prediction, and we view this approach\nas an ensemble technique to enhance model performance. Our experiments on polyp\nsegmentation reveal that the proposed architecture surpasses other top models,\nexhibiting improved learning capacity and resilience.
