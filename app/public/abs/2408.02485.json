We show that the generating\nfunctor for this action is exact. We then produce a categorical Heisenberg\naction on the categories $\\mathcal{O}$ and show it is the same as one\nconstructed by Shan and Vasserot. Finally, we reduce modulo a large prime $p$.\nWe show that the functors constituting the action of the positive half of the\nHeisenberg algebra send simple objects to semisimple ones, and we describe\nthese semisimple objects.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
