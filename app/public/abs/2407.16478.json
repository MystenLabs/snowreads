Increasing the number of antennas\nrequires a growth in connections between a remote radio head (RRH) and a\nbaseband unit (BBU). Therefore, the traffic load between RRH and BBU has to\ngrow, and the compression of interconnection between them becomes a serious\nproblem. In this paper, we propose a compression scheme to reduce the bitrate\nof the fronthaul interface that connects BBU and RRU. Then we justify\ncompression block size and mantissa length to guarantee the required error\nvector magnitude (EVM). The knowledge of propagation channel sparsity and the\ncondition number of the channel matrix helps to achieve higher compression\nratios without performance loss. Simulation results with a realistic\npropagation channel are provided to confirm theoretical derivations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
