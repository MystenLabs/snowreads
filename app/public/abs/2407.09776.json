The problem can arise when visualising\nevolutionary data, for example, because popular phylogenetic network\nreconstruction methods such as Neighbor-Net are distance-based and thus\ninevitably produce undirected graphs. The complexity of C-Orientation remains\nopen for many classes C, including binary tree-child networks, and practical\nmethods are still lacking. In this paper, we propose an exponential but\npractically efficient FPT algorithm for C-Orientation, which is parameterised\nby the reticulation number and the maximum size of minimal basic cycles used in\nthe computation. We also present a very fast heuristic for Tree-Child\nOrientation. To evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed methods, we\ncompared their accuracy and execution time for Tree-Child Orientation with\nthose of an exponential time C-orientation algorithm from the literature. Our\nexperiments show that the proposed exact algorithm is significantly faster than\nthe state-of-the-art exponential time algorithm. The proposed heuristic runs\neven faster but the accuracy decreases as the reticulation number increases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
