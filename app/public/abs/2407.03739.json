By examining coupling minimization as a critical aspect\nof advanced systems engineering practices, we aim to provide a scholarly\nexploration, blending theoretical insights with practical applications. The\nobjective is to equip systems architects with analytical tools integrated\nwithin their Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) environment for exploring\nthe design space of component interactions, facilitating the identification of\noptimal system architectures.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
