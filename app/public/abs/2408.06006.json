To this end, the Harmonic State-Space (HSS) model of a\ngeneric power system is formulated by combining the HSS models of the resources\nand the grid in closed-loop configuration. The HSS model of the resources is\nobtained from the Linear Time Periodic (LTP) models of the CIDER components\ntransformed to frequency domain using Fourier theory and Toeplitz matrices.\nNotably, the HSS of a CIDER is capable of representing the coupling between\nharmonic frequencies in detail. The HSS model of the grid is derived from the\ndynamic equations of the individual branch and shunt elements. The system\nmatrix of the HSS models on power-system or resource level is employed for\neigenvalue analysis in the context of HSA. A sensitivity analysis of the\neigenvalue loci w.r.t. changes in model parameters, and a classification of\neigenvalues into control-design variant, control-design invariant, and design\ninvariant eigenvalues is proposed. A case of harmonic instability is identified\nby the HSA and validated via Time-Domain Simulations (TDS) in Simulink.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
