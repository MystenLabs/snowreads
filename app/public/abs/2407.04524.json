By introducing two geometric relations, we innovatively\nestablish an equivalent regularized sharp-interface model and further construct\nan energy-stable parametric finite element algorithm for this equivalent model.\nWe provide a detailed proof of the energy stability of the numerical scheme,\naddressing a gap in the relevant theory. Additionally, we develop another\nstructure-preserving parametric finite element scheme that can preserve both\narea conservation and energy stability. Finally, we present several numerical\nsimulations to show accuracy and efficiency as well as some\nstructure-preserving properties of the proposed numerical methods. More\nimportantly, extensive numerical simulations reveal that our schemes provide\nbetter mesh quality and are more suitable for long-term computations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
