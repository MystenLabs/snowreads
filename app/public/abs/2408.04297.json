Especially when multiple remote users connect, a large\nshared space is necessary for people to maintain their personal space while\ncollaborating, but the existing simple intersection method leads to the\ncreation of narrow shared spaces as the number of remote spaces increases. To\nrobustly align to the host space even as the number of remote spaces increases,\nwe propose a spatial affordance-aware interactable subspace allocation\nalgorithm. The key concept of our approach is to consider the perceivable and\ninteractable areas separately, where every user views the same mutual space,\nbut each remote user has a different interactable subspace, considering their\nlocation and spatial affordance. We conducted an evaluation with 900 space\ncombinations, varying the number of remote spaces as two, four, and six, and\nresults show our method outperformed in securing wide interactable mutual space\nand instantiating users compared to the other spatial matching methods. Our\nwork enables multiple clients from diverse remote locations to access the AR\nhost's space, allowing them to interact directly with the table, wall, or floor\nby aligning their physical subspaces within a connected mutual space.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
