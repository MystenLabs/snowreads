Often these systems build on next-generation\nhardware, and evaluation in realistic physical testbeds is out of reach. Even\nwhen physical testbeds are available, visibility into essential system aspects\nis a challenge in modern systems where system performance depends on often\nsub-$\\mu s$ interactions between HW and SW components. Existing tools such as\nperformance counters, logging, and distributed tracing provide aggregate or\nsampled information, but remain insufficient for understanding individual\nrequests in-depth. In this paper, we explore a fundamentally different approach\nto enable in-depth understanding of cloud system behavior at the software and\nhardware level, with (almost) arbitrarily fine-grained visibility. Our proposal\nis to run cloud systems in detailed full-system simulations, configure the\nsimulators to collect detailed events without affecting the system, and finally\nassemble these events into end-to-end system traces that can be analyzed by\nexisting distributed tracing tools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Performance","Computing Research Repository/Operating Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oShsJTc_PkOqynciu9OnLV_7iS_m_FrhxmpkW8MJT1U","pdfSize":"680392"}
