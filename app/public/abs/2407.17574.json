We also study the influence that partial\nsymmetries of a given space may have on the behavior of pointwise\nsemi-Lipschitz functions defined on it. Furthermore, we are interested in\ncharacterizing the pointwise semi-Lipschitz structure of an asymmetric space in\nterms of real-valued pointwise semi-Lipschitz functions defined on it. By using\ntwo algebras of functions naturally associated to our spaces of pointwise\nreal-valued semi-Lipschitz functions, we are able to provide two Banach-Stone\ntype results in this context. In fact, these results are obtained as\nconsequences of a general Banach-Stone type theorem of topological nature,\nstated for abstract functional spaces, which is quite flexible and can be\napplied to many spaces of continuous functions over metric and asymmetric\nspaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
