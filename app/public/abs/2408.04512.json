Our hypotheses include\ntwo assumptions: 1) $M$ admits a function that is strictly plurisubharmonic\nacting on $(p_0,q_0)$-forms in a neighborhood of $b\\Omega$ for some fixed $0\n\\leq p_0 \\leq n$, $1 \\leq q_0 \\leq n$, or $M$ is a K\\\"ahler metric whose\nholomorphic bisectional curvature acting $(p,q)$-forms is positive; and 2)\nthere exists a family of vector fields $T_\\epsilon$ that are transverse to the\nboundary $b\\Omega$ and generate one forms, which when applied to $(p,q)$-forms,\n$0 \\leq p \\leq n$ and $q_0 \\leq q \\leq n$, satisfy a \"weak form\" of the\ncompactness estimate.\n  We also provide examples and applications of our main theorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
