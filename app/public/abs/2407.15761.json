A recently developed interference-based\nprepare-and-measure quantum CKA possesses the advantages of\nmeasurement-device-independence, namely, being immune to side-channels from the\ndetector side. Besides, it achieves good key rate performance, especially for\nhigh-loss channels, due to the use of single photon interference. Meanwhile,\nseveral fully passive QKD schemes have been proposed, which eliminate all side\nchannels from the source modulation side. We extend the fully passive idea to\nan interference-based CKA, which has a high level of implementation security\nfor many-user communication.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
