The primary focus of these studies is to examine the\ndose-response relationship, which is depicted by the (conditional) probability\nof an endpoint across the dose (toxin) levels. Standard parametric approaches,\nlimited in terms of the response distribution and/or the dose-response\nrelationship, hinder reliable uncertainty quantification in this context. We\npropose nonparametric mixture models that are built from dose-dependent\nstick-breaking process priors, leveraging the continuation-ratio logits\nrepresentation of the multinomial distribution to formulate the mixture kernel.\nWe further elaborate the modeling approach, amplifying the mixture models with\nan overdispersed kernel which offers enhanced control of variability. We\nconduct a simulation study to demonstrate the benefits of both the discrete\nnonparametric mixing structure and the overdispersed kernel in delivering\ncoherent uncertainty quantification. Further illustration is provided with\ndifferent forms of risk assessment, using data from a toxicity experiment on\nthe effects of ethylene glycol.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
