Along the way we derive\nsome restrictions on the geometry of the conic-line arrangement, induced by the\nfreeness property. We show the same behaviour with respect to the\ndeletion-addition of a smooth conic extends to general free reduced curves in\nthe complex projective plane.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
