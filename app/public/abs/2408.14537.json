In this paper, we\nconstrain a phenomenological fluid model using recent cosmic microwave\nbackground likelihoods based on Planck NPIPE data alongside baryonic acoustic\noscillations and supernovae data from Pantheon+. Exploiting the enhanced\nconstraining power of the datasets, we introduce and study an extended version\nof the NEDE fluid model in which the equation of state parameter\n$w_\\mathrm{NEDE}$, characterizing the post-phase transition fluid, is allowed\nto evolve with non-vanishing derivatives ${d}w_\\mathrm{NEDE}/d\\ln a$ and\n${d^2}w_\\mathrm{NEDE}/{d}(\\ln a)^2$. Our results indicate that data is\ncompatible with a rather simple time dependence that could arise from a mixture\nof radiation and a stiff fluid. With the updated datasets, the base and\nextended models still show a significant reduction of the DMAP tension from\n$6.3 \\sigma$ in $\\Lambda$CDM down to $3.5\\sigma$ with a small simultaneous\nreduction of the $S_8$ tension, slightly improving over recent findings for the\naxion-like early dark energy model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
