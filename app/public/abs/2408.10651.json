We explore\na generalisation of this result to edge-coloured graphs. Let $G$ be an\nedge-coloured graph on $n$ vertices. The minimum colour degree $\\delta^c(G)$ of\n$G$ is the largest integer $k$ such that, for every vertex $v \\in V(G)$, there\nare at least $k$ distinct colours on edges incident to $v$. We show that if\n$\\delta^c(G) \\ge (5/6 + \\varepsilon) n$, then $G$ has a spanning set of\nvertex-disjoint rainbow triangles. On the other hand, we find an example\nshowing the bound should be at least $5n/7$. We also discuss a related tiling\nproblems on digraphs, which may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
