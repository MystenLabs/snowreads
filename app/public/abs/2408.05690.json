The approach relies on combining a target\nvariable with different context variables and use auto-encoders (AEs) to learn\nreconstructions of the combined inputs. The objective is to obtain agreement\namong pairs of AEs which are trained on related but different inputs and for\nwhich they are forced to find common ground. The training process is set up as\na \"conversation\" where the models take turns at producing a prediction\n(speaking) and reconciling own predictions with the output of the other AE\n(listening), until an agreement is reached. This leads to a new way of\nconstraining the complexity of the data representation generated by the AE.\nUnlike standard regularization whose strength needs to be decided by the\ndesigner, the proposed mutual regularization uses the partner network to detect\nand amend the lack of generality of the learned representation of the data. The\nintegration of alternative perspectives enhances the de-noising capacity of a\nsingle AE and allows us to discover new regularities in financial time-series\nwhich can be converted into profitable trading strategies.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
