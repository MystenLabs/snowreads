As\nwell as reducing the computational domain in the same manner as the traditional\nWPBC, the proposed scheme further reduces the degrees of freedom at the\nwaveguide ports, simplifies the implementation and seamlessly provides\npost-processing results such as the reflected power in each waveguide mode. The\nboundary condition is thoroughly derived, and numerical examples are used as a\nsupport for the discussion on topics such as the needed number of modes to be\nemployed at a waveguide port. Finally, a nanograting-based plasmonic sensor is\nanalysed to illustrate further possibilities of the scheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4tAQbyLgJD6kQzpSgR-R0e5l7QGO1NxTgQUEoJx8UPg","pdfSize":"2362496","objectId":"0xa73e5c37d42f5c2a0f877c1adbd3eddd53c8af89d318d8998d967eba65a73bdb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
