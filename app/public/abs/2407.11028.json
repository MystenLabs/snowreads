The\nunconventional observation of a larger portion of the deposited heat being\ndetected first in the underlying CoSb$_3$ layer supports the picture of\nballistic transport of the photo-excited electrons from gold to the underlying\nlayer. The lattice expansion recorded by x-ray scattering allows accounting for\nthe energy deposition and heat transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
