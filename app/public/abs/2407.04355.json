However, a major challenge lies in the reliance on\nphysical parameters: Parameter estimations vary widely across the literature,\nand the physical properties themselves are inherently subject-specific. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel data-driven method that leverages hypernetworks to\nlearn the tissue-dependent elasticity parameters of an elastic regularizer.\nNotably, our approach facilitates the estimation of patient-specific parameters\nwithout the need to retrain the network. We evaluate our method on three\npublicly available 2D and 3D lung CT and cardiac MR datasets. We find that with\nour proposed subject-specific tissue-dependent regularization, a higher\nregistration quality is achieved across all datasets compared to using a global\nregularizer.
