This formalism\naccommodates an arbitrary number of molecules $N$, excitations and internal\nvibronic structures, making it ideal for investigating molecular polariton\nprocesses beyond the $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit (i.e., accounting for finite\n$N$ effects), both numerically and analytically. Here, we employ this formalism\nto rigorously derive radiative pumping and vibrational relaxation rates, and\nestablish the fundamental differences between these mechanisms. We show that\nradiative pumping is the emission from incoherent excitons and divide its rate\ninto transmitted and re-absorbed components. On the other hand, the vibrational\nrelaxation rate in the weak linear vibronic coupling regime is composed of two\ncomponents: a $\\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ contribution already accounted for by\nradiative pumping, and a $\\mathcal{O}(1/N^2)$ contribution from a second-order\nprocess in the \\textit{single}-molecule light-matter coupling that we identify\nas a polariton-assisted Raman scattering. We demonstrate that vibrational\nrelaxation via this scattering is enhanced when the energy difference between\nthe emission and the lower polariton transition corresponds to the vibrational\nexcitation created in the Raman process.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
