The\nexperiment was aimed at the production of a superheavy element with $Z\\ge 114$\nby irradiating an actinide target with a beam heavier than $^{48}$Ca. Produced\nLv ions were separated from the unwanted beam and nuclear reaction products\nusing the Berkeley Gas-filled Separator and implanted into a newly commissioned\nfocal plane detector system. Two decay chains were observed and assigned to the\ndecay of $^{290}$Lv. The production cross section was measured to be\n$\\sigma_{\\rm prod}=0.44(^{+58}_{-28})$~pb at a center-of-target center-of-mass\nenergy of 220(3)~MeV. This represents the first published measurement of the\nproduction of a superheavy element near the `Island-of-Stability', with a beam\nof $^{50}$Ti and is an essential precursor in the pursuit of searching for new\nelements beyond $Z=118$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
