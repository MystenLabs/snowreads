For tight-binding Hamiltonians, the substitution\nresults in a set of (Peierls) phases that are usually calculated from the\nmagnetic vector potential. As the potential is not unique, a convenient gauge\ncan be chosen to fit the geometry and simplify calculations. However, if the\nmagnetic field is non-uniform, finding a convenient gauge is challenging. In\nthis work we propose to bypass the vector potential determination by\ncalculating the Peierls phases exclusively from the gauge-invariant magnetic\nflux. The phases can be assigned following a graphic algorithm reminiscent of\nthe paper and pencil game \"dots and boxes\". We showcase the method\nimplementation by calculating the interference phenomenon in a modified\nAharonov-Bohm ring and propose a phase assignation alternative to the Landau\ngauge to reproduce the Half Integer Quantum Hall Effect in graphene. A\nnon-uniform magnetic field case is addressed by considering a multi-domain\nChern insulator to study the effects of domain walls in resistance and current\nquantization. It is found that adding decoherence and a finite temperature into\nthe model results in quantized resistances that are in good agreement with\nexperiments made with multi-domain intrinsic topological insulators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
