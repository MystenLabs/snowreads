The input to the method is the Poincare map orbits of\nfield lines and the output is a separation into three classes: islands, chaotic\nlayers, and invariant tori. The classification is tested numerically for the\ncase of a toy model of a perturbed tokamak represented initially in its\ngeometric coordinates. The persistent $H_1$ data is demonstrated to be\nsufficient to distinguish magnetic islands from the other orbits. When combined\nwith persistent $H_0$ information, describing the average spacing between\npoints on the Poincare section, the larger chaotic orbits can then be separated\nfrom very thin chaotic layers and invariant tori. It is then shown that if\nstraight field line coordinates exist for a nearby integrable field\nconfiguration, the performance of the classification can be improved by\ntransforming into this natural coordinate system. The focus is the application\nto toroidal magnetic confinement but the method is sufficiently general to\napply to generic $1\\frac{1}{2}$d Hamiltonian systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sktHWWIDv4EIpllX6mrUyWhzalq0UGx34NxeMzL6N7A","pdfSize":"19228327"}
