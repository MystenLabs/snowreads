One such notion is Ezra Millers notion of finite\nencodability, which roughly states that a persistence module can be obtained by\npulling back a finite dimensional persistence module over a finite poset. From\nthe perspective of homological algebra, finitely encodable persistence have an\ninconvenient property: They do not form an abelian category. Here, we prove\nthat if one restricts to such persistence modules which can be constructed in\nterms of topologically closed and sufficiently constructible (piecewise linear,\nsemi-algebraic, etc.) upsets then abelianity can be restored.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
