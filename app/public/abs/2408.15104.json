In the paper, we find that the\nblack hole evaporation interpreted by the island formula can be understood in\nthe language of approximate quantum error correction. Furthermore, the Page\ntransition, as a special property of the Page curve, should be understood as\nthe property of approximate quantum error correction itself, i.e. a general\nclass of quantum systems under certain conditions from approximate quantum\nerror correction can also exhibit phenomenon similar to the Page transition.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
