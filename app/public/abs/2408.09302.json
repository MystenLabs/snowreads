The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz\nequations for a related coherent system, described by a dissipation-projected\nHamiltonian of the original system. We find explicit analytic expressions for\nthe dressed energies of $XXX$ and $XXZ$ models with effective, i.e., induced by\nthe dissipation, diagonal boundary fields, which are U(1) invariant, as well as\nXXZ and XYZ models with effective non-diagonal boundary fields. In all cases,\nthe dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion\nrelation, which strongly modifies the nonequilibrium steady state spectrum with\nrespect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. This leads, in\nparticular, to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression\nin the NESS spectrum of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states\nlocalized at the boundaries.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
