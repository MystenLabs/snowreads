The JSI quantifies the\nthermodynamic effect of the solvent simultaneously accommodating the solutes,\ngeneralizing the typical notion of the hydrophobic interaction. We present a\nformal definition of the JSI within the framework of the mixture expansion,\ndemonstrate that this definition is equivalent to the SII between rigid\nsolutes, and propose a method, partially-connected molecular dynamics, which\nallows one to compute the interaction with existing free energy algorithms. We\nalso compare the JSI to the more natural generalization of the hydrophobic\ninteraction, the indirect solvent-mediated interaction, and argue that JSI is a\nmore useful quantity for studying solute binding thermodynamics. Direct\ncalculation of the JSI may prove useful in developing our understanding of\nsolvent effects in self-assembly, protein aggregation, and protein folding, for\nwhich the isolation of the JSI from the conformational component of the SII\nbecomes important due to the intra-species flexibility.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"baUObPB1j22jt6XsYtGonQdMC9WERTn4fe-_F17FzxQ","pdfSize":"3569342"}
