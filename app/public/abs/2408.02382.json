This study introduces a semi-supervised segmentation model for LULC\nprediction using high-resolution satellite images with a vast diversity of data\ndistributions in different areas of India. Our approach ensures a robust\ngeneralization across different types of buildings, roads, trees, and water\nbodies within these distinct areas. We propose a modified Cross Pseudo\nSupervision framework to train image segmentation models on sparsely labelled\ndata. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of the famous 'Cross\nPseudo Supervision' technique for semi-supervised learning, specifically\ntackling the challenges of training segmentation models on noisy satellite\nimage data with sparse and inaccurate labels. This comprehensive approach\nsignificantly enhances the accuracy and utility of LULC mapping, providing\nvaluable insights for urban and resource planning applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CtAJ3gl255pQPQxQH6ciX8w8P3-sF_bQbu9VP4odTeA","pdfSize":"469585"}
