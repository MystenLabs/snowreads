As a consequence, we are able to define Adams\noperations and absolute cohomology for smooth algebraic stacks satisfying this\nhypothesis. We also obtain a comparison of the absolute cohomology with the\nequivariant higher Chow groups in certain special cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
