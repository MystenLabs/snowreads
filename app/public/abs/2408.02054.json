This advanced model serves as a real-time tool that recommends the\nideal denoise steps for generating high-quality images efficiently. It is\ndesigned to work seamlessly with the Diffusion model, ensuring that images are\nproduced with superior quality in the shortest possible time. Although our\nexplanation focuses on the DDIM scheduler, the methodology is adaptable and can\nbe applied to various other schedulers like Euler, Euler Ancestral, Heun, DPM2\nKarras, UniPC, and more. This model allows our customers to conserve costly\ncomputing resources by executing the fewest necessary denoising steps to\nachieve optimal quality in the produced images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
