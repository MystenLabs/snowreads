To address these issues, we\npropose a single-point supervised high-resolution dynamic network (SSHD-Net).\nIn contrast to existing methods, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection\nperformance using only single-point supervision. Specifically, we first design\na high-resolution cross-feature extraction module (HCEM), that achieves\nbi-directional feature interaction through stepped feature cascade channels\n(SFCC). It balances network depth and feature resolution to maintain deep IR\nsmall-target information. Secondly, the effective integration of global and\nlocal features is achieved through the dynamic coordinate fusion module (DCFM),\nwhich enhances the anti-interference ability in complex backgrounds. In\naddition, we introduce the high-resolution multilevel residual module (HMRM) to\nenhance the semantic information extraction capability. Finally, we design the\nadaptive target localization detection head (ATLDH) to improve detection\naccuracy. Experiments on the publicly available datasets NUDT-SIRST and\nIRSTD-1k demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other SOTA\nmethods, our method can achieve better detection performance with only a single\npoint of supervision.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
