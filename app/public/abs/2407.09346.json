Due to data-driven approaches, SVS performs a music score-to-waveform\nmapping; however, the direct mapping limits control, such as being able to only\nsynthesize in the language or the singers present in the labeled singing\ndatasets. As collecting large singing datasets labeled with music scores is an\nexpensive task, we investigate an alternative approach by decomposing the SVS\nsystem and inferring different singing voice features. We decompose the SVS\nsystem into three-stage modules of linguistic, pitch contour, and synthesis, in\nwhich singing voice features such as linguistic content, F0, voiced/unvoiced,\nsinger embeddings, and loudness are directly inferred from audio. Through this\ndecomposed framework, we show that we can alleviate the labeled dataset\nrequirements, adapt to different languages or singers, and inpaint the lyrical\ncontent of singing voices. Our investigations show that the framework has the\npotential to reach state-of-the-art in SVS, even though the model has\nadditional functionality and improved flexibility. The comprehensive analysis\nof our investigated framework's current capabilities sheds light on the ways\nthe research community can achieve a flexible and multifunctional SVS system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
