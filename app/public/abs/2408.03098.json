Providing an accurate tracking\ncontrol design with implementable torque input for these robots is a complex\ntopic. This paper presents two approaches to solve this problem. The approaches\nconsider joint space tracking control design in the presence of nonlinear\nuncertain torques caused by external vibration and payload variation. The\nproperties of the uncertain torques are used in both approaches. The first\napproach is based on the boundedness property, while the second approach\nconsiders the differentiability and boundedness together. The controllers\nderived from each approach differ from the perspectives of accuracy, control\neffort, and disturbance properties. A Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to\nguarantee the stability of the control design in each case. Simulation results\nvalidate the approaches and demonstrate the performance of the controllers. The\nderived controllers show stable results at the cost of the mentioned\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
