Our innovative approach involves a dual-stage framework that\nenhances 3D occupancy and flow predictions by incorporating adaptive forward\nview transformation and flow modeling. Initially, we independently train the\noccupancy model, followed by flow prediction using sequential frame\nintegration. Our method combines regression with classification to address\nscale variations in different scenes, and leverages predicted flow to warp\ncurrent voxel features to future frames, guided by future frame ground truth.\nExperimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate significant\nimprovements in accuracy and robustness, showcasing the effectiveness of our\napproach in real-world scenarios. Our single model based on Swin-Base ranks\nsecond on the public leaderboard, validating the potential of our method in\nadvancing autonomous car perception systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
