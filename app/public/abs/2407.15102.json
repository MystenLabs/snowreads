However, brute-force approaches to\nquantum state tomography would become impractical for large systems, as the\nrequired resources scale exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore a\nmachine learning approach and report an experimental demonstration of\nreconstructing quantum states based on neural network generative models with an\narray of programmable superconducting transmon qubits. In particular, we\nexperimentally prepare the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and random states\nup to five qubits and demonstrate that the machine learning approach can\nefficiently reconstruct these states with the number of required experimental\nsamples scaling linearly with system size. Our results experimentally showcase\nthe intriguing potential for exploiting machine learning techniques in\nvalidating and characterizing complex quantum devices, offering a valuable\nguide for the future development of quantum technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
