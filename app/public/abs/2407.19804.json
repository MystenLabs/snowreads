In this context, imputation is a\ncommon practice, driven by the hope that accurate imputations will enhance\npredictions. However, recent theoretical and empirical studies indicate that\nsimple constant imputation can be consistent and competitive. This empirical\nstudy aims at clarifying if and when investing in advanced imputation methods\nyields significantly better predictions. Relating imputation and predictive\naccuracies across combinations of imputation and predictive models on 20\ndatasets, we show that imputation accuracy matters less i) when using\nexpressive models, ii) when incorporating missingness indicators as\ncomplementary inputs, iii) matters much more for generated linear outcomes than\nfor real-data outcomes. Interestingly, we also show that the use of the\nmissingness indicator is beneficial to the prediction performance, even in MCAR\nscenarios. Overall, on real-data with powerful models, improving imputation\nonly has a minor effect on prediction performance. Thus, investing in better\nimputations for improved predictions often offers limited benefits.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
