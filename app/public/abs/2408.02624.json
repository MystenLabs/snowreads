We\nexplore existence, uniqueness, comparison property, and stability properties of\nsolutions to inhomogeneous Dirichlet problems associated with certain nonlinear\nnonlocal operators on $Z$. We also establish interior regularity of solutions\nwhen the inhomogeneity data is in an $L^q$-class for sufficiently large $q>1$,\nand verify a Kellogg-type property when the inhomogeneity data vanishes and the\nDirichlet data is continuous.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
