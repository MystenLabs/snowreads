The metric and mass functions and\ncorrections to the Reissner--Nordstr\\\"{o}m solution are obtained. Black hole\nsolutions can have one or two horizons. Thermodynamics and phase transitions of\nmagnetically charged black holes in Anti-de Sitter spacetime are investigated.\nThe first law of black hole thermodynamics is formulated and the generalized\nSmarr relation is proofed. By calculating the Gibbs free energy and heat\ncapacity we study the black hole stability. Zero-order (reentrant),\nfirst-order, and second-order phase transitions are analysed. The\nJoule--Thomson expansion is considered showing the cooling and heating phase\ntransitions. It was shown that the principles of causality and unitarity are\nsatisfied in the model under consideration.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
