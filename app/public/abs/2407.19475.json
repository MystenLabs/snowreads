The immediate and objective recognition of it is a great of\nimportance in order to attain a reliable and unbiased healthcare system. In\nthis work, we elaborate electrocardiography signals revealing the existence of\nvariations in pain perception among different demographic groups. We exploit\nthis insight by introducing a novel multi-task neural network for automatic\npain estimation utilizing the age and the gender information of each\nindividual, and show its advantages compared to other approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
