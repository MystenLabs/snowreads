This\nfunction is shown to satisfy strong rigidity properties and is closely\nconnected via the Berezin transform to the square of the Kerzman-Stein\noperator. Explicit example calculations are presented. For ellipses, a new\nasymptotically sharp lower bound on the norm of $\\bf{C}$ is produced.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EB-igv8ZmaLSTi3CvV_2Lk0fEb9v8eTBQwz2ByDD1dk","pdfSize":"661616"}
