The HPCA paper presented\na detailed field data analysis of faults observed at scale in DDR4 DRAM from\ntwo different memory vendors. This analysis included a breakdown of fault\npatterns or modes. Upon further study of the data, we found a bug in how we\ndecoded errors based on the logged row-bank-column address. Specifically, we\nfound that some errors that occurred in one column were mis-interpreted as\noccurring in two non-adjacent columns. As a result of this, some single-bit\nfaults were misclassified as partial-row faults (i.e., two-bit faults).\nSimilarly, some single-column faults were misclassified as two-column faults.\nThe result of these misclassification errors is that the proportion of\nsingle-bit faults is higher than reported in the paper, with a commensurate\nreduction in the fraction of certain types of multi-bit faults. These\nmisclassifications also slightly change the Failure In Time (FIT) per DRAM\ndevice values presented in the original paper. In this corrigendum, we provide\nan updated version of the relevant tables and figures and point out the\ncorresponding page numbers and references in the original paper that they\nreplace.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
