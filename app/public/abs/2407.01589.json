A technique\ntermed \"fixed particle per cell (FPPC)\" was employed, which enforces a fixed\nnumber of simulator particles across all computational cells. The proposed\ntechnique eliminates the need for real-time adjustment of particle weights\nduring simulation, reducing calculation time. Using the SPARTA solver,\nsimulations of rarefied gas flow in a micromixer and rarefied supersonic\nairflow around a cylinder were conducted to validate the proposed technique.\nResults demonstrate that applying the FPPC technique effectively reduces\ncomputational costs while yielding results comparable to conventional DSMC\nimplementations. Additionally, the application of local grid refinement coupled\nwith the FPPC technique was investigated. The results show that integrating\nlocal grid refinement with the FPPC technique enables accurate prediction of\nflow behaviour in regions with significant gradients. These findings highlight\nthe efficacy of the proposed technique in improving the accuracy and efficiency\nof numerical simulations of complex vacuum gas dynamics at a reduced\ncomputational cost.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
