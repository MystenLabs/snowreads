Our\ndistributed scheme combines federated learning-based attack detection with a\nlocal electricity market-based attack mitigation method. We validate the scheme\nby applying it to a real-world distribution grid rich in solar PV. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the approach is feasible and can successfully mitigate\nthe grid impacts of cyber-physical attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
