As a result, we establish a relation between the\ngenerating function of generalized Schr\\\"oder paths with backwards and the wave\nfunction corresponding to colored HOMFLY-PT polynomials of torus knot\n$T_{1,f}$. We also give a combinatorial proof of a recent result by\nSto\\v{s}i\\'c and Su{\\l}kowski, in which the standard generalized Schr\\\"oder\npaths are related to the superpolynomial of reduced colored HOMFLY-PT homology\nof $T_{1,f}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
