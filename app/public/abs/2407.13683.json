The uniform circular array (UCA) structure is widely used to\ngenerate or receive vortex electromagnetic waves with multiple OAM-modes.\nHowever, the maximum number of orthogonal OAM-modes based on UCA is usually\nlimited to the number of array-elements of the UCA antenna, leaving how to\nutilize more OAM-modes to achieve higher spectrum efficiency given a fixed\nnumber of array-elements as an intriguing question. In this paper, we propose\nan Ndimensional quasi-fractal UCA (ND QF-UCA) antenna structure in different\nfractal geometry layouts to break through the limits of array-elements number\non OAM-modes number. We develop the N-dimensional OAM modulation (NOM) and\ndemodulation (NOD) schemes for OAM multiplexing transmission with the OAM-modes\nnumber exceeding the array-elements number, which is beyond the traditional\nconcept of multiple antenna based wireless communications. Then, we investigate\ndifferent dimensional multiplex transmission schemes based on the corresponding\nQF-UCA antenna structure with various array-elements layouts. Simulation\nresults show that our proposed schemes can obtain a higher spectrum efficiency.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
