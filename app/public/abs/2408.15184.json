However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone\nunder any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions\nare canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is\nmonotone. We prove that this is indeed the case: we show that - up to\nisomorphism - contractions are the only surjective graph homomorphisms that\npreserve tree decompositions and the shape of the decomposition tree.\nFurthermore, our results provide a framework for answering questions of this\nsort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed\nmultigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs,\ndatabases, simplicial complexes etc.) for which natural analogues of tree\ndecompositions can be defined.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
