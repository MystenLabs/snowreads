However, most practical\nscenarios involve the absorption of partially coherent rather than fully\ncoherent waves. Here we present a systematic theory of unitary control over the\nabsorption of partially coherent waves by linear systems. Given an absorbing\nsystem and incident partially coherent wave, we provide analytical expressions\nfor the range of attainable absorptivity under arbitrary unitary\ntransformations of the incident field. We also present an explicit algorithm to\nconstruct the unitary control scheme that achieves any desired absorptivity\nwithin that attainable range. As applications of our theory, we derive the\nconditions required for achieving two new phenomena - partially coherent\nperfect absorption and partially coherent zero absorption. Furthermore, we\nprove a theorem relating the coherence properties of the incident field, as\nquantified by majorization, to the resulting absorption intervals. Our results\nprovide both fundamental insights and practical prescriptions for exploiting\nunitary control to shape the absorption of partially coherent waves. The theory\napplies across the electromagnetic spectrum as well as to other classical wave\nsystems such as acoustic waves.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
