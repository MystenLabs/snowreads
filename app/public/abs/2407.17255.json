For this class of models, a new\nanalytical reconstruction method is introduced for finding their equivalent\npurely kinetic k-essence formulation. The method is explicitly demonstrated for\nseveral $c_s^2(w)$ models. The application of the obtained explicit or closed\nform solutions in understanding dark sector unification models is discussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
