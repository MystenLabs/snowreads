For a\ngeneral class of singular potentials (including the physically relevant\nlogarithmic potential), we establish the regularity propagation of global weak\nsolutions to the initial boundary value problem. In particular, when the\nspatial dimension is two, we prove the instantaneous strict separation\nproperty, which ensures that every global weak solution remains uniformly away\nfrom the pure states $\\pm 1$ after any given positive time. In the\nthree-dimensional case, we obtain the eventual strict separation property that\nholds for sufficiently large time. This strict separation property allows us to\nprove that every global weak solution converges to a single equilibrium as time\ngoes to infinity using the {\\L}ojasiewicz-Simon approach. Finally, we study the\ndouble obstacle limit for the problem with logarithmic potentials in the bulk\nand on the boundary, showing that as the absolute temperature $\\Theta$ tends to\nzero, the corresponding weak solutions converge (for a suitable subsequence) to\na weak solution of the problem with a double obstacle potential.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
