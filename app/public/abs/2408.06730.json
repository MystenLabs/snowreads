First, the\ndistributed filter structure is designed with an augmented leader-following\nmeasurement fusion strategy. Subsequently, two parameter design methods are\npresented, and the consensus gain parameter is devised utilizing local\ninformation exclusively rather than global information. Additionally, the lower\nbound of the fusion step is derived to guarantee a uniformly upper bound of the\nestimation error covariance. Moreover, the lower bounds of the convergence\nrates of the steady-state performance gap between the proposed algorithm and\nthe centralized filter are provided with the fusion step approaching infinity.\nThe analysis demonstrates that the convergence rate is, at a minimum, as rapid\nas exponential convergence under the spectral norm condition of the\ncommunication graph. The transient performance is also analyzed with the fusion\nstep tending to infinity. The inherent trade-off between the communication cost\nand the filtering performance is revealed from the analysis of the steady-state\nperformance and the transient performance. Finally, the theoretical results are\nsubstantiated through the validation of two simulation examples.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
