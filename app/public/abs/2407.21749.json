The partial density of states (PDOS) of the\nCaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ stable compounds has been determined, and\nit has been observed that the requirement of including an on-site Hubbard-$U$\npotential was necessary in order to describe the highly correlated Mn\n$3d$-states. By considering $U_{eff}$=4 eV, we obtained a band gap width of\n1.82 eV and 1.70 eV, for the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$, respectively.\nCombining electric field gradient (EFG) first principles calculations, using a\nsupercell scheme, with experimental PAC results, we were able to infer that the\nCd probe can replace either the $A$ (Ca, Sr) or the Mn sites in the crystalline\nstructures. We also showed that Cd substitution is expected to lead to a\nreduction in the width of the band gap in these systems, evidencing\nopportunities for potential band-gap engineering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
