Conventionally, this\nhas been a time-consuming process which requires both artistic skill and\nfamiliarity with professional software, making it hardly accessible for layman\nusers. However, recent advances in generative AI have established solid\nfoundation for democratizing 3D design. In this paper, we propose a pioneering\napproach for text-based 3D room design. Given a prompt in natural language\ndescribing the object placement in the room, our method produces a high-quality\n3D scene corresponding to it. With an additional text prompt the users can\nchange the appearance of the entire scene or of individual objects in it. Built\nusing in-context learning, CAD model retrieval and 3D-Gaussian-Splatting-based\nstylization, our turnkey pipeline produces state-of-the-art 3D scenes, while\nbeing easy to use even for novices.
