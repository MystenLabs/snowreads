We force the energy degeneracy of the collective\nstates by adjusting the direct coupling strength between the two giant atoms.\nOur results indicate that resonant photons can be completely transferred\nbetween the two waveguides owing to the scattering interference of eigenstates,\nwhich also results in the directional propagation of resonant photons in the\noutput waveguide. Perfect transfer occurs when the two scattering states\ndegenerate in the energy and decay rates. We further propose a simple scheme to\nrealize the efficient photon transfer with directional control. This study has\npotential applications in quantum networks and integrated photonic circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
