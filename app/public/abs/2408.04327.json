Bayesian methods facilitate borrowing which is \"dynamic\" in the sense\nthat the similarity of the data helps to determine how much information is\nused. We propose a Bayesian semiparameteric model, which allows the baseline\nhazard to take any form through an ensemble average. We introduce priors to\nsmooth the posterior baseline hazard improving both model estimation and\nborrowing characteristics. A \"lump-and-smear\" borrowing prior accounts for\nnon-exchangable historical data and helps reduce the maximum type I error in\nthe presence of prior-data conflict. In this article, we present\nBayesFBHborrow, an R package, which enables the user to perform Bayesian\nborrowing with a historical control dataset in a semiparameteric time-to-event\nmodel. User-defined hyperparameters smooth an ensemble averaged posterior\nbaseline hazard. The model offers the specification of lump-and-smear priors on\nthe commensurability parameter where the associated hyperparameters can be\nchosen according to the users tolerance for difference between the log baseline\nhazards. We demonstrate the performance of our Bayesian flexible baseline\nhazard model on a simulated and real world dataset.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
