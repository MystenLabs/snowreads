Recent approaches\nbased on Bird's-eye-view (BEV) and deep learning have made significant\nprogress. However, there exists challenging issues including lengthy\ndevelopment cycles, poor reusability, and complex sensor setups in perception\nalgorithm development process. To tackle the above challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel hierarchical BEV perception paradigm, aiming to provide a\nlibrary of fundamental perception modules and user-friendly graphical\ninterface, enabling swift construction of customized models. We conduct the\nPretrain-Finetune strategy to effectively utilize large scale public datasets\nand streamline development processes. Moreover, we present a Multi-Module\nLearning (MML) approach, enhancing performance through synergistic and\niterative training of multiple models. Extensive experimental results on the\nNuscenes dataset demonstrate that our approach renders significant improvement\nover the traditional training scheme.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
