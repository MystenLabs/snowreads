The electrodes, termed 'shark-teeth\nelectrodes', are fabricated using a laser ablation technique optimized for\nfacile nanostructure creation. This method involves successive, overlapping\nablated discs in a thin film of gold, producing sharp tips that generate strong\nelectric fields. When electrically polarized in an electrolyte solution, these\nsharp tips form a screening layer, facilitating the observation of ion and\nnanoparticle behavior.\n  A total-internal reflection microscope is employed to monitor ion\naccumulation on these electrodes, demonstrating their capability in iontronic\nmicroscopy. Additionally, the same electrodes are used to track nanoparticle\ntrapping under high-frequency alternating potentials. This dual functionality\nallows for the investigation of electrochemical and physical interactions\nbetween ions and colloidal nanoparticles, contributing valuable insights to the\nfield of soft matter.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
