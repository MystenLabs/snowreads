Here\nwe investigate the topological phase transition driven by disorder in a\nsemi-magnetic structure of topological insulator, and narrow-gap weak\ntopological insulator film. We demonstrate that strong disorder not only leads\nto a topological transition from the parity anomalous semimetal to a diffusive\nmetal with non-quantized anomalous Hall conductance, but also induces the\ntopological phase in a trivial insulating phase. Our calculations of the local\ndensity of states provide clear picture for the formation of a single gapless\nDirac fermion, which emerges as the disorder strength increases. The half\nquantized Hall effect is attributed to the existence of the gapless Dirac cone.\nOur findings of disorder-induced parity anomalous semimetal and diffusive metal\nsignificantly advance our understanding of the disorder-driven topological\nphase transition in magnetic topological insulators, opening up new avenues for\nfurther exploration in the field of quantum materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
