{"id":"2407.06228","title":"Implementing the Typed Graph Data Model Using Relational Database\n  Technology","authors":"Malcolm Crowe and Fritz Laux","authorsParsed":[["Crowe","Malcolm",""],["Laux","Fritz",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2024 15:40:57 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-10","timestamp":1720280457000,"abstract":"  Recent standardization work for database languages has reflected the growing\nuse of typed graph models (TGM) in application development. Such data models\nare frequently only used early in the design process, and not reflected\ndirectly in underlying physical database. In previous work, we have added\nsupport to a relational database management system (RDBMS) with role-based\nstructures to ensure that relevant data models are not separately declared in\neach application but are an important part of the database implementation. In\nthis work, we implement this approach for the TGM: the resulting database\nimplementation is novel in retaining the best features of the graph-based and\nrelational database technologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
