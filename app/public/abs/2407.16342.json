This allows us to engineer the\ndispersive shift of the readout resonator independent of the qubit and\nresonator capacitances. We validate the pure kinetic coupling concept and\ndemonstrate various generalized flux qubit regimes from plasmon to fluxon, with\ndispersive shifts ranging from 60 kHz to 2 MHz at the half-flux quantum sweet\nspot. We achieve readout performances comparable to conventional architectures\nwith quantum state preparation fidelities of 99.7 % and 92.7 % for the ground\nand excited states, respectively, and below 0.1 % leakage to non-computational\nstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
