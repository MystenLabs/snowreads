This paper points out flaws in his results by providing\na counterexample. Inspired by Takai's construction, the notion of a (saturated)\n(G, R)-automaton is introduced and metatheorems concerning (maximally\npermissive) supervisors for the similarity control problem are provided in\nterms of this notion. As an application of these metatheorems, the flaws in\nTakai's work are corrected.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
