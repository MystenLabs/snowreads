In this work, we demonstrate the limitations\nand benefits of prominent imitation learning approaches and analyze their\ncapabilities regarding these properties. We evaluate each algorithm on a\ncomplex bimanual manipulation task involving an over-constrained dynamics\nsystem in a setting involving multiple contacts between the manipulated object\nand the environment. While we find that imitation learning is well suited to\nsolve such complex tasks, not all algorithms are equal in terms of handling\nenvironmental and hyperparameter perturbations, training requirements,\nperformance, and ease of use. We investigate the empirical influence of these\nkey characteristics by employing a carefully designed experimental procedure\nand learning environment.
