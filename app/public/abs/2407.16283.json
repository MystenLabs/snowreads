To address this problem within the framework of approximate designs,\nwe introduce mREX, an algorithm that generalizes the randomized exchange\nalgorithm REX (J Am Stat Assoc 115:529, 2020), originally specialized for\nsingle-response models. The mREX algorithm incorporates several improvements: a\nnovel method for computing efficient sparse initial designs, an extension to\nall differentiable Kiefer's optimality criteria, and an efficient method for\nperforming optimal exchanges of weights. For the most commonly used\nD-optimality criterion, we propose a technique for optimal weight exchanges\nbased on the characteristic matrix polynomial. The mREX algorithm is applicable\nto linear, nonlinear, and generalized linear models, and scales well to large\nproblems. It typically converges to optimal designs faster than available\nalternative methods, although it does not require advanced mathematical\nprogramming solvers. We demonstrate the application of mREX to bivariate\ndose-response Emax models for clinical trials, both without and with the\ninclusion of covariates.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
