We introduce two special types of\nsubspaces, christened the anti-coproximinal subspaces and the strongly\nanti-coproximinal subspaces. We obtain a necessary condition for the strongly\nanti-coproximinal subspaces in a reflexive Banach space whose dual space\nsatisfies the Kadets-Klee Property. On the other hand, we provide a sufficient\ncondition for the strongly anti-coproximinal subspaces in a general Banach\nspace. We also characterize the anti-coproximinal subspaces of a smooth Banach\nspace. Further, we study these special subspaces in a finite-dimensional\npolyhedral Banach space and find some interesting geometric structures\nassociated with them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
