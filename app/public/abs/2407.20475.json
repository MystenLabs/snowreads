The existing\nliterature on the usage of soft targets for regression fails to properly assess\nthe method's limitations, and empirical evaluation is quite limited. In this\nwork, we assess the strengths and drawbacks of existing methods when applied to\nmolecular property regression tasks. Our assessment outlines key biases present\nin existing methods and proposes methods to address them, evaluated through\ncareful ablation studies. We leverage these insights to propose Distributional\nMixture of Experts (DMoE): A model-independent, and data-independent method for\nregression which trains a model to predict probability distributions of its\ntargets. Our proposed loss function combines the cross entropy between\npredicted and target distributions and the L1 distance between their expected\nvalues to produce a loss function that is robust to the outlined biases. We\nevaluate the performance of DMoE on different molecular property prediction\ndatasets -- Open Catalyst (OC20), MD17, and QM9 -- across different backbone\nmodel architectures -- SchNet, GemNet, and Graphormer. Our results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method is a promising alternative to classical regression for\nmolecular property prediction tasks, showing improvements over baselines on all\ndatasets and architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
