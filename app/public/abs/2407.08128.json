Sequential\ncircuits are modeled as causal stream functions, the outputs of which depend\nsolely on the past and current inputs. Referring forms are defined based on the\ntype expressions of functions and represent how a circuit refers to past\ninputs. The key contribution of this study is identifying a universal property\nin multiple clock domain circuits using referring forms. This theoretical\nframework is expected to enhance the comprehension and analysis of sequential\ncircuits.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
