In this paper,\nleveraging properties of generalized Fibonacci sequences and formulas for\nconsecutive sums of equidistant subsequences, we investigate the ratio of the\nsum of numbers along main-diagonal and sub-diagonal of odd-order grids\ncontaining generalized Fibonacci sequences. We show that this ratio is solely\ndependent on the order of the grid, providing a concise and splendid identity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
