The undirected power graph of a group\n$G$ has vertices the elements of $G$, with an edge between $g_1$ and $g_2$ if\none of the two cyclic subgroups $\\langle g_1\\rangle, \\langle g_2\\rangle$ is\ncontained in the other. It is denoted by $P(G)$. The reduced power graph,\ndenoted by $P^*(G),$ is the subgraph of $P(G)$ induced by the non-identity\nelements. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the finite groups whose\nreduced power graph is claw-free. In particular we prove that if $P^*(G)$ is\nclaw-free, then either $G$ is solvable or $G$ is an almost simple group. In the\nsecond case the socle of $G$ is isomorphic to $PSL(2,q)$ for suitable choices\nof $q$. Finally we prove that if $P^*(G)$ is claw-free, then the order of $G$\nis divisible by at most 5 different primes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
