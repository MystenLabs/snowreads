It\nwraps the original SLSQP Fortran code sourced from the SciPy repository and\nprovides a host of new features to improve the research utility of the original\nalgorithm. Some of the additional features offered by PySLSQP include\nauto-generation of unavailable derivatives using finite differences,\nindependent scaling of the problem variables and functions, access to internal\noptimization data, live-visualization, saving optimization data from each\niteration, warm/hot restarting of optimization, and various other utilities for\npost-processing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
