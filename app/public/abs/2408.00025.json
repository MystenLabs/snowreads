However, AI's complex\nnature makes understanding and fixing problems challenging. Research worldwide\nshows that a parent's income greatly influences a child's education. This led\nus to explore how AI, especially complex models, makes important decisions\nusing Explainable AI tools. Our research uncovered many complexities linked to\nparental income and offered reasonable explanations for these decisions.\nHowever, we also found biases in AI that go against what we want from AI in\neducation: clear transparency and equal access for everyone. These biases can\nimpact families and children's schooling, highlighting the need for better AI\nsolutions that offer fair opportunities to all. This chapter tries to shed\nlight on the complex ways AI operates, especially concerning biases. These are\nthe foundational steps towards better educational policies, which include using\nAI in ways that are more reliable, accountable, and beneficial for everyone\ninvolved.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rG8UIJBomBk9kEwiFmcs-65UT8wIsvkJ7iqHFCv8a8M","pdfSize":"1889019"}
