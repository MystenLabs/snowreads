Failures cascade: if one fails their agreement, then so\ndo all who follow in the chain. Thus, later agents' investments turn out to be\npointless when there is an earlier failure. How losses are shared affects how\nagents invest to avoid the losses in the first place. In this way, a solution\nsets agent liabilities depending on the point of disruption and induces a\nsupermodular investment game. We characterize all efficient solutions. These\nhave the form that later agents -- who are not directly liable for the\ndisruption -- still shoulder some of the losses, justified on the premise that\nthey might have failed anyway. Importantly, we find that such indirect\nliabilities are necessary to avoid unbounded inefficiencies. Finally, we\npinpoint one efficient solution with several desirable properties.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A0DfkqF_cI78Ezg9a4b6PADBpYxYPjSpcYdNHamkntg","pdfSize":"276002"}
