Unlike\nprevious approaches that predict point-wise displacements from point features\nor learned noise distributions, our method learns an optimal transport plan\nbetween paired point clouds. Experiments on object datasets like PU-Net and\nreal-world datasets such as ScanNet++ and ARKitScenes show that P2P-Bridge\nachieves significant improvements over existing methods. While our approach\ndemonstrates strong results using only point coordinates, we also show that\nincorporating additional features, such as color information or point-wise\nDINOv2 features, further enhances the performance.
