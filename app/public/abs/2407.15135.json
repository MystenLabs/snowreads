We also investigate the continuity of both the directional\nshort-time fractional Fourier transform and its synthesis operator on the\nappropriate space of test functions. Using the obtained continuity results, we\ndevelop a distributional framework for the DSTFRFT on the space of tempered\ndistributions $\\mathcal{S}'(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. We end the article with a\ndesingularization formula.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
