The resulting charged hadron\nspectra and anisotropic flow profiles correspond closely with experimental\ndata. The transverse momentum spectra and longitudinal decorrelations are\nessentially unaffected by the phase transition temperature. An increase in the\nphase transition temperature leads to a rise in particle yields at midrapidity,\naccompanied by a decrease in both elliptic and triangular flows over a range of\ntransverse momenta and pseudorapidities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
