This paper presents a new type of graph attention network, called\nTempoKGAT, which combines time-decaying weight and a selective neighbor\naggregation mechanism on the spatial domain, which helps uncover latent\npatterns in the graph data. In this approach, a top-k neighbor selection based\non the edge weights is introduced to represent the evolving features of the\ngraph data. We evaluated the performance of our TempoKGAT on multiple datasets\nfrom the traffic, energy, and health sectors involving spatio-temporal data. We\ncompared the performance of our approach to several state-of-the-art methods\nfound in the literature on several open-source datasets. Our method shows\nsuperior accuracy on all datasets. These results indicate that TempoKGAT builds\non existing methodologies to optimize prediction accuracy and provide new\ninsights into model interpretation in temporal contexts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
