In\ncontemporary research, there has been a notable upsurge in exploring feature\nextraction through random sampling. Unlike deep convolutional networks, these\nmethods sidestep elaborate training procedures, yet they often necessitate\ngenerating a surplus of features to comprehensively encapsulate time series\nnuances. Consequently, some features may lack relevance to labels or exhibit\nmulti-collinearity with others. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical\nfeature selection method aided by ANOVA variance analysis to address this\nchallenge. Through meticulous experimentation, we demonstrate that our method\nsubstantially reduces features by over 94% while preserving accuracy -- a\nsignificant advancement in the field of time series analysis and feature\nselection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
