It is believed that fibrils and rapid\nblueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs; collectively referred to\nas REs) correspond to on-disk counterparts of type I spicules and type II\nspicules, respectively. Our investigation focuses on observing the response of\nthese REs alongside similar spectral features in the chromosphere, transition\nRegion (TR), and corona, utilizing space-time plots derived from coordinated\nobservations from Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope/H{\\alpha}, Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our analysis\nreveals upflowing REs, promptly reaching temperatures characteristic of the TR\nand corona, indicating a multi-thermal nature. Similarly, downflowing features\nexhibiting similar spectral signatures over the disk display plasma motion from\nthe corona to chromospheric temperatures, demonstrating a multithermal nature.\nIn addition to distinct upflows and downflows, we observe sequential upflow and\ndownflow along the same path, depicting a distinctive parabolic trajectory in\nspace-time plots of observations sampling TR and various coronal passbands.\nSimilar to isolated upflows and downflows, these REs also exhibit a\nmulti-thermal nature throughout their trajectory. Furthermore, our results\nreveal a more intricate motion of the REs in which both upflow and downflow\ncoexist at the same spatial location. On a different note, our analysis,\nutilizing coordinated IRIS spectral observations, shows spatio-temporal\nredshifts/downflows in both the TR and chromosphere, suggesting that at least\nsubsets of the strong redshifts/downflows observed in TR temperature spectra\nresult from the return from the upper atmosphere flow of plasma in the form of\nbundles of spicules or features exhibiting similar spectra.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
