Efficient hill climbers and crossover operators have been proposed\nin the domain of pseudo-Boolean optimization and also in some permutation\nproblems. However, there is no general rule on how to design these efficient\noperators in different representation domains. This paper proposes a general\nframework that encompasses all known gray-box operators for combinatorial\noptimization problems. The framework is general enough to shed light on the\ndesign of new efficient operators for new problems and representation domains.\nWe also unify the proofs of efficiency for gray-box hill climbers and\ncrossovers and show that the mathematical property explaining the speed-up of\ngray-box crossover operators, also explains the efficient identification of\nimproving moves in gray-box hill climbers. We illustrate the power of the new\nframework by proposing an efficient hill climber and crossover for two related\npermutation problems: the Linear Ordering Problem and the Single Machine Total\nWeighted Tardiness Problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
