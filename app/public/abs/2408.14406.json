For real-weighted\ndirected graphs, we show a deterministic fully dynamic data structure with\n$\\tilde{O}(mn^{4/5})$ worst-case update time processing arbitrary\n$s,t$-distance queries in $\\tilde{O}(n^{4/5})$ time. This constitutes the first\nnon-trivial update/query tradeoff for this problem in the regime of sparse\nweighted directed graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ik5OZ333pTocbsTAc8Ha2l4RWc3dPm1froy3zcKbgR4","pdfSize":"348798"}
