The hot medium\nis described with the hydrodynamic model, while charmonium evolutions in the\nmedium are studied with a time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. The hot medium\ndissociation on charmonium is considered with the temperature-dependent complex\npotential parametrized with the results from lattice QCD calculations. The\nratio $\\sigma_{\\psi(2S)}/\\sigma_{J/\\psi}$ of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ production\ncross sections are calculated and compared with the LHCb experimental data in\npp collisions. Our calculations explain the charmonium relative suppression in\ndifferent transverse momentum and multiplicity bins. The suppression of this\nratio is mainly affected by the effects of the deconfined medium. It is less\naffected by the initial effects before the generation of the heavy quark pair.\nWe suggest this to be a clear signal of the small QGP droplets generated in\nhigh multiplicity pp collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
