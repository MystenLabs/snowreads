Precision measurements\nof Transverse Energy-Energy Correlations at the ATLAS experiment are used,\nexploiting their dependence on the strong coupling constant to analyse the\neffects of introducing new fermions with colour charge on the Renormalisation\nGroup Equation. The comparison between theoretical predictions, corrected up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order, and the data collected by ATLAS at $\\sqrt{s} =\n13$ TeV allows to constrain physics models proposing the existence of new\nfermions with masses up to 2 TeV, independently of assumptions on the fermion\ndecay.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
