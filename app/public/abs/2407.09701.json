The moon formed close to the Earth\n(semi-major axis $a_{EM}\\approx 3\\, R_\\oplus$) and expanded through tides to\nits current day semi-major axis ($a_{ EM}= 60\\, R_\\oplus$). Circumbinary orbits\nthat are polar or highly inclined to the Earth-Moon orbit are subject to two\ncompeting effects: (i) nodal precession about the Earth-Moon eccentricity\nvector and (ii) Kozai-Lidov oscillations of eccentricity and inclination driven\nby the Sun. While we find that there are no stable polar orbits around the\nEarth-Moon orbit with the current day semi-major axis, polar orbits were stable\nimmediately after the formation of the Moon, at the time when there was a lot\nof debris around the system, up to when the semi-major axis reached about $a_{\nEM}\\approx 10\\, R_\\oplus$. We discuss implications of polar orbits on the\nevolution of the Earth-Moon system and the possibility of polar orbiting moons\naround exoplanet-moon binaries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
