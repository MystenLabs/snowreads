We also disagree with him about his manner and attitude which he\nadopted in his campaign against special relativity although we generally agree\nwith him about the necessity of impartiality of the scientific community and\nthe scientific press towards scientific theories and opinions as well as the\nnecessity of total respect to the ethics of science and the rules of moral\nconduct in general.\n","subjects":["Physics/Popular Physics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uK3PM8_L3on5Bw5SqvCLhuLJ3fgUF0fuA1FiTCucaNw","pdfSize":"270515","objectId":"0x9c16e5c117b9a5af697d5090246a2a44d051fe0cedced6984af4b90e14bb2982","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
