Conventional methods rely on specialized architectures trained on\nspecific datasets, which struggle to be adapted to new requirements. Recent\nbreakthroughs in large vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled visual\nin-context learning without explicit training. However, effective strategies\nfor vision downstream tasks with VLMs remain largely unclear and underexplored.\nIn this paper, we propose an effective approach to leverage VLMs for better\nimage cropping. First, we propose an efficient prompt retrieval mechanism for\nimage cropping to automate the selection of in-context examples. Second, we\nintroduce an iterative refinement strategy to iteratively enhance the predicted\ncrops. The proposed framework, named Cropper, is applicable to a wide range of\ncropping tasks, including free-form cropping, subject-aware cropping, and\naspect ratio-aware cropping. Extensive experiments and a user study demonstrate\nthat Cropper significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several\nbenchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TejECyPxRu9CdcOlMGv86rmFOiQJAozzAgAPQZrOXug","pdfSize":"19935474"}
