Typically,\nthe network slice orchestrator relies on demand forecasts for each slice to\nmake informed decisions and maximize resource utilization. The new generation\nof Industry 4.0 has introduced digital twins to map physical systems to digital\nmodels for accurate decision-making. In our approach, we first use\ngraph-attention networks to build a digital twin environment for network\nslices, enabling real-time traffic analysis, monitoring, and demand\nforecasting. Based on these predictions, we formulate the resource allocation\nproblem as a federated multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and employ a\ndeep deterministic policy gradient to determine the resource allocation policy\nwhile preserving the privacy of the slices. Our results demonstrate that the\nproposed approaches can improve the accuracy of demand prediction for network\nslices and reduce the communication overhead of dynamic network slicing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
