This variant, called LMM with Singular Scaling (LMMSS),\nallows the LMM scaling matrix to be singular, encompassing a broader class of\nregularizers, which has proven useful in certain applications. In order to\nestablish local convergence results, a careful choice of the LMM parameter is\nmade based on the gradient linearization error, dictated by the nonlinearity\nand size of the residual. Under completeness and local error bound assumptions\nwe prove that the distance from an iterate to the set of stationary points goes\nto zero superlinearly and that the iterative sequence converges. Furthermore,\nwe also study a globalized version of the method obtained using linesearch and\nprove that any limit point of the generated sequence is stationary. Some\nexamples are provided to illustrate our theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
