To\naddress this, various safety mechanisms and red teaming attack methods are\nproposed to enhance or expose the T2I model's capability to generate unsuitable\ncontent. However, many red teaming attack methods assume knowledge of the text\nencoders, limiting their practical usage. In this work, we rethink the case of\n\\textit{purely black-box} attacks without prior knowledge of the T2l model. To\novercome the unavailability of gradients and the inability to optimize attacks\nwithin a discrete prompt space, we propose DiffZOO which applies Zeroth Order\nOptimization to procure gradient approximations and harnesses both C-PRV and\nD-PRV to enhance attack prompts within the discrete prompt domain. We evaluated\nour method across multiple safety mechanisms of the T2I diffusion model and\nonline servers. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art safety mechanisms show\nthat DiffZOO attains an 8.5% higher average attack success rate than previous\nworks, hence its promise as a practical red teaming tool for T2l models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
