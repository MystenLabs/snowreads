Although encoding is easier than\ndecoding in general, designing an encoding algorithm of codes of length $N$\nwith quasi-linear complexity $O(N\\log N)$ is not an easy task. Despite the fact\nthat algebraic geometry codes were discovered in the early of 1980s, encoding\nalgorithms of algebraic geometry codes with quasi-linear complexity $O(N\\log\nN)$ have not been found except for the simplest algebraic geometry\ncodes--Reed-Solomon codes. The best-known encoding algorithm of algebraic\ngeometry codes based on a class of plane curves has quasi-linear complexity at\nleast $O(N\\log^2 N)$. In this paper, we design an encoding algorithm of\nalgebraic geometry codes with quasi-linear complexity $O(N\\log N)$. Our\nalgorithm works well for a large class of algebraic geometry codes based on\nboth plane and non-plane curves.\n  The main idea of this paper is to generalize the divide-and-conquer method\nfrom the fast Fourier Transform over finite fields to algebraic curves. Suppose\nwe consider encoding of algebraic geometry codes based on an algebraic curve\n${\\mathcal X}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We first consider a tower of Galois\ncoverings ${\\mathcal X}={\\mathcal X}_0\\rightarrow{\\mathcal\nX}_1\\rightarrow\\cdots\\rightarrow{\\mathcal X}_r$ over a finite field\n$\\mathbb{F}_q$, i.e., their function field tower $\\mathbb{F}_q({\\mathcal\nX}_0)\\supsetneq\\mathbb{F}_q({\\mathcal X}_{1})\\supsetneq\\cdots\n\\supsetneq\\mathbb{F}_q({\\mathcal X}_r)$ satisfies that each of extension\n$\\mathbb{F}_q({\\mathcal X}_{i-1})/\\mathbb{F}_q({\\mathcal X}_i)$ is a Galois\nextension and the extension degree $[\\mathbb{F}_q({\\mathcal\nX}_{i-1}):\\mathbb{F}_q({\\mathcal X}_i)]$ {is a constant}. Then encoding of an\nalgebraic geometry code based on ${\\mathcal X}$ is reduced to the encoding of\nan algebraic geometry code based on ${\\mathcal X}_r$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
