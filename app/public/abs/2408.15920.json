In these applications,\nsignals are described by stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and\nobservations can be modelled as functionals of marked point processes whose\nintensities depend on the underlying signal. We derive both the unnormalized\nand normalized filtering equations for these systems, demonstrate the\nasymptotic consistency and approximations of finite dimensional observation\nschemes respectively partial observations. Our theoretical results are\nvalidated through extensive simulations using synthetic and real data. These\nfindings contribute to a deeper understanding of filtering with point process\nobservations and provide a robust framework for future research in this area.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BFc6rpsAtfZTjaFyT03a0RN3o8olqEaSgKmYj3hR3kg","pdfSize":"4863597"}
