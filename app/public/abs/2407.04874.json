These interferometers do not rely on the ubiquitous light-pulses of\ntraditional atom sensors, but are instead built from an innovative design that\noperates entirely within the Bloch bands of an optical lattice formed by\ninterfering laser beams. Through time-dependent control of the position of the\nlattice in three-dimensional space, we realize simultaneous Bloch oscillations\nin two dimensions, and a vector atomic Michelson interferometer. Fits to the\nobserved Bloch oscillations demonstrate the measurement of an applied\nacceleration of $2g$ along two axes, where $g$ is the average gravitational\nacceleration at the Earth's surface. For the Michelson interferometer, we\nperform Bayesian inferencing from a 49-channel output by repeating experiments\nfor selected examples of two-axis accelerations. We demonstrate the resulting\naccuracy and sensitivity for vector parameter estimation. Our acceleration can\nbe measured from a single experimental run and does not require repeated shots\nto construct a fringe. We find the performance of our device to be near the\nquantum limit for the interferometer size and quantum detection efficiency of\nthe atoms. We discuss the reconfigurability of the vector accelerometer and the\npathway toward further sensitivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
