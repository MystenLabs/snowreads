We show that unambiguous discrimination is not realizable. We\nthen consider discrimination with nonzero error probability and minimize this\nlatter in the absence of input constraints. In the presence of an input energy\nconstraint, we derive an upper bound on the error probability. Finally, we\nextend these results from single-shot to multi-shot discrimination, envisaging\nthe asymptotic behavior.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
