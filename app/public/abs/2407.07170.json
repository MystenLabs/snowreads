For this model, we prove a\nfunctional law of large numbers (FLLN) and a functional central limit theorem\n(FCLT). We apply these results to a non-Markovian version of the rumor model\nintroduced by Lebensztayn, Machado and Rodr\\'{i}guez.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
