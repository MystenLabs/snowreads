However, few studies have examined how participant demographics\nmay interact with these matching effects. We recruited a diverse and racially\nbalanced sample of 78 participants to investigate the differences among\nparticipant groups when embodying both demographically matched and unmatched\navatars. We found that participant ethnicity emerged as a significant factor,\nwith Asian and Black participants reporting lower total SoE compared to\nHispanic participants. Furthermore, we found that user ethnicity significantly\ninfluences ownership (a subscale of SoE), with Asian and Black participants\nexhibiting stronger effects of matched avatar ethnicity compared to White\nparticipants. Additionally, Hispanic participants showed no significant\ndifferences, suggesting complex dynamics in ethnic-racial identity. Our results\nalso reveal significant main effects of matched avatar ethnicity and gender on\nSoE, indicating the importance of considering these factors in VR experiences.\nThese findings contribute valuable insights into understanding the complex\ndynamics shaping VR experiences across different demographic groups.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SylmxrTHuLOOyfZVACKqA66lzi25Heb2YWE8VQDalRQ","pdfSize":"4458616"}
