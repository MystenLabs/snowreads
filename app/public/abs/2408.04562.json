We introduce new improved formulation techniques that take advantage\nof the simplotope structure present in the domain of the binarization\nvariables. Our technique identifies new polynomially solvable instances for\nprice promotion problem initially studied by Cohen et al. (2021) and allows us\nto develop a linear programming (LP) formulation for inventory optimization\nproblem under a choice model proposed by Boada-Collado and Martinez-de Albeniz\n(2020). The techniques we develop rely on ideal formulations for submodular and\nfractional compositions of discrete functions, improving prior formulations for\nbilinear products suggested by Adams and Henry (2012). Submodular compositions\nalso generalize L natural functions over bounded domains and our construction\nprovides new insights into Lovasz-extension based formulations for this class\nof problems while expanding the class of nonlinear discrete optimization\nproblems amenable to linear programming based techniques.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
