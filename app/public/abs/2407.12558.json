Computer systems\nhave evolved to meet diverse social needs thanks to technological advances. The\nInternet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing, and\nother emerging paradigms provide new economic and creative potential.\nTherefore, this article explores and evaluates the elements impacting the\nadvancement of computing platforms, including both long standing systems and\nframeworks and more recent innovations like cloud computing, quantum\ntechnology, and edge AI. In this article, we examine computing paradigms,\ndomains, and next generation computing systems to better understand the past,\npresent, and future of computing technologies. This paper provides readers with\na comprehensive overview of developments in computing technologies and\nhighlights promising research gaps for the advancement of future computing\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
