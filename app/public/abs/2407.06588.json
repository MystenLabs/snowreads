Their definition involves only continuous\nmaps from ${\\mathbb R}^n$ to a manifold, which is a purely topological one.\nThey also provided a sufficient condition for the $C^0$ transversality in terms\nof homological nature. In this paper, we prove that such a homological\ncondition of Axiom A diffeomorphisms is sufficient for enjoying the shadowing\nproperty. Moreover, it is proved that the $C^0$ transversality of Axiom A\ndiffeomorphisms with codimension one basic sets implies the homological\ncondition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
