Yet, the challenge of detecting overlapping actions is often overlooked\neven though it is a common scenario in streaming videos. Current methods that\ncan address concurrent actions depend heavily on class information, limiting\ntheir flexibility. This paper introduces ActionSwitch, the first class-agnostic\nOn-TAL framework capable of detecting overlapping actions. By obviating the\nreliance on class information, ActionSwitch provides wider applicability to\nvarious situations, including overlapping actions of the same class or\nscenarios where class information is unavailable. This approach is complemented\nby the proposed \"conservativeness loss\", which directly embeds a conservative\ndecision-making principle into the loss function for On-TAL. Our ActionSwitch\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in complex datasets, including\nEpic-Kitchens 100 targeting the challenging egocentric view and FineAction\nconsisting of fine-grained actions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
