In this work, we extend these limits down to the\nsub-keV mass range. Using principal component analysis, we estimate the lower\nbound on the decay lifetime for a basis of different dark matter masses and\nStandard Model final states, from which the bound on an arbitrary model can be\ncalculated. We validate our principal component analysis using Markov chain\nMonte Carlo methods and Planck 2018 data. We perform a separate analysis for\nmodels decaying into photons below the hydrogen ionization threshold. We\ndemonstrate that for these models, the effect of energy deposition can be\ncaptured approximately by a single parameter, but the redshift dependence of\nthe effect is very different from higher-energy injections; in particular, the\nperturbations to CMB anisotropies are more sensitive to energy deposited around\nthe time of recombination.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
