Our approach is based on the\nGraphCodeBERT model, extended with a custom output feature layer and a\nconcatenation mechanism for improved feature representation. The model was\ntrained and evaluated, achieving promising results in terms of precision,\nrecall, and f-measure. The implementation details, including model architecture\nand training strategies are discussed.
