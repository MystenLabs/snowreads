Nearly every method\nimaginable has been applied to establish solutions, including Laplace and\nFourier transforms, singular eigenfunctions, solutions of singular integral\nequation, PN expansions, double PN expansions, Chebychev expansions, Lagrange\npolynomial expansions, numerical discrete ordinates with finite difference,\nanalytical discrete ordinates, finite elements, solutions to integral\nequations, adding and doubling, invariant imbedding, solution of Ricatti\nequations and response matrix methods -- and probably more methods of which the\nauthors are unaware. Of those listed, the response matrix solution to the\ndiscrete ordinates form of the 1D transport equation is arguably the simplest\nand most straightforward. Here, we propose another response of exponential\nsolutions but to the first order equation enabled by matrix scaling.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
