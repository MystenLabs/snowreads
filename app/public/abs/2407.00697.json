Recently, radar-camera depth estimation has become of sufficient\ninterest due to the robustness and low-cost properties of radar. Thus, this\npaper introduces a two-stage, end-to-end trainable Confidence-aware Fusion Net\n(CaFNet) for dense depth estimation, combining RGB imagery with sparse and\nnoisy radar point cloud data. The first stage addresses radar-specific\nchallenges, such as ambiguous elevation and noisy measurements, by predicting a\nradar confidence map and a preliminary coarse depth map. A novel approach is\npresented for generating the ground truth for the confidence map, which\ninvolves associating each radar point with its corresponding object to identify\npotential projection surfaces. These maps, together with the initial radar\ninput, are processed by a second encoder. For the final depth estimation, we\ninnovate a confidence-aware gated fusion mechanism to integrate radar and image\nfeatures effectively, thereby enhancing the reliability of the depth map by\nfiltering out radar noise. Our methodology, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset,\ndemonstrates superior performance, improving upon the current leading model by\n3.2% in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 2.7% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\nCode: https://github.com/harborsarah/CaFNet\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
