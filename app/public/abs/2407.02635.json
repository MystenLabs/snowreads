It is proved that if $k\\ge 3$ and $n>k(k+2)$, then the\ngeneralized Petersen graph $GP(n,k)$ is not distance-balanced and that\n$GP(k(k+2),k)$ is distance-balanced. This significantly improves the main\nresult of Yang et al.\\ [Electron.\\ J.\\ Combin.\\ 16 (2009) \\#N33]. It is also\nproved that if $k\\ge 6$, where $k$ is even, and $n>\\frac{5}{4}k^2+2k$, or if\n$k\\ge 5$, where $k$ is odd, and $n>\\frac{7}{4}k^2+\\frac{3}{4}k$, then $GP(n,k)$\nis not $2$-distance-balanced.
