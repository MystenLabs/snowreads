Our\nfindings show that geographic and socioeconomic integrated prompts improve VL\nperformance on lower-income data and favor the retrieval of topic appearances\ncommonly found in data from low-income households. From our analyses, we\nidentify and highlight contexts where these strategies yield the most\nimprovements.
