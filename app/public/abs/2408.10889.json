This allows us to specify the valid plans of a\nplanning task. However, very little work focuses on learning action costs,\nwhich in turn allows us to rank the different plans. In this paper we introduce\na new problem: that of learning the costs of a set of actions such that a set\nof input plans are optimal under the resulting planning model. To solve this\nproblem we present $LACFIP^k$, an algorithm to learn action's costs from\nunlabeled input plans. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing how\n$LACFIP^k$ can successfully solve this task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
