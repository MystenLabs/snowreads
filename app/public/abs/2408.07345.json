Despite intensive investigations of heavy\nquasiparticles on the Kondo-screened side of the quantum phase transition and\nof their breakdown at the quantum critical point, studies on the magnetically\nordering side are scarce. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we report a\nsuppression of the Kondo quasiparticle weight in CeCu6-xAux samples on the\nantiferromagnetic side of the quantum phase transition at temperatures as much\nas two orders of magnitude above the Neel temperature TN. The suppression\nresults from a quantum frustration effect induced by the\ntemperature-independent RKKY interaction. Hence, our results emphasize that\nbesides critical fluctuations, the RKKY interaction may play an important role\nin the quantum-critical scenario.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dgrnBVxL4V5eZkxruhmcrKCEuVTKidPUM-wLLEeeVLg","pdfSize":"955922"}
