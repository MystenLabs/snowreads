While Intel's\nSoftware Guard Extensions (SGX) offers a potential remedy, it requires complex\napplication adaptations. This paper investigates AMD's Secure Encrypted\nVirtualization (SEV) as an alternative approach for securing NFV. SEV encrypts\nvirtual machine (VM) memory, protecting it from threats, including those at the\nhypervisor level, without requiring application modifications. We explore the\npracticality and performance implications of executing native network function\n(NF) implementations in AMD SEV-SNP, the latest iteration of SEV. Our study\nfocuses on running an unmodified Snort NF within SEV. Results show an average\nperformance penalty of approximately 20% across various traffic and packet\nconfigurations, demonstrating a trade-off between security and performance that\nmay be acceptable for many NFV deployments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
