The proposed expansive design for a 12-element array of\n8m class telescopes with >1.2 km baselines would indeed revolutionize our\nunderstanding of planet formation and is technically achievable, albeit at a\nhigh cost. It has been 10 years since this conceptual design process began and\nwe give an overview of the status of the PFI project. We also review how a\nscaled back PFI with fewer large telescopes could answer a range of compelling\nscience questions, including in planet formation and as well as totally\ndifferent astrophysics areas. New opportunities make a space-based PFI more\nfeasible now and we give a brief overview of new efforts that could also pave\nthe way for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) space mission.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
