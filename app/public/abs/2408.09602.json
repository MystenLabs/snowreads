By reformulating the DCMRAP as a single-objective\nweighted $L_p$ problem, a distributed solution is enabled, which eliminates the\nneed for predetermined weighting factors or centralized decision-making in\ntraditional methods. Leveraging prescribed-time control and dynamic\nevent-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), novel distributed algorithms are proposed to\nachieve Pareto optimality within a prescribed settling time through sampled\ncommunication. Using generalized time-based generators (TBGs), these algorithms\nprovide more flexibility in optimizing accuracy and control smoothness without\nthe constraints of initial conditions. Novel dynamic ETMs are designed to work\nwith generalized TBGs to promote communication efficiency, which adjusts to\nboth local error metrics and network-based disagreements. The Zeno behavior is\nexcluded. Validated by Lyapunov analysis and simulations, our method\ndemonstrates superior control performance and efficiency compared to existing\nmethods, advancing distributed optimization in complex environments.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
