The WASSA\nshared task on empathy and emotion prediction in interactions presents an\nopportunity to benchmark approaches to these tasks. Appropriately selecting and\nrepresenting the historical context is crucial in the modelling of empathy and\nemotion in conversations. In our submissions, we model empathy, emotion\npolarity and emotion intensity of each utterance in a conversation by feeding\nthe utterance to be classified together with its conversational context, i.e.,\na certain number of previous conversational turns, as input to an encoder\nPre-trained Language Model, to which we append a regression head for\nprediction. We also model perceived counterparty empathy of each interlocutor\nby feeding all utterances from the conversation and a token identifying the\ninterlocutor for which we are predicting the empathy. Our system officially\nranked $1^{st}$ at the CONV-turn track and $2^{nd}$ at the CONV-dialog track.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
