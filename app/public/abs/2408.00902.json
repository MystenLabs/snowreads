In this work, we address the\nnonequilibrium quantum ionic dynamics from first principles. Our approach is\ngeneral and can be applied to simulate any crystal, in combination with a\nfirst-principles treatment of electrons or external machine-learning\npotentials. It is implemented by leveraging the nonequilibrium time-dependent\nself-consistent harmonic approximation (TD-SCHA), with a stable,\nenergy-conserving, correlated stochastic integration scheme that achieves an\naccuracy of $\\mathcal{O}(dt^3)$. We benchmark the method with both a simple\none-dimensional model to test its accuracy and a realistic 40-atom cell of\nSrTiO3 under THz laser pump, paving the way for simulations of ultrafast\nTHz-Xray pump-probe spectroscopy like those performed in synchrotron\nfacilities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
