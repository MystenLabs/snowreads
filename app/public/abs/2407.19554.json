In a 2021 paper, Lemke Oliver, Wang, and Wood proved this conjecture in\nthe case of $p = 3$ for permutation groups $G$ of the form $C_2 \\wr H$ for a\nbroad family of permutation groups $H$, including most nilpotent groups.\nHowever, their theorem does not apply for some nilpotent groups of interest,\nsuch as $H = C_5$. We extend their results to prove that the average size of\n$3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \\wr H$-extensions is finite for any\nnilpotent group $H$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
