This means that when using a standard microscope, any\nminor movement of the object along the optical axis can cause the image to\nbecome blurry. To address this issue, we exploit inverse design techniques to\noptimise a phase mask which, when inserted into a standard microscope, extends\nthe depth of field by a factor of approximately four without compromising the\nmicroscope's resolution. Differentiable Fourier optics simulations allow us to\nrapidly iterate towards an optimised design in a hybrid fashion, starting with\ngradient-free Bayesian optimisation and proceeding to a local gradient-based\noptimisation. To fabricate the device, a commercial two-photon 3D laser\nnanoprinter is used, in combination with a two-step pre-compensation routine,\nproviding high fabrication speed and much better than subwavelength accuracy.\nWe find excellent agreement between our numerical predictions and the\nmeasurements upon integrating the phase mask into a microscope and optically\ncharacterising selected samples. The phase mask enables us to conduct\nsimultaneous multiplane imaging of objects separated by distances that cannot\nbe achieved with the original microscope.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
