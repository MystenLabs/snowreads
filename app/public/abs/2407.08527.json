However, it lacks reading error detection\ncapability in nanowires, which requires high electric current density for the\ndeterministic motion of domain walls (DWs) or skyrmions. Here, we propose a\nmethod of a reading error-detectable RTM and explore domain-stored skyrmion\nstructures for this RTM. This method uses domains as memory cells and assigns\nthe presence and absence of a skyrmion in a domain to different bits, enabling\nthe electrical signal of any memory cells to output the opposite sign to that\nof the adjacent memory cells. Using simulations and Lorentz microscopy, we\ndemonstrate that perpendicularly magnetized nanowires with relatively large\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can achieve domain-stored skyrmion\nstructures. Additionally, our simulations show that when DWs approach to\nskyrmions during spin-orbit torque-induced motion, angular momentum transfers\nfrom DWs to skyrmions, resulting in fast motion of skyrmions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
