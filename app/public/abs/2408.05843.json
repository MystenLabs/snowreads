This problem has been well-studied\nin the literature and has several applications in practice. In each round, we\nrecommend ${S}$ carefully chosen distinct items to every user and observe noisy\nrewards. In the regime where ${M},{N} >> {T}$, we propose two distinct\ncomputationally efficient algorithms for recommending items to users and\nanalyze them under the benign \\emph{hott items} assumption.1) First, for\n${S}=1$, under additional incoherence/smoothness assumptions on ${R}$, we\npropose the phased algorithm \\textsc{PhasedClusterElim}. Our algorithm obtains\na near-optimal per-user regret of\n$\\tilde{O}({N}{M}^{-1}(\\Delta^{-1}+\\Delta_{{hott}}^{-2}))$ where\n$\\Delta_{{hott}},\\Delta$ are problem-dependent gap parameters with\n$\\Delta_{{hott}} >> \\Delta$ almost always. 2) Second, we consider a simplified\nsetting with ${S}=r$ where we make significantly milder assumptions on ${R}$.\nHere, we introduce another phased algorithm, \\textsc{DeterminantElim}, to\nderive a regret guarantee of $\\widetilde{O}({N}{M}^{-1/r}\\Delta_{det}^{-1}))$\nwhere $\\Delta_{{det}}$ is another problem-dependent gap. Both algorithms\ncrucially use collaboration among users to jointly eliminate sub-optimal items\nfor groups of users successively in phases, but with distinctive and novel\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fgH9icPtUbkfraYUT0ZAzWf8_hBzmP8VobHlmDjzJfk","pdfSize":"1224845"}
