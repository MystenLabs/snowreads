Moreover, we\nintroduce the Embeddings Specialization Stage to purify the feature\nrepresentation with the help of a given scene-level label, specifying a better\nfeature supervised by the corresponding text embedding. Thus, the 3D model is\nable to gain informative supervisions both from the image embedding and text\nembedding, leading to competitive segmentation performances. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D weakly supervised semantic\nsegmentation by using the textual semantic information of text category labels.\nMoreover, with extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we present\nthat our 3DSS-VLG is able not only to achieve the state-of-the-art performance\non both S3DIS and ScanNet datasets, but also to maintain strong generalization\ncapability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
