It is vital\nto ensure the safety of such systems and stop the evolution of the system with\nerror before causing harm to human participants. We propose a model-agnostic\napproach to detecting unknown errors in such human-centered systems without\nrequiring any knowledge about the error signatures. Our approach employs\ndynamics-induced hybrid recurrent neural networks (DiH-RNN) for constructing\nphysics-based models from operational data, coupled with conformal inference\nfor assessing errors in the underlying model caused by violations of physical\nlaws, thereby facilitating early detection of unknown errors before unsafe\nshifts in operational data distribution occur. We evaluate our framework on\nmultiple real-world safety critical systems and show that our technique\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art in detecting unknown errors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
