This holds also in the\nstrong coupling case. We also show that for mean field coupled systems\nsatisfying uniformly a Lasota-Yorke inequality also the differential does. We\npresent examples of application of the general results to deterministic\nexpanding maps outside the weak coupling regime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
