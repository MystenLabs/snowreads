This heterogeneous phase distribution\ncontributes to multiple deformation and damage mechanisms. The presence of\nbrittle phases promotes crack initiation and propagation. This study reveals a\nnew deformation and damage mechanism of a Zn-Al-Mg coating, where twinning can\ninduce crack initiation in the eutectic region. The chronology of different\nevents leading to crack initiation and propagation is clearly established by\nin-situ tensile testing in a scanning electron microscope, which helps to\nestablish a detailed characterization of the mechanical behavior of the\ncoating.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
