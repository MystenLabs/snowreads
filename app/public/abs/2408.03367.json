The intrinsic line profiles of the Ka and Kb lines of Cr, Mn, Fe,\nCo, Ni, and Cu were implemented based on a multi-Lorentzian parameterisation\nand line energies are sampled from these Lorentzian components during the\nradiative transfer routine. In the optically thin regime, the SKIRT results\nmatch the intrinsic line profiles as measured in the laboratory. With a more\ncomplex 3D model that also includes kinematics, we find that the intrinsic line\nprofiles are broadened and shifted to an extent that will be detectable with\nXRISM/Resolve; this model also demonstrates the importance of the intrinsic\nline shapes for constraining kinematics. We find that observed line profiles\ndirectly trace the cold-gas kinematics, without any additional radiative\ntransfer effects. With the advent of the first XRISM/Resolve data, this update\nto the X-ray radiative transfer framework of SKIRT is timely and provides a\nunique tool for constraining the velocity structure of cold gas from X-ray\nmicrocalorimeter spectra.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
