However, the\nAharonov-Casher theory indicates the possibility of topological effects for\nneutral particles. In this work, we predict the skyrmion Hall effect in\nemerging altermagnets with zero net magnetization and zero skyrmion charge. We\nfirst show that the neutral skyrmion manifests as a magnetic quadrupole in\naltermagnets. We reveal a hidden gauge field from the magnetic quadrupole,\nwhich induces the skyrmion Hall effect when driven by spin transfer torque.\nInterestingly, we identify a sign change of the Hall angle when one swaps the\nanisotropic exchange couplings in altermagnets. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat both the velocity and Hall angle of altermagnetic skyrmions sensitively\ndepend on the current direction. Our findings real the critical role of\nmagnetic quadrupole in driving the skyrmion Hall effect with vanishing charge,\nand pave the way to discovering new Hall effect of neutral quasiparticles\nbeyond magnetic skyrmions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e8AnrYwuLGDOLwyAAg3ffbFbCtudyG6JqEBFwY78C3I","pdfSize":"7888865"}
