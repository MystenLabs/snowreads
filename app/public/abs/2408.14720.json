We provide the Poisson algebra of their Darboux\npolynomials, and prove a contraction theorem. We then use these results to\nclassify the systems according to the number of functionally independent (and,\nfor some, commuting) integrals. We also establish separability/solvability by\nquadratures, given the solutions to the 2- and 3-dimensional systems, which we\nprovide in terms of the Lambert W function.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
