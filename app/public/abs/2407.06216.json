The digital\ntwin consists of three modules emulating a closed-loop system: fuzzy logic for\nthe expert control, a state-space model for regulatory control, and a recurrent\nneural network for the SAG mill process. The model was trained with 68 hours of\ndata and validated with 8 hours of test data. It predicts the mill's behavior\nwithin a 2.5-minute horizon with a 30-second sampling time. The disturbance\ndetection evaluates the need for retraining, and the digital twin shows promise\nfor supervising the SAG mill with the expert control system. Future work will\nfocus on integrating this digital twin into real-time optimization strategies\nwith industrial validation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
