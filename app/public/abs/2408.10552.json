The objective is\nto minimize the transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamformers and the MA\npositions while satisfying the minimum-achievable-rate requirement for each\nuser. We propose a two-loop dynamic neighborhood pruning particle swarm\noptimization (DNPPSO) algorithm that significantly reduces computational\ncomplexity while effectively maintaining the performance of the standard\nparticle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Simulation results validate the\neffectiveness and advantages of the proposed scheme in power-saving for\nmultiuser communications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ai6_NehLVasYj8FfSBv-MtGhYXJ-28tgfiTFegwzD2k","pdfSize":"742568"}
