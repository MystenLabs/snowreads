We study symmetry-protected topological states in $[110]$ SnTe\nnanowires in the presence of various combinations of Zeeman field, $s-$wave\nsuperconductivity, inversion-symmetry-breaking field and the thickness of the\nwire. In the normal state we find a Weyl semimetal phase protected by a twofold\nscrew axis symmetry and a topological insulating phase characterized by a\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ invariant protected by a mirror symmetry. In the presence of\nsuperconductivity, we find inversion-symmetry-protected gapless phase which\nbecomes fully gapped and topologically non-trivial by introducing an\ninversion-symmetry-breaking field. Consequently, we find topologically\nprotected localized Majorana zero modes appear at the ends of the wire. We find\nthat this Majorana phase is much easier to achieve in a $[110]$ SnTe nanowire\nthan in a $[001]$ one.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
