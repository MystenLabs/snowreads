We\ntranscribe a dataset of 11.7k hours, broadcasted in 2023 on 21 French channels.\nA Large Language Model (LLM) is used in few-shot conversation mode to obtain a\ntopic classification on those transcriptions. Using the generated LLM\nannotations, we explore the finetuning of a specialized smaller classification\nmodel, to reduce the computational cost. To evaluate the performances of these\nmodels, we construct and annotate a dataset of 804 dialogues. This dataset is\nmade available free of charge for research purposes. We show that women are\nnotably underrepresented in subjects such as sports, politics and conflicts.\nConversely, on topics such as weather, commercials and health, women have more\nspeaking time than their overall average across all subjects. We also observe\nrepresentations differences between private and public service channels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"L1eSKF4zVLoStAEBbjZC5bRK1i-1Waq6hu1tI5Abo0c","pdfSize":"188546","objectId":"0x4307b51e6a03ffc342af3f5ecdbcbb78dfa18d775b7f0e21d4e70976b7f2052e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
