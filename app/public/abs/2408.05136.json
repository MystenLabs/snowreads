Proposed\ndescriptors capture the notion of ortho/meta/para patterns that appear in\naromatic rings, which has been impossible in the framework so far.\nComputational experiments show that, when the new descriptors are supplied, we\ncan construct prediction functions of similar or better performance for all of\nthe 27 tested chemical properties. We also provide an MILP formulation that\nasks for a chemical graph with desired properties under the 2L model with CC\ndescriptors (2L+CC model). We show that a chemical graph with up to 50\nnon-hydrogen vertices can be inferred in a practical time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
