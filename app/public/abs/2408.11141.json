We aim\nto study the membership of the variable stars detected in the field of the\ncluster as listed in the Catalogue of Variable stars in Globular Clusters\n(CVSGC; Clement et al. 2001) and reported by the Gaia mission. We cross match\nthe two sets of variables to produce light curves that lead to the estimation\nof physical parameters. The resulting colour-magnitude diagram (CMD), free of\nlikely field stars, enables to confirm the position of the variables, their\ntype and evolutionary stage. We provide new estimations of the period using\ndata acquired on a long timebase. The Fourier decomposition of cluster member\nRR Lyrae light curves lead to a mean metalicity and distance of \\([Fe/H]_{ZW} =\n-1.35 \\pm 0.22\\) dex and \\(11.9 \\pm 0.6\\) kpc. The variability and membership\nof stars reported by Gaia-DR3 as variables in the field of the cluster is\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
