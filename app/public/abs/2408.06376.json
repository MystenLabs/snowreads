Clickbait detection continues to be well studied, but analyses of\nclickbait overall on the web are limited. A dataset was built consisting of\n451,033,388 clickbait scores produced by a clickbait detector which analyzed\nlinks and headings on primarily English news pages from the Common Crawl. On\nthis data, 5 segmented regression models were fit on 5 major news events and\naveraged clickbait scores. COVID and the 2020 US Election appeared to influence\nclickbait levels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"J-B4yV1d1CW97Uh0Iwp3aQ3U6ctcoPQZV-8diUpF57A","pdfSize":"305401"}
