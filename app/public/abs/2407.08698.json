Loyarte. Based on his studies, alone or in collaboration\nwith members of the Institute, towards the end of the 1920s Loyarte proposed\nthe possible existence of a new quantum of rotational energy in the mercury\natom. This idea raised criticism and generated a fierce scientific controversy\nthat reached the national and international academic media. We analyse this\ncontroversy by studying the comments that appeared in international review\njournals. We also study Loyarte's activities in politics and science policy in\nArgentina in the 1930s and 1940s, where he was responsible for interesting\npolitical and scientific initiatives.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
