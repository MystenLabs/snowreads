However, water-window X-ray sources whose\noutput photon energy can be arbitrarily specified - a crucial feature in many\nhigh-contrast imaging applications - are still challenging to obtain except at\nlarge synchrotron facilities. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by\ndemonstrating table-top, water-window X-ray generation from free\nelectron-driven van der Waals materials, resulting in output photon energies\nthat can be continuously tuned across the entire water window regime. In\naddition, we present a truly predictive theoretical framework that combines\nfirst-principles electromagnetism with Monte Carlo simulations to accurately\npredict the photon flux and brightness in absolute numbers. Using this\nframework, we theoretically obtain fundamental scaling laws for the tunable\nphoton flux, showing good agreement with experimental results and providing a\npath to the design of powerful emitters based on free electron-driven quantum\nmaterials. We show that we can achieve photon fluxes needed for imaging and\nspectroscopy applications (over 1E8 photons per second on sample) where\ncompactness is important, and the ultrahigh fluxes of synchrotron sources are\nnot needed. Importantly, our theory highlights the critical role played by the\nlarge mean free paths and interlayer atomic spacings unique to van der Waals\nstructures, showing the latter's advantages over other materials in generating\nwater window X-rays. Our results should pave the way to advanced techniques and\nnew modalities in water-window X-ray generation and high-resolution biological\nimaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
