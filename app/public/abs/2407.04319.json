In\nthis theoretical study, we develop a minimal model incorporating\nviscoelasticity, carrying out a perturbation analysis in both the elastic\ndeformation of the wall and its viscous damping. Our approach reveals the\nsingular-perturbation nature of viscoelasticity to soft lubrication. Numerical\nresolution of the resulting non-linear, singular and coupled equations of\nmotion reveals peculiar effects of viscoelasticity on confined colloidal\nmobility, opening the way towards the description of complex migration\nscenarios near realistic polymeric substrates and biological membranes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
