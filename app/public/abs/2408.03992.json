Our main finding is that nearly every new\nparticle which matches at tree level to dimension-six operators of the Standard\nModel Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) affects electroweak precision observables\n(EWPOs) at either tree level or via one loop renormalisation group (RG)\nrunning. This is true almost regardless of the structure of couplings to the\nStandard Model; just a handful of exceptions are identified which can produce\nzeroes in the EWPO RG equations. Under simple flavour assumptions, we perform\nfits of each state to projected FCC-ee $Z$ pole measurements, showing that all\nscenarios can be tested at the TeV scale or better, with many projected\nexclusions reaching tens of TeV. Tera-$Z$ is argued to provide an almost\ninescapable probe of heavy new physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
