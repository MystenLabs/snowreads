The optimization\nmethodology utilized here is Differential Evolution (DE), complemented by an\nimproved electrostatic model for solving electrostatic equations. In this\nelectrostatic model, two elliptic equations, governing electrical potential and\nplasma density, are independently resolved, and their solutions are\nsubsequently incorporated as source terms within the Navier-Stokes equations.\nNotably, contrary to prior research suggesting the placement of the plasma\nactuator at the leading edge of the airfoil, our findings reveal that the\noptimal position for plasma actuation falls within the range of 2 to 4 percent\nof the chord length from the leading edge, contingent upon the prevailing\naerodynamic conditions. Furthermore, we elucidate a mathematical pattern in the\noptimization data across a continuous domain, applicable to various geometries\nand designs. This mathematical model articulates the optimal location as a\ncomplex function, dependent on both the linear Reynolds effect and the angular\nimpact of the angle of attack.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JKxljemeaCkBM7K-ArSRIoMc0FQ3OXE8awY3f0oAjB0","pdfSize":"14542517"}
