Maturity rating offers a quick and\neffective method for potential users, particularly guardians, to assess the\nmaturity levels of apps. Determining accurate maturity ratings for mobile apps\nis essential to protect children's health in today's saturated digital\nmarketplace. Existing approaches to maturity rating are either inaccurate\n(e.g., self-reported rating by developers) or costly (e.g., manual\nexamination). In the literature, there are few text-mining-based approaches to\nmaturity rating. However, each app typically involves multiple modalities,\nnamely app description in the text, and screenshots in the image. In this\npaper, we present a framework for determining app maturity levels that utilize\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), specifically ChatGPT-4 Vision.\nPowered by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, our framework systematically\nleverages ChatGPT-4 to process multimodal app data (i.e., textual descriptions\nand screenshots) and guide the MLLM model through a step-by-step reasoning\npathway from initial content analysis to final maturity rating determination.\nAs a result, through explicitly incorporating CoT reasoning, our framework\nenables ChatGPT to understand better and apply maturity policies to facilitate\nmaturity rating. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method\noutperforms all baseline models and other fusion strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
