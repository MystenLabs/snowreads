For Hardy spaces, this provides a much simpler\nproof than the one due to Livingston that involves abstract functional analysis\narguments and an approximation theorem. For Bergman spaces, we have not been\nable to locate any examples or proofs in the existing literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
