We\nidentify reliability criteria, describe how they are applied in practice, and\ncompare them to prior work. Based on our analysis, we distinguish between\nmanipulable and less manipulable criteria and compare politically diverse\nlaypeople as end users and journalists as expert users. We discuss 11 widely\nrecognized criteria, including the following 6 criteria that are difficult to\nmanipulate: content, political alignment, authors, professional standards, what\nsources are used, and a website's reputation. Finally, we describe how\ntechnology may be able to support people in applying these criteria in practice\nto assess the reliability of websites.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
