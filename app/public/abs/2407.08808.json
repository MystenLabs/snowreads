New types of complex crystal structures seek more\ninvolvement of advanced techniques and understandings as well as developing new\nkinds of machinery. Despite the existence of proper experimental techniques of\ncrystal structure detection, it lacks the exact approach to obtain the complete\nunit cell information from the three dimensional coordinates only. In this\nresearch, we propose an exact prescription to detect the crystal structures in\nreal-space based on the arrangements of the local environment and by searching\nfor the directions of possible translational vectors. The protocol yields good\nagreements with the experimental results for any simple or complex crystal\nstructures irrespective of the single-component or multi-component systems\nallowing the complete execution to take a minimal time and computational cost.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this algorithmic prescription can be applied to\ndetect the unit cell of crystal structure and identify the space group across\nthe domains of condensed matter physics and material sciences.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
