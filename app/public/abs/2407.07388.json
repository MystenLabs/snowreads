In\nthis paper, we consider a probabilistic model-based algorithm using the family\nof categorical distributions as its underlying distribution and set the sample\nsize as two. We term this specific algorithm the categorical compact genetic\nalgorithm (ccGA). The ccGA can be considered as an extension of the compact\ngenetic algorithm (cGA), which is an efficient binary optimization algorithm.\nWe theoretically analyze the dependency of the number of possible categories\n$K$, the number of dimensions $D$, and the learning rate $\\eta$ on the runtime.\nWe investigate the tail bound of the runtime on two typical linear functions on\nthe categorical domain: categorical OneMax (COM) and KVal. We derive that the\nruntimes on COM and KVal are $O(\\sqrt{D} \\ln (DK) / \\eta)$ and $\\Theta(D \\ln K/\n\\eta)$ with high probability, respectively. Our analysis is a generalization\nfor that of the cGA on the binary domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cfzswENhk6haSyFvUUsdTyBrv1Oa3UB3H-YXNwj8oUU","pdfSize":"1905587","objectId":"0x43849f5301229ef95f81ad2aa0cf56fd202103e579084a1faf32f762644162fe","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
