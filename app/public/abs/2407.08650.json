Multi-lesion\nlung SABR plans are complex and require significant resources to create. In\nthis work, we propose a novel two-stage latent transformer framework (LDFormer)\nfor dose prediction of lung SABR plans with varying numbers of lesions. In the\nfirst stage, patient anatomical information and the dose distribution are\nencoded into a latent space. In the second stage, a transformer learns to\npredict the dose latent from the anatomical latents. Causal attention is\nmodified to adapt to different numbers of lesions. LDFormer outperforms a\nstate-of-the-art generative adversarial network on dose conformality in and\naround lesions, and the performance gap widens when considering overlapping\nlesions. LDFormer generates predictions of 3-D dose distributions in under 30s\non consumer hardware, and has the potential to assist physicians with clinical\ndecision making, reduce resource costs, and accelerate treatment planning.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RTbQ7RrTHxkb5PaE-JdkZp6u3vwipjP13kQD80WPNLY","pdfSize":"7642481"}
