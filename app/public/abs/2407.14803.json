We give some criteria for\n$\\mathscr{A}$ to be homologically smooth in terms of the singularity category,\nthe cone length of the canonical module $k$ and the global dimension of\n$\\mathscr{A}$. For any cohomologically finite DG $\\mathscr{A}$-module $M$, we\nshow that it is compact when $\\mathscr{A}$ is homologically smooth. If\n$\\mathscr{A}$ is in addition Gorenstein, we get $$\\mathrm{CMreg}M =\n\\mathrm{depth}_{\\mathscr{A}}\\mathscr{A} + \\mathrm{Ext.reg}\\, M<\\infty,$$ where\n$\\mathrm{CMreg}M$ is the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $M$,\n$\\mathrm{depth}_{\\mathscr{A}}\\mathscr{A}$ is the depth of $\\mathscr{A}$ and $\n\\mathrm{Ext.reg}\\, M$ is the Ext-regularity of $M$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
