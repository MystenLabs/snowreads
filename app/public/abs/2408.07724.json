Complex,\nhigh dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific disciplines,\nincluding machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One of the\nprimary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two dimensional scatter\nplots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because visually\ndetermining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers often use\nquality metrics to measure projection accuracy or faithfulness to the full\ndata. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized stress, is\nsensitive to uniform scaling of the projection, despite this act not\nmeaningfully changing anything about the projection. We investigate the effect\nof scaling on stress and other distance based quality metrics analytically and\nempirically by showing just how much the values change and how this affects\ndimension reduction technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to\nmake normalized stress scale invariant and show that it accurately captures\nexpected behavior on a small benchmark.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
