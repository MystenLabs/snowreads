To ensure maximal containment of energy and acceptance for the\nrequired physics processes, the ePIC detector employs calorimetry over almost\nthe entire polar angle. These proceedings provide an overview of the current\ncalorimeter designs being employed in ePIC.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"op1PdwUZxwAttR8YKiyEGRmnZQkN89AaVNnbErby09U","pdfSize":"5560097"}
