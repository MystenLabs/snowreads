This\napproach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models,\nreducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing\nmodel applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures\nthat capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such\nas social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite\nthe success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains\nremains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge\nfeatures often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures\nalso differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to\nincompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on\ndownstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for\nalleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design\nmethodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios\nand datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey\ncategorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design\nprinciples and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs,\nmolecules, proteins, and recommendation systems. Through this extensive review,\nwe provide a foundational understanding of graph prompt learning, aiming to\nimpact not only the graph mining community but also the broader Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence (AGI) community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
