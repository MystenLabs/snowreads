Aiming to obtain more accurate frequency\nestimation for periodic signals of respiration and heartbeat, we propose the\nharmonic MUSIC (HMUSIC) algorithm to consider harmonic components for frequency\nestimation of vital sign signals. In the experiments, we tested different\nsubjects' vital signs. Experimental results demonstrate that the 89-th\npercentile errors in respiration rate and the 88-th percentile errors in\nheartbeat rate are less than 3 respirations per minute and 5 beats per minute.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
