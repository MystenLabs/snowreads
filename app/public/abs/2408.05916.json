Earth surface forecasting represents one such task that\nintegrates satellite images with meteorological data to capture the joint\nevolution of regional climate change effects. However, understanding the\ncomplex relationship between specific meteorological variables and land surface\nevolution poses a significant challenge. In light of this challenge, our paper\nintroduces a pipeline that integrates principles from both perturbation-based\nexplainability techniques like LIME and global marginal explainability\ntechniques like PDP, besides addressing the constraints of using such\ntechniques when applying them to high-dimensional spatiotemporal deep models.\nThe proposed pipeline simplifies the undertaking of diverse investigative\nanalyses, such as marginal sensitivity analysis, marginal correlation analysis,\nlag analysis, etc., on complex land surface forecasting models In this study we\nutilised Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) as the surface\nforecasting model and did analyses on the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI) of the surface forecasts, since meteorological variables like\ntemperature, pressure, and precipitation significantly influence it. The study\narea encompasses various regions in Europe. Our analyses show that\nprecipitation exhibits the highest sensitivity in the study area, followed by\ntemperature and pressure. Pressure has little to no direct effect on NDVI.\nAdditionally, interesting nonlinear correlations between meteorological\nvariables and NDVI have been uncovered.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
