A Rubix Cube has six faces\nand twelve possible actions, leading to a small and unconstrained action space\nand a very large state space with only one goal state. Modeling such a large\nstate space and storing the information of each state requires exceptional\ncomputational resources, which makes it challenging to find the shortest\nsolution to a scrambled Rubix cube with limited resources. The Rubix Cube can\nbe represented as a graph, where states of the cube are nodes and actions are\nedges. Drawing on graph convolutional networks, we design a new heuristic,\nweighted convolutional distance, for A star search algorithm to find the\nsolution to a scrambled Rubix Cube. This heuristic utilizes the information of\nneighboring nodes and convolves them with attention-like weights, which creates\na deeper search for the shortest path to the solved state.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"yztAt8qZBU8Yw1d-PtuiHobCUIwNigu-oLwjvBAlUEQ","pdfSize":"708458"}
