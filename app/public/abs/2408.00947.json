To\ndiscretize the continuous problem in space, we utilize a spectral Galerkin\nmethod. Subsequently, we introduce a nonlinear-tamed exponential integrator\nscheme, resulting in a fully discrete scheme. Within the framework of semigroup\ntheory, this study provides precise estimations of the Sobolev regularity,\n$L^\\infty$ regularity in space, and H\\\"older continuity in time for the mild\nsolution, as well as for its semi-discrete and full-discrete approximations.\nBuilding upon these results, we establish moment boundedness for the numerical\nsolution and obtain strong convergence rates in both spatial and temporal\ndimensions. A numerical example is presented to validate the theoretical\nfindings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
