It was described by Block and Purcel in 1946, and it was not until\n1980 that the first clinical application of MRI became available. Since that\ntime the MRI has gone through many advances and has altered the way diagnosing\nprocedures are performed. Due to its ability to improve constantly, MRI has\nbecome a commonly used practice among several specialisations in medicine.\nParticularly starting 0.55T and 7T MRI technologies have pointed out enhanced\npreservation of image detail and advanced tissue characterisation. This review\nexamines the integration of deep learning (DL) techniques into these MRI\nmodalities, disseminating and exploring the study applications. It highlights\nhow DL contributes to 0.55T and 7T MRI data, showcasing the potential of DL in\nimproving and refining these technologies. The review ends with a brief\noverview of how MRI technology will evolve in the coming years.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
