However, to gain deeper insights, it is essential\nto estimate distributional treatment effects rather than relying solely on\naverage effects. Our approach incorporates pre-treatment covariates into a\ndistributional regression framework, utilizing machine learning techniques to\nimprove the precision of distributional treatment effect estimators. The\nproposed approach can be readily implemented with off-the-shelf machine\nlearning methods and remains valid as long as the nuisance components are\nreasonably well estimated. Also, we establish the asymptotic properties of the\nproposed estimator and present a uniformly valid inference method. Through\nsimulation results and real data analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nintegrating machine learning techniques in reducing the variance of\ndistributional treatment effect estimators in finite samples.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
