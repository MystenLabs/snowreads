In addition to preparing monthly reports on fund\nmanagement, fund managers prepare management reports that summarize these\nmonthly reports every six months or once a year. The preparation of fund\nreports is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper,\nwe tackle investment summarization from monthly reports using transformer-based\nmodels. There are two main types of summarization methods: extractive\nsummarization and abstractive summarization, and this study constructs both\nmethods and examines which is more useful in summarizing investment reports.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
