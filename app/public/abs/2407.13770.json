Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations at\nfilling $\\nu=1$ yield a gapped ground state with Chern number 1 through band\nmixing, identifying a possible parent state. However, many-body calculations\nrestricted to the occupied HF band predispose the system towards FCIs and are\nessentially uncontrolled. In this work, we use unbiased multi-band exact\ndiagonalization (ED) to allow fluctuations into the gapless bands for two\nnormal-ordering schemes. In the \"charge neutrality\" scheme, the weak moir\\'e\npotential leads to theoretical proposals based on Wigner crystal-like states.\nHowever, we find that FCIs seen in 1-band ED calculations are destroyed by band\nmixing, becoming gapless as fluctuations are included. In the \"average\" scheme,\nthe Coulomb interaction with the periodic valence charge background sets up a\nstronger moir\\'e potential. On small systems, FCIs at $\\nu=1/3$ are destroyed\nin multi-band calculations, while those at $\\nu=2/3$ are initially\nstrengthened. However we do not converge to a stable FCI at $\\nu=2/3$ even on\nthe largest accessible systems. These findings question prior results obtained\nwithin projection to a single HF band. They suggest that current models do not\nsupport FCIs with correlation length small enough to be converged in\naccessible, unbiased ED calculations, or do not support FCIs at all.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rGOaVwq0Cy7KOrSQgZJEfkUK555WiNiimCqztd5V23I","pdfSize":"24500089","objectId":"0x56af7e7747a94c604f5095f8c45041f083e766deb29b039559e9888e94b32586","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
