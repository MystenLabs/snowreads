We resolve this by constructing infinitely\nmany quartic del Pezzo surfaces over $\\mathbb{Q}$ without degree $2$ points.\nThese are the first examples of smooth intersections of two quadrics with index\nstrictly less than the minimal degree of a closed point.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JOwAog193o4gXmbCoz3IFS7RKlCgYeqnmjwcyMMtxiQ","pdfSize":"161862"}
