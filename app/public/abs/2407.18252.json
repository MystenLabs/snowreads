We\nshow that effectively massless mediators lead to an enhancement of the matter\npower spectrum, while heavier mediators lead to a suppression, together with a\nfeature around their Jeans scale. We derive the strongest present constraints\nby combining Planck and BOSS data. The recent DESI measurements of Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillations exhibit a mild preference for long-range\nself-interactions, as strong as 4 per mille of the gravitational coupling.\nForthcoming data from DESI itself and Euclid will confirm or disprove such a\nhint.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
