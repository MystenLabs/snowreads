While recent learning-based optical flow methods have\nachieved high accuracy, they often come with significant computational costs.\nIn this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow method that balances\nhigh accuracy with reduced computational demands. Building upon NeuFlow v1, we\nintroduce new components including a much more light-weight backbone and a fast\nrefinement module. Both these modules help in keeping the computational demands\nlight while providing close to state of the art accuracy. Compares to other\nstate of the art methods, our model achieves a 10x-70x speedup while\nmaintaining comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world data. It is\ncapable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin\nNano.
