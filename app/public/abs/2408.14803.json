In Phase I, we analyze and\ncharacterize a large family of zonal kernels (e.g., the spherical version of\nPoisson kernel, Gaussian, compactly-supported radial kernels), so that the\nunderlying spherical convolution operators (upon the introduction of a scaling\nparameter) attains a high-order of approximation to target functions. In Phase\nII, we discretize the spherical integrals utilizing quadrature rules of optimal\norder to produce the final quasi-interpolants. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that the new quasi-interpolation algorithm is robust and amenable\nto integrated as well as distributed ways of implementation. Moreover, the\nunderlying error-analysis shows that by fine-tuning the scaling parameter in\nthe radial kernels employed, the resulting quasi-interpolants achieve a\nwell-balanced trade-off between approximation and sampling errors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
