In real world scenario, such mobile nodes\ncan be part of any biological network, transportation network, social network,\nhuman interaction, etc. The change in the geometry leads to the change in\nvarious desirable properties of real-world networks especially in human\ninteraction networks. In real life, human movement is concerned for better\nlifestyle where they form their new connections due to the geographical\nchanges. Therefore, in this paper, we design a model for geometric networks\nwith mobile nodes (GNMN) and conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of\ntheir properties. We analyze the effect of node mobility by evaluating key\nnetwork metrics such as connectivity, node degree distribution, second hop\nneighbors, and centrality measures. Through extensive simulations, we observe\nsignificant variations in the behavior of geometric networks with mobile nodes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MuURepWgT5HZ10OBE3r-Jo_eQD-5J50JsebdW80eOGg","pdfSize":"3273187"}
