The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop\nself-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light quark\nmesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift.\nOur results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson\n($\\bar{b} c$ or $b \\bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\\eta_c (\\bar{c} c)$\nand $\\eta_b (\\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be\nin-between of them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in-between of the\n$J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in\neach meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding\nmeson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
