Solving such optimization problems\nrequires sophisticated algorithms and optimization techniques. A major trend in\nrecent years is the use of nature-inspired metaheustic algorithms (NIMA).\nDespite the popularity of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, there are\nstill some challenging issues and open problems to be resolved. Two main issues\nrelated to current NIMAs are: there are over 540 algorithms in the literature,\nand there is no unified framework to understand the search mechanisms of\ndifferent algorithms. Therefore, this paper attempts to analyse some\nsimilarities and differences among different algorithms and then presents a\ngeneralized evolutionary metaheuristic (GEM) in an attempt to unify some of the\nexisting algorithms. After a brief discussion of some insights into\nnature-inspired algorithms and some open problems, we propose a generalized\nevolutionary metaheuristic algorithm to unify more than 20 different algorithms\nso as to understand their main steps and search mechanisms. We then test the\nunified GEM using 15 test benchmarks to validate its performance. Finally,\nfurther research topics are briefly discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
