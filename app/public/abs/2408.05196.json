When combined with\ndeep learning techniques to predict and represent molecular-phenotype\ninteractions, these advancements hold the potential to significantly accelerate\nand enhance drug discovery applications. This work focuses on the novel task of\nHCI-guided molecular design. Generative models for molecule design could be\nguided by HCI data, for example with a supervised model that links molecules to\nphenotypes of interest as a reward function. However, limited labeled data,\ncombined with the high-dimensional readouts, can make training these methods\nchallenging and impractical. We consider an alternative approach in which we\nleverage an unsupervised multimodal joint embedding to define a latent\nsimilarity as a reward for GFlowNets. The proposed model learns to generate new\nmolecules that could produce phenotypic effects similar to those of the given\nimage target, without relying on pre-annotated phenotypic labels. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed method generates molecules with high\nmorphological and structural similarity to the target, increasing the\nlikelihood of similar biological activity, as confirmed by an independent\noracle model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
