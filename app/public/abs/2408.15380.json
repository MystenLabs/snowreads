These\nmethods require precise tuning of multiple tunnel rates, which can be\nchallenging to achieve under realistic experimental conditions, such as when a\nqubit is coupled to a single reservoir. Here, we present a method for\nsingle-shot measurement of a quantum dot qubit with a single reservoir using a\nlatched-readout scheme. Our approach involves pulsing a barrier gate to\ndynamically control qubit-to-reservoir tunnel rates, a method that is readily\napplicable to the latched readout of various spin-based qubits. We use this\nmethod to enable qubit state latching and to reduce the qubit reset time in\nmeasurements of coherent Larmor oscillations of a Si/SiGe quantum dot hybrid\nqubit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1Zg-8vFkYR8B0eLix4NuEjoyr6P59h1vSuMdnzJzzkc","pdfSize":"2783220"}
