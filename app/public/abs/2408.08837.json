Data structures that can\nbe compressed using shuffle coding include multisets, graphs, hypergraphs, and\nothers. We release an implementation that can easily be adapted to different\ndata types and statistical models, and demonstrate that our implementation\nachieves state-of-the-art compression rates on a range of graph datasets\nincluding molecular data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
