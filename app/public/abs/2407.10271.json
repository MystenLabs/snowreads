In this work, we initiate a novel approach for building\nholographic code that can be generally applied in potentially broad and\ninterdisciplinary contexts. Our approach takes an \"opposite\" route to the\nconventional paradigm that is based on bulk tensor-networks. As illustrated in\nan exact model, we start from scalable descriptions of boundary qudits which\ncan guide succinct quantum-circuit simulations, and rigorously show how the\nbulk qudits and the encoding structure emerge from boundary entanglement\npatterns. By investigating the entanglement patterns, we systematically unfold\nthe hypothetical structure for bulk reconstruction and the details of the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula in the formalism of operator-algebra quantum error\ncorrection, demonstrating desired properties that are not yet proved in the\nestablished models. Our work might offer a fresh perspective for the study of\nholographic code.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
