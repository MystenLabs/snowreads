We have carried out iSALE\nsimulations for high-velocity vertical impacts using ANEOS for an\nequation-of-state (EoS) model. To understand the shock fields obtained from\nsimulations, we have investigated the contribution of the thermal and cold\nterms in the EoS model on the Hugoniot curves. Although the thermal and cold\nterms are important for the pressure, the internal energy is mainly determined\nby the thermal term. We thus assume a simple EoS determined by the thermal term\nand then analytically derive the shock internal-energy field, which reproduces\nthe results of simulations well. Using the analytical solution of internal\nenergy and the Hugoniot curve, we have derived the shock pressure field\nanalytically as well. The analytical solutions for internal energy and pressure\nare valid even for impact velocities as low as the sound speed. The solution is\ngood for the vertical direction or within the angles of about 60 degrees. We\nhave applied the solution to impact vaporization for the formation of planetary\natmospheres. This gives good estimation of reformation of the planetary\natmospheres of Earth sized planet.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
