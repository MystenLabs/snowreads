By precisely\ncontrolling the spectral power distribution (SPD) of illumination and\nharnessing the unique phenomenon of metamerism, our system achieves unique\ncolor variations in ways you've never seen before. Our system calculates the\noptimal SPDs of illumination for given materials to intensively induce\nmetamerism, and then synthesizes the illumination using various colors of LEDs.\nWe successfully demonstrated the system's implementation at Paris Fashion Week\n2024. As models step onto the stage, their dresses initiate a captivating\ntransformation. Our system altering the colors of the dresses, showcasing an\nimpressive transition from one stunning color to another.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
