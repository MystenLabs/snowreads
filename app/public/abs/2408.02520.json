Due to news reports with allegations of human rights violations,\nthere were calls to boycott it. Wearing a OneLove armband was part of a planned\nprotest activity. Controversy around the armband arose when FIFA threatened to\nsanction captains who wear it. To understand what topics Twitter users Tweeted\nabout and what the opinion of German Twitter users was towards the OneLove\narmband, we performed an analysis of German Tweets published during the World\nCup using in-context learning with LLMs. We validated the labels on human\nannotations. We found that Twitter users initially discussed the armband's\nimpact, LGBT rights, and politics; after the ban, the conversation shifted\ntowards politics in sports in general, accompanied by a subtle shift in\nsentiment towards neutrality. Our evaluation serves as a framework for future\nresearch to explore the impact of sports activism and evolving public\nsentiment. This is especially useful in settings where labeling datasets for\nspecific opinions is unfeasible, such as when events are unfolding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
