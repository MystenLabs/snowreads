Although the overall phase composition and structure of\nthese matrices are well characterized, the binding sites of Cs in these\nmaterials have not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested that\ncombining the sensitivity of solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) to\nthe local atomic structure with other structural techniques provides insights\ninto the mode of Cs binding and release. Density Functional Theory (DFT) can\nprovide the connection between spectroscopic parameters and geometric\nproperties. However, the reliability of DFT results strongly relies on the\nchoice of a suitable exchange-correlation functional, which for 133Cs, the NMR\nsurrogate for such studies, is not well-established. In this work we benchmark\nvarious functionals against their performance in predicting the geometry of\nvarious simple Cs compounds, their NMR quadrupolar coupling constants, and\ntheir chemical shift values. The results show rev-vdW-DF2 to be a leading,\nthough not a flawless, candidate for these systems, and apparently for\nadditional classes of Cs-containing systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
