Furthermore, we carry out interactive\nsegmentation experiments on said dataset to explore possibilities for efficient\nfurther labeling. The SAM and HQ-SAM models are conceptualized as foundation\nmodels for performing user guided segmentation. In order to measure their\nclaimed generalization capability we evaluate them on WSESeg. Since interactive\nsegmentation offers the benefit of creating easily exploitable ground truth\ndata during test-time, we are going to test various online adaptation methods\nfor the purpose of exploring potentials for improvements without having to\nfine-tune the models explicitly. Our experiments show that our adaptation\nmethods drastically reduce the Failure Rate (FR) and Number of Clicks (NoC)\nmetrics, which generally leads faster to better interactive segmentation\nresults.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
