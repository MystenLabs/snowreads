To quantify approximability, we propose that an ARMA model be viewed as\nan approximation of a stationary random variable. We map these stationary\nrandom variables to Hardy space functions, and formulate a new function\napproximation problem that corresponds to random variable approximation, and\nthus to ARMA. Based on this Hardy space formulation we identify a class of\nstationary processes where approximation guarantees are feasible. We also\nidentify an idealized stationary random process for which we conjecture that a\ngood ARMA approximation is not possible. Next, we provide a constructive proof\nthat Pad\\'e approximations do not always correspond to the best ARMA\napproximation. Finally, we note that the spectral methods adopted in this paper\ncan be seen as a generalization of unit root methods for stationary processes\neven when an ARMA model is not defined.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
