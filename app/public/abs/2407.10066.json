In this paper, we proposed an IoT health based monitoring\nsystem which comprises of a wearable wristband mounted on the patient wrist to\neliminate the concept of patient's being static. The wearable wristband\ncomposed of a digital temperature sensor and a pulse rate sensor can remotely\nmonitor health status and utilizing Thingspeak result viewed via a web app or\ndelivered on a smartphone to a specialist who is in a remote location. In order\nto achieve high accuracy in readings, the signal measured from the pulse rate\nsensor was passed through a two stage Hp-Lp circuit to eliminate DC offset and\nnoise. In addition, a scaling factor of 10.41909 was formulated and used to\nconvert the digital output from the pulse rate sensor into a more accurate\nrepresentation of the patient heat rate readings. The results displayed by the\nproposed system proved the system to be well suited and reliable for healthcare\nmonitoring.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ff9ZheL5uxHtrOkdRQ-jwxvg_ymS0Wms8wp7eESG5io","pdfSize":"953380"}
