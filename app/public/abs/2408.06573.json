More precisely, the convolution of two measures with connected\nsupports also has connected support. The result holds without any absolute\ncontinuity or bounded support hypotheses on the measures being convolved. We\nalso show that the results of Moreillon and Schnelli concerning the number of\ncomponents of the support of a free additive convolution hold for arbitrary\nmeasures with bounded supports. Finally, we provide an approach to the\ncorresponding results in the case of free multiplicative convolutions of\nprobability measures on the unit circle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
