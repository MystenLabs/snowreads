This problem has rich connections to\nrelative entropy minimization, Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge, the enumeration of\ncontingency tables, and random graphs with given degree sequences. We show that\nsuch margin-constrained random matrix is sharply concentrated around a certain\ndeterministic matrix, which we call the \\textit{typical table}. Typical tables\nhave dual characterizations: (1) the expectation of the random matrix ensemble\nwith minimum relative entropy from the base model constrained to have the\nexpected target margin, and (2) the expectation of the maximum likelihood model\nobtained by rank-one exponential tilting of the base model. The structure of\nthe typical table is dictated by two dual variables, which give the maximum\nlikelihood estimates of the tilting parameters. Based on these results, for a\nsequence of \"tame\" margins that converges in \\( L^{1} \\) to a limiting\ncontinuum margin as the size of the matrix diverges, we show that the sequence\nof margin-constrained random matrices converges in cut norm to a limiting\nkernel, which is the $L^{2}$-limit of the corresponding rescaled typical\ntables. The rate of convergence is controlled by how fast the margins converge\nin $L^{1}$. We derive several new results for random contingency tables from\nour general framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
