We\ncall it {\\it quintessential early dark energy} model in which early and late\ndark energy are explained by a single scalar field. In other words two\ndifferent energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To\nachieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential. This\npotential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat\nregion followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial\nrole in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential\ncan almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time\nacceleration. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential,\nmodified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the\navailable background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024),\nsupernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements.\nThe maximum improvement we get in the present value of Hubble parameter\ncompared to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model is for the axionlike potential. For\nother potentials the constraints are similar to the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
