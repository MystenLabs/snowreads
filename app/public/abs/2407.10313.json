We provide lower bounds for its smallest\nsingular value when $\\Omega$ is either a ball or cube of radius $m$, and under\ndifferent types of geometric assumptions on $\\mathcal{X}$. We first show that\nif distances between points in $\\mathcal{X}$ are lower bounded by a $\\delta$\nthat is allowed to be arbitrarily small, then the smallest singular value is at\nleast $Cm^{d/2} (m\\delta)^{\\lambda-1}$, where $\\lambda$ is the maximum number\nof elements in $\\mathcal{X}$ contained within any ball or cube of an explicitly\ngiven radius. This estimate communicates a localization effect of the Fourier\ntransform. While it is sharp, the smallest singular value behaves better than\nexpected for many $\\mathcal{X}$, including when we dilate a generic set by\nparameter $\\delta$. We next show that if there is a $\\eta$ such that, for each\n$x\\in\\mathcal{X}$, the set $\\mathcal{X}\\setminus\\{x\\}$ locally consists of at\nmost $r$ hyperplanes whose distances to $x$ are at least $\\eta$, then the\nsmallest singular value is at least $C m^{d/2} (m\\eta)^r$. For dilations of a\ngeneric set by $\\delta$, the lower bound becomes $C m^{d/2} (m\\delta)^{\\lceil\n(\\lambda-1)/d\\rceil }$. The appearance of a $1/d$ factor in the exponent\nindicates that compared to worst case scenarios, the condition number of\nnonharmonic Fourier transforms is better than expected for typical sets and\nimprove with higher dimensionality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
