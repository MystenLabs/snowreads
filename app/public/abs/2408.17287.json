However, previous studies\nhave highlighted the subpar performance of LMC in reliably recording hand\nkinematics. In this study, we employ four LMC devices to optimize their\ncollective tracking volume, aiming to enhance the accuracy and precision of\nhand kinematics. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we determine an optimized\nlayout for the four LMC devices and subsequently conduct reliability and\nvalidity experiments encompassing 1560 trials across ten subjects. The combined\ntracking volume is validated against an MMC system, particularly for kinematic\nmovements involving wrist, index, and thumb flexion. Utilizing calculation\nresources in one computer, our result of the optimized configuration has a\nbetter visibility rate with a value of 0.05 $\\pm$ 0.55 compared to the initial\nconfiguration with -0.07 $\\pm$ 0.40. Multiple Leap Motion Controllers (LMCs)\nhave proven to increase the interaction space of capture volume but are still\nunable to give agreeable measurements from dynamic movement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hObvghPl8FYfmsEa1xVx0vHtK813VZb3AED41HyE27Y","pdfSize":"6875985"}
