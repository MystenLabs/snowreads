Only a few transiting planets have been detected around stars\nyounger than 100 Myr. We initially detected a transit-like signal in the K2\nlight curve of a very cool M dwarf star (EPIC 211101996) in the Pleiades open\ncluster, with an estimated age of about 100 Myr. Our detailed analysis of the\nper-pixel light curves, detrending with the W\\={o}tan software and transit\nsearch with the Transit Least Squares algorithm showed that the source of the\nsignal is a contaminant source (Gaia DR3 66767847894609792) 20\" west of the\ntarget. The V-like shape of its phase-folded light curve and eclipse depth of\n~15% suggest that it is a grazing eclipsing binary. The contaminant has\nhitherto been listed as a single star, which we now identify as an eclipsing\nstellar binary with a period of about 6 days.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
