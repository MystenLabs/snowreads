This identity will\nallow us to understand the interaction of different aspects of the nonlinearity\nin the Navier--Stokes equation from the strain and vorticity perspective,\nparticularly as they relate to the depletion of the nonlinearity by advection.\nWe will prove global regularity for the strain-vorticity interaction model\nequation, a model equation for studying the impact of the vorticity on the\nevolution of strain which has the same identity for enstrophy growth as the\nfull Navier--Stokes equation. We will also use this identity to obtain several\nnew regularity criteria for the Navier--Stokes equation, one of which will help\nto clarify the circumstances in which advection can work to deplete the\nnonlinearity, preventing finite-time blowup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
