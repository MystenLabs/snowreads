However, these methods require inclusion of\nat least some connected quadruple excitations, which generally scale at best as\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^9)$ with the number of basis functions. It very difficult to\npredict, a priori, the effect correlation past CCSD(T) has on a give reaction\nenergies. The purpose of this work is to examine cost-effective quadruple\ncorrections based on the factorization theorem of many-body perturbation theory\nthat may address these challenges. We show that the $\\mathcal{O}(N^7)$,\nfactorized CCSD(TQ${}_\\text{f}$) method introduces minimal error to predicted\ncorrelation and reaction energies as compared to the $\\mathcal{O}(N^9)$\nCCSD(TQ). Further, we examine the performance of Goodson's continued fraction\nmethod in the estimation of CCSDT(Q)${}_\\Lambda$ contributions to reaction\nenergies, as well as a \"new\" method related to %TAE[(T)] that we refer to as a\nscaled perturbation estimator. We find that the scaled perturbation estimator\nbased upon CCSD(TQ${}_\\text{f}$)/cc-pVDZ is capable of predicting\nCCSDT(Q)${}_\\Lambda$/cc-pVDZ contributions to reaction energies with an average\nerror of 0.07 kcal mol${}^{-1}$ and a RMST of 0.52 kcal mol${}^{-1}$ when\napplied to a test-suite of nearly 3000 reactions. This offers a means by which\nto reliably ballpark how important post-CCSD(T) contributions are to reaction\nenergies while incurring no more than CCSD(T) formal cost and a little mental\nmath.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
