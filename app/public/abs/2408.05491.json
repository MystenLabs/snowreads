In this paper, we consider the dispersion problem for silent robots\n\\cite{gorain2024collaborative}, i.e., no direct, explicit communication between\nany two robots placed in the nodes of an oriented $n$ node ring network. The\nrobots operate in synchronous rounds. The dispersion problem for silent mobile\nrobots has been studied in arbitrary graphs where the robots start from a\nsingle source. In this paper, we focus on the dispersion problem for silent\nmobile robots where robots can start from multiple sources. The robots have\nunique labels from a range $[0,\\;L]$ for some positive integer $L$. Any two\nco-located robots do not have the information about the label of the other\nrobot. The robots have weak multiplicity detection capability, which means they\ncan determine if it is alone on a node. The robots are assumed to be able to\nidentify an increase or decrease in the number of robots present on a node in a\nparticular round. However, the robots can not get the exact number of increase\nor decrease in the number of robots. We have proposed a deterministic\ndistributed algorithm that solves the dispersion of $k$ robots in an oriented\nring in $O(\\log L+k)$ synchronous rounds with $O(\\log L)$ bits of memory for\neach robot. A lower bound $\\Omega(\\log L+k)$ on time for the dispersion of $k$\nrobots on a ring network is presented to establish the optimality of the\nproposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
