This study attempts to\nunpack this complexity by combining exploratory search strategies with the\ntheories of exploratory learning to form a new theoretical model of exploratory\nlearning from the perspective of students' learning. Our work adapts Kolb's\nlearning model by incorporating high-frequency exploration and feedback loops,\naiming to promote deep cognitive and higher-order cognitive skill development\nin students. Additionally, this paper discusses and suggests how advanced LLMs\nintegrated into information retrieval and information theory can support\nstudents in their exploratory searches, contributing theoretically to promoting\nstudent-computer interaction and supporting their learning journeys in the new\nera with LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
