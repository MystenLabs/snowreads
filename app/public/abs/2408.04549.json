As a result, agents\nstruggle to learn cooperative policies through independent reinforcement\nlearning (RL). Indirect reciprocity, where agents consider their interaction\npartner's reputation, has been shown to stabilise cooperation in homogeneous,\nidealised populations. However, more realistic settings are comprised of\nheterogeneous agents with different characteristics and group-based social\nidentities. We study cooperation when agents are stratified into two such\ngroups, and allow reputation updates and actions to depend on group\ninformation. We consider two modelling approaches: evolutionary game theory,\nwhere we comprehensively search for social norms (i.e., rules to assign\nreputations) leading to cooperation and fairness; and RL, where we consider how\nthe stochastic dynamics of policy learning affects the analytically identified\nequilibria. We observe that a defecting majority leads the minority group to\ndefect, but not the inverse. Moreover, changing the norms that judge in and\nout-group interactions can steer a system towards either fair or unfair\ncooperation. This is made clearer when moving beyond equilibrium analysis to\nindependent RL agents, where convergence to fair cooperation occurs with a\nnarrower set of norms. Our results highlight that, in heterogeneous populations\nwith reputations, carefully defining interaction norms is fundamental to tackle\nboth dilemmas of cooperation and of fairness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
