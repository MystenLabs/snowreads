The design features single-mode fibre\ncoupling of the free-space beam, assisted by a fast-steering, tip/tilt mirror\nthat enables first-order turbulence suppression and fine target tracking. The\ntotal power throughput over the free-space link and the scintillation index in\nfibre are optimised. The optimal tip/tilt correction bandwidth and range,\naperture size, and focal length for a given link are derived using analytical\natmospheric turbulence modelling and numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
