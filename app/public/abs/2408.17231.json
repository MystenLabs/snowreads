Mainstream approaches\ntackle this problem as a multi-class segmentation task, providing only visible\npart of pupil/iris, other methods regress elliptical parameters using\nhuman-annotated full pupil/iris parameters. In this paper, we consider two\npriors: projected full pupil/iris circle can be modelled with ellipses (ellipse\nprior), and the visibility of pupil/iris is controlled by openness of\neye-region (condition prior), and design a novel method CondSeg to estimate\nelliptical parameters of pupil/iris directly from segmentation labels, without\nexplicitly annotating full ellipses, and use eye-region mask to control the\nvisibility of estimated pupil/iris ellipses. Conditioned segmentation loss is\nused to optimize the parameters by transforming parameterized ellipses into\npixel-wise soft masks in a differentiable way. Our method is tested on public\ndatasets (OpenEDS-2019/-2020) and shows competitive results on segmentation\nmetrics, and provides accurate elliptical parameters for further applications\nof eye tracking simultaneously.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"45rV-dAPGazMofj16C8HlFfWj3pwCD8IAHGhaYCzsLc","pdfSize":"6055123"}
