Firstly, the\ndecay amplitudes of different modes are related by the SU(3) flavor symmetry.\nThen, relevant experiential data are used to constrain nonperturbative\ncoefficients in the non-resonant and various resonant $B\\to DP\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$\ndecays. Finally, using the constrained nonperturbative coefficients, the\nbranching ratios of not-yet-measured $B\\to D^*P\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ decays with the\nnon-resonant and various charmed resonant contributions are predicted. Many\nbranching ratios are predicted for the first time. We find that $B\\to\nD\\eta'\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell, B_s\\to D_s\\eta'\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ decays only receive the\nnon-resonant contributions, $B\\to D_sK\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$, $B_s\\to\nDK\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$, $B\\to D\\eta\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ and $B_s\\to\nD_s\\eta\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ decays receive both non-resonant and charmed tensor\nresonant contributions, $B^+\\to D^-\\pi^+\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ decays receive the\nnon-resonant, the charmed scalar resonant and the charmed tensor resonant\ncontributions, and other $B\\to D\\pi\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ decays receive all four\nkinds of contributions. These results can be used to test the SU(3) flavor\nsymmetry approach in the four-body semileptonic decays by the future LHCb and\nBelle-II experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l-aCd9vkgYwL9SeFvBMtsj1I0jW_GgCzYv4d-qD1Ry8","pdfSize":"484275"}
