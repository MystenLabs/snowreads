One of its consequences, the central transversal theorem,\nextends both the centerpoint theorem and the ham sandwich theorem. In this\nmanuscript, we establish complex analogues of these results where the\ncorresponding transversals are complex affine spaces. The proof of the complex\nTverberg--Vre\\'cica conjecture for powers of the same prime relies on the\nnon-vanishing of an equivariant Euler class. Additionally, we obtain new\nBorsuk--Ulam-type theorems on complex Stiefel manifolds, which are interesting\non their own. These theorems yield complex analogues of recent extensions of\nthe ham sandwich theorem for mass assignments by Axelrod-Freed and Sober\\'on,\nand provide a direct proof of the complex central transversal theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
