However, existing methods\neither 1) lack guidance from class-specific knowledge (i.e., old class\nprototypes), leading to a bias towards new classes, or 2) constrain\nclass-shared knowledge (i.e., old model weights) excessively without\ndiscrimination, resulting in a preference for old classes. In this paper, to\ntrade off model performance, we propose the Class-specific and Class-shared\nKnowledge (Cs2K) guidance for incremental semantic segmentation. Specifically,\nfrom the class-specific knowledge aspect, we design a prototype-guided pseudo\nlabeling that exploits feature proximity from prototypes to correct pseudo\nlabels, thereby overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, we develop a\nprototype-guided class adaptation that aligns class distribution across\ndatasets via learning old augmented prototypes. Moreover, from the class-shared\nknowledge aspect, we propose a weight-guided selective consolidation to\nstrengthen old memory while maintaining new memory by integrating old and new\nmodel weights based on weight importance relative to old classes. Experiments\non public datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cs2K significantly improves\nsegmentation performance and is plug-and-play.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
