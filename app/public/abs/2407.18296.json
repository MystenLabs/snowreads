In this Letter, we explore the collider and\nastrophysical signatures of new light scalar and pseudoscalar particles\ndominantly coupled to the $\\tau$-lepton. The best experimental prospects are\nexpected at Belle II through the $e^+e^-\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-\\gamma\\gamma$,\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-\\gamma$, $3\\gamma$, mono-$\\gamma$ processes, and the $\\tau$\nanomalous magnetic moment. The correlated effects in these searches can\nunambiguously point toward the underlying new physics dynamics. Moreover, we\nstudy astrophysics bounds - especially from core-collapse supernovae and\nneutron star mergers - finding them particularly effective and complementary to\ncollider bounds. We carry out this program in the well-motivated context of\naxion-like particles as well as generic CP-even and CP-odd particles,\nhighlighting possible ways to discriminate among them.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
