We have previously shown that the relative abundances of some\n$\\alpha$-elements: magnesium, silicon, calcium, and to a greater extent of\ntitanium, as well as yttrium and scandium in such stars are lower than in most\nof other types of stars, bearing similar metallicity. It is found here that\nsome of these metal-rich RR~Lyrae stars also have very low relative abundances\nof sodium, aluminum and nickel. The orbital parameters of all the metal-rich\nRR~Lyrae variables studied in this paper are typical of the Galactic thin or\nthick disk objects, however, unusual chemical composition let us to suggests a\npossible extragalactic origin for some of them.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
