Able to work with diverse text in these\ndomains, large language models (LLMs) have proven capable of answering\nquestions and solving problems. However, I show that end-to-end LLMs still\nsystematically fail to reason about complex events, and they lack\ninterpretability due to their black-box nature. To address these issues, I\npropose three general approaches to use LLMs in conjunction with a structured\nrepresentation of events. The first is a language-based representation\ninvolving relations of sub-events that can be learned by LLMs via fine-tuning.\nThe second is a semi-symbolic representation involving states of entities that\ncan be predicted and leveraged by LLMs via few-shot prompting. The third is a\nfully symbolic representation that can be predicted by LLMs trained with\nstructured data and be executed by symbolic solvers. On a suite of event\nreasoning tasks spanning common-sense inference and planning, I show that each\napproach greatly outperforms end-to-end LLMs with more interpretability. These\nresults suggest manners of synergy between LLMs and structured representations\nfor event reasoning and beyond.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
