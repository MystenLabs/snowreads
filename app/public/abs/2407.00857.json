In this paper we study the relationship\nbetween $K$-frames for $H_1$ and $L$-frames for $H_2$ and $K\\oplus L$-frames\nfor $H_1\\oplus H_2$. The $K\\oplus L$-minimal frames and $K\\oplus L$-orthonormal\nbases for $H_1\\oplus H_2$ are also studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
