Through Monte Carlo simulations,\nwe demonstrate that existing $L_1$-regularized estimation methods, including\nthe Huber estimator and the least absolute deviation (LAD) estimator, exhibit\nsignificant bias when outliers are endogenous. Motivated by this finding, we\ninvestigate $L_0$-regularized estimation methods. We propose systematic\nheuristic algorithms, notably an iterative hard-thresholding algorithm and a\nlocal combinatorial search refinement, to solve the combinatorial optimization\nproblem of the \\(L_0\\)-regularized estimation efficiently. Our Monte Carlo\nsimulations yield two key results: (i) The local combinatorial search algorithm\nsubstantially improves solution quality compared to the initial\nprojection-based hard-thresholding algorithm while offering greater\ncomputational efficiency than directly solving the mixed integer optimization\nproblem. (ii) The $L_0$-regularized estimator demonstrates superior performance\nin terms of bias reduction, estimation accuracy, and out-of-sample prediction\nerrors compared to $L_1$-regularized alternatives. We illustrate the practical\nvalue of our method through an empirical application to stock return\nforecasting.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_9jIlUbh6Vo3-zrxSmDhn1ZetnVf34L42WTzl_YE1SU","pdfSize":"1356702"}
