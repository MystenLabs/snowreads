Specifically, the primary\ntransmitter (PT) equipped with MAs utilizes a maximum ratio transmission (MRT)\nbeamforming scheme to ensure the highest primary rate at the primary user (PU).\nConcurrently, the backscatter device (BD) establishes the secondary\ntransmission by overlaying onto the primary signal. The utilization of MAs aims\nto enhance the secondary rate by optimizing the positions of MAs to improve the\nbeam gain at the BD. Accordingly, the beam gains for both MA and fixed-position\nantenna (FPA) scenarios are analyzed, confirming the effectiveness of the MA\nscheme in achieving the highest primary and secondary rates. Numerical results\nverity the superiority of our proposed MA enabled scheme.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
