We adapt PCA to max-stable distributions using a regression\nsetting and employ max-linear maps to project the random vector to a\nlower-dimensional space while preserving max-stability. We also provide a\ncharacterization of those distributions which allow for a perfect\nreconstruction from the lower-dimensional representation. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how an optimal projection matrix can be consistently estimated and\nshow viability in practice with a simulation study and application to a\nbenchmark dataset.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
