We\nstart with symmetric and almost symmetric $\\mathcal{C}$-semigroups and prove\nthat these notions are independent of term orders. We further investigate the\nconductor and the Ap\\'ery set of a $\\mathcal{C}$-semigroup with respect to a\nminimal extremal ray. Building upon this, we extend the notion of reduced type\nto $\\mathcal{C}$-semigroups and study its extremal behavior. For all $d$ and\nfixed $e \\geq 2d$, we give a class of $\\mathcal{C}$-semigroups of embedding\ndimension $e$ such that both the type and the reduced type do not have any\nupper bound in terms of the embedding dimension. We further explore irreducible\ndecompositions of a $\\mathcal{C}$-semigroup and give a lower bound on the\nirreducible components in an irreducible decomposition. Consequently, we deduce\nthat for each positive integer $k$, there exists a $\\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S$\nsuch that the number of irreducible components of $S$ is at least $k$. A\n$\\mathcal{C}$-semigroup is known as a generalized numerical semigroup when the\nrational cone spanned by the semigroup is full. We classify all the symmetric\ngeneralized numerical semigroups of embedding dimension $2d+1$. Consequently,\nwhen $d>1$, we deduce that a generalized numerical semigroup of embedding\ndimension $2d+1$ is almost symmetric if and only if it is symmetric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
