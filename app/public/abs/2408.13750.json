However, most literature only addresses one of these\ntwo problems separately. In this study, we propose a method to simultaneously\nsolve target assignment and path planning from a perspective of cooperative\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL). To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to model the TAPF problem for intelligent warehouse to\ncooperative multi-agent deep RL, and the first to simultaneously address TAPF\nbased on multi-agent deep RL. Furthermore, previous literature rarely considers\nthe physical dynamics of agents. In this study, the physical dynamics of the\nagents is considered. Experimental results show that our method performs well\nin various task settings, which means that the target assignment is solved\nreasonably well and the planned path is almost shortest. Moreover, our method\nis more time-efficient than baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xC0AfWnT9PpWvhSKjXyVVCEjQAvivN5CZ9HV0GS0iHk","pdfSize":"1453097"}
