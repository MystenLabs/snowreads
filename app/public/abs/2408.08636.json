The method leverages\ninformation from the the undichotomised component to improve power. We extend\nthis method for basket trials, which are gaining popularity in many clinical\nareas. For clinical areas where response outcomes are used, we propose the new\nAugmented Binary method for BAsket trials (ABBA) enhances efficiency by\nborrowing information on the treatment effect between subtrials. The method is\ndeveloped within a latent variable framework using a Bayesian hierarchical\nmodelling approach. We investigate the properties of the proposed methodology\nby analysing point estimates and credible intervals in various simulation\nscenarios, comparing them to the standard analysis for basket trials that\nassumes binary outcome. Our method results in a reduction of 95% high density\ninterval of the posterior distribution of the log odds ratio and an increase in\npower when the treatment effect is consistent across subtrials. We illustrate\nour approach using real data from two clinical trials in rheumatology.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
