The ANS is widely used in various practical systems\nlike Facebook, Apple, Google, Dropbox, Microsoft, and Pixar, due to their high\nperformance, but many researchers still lack much knowledge about the ANS. This\npaper thoroughly explains the encoding and decoding algorithms of the ANS, and\ntheoretically analyzes the average code length achievable by the ANS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
