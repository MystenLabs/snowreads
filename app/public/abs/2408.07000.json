We use this formalism to deduce restrictions on\npossible categorical actions and show how this recovers admissibility results\nthat have appeared in the literature on cyclotomic Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW)\nalgebras and their degenerate versions, also known as cyclotomic Nazarov-Wenzl\nalgebras or VW algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
