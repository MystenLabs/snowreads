We introduce an approach that combines visual\nand tactile sensing for robotic manipulation by learning a neural,\ntactile-informed dynamics model. Our proposed framework, RoboPack, employs a\nrecurrent graph neural network to estimate object states, including particles\nand object-level latent physics information, from historical visuo-tactile\nobservations and to perform future state predictions. Our tactile-informed\ndynamics model, learned from real-world data, can solve downstream robotics\ntasks with model-predictive control. We demonstrate our approach on a real\nrobot equipped with a compliant Soft-Bubble tactile sensor on non-prehensile\nmanipulation and dense packing tasks, where the robot must infer the physics\nproperties of objects from direct and indirect interactions. Trained on only an\naverage of 30 minutes of real-world interaction data per task, our model can\nperform online adaptation and make touch-informed predictions. Through\nextensive evaluations in both long-horizon dynamics prediction and real-world\nmanipulation, our method demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to\nprevious learning-based and physics-based simulation systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
