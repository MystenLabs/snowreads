We introduce the multi-agent flying sidekick traveling\nsalesman problem (MA-FSTSP) on road networks, extending the single truck-drone\nmodel to multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones while considering full\nroad networks for truck restrictions and flexible drone routes. We propose a\nmixed-integer linear programming model and an efficient three-phase heuristic\nalgorithm for this NP-hard problem. Our approach decomposes MA-FSTSP into\nmanageable subproblems of one truck with multiple drones. Then, it computes the\nroutes for trucks without drones in subproblems, which are used in the final\nphase as heuristics to help optimize drone and truck routes simultaneously.\nExtensive numerical experiments on Manhattan and Boston road networks\ndemonstrate our algorithm's superior effectiveness and efficiency,\nsignificantly outperforming both column generation and variable neighborhood\nsearch baselines in solution quality and computation time. Notably, our\napproach scales to more than 300 customers within a 5-minute time limit,\nshowcasing its potential for large-scale, real-world logistics applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
