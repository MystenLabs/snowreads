Recently introduced\nJacobi-Lie T-plurality is based on Leibniz algebras whose structure constants\n${f_{ab}}^c, {f_c}^{ab}, Z_a, Z^a$ satisfy further conditions. Low dimensional\nJacobi-Lie bialgebras were classified a few years ago. We study four- and\nsix-dimensional algebras with structure constants ${f_b}^{ba} = Z^a = 0$ and\nshow that there are several classes consisting of mutually isomorphic algebras.\n  Using isomorphisms between Jacobi-Lie bialgebras we investigate three- and\nfour-dimensional sigma models related by Jacobi-Lie T-plurality with and\nwithout spectators. In the Double Field Theory formulation constant generalized\nfluxes $F_A$ are used in the literature to transform dilaton field. We extend\nthe procedure to non-constant fluxes and verify that obtained backgrounds and\ndilatons solve Supergravity Equations. Most of the resulting backgrounds have\nvanishing curvature scalars and, as can be seen by finding Brinkmann\ncoordinates, represent plane-parallel waves solving Supergravity Equations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QrGzoHMis9EkDMeCDMcqJf2lWGt-q7nLhf7XkcgPuIM","pdfSize":"385152"}
