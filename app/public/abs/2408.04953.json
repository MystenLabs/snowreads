Low-energy\nsupernovae, a class of supernovae with low explosion energy, are particularly\nintriguing due to their stringent constraints on the energy transfer caused by\nnew particles from the supernova core to the mantle. We investigate low-energy\nsupernova constraints on millicharged particles by considering three production\nchannels in the core: plasmon decay, proton bremsstrahlung, and\nelectron-positron annihilation processes. We find that the electron-positron\nannihilation process, previously omitted in supernova studies on millicharged\nparticles, is the dominant production channel in the high-mass region. By\nstudying the energy deposition due to Coulomb scatterings with protons in the\nsupernova mantle, we find that low-energy supernovae impose the most stringent\nconstraints on millicharged particles in the mass range of $\\sim(10-200)$ MeV,\nsurpassing the energy loss limit from SN1987A by nearly one order of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
