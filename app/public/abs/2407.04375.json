In a previous work, the same authors noticed that the\nmodel of the toric arrangement of type $A_{n-1}$ is isomorphic to the one of\nthe hyperplane arrangement of type $A_{n}$; it is natural to ask if there exist\nsimilar isomorphisms between other families of arrangements. The aim of this\npaper is to study one such family, namely the family of arrangements defined by\ngraphs. The main result states that there is indeed an isomorphism between the\nmodel of a toric arrangement defined by a graph $\\Gamma$ and the model of a\nhyperplane arrangement defined by the cone of $\\Gamma$, provided that a\nsuitable building set is chosen.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
