We present a\nproof-of-concept convolutional neural network aimed at reconstruction of energy\nand arrival directions of primary particles using model data for two telescopes\ndeveloped by the international JEM-EUSO collaboration. We also demonstrate how\na simple convolutional encoder-decoder can be used for EAS track recognition.\nThe approach is generic and can be adopted for other fluorescence telescopes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
