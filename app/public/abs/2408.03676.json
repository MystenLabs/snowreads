The method builds on a\nstochastic model accounting for the force exerted by the motor ensemble\noperated both in the low and high force-generating regimes corresponding to\ndifferent temperature ranges. The proposed interpretative framework is\nsuccessfully challenged against simulated data, meant to mimic the experimental\noutput of a unidimensional synthetic nanomachine powered by pure muscle myosin\nisoforms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
