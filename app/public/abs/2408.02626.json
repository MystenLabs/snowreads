Other fields, Kalb-Ramond and dilaton\nfields are set to zero. Action with this configuration of fields is not\ninvariant to translations. In order to find T-dual theory we will employ\ngeneralization of the Buscher procedure that can be applied to such cases where\nwe have coordinate dependent fields that do not possess translational isometry.\nFinally, using transformation laws that connect coordinates of starting and\nT-dual theories, we will be able to examine the geometric structure of T-dual\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
