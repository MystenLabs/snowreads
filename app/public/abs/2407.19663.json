However, the task of photovoltaic forecasting is\ncomplicated due to its property of uncertainty, especially in specific regions\nduring the foggy winter. This paper proposes a novel model to accomplish the\nproblem. A developed entropy is created to qualify the uncertainty during the\nfoggy winter. The clustering method and modified retention network are applied\nto reduce complexity and forecast, respectively. We adopt an optimization to\noptimize the hyperparameters. Results are validated from the multivariate\nforecasting model using the dataset from a photovoltaic power station in\nJiangsu Province, China. Experiments show that the proposed model improves the\nforecasting accuracy compared to various models during the foggy winter.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
