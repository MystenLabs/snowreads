The\nidentification and visualization of clusters in graphs enable insight discovery\nin many application areas, such as life sciences and social sciences.\nForce-directed graph layouts promote the visual saliency of clusters, as they\nbring adjacent nodes closer together, and push non-adjacent nodes apart. At the\nsame time, matrices can effectively show clusters when a suitable row/column\nordering is applied, but are less appealing to untrained users not providing an\nintuitive node-link metaphor. It is thus worth exploring layouts combining the\nstrengths of the node-link metaphor and node ordering. In this work, we study\nthe impact of node ordering on the visual saliency of clusters in orderable\nnode-link diagrams, namely radial diagrams, arc diagrams and symmetric arc\ndiagrams. Through a crowdsourced controlled experiment, we show that users can\ncount clusters consistently more accurately, and to a large extent faster, with\norderable node-link diagrams than with three state-of-the art force-directed\nlayout algorithms, i.e., `Linlog', `Backbone' and `sfdp'. The measured\nadvantage is greater in case of low cluster separability and/or low\ncompactness.
