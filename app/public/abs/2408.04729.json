We use this MPS to formulate a quantum circuit for sequentially\npreparing Dicke states deterministically, relating it to the recursive\nalgorithm of B\\\"artschi and Eidenbenz. We also find exact canonical MPS\nrepresentations with minimal bond dimension for higher-spin and qudit Dicke\nstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
