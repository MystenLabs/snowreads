More precisely, we consider the case where all\nsurfaces have the same Euler characteristic. We give a complete description of\nthe limit spaces and study their topological properties. Our investigation\nbuilds on the results of a previous work which treats the case of closed\nsurfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
