In general,\nany linear combination of an $r$-gonal number and an $s$-gonal number with\ncoprime positive integer coefficients produces infinitely many primes. However,\nunless $r=s=4$, such primes can not be described by finitely many congruences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kq46Nw0WfmJllzhDRJ_IN-dH8zXh4VlvxuD_GVZYnIk","pdfSize":"316307"}
