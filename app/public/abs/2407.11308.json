Anomaly detection sometimes comes with\nhigh-frequency data sampling which should be carried out at Edge devices rather\nthan Cloud. In this paper, we consider the case that multiple IoT devices are\ninstalled in a single remote site and that they collaboratively detect\nanomalies from the observations with device-to-device communications. For this,\nwe propose a fully distributed collaborative scheme for training distributed\nanomaly detectors with Wireless Ad Hoc Federated Learning, namely\n\"WAFL-Autoencoder\". We introduce the concept of Global Anomaly which sample is\nnot only rare to the local device but rare to all the devices in the target\ndomain. We also propose a distributed threshold-finding algorithm for Global\nAnomaly detection. With our standard benchmark-based evaluation, we have\nconfirmed that our scheme trained anomaly detectors perfectly across the\ndevices. We have also confirmed that the devices collaboratively found\nthresholds for Global Anomaly detection with low false positive rates while\nachieving high true positive rates with few exceptions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jEGqzeQ0HX3lE2syhODm4pmxFrjyFUE5qqTzoNYDWkg","pdfSize":"1107149"}
