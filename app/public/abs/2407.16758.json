The former can in principle be done by\nfluxes in type IIB solutions. However, the tadpole conjecture proposes that the\nnumber of stabilised moduli can at most grow linearly with the tadpole charge\nof the fluxes required for stabilisation. We scrutinise this conjecture in the\n$2^6$ Gepner model: a non-geometric background mirror dual to a rigid\nCalabi-Yau manifold, in the deep interior of moduli space. By constructing an\nextensive set of supersymmetric Minkowski flux solutions, we spectacularly\nconfirm the linear growth, while achieving a slightly higher ratio of\nstabilised moduli to flux charge than the conjectured upper bound. As a\nbyproduct, we obtain for the first time a set of solutions within the tadpole\nbound where all complex structure moduli are massive. Since the $2^6$ model has\nno K\\\"ahler moduli, these show that the massless Minkowski conjecture does not\nhold beyond supergravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dhnmrFRnZiDPEv5nj70-xcnekjrvxTo6t3Pc38_yxN8","pdfSize":"551565"}
