This article examines two classes of heterogeneous\ncar-following models with quenched disorder to shed light on the underlying\nmechanisms that drive traffic instability and stop-and-go dynamics.\nSpecifically, a scaled heterogeneity model and an additive heterogeneity model\nare investigated, each of which affects the stability of linear and nonlinear\ncar-following models differently. We derive general linear stability conditions\nwhich we apply to specific models and illustrate by simulation. The study\nprovides insights into the role of individual heterogeneity in vehicle\nbehaviour and its influence on traffic stability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
