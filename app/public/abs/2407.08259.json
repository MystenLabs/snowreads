Climate projections provide valuable insight into long-term wind\nspeed conditions, yet their spatial data resolution is typically insufficient\nfor precise wind power forecasts. Deep learning methods, particularly models\ndeveloped for image super-resolution, offer a promising solution to bridge this\nscale gap by increasing the spatial resolution of climate models. In this\npaper, we compare the performance of various deep learning models on two\ndistinct tasks: super-resolution, where we map artificially coarsened ERA5 data\nto its native resolution, and downscaling, where we map native ERA5 to\nhigh-resolution COSMO-REA6 data. We evaluate the models on their downstream\napplication in forecasting long-term wind power, emphasizing the impact of\nspatial wind speed resolution on wind power estimates. Our findings highlight\nthe importance of aligning models and evaluation metrics with their specific\ndownstream applications. We show that a diffusion model outperforms other\nmodels for estimating the wind power potential by better preserving the wind\nspeeds' distributional and physical properties.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
