This improves a previous result\ndue to Contreras, D\\'iaz-Madrigal, and Pommerenke. We also derive some\nconsequences for the rate of convergence of these functions to their\nDenjoy-Wolff point, improving a related result of Kourou, Theodosiadis, and\nZarvalis for the continuous setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
