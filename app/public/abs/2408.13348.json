Our\nbounds are dimension-free, scaling with the dimension of the Gaussian vectors\nonly through the smaller expected maximum of the Gaussian subvectors. In\naddition, our bounds hold under the degenerate covariance structures, which\nprevious results do not cover. In addition, we show that our conditions are\nsharp under the homogeneous component-wise variance setting, while we only\nimpose some mild assumptions on the covariance structures under the\nheterogeneous variance setting. We apply the new anti-concentration bounds to\nderive the central limit theorem for the maximizers of discrete empirical\nprocesses. Finally, we back up our theoretical findings with comprehensive\nnumerical studies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
