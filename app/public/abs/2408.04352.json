First, we obtain a new property concerning the nonemptiness of\nweak Pareto efficient solution sets for these vector optimization problems.\nThen, under the condition of weak section-boundedness from below, we establish\nrelationships between the notions of properness, Palais-Smale, weak\nPalais-Smale and M-tameness conditions with respect to some index sets for the\nrestriction of the vector mapping on the constraint set. Finally, we present\nsome new necessary and sufficient conditions for the nonemptiness of the weak\nPareto efficient solution set for a general class of nonsmooth vector\noptimization problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
