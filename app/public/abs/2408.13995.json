To overcome this, we propose the Avatar\nConcept Slider (ACS), a 3D avatar editing method that allows precise\nmanipulation of semantic concepts in human avatars towards a specified\nintermediate point between two extremes of concepts, akin to moving a knob\nalong a slider track. To achieve this, our ACS has three designs. 1) A Concept\nSliding Loss based on Linear Discriminant Analysis to pinpoint the\nconcept-specific axis for precise editing. 2) An Attribute Preserving Loss\nbased on Principal Component Analysis for improved preservation of avatar\nidentity during editing. 3) A 3D Gaussian Splatting primitive selection\nmechanism based on concept-sensitivity, which updates only the primitives that\nare the most sensitive to our target concept, to improve efficiency. Results\ndemonstrate that our ACS enables fine-grained 3D avatar editing with efficient\nfeedback, without harming the avatar quality or compromising the avatar's\nidentifying attributes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
