This research paper addresses this challenge by presenting\na new, AI-based data compression method. It is based on existing, multi-level\ncompression schemes; however, it uses state-of-the-art technologies, such as\nautoencoders, to improve the performance. Furthermore, it solves the problem\nthat such algorithms usually cannot ensure an error bound. The scheme is tested\non synthetically generated power quality disturbance samples. The evaluation is\nperformed using different metrics such as final compression rate and overhead\nsize. Compression rates between 5 and 68 were achieved depending on the error\nbound and noise level. Additionally, the impact of the compression on the\nperformance of subsequent algorithms is determined by applying a classification\nalgorithm to the decompressed data. The classification accuracy only declined\nby 0.8--11.9 \\%, depending on the chosen error bound.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
