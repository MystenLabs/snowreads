The discrete\nstructure of energy levels is taken into account and size effects at low\ntemperatures are studied. The transition to the continual limit is considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5l2LN4lb5CvZZdozVCtCtSK87Kt5L8-EzodpO8O3PWs","pdfSize":"416593"}
