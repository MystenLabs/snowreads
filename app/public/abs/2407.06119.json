The workshop's primary goals were\nto (i) advance the development of research initiatives along the themes of both\nsustainable computing and computing for sustainability, while also (ii) helping\ndevelop and sustain the interdisciplinary teams those initiatives would need.\nThe workshop's findings are in the form of recommendations grouped in three\ncategories: General recommendations that cut across both themes of sustainable\ncomputing and computing for sustainability, and recommendations that are\nspecific to sustainable computing and computing for sustainability,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
