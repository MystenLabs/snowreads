While the data collected by the agents is private, in every\niteration of the algorithm, the models estimated by the agents are uploaded to\nthe fusion center, fused, and, subsequently downloaded by the agents. We\nconsider the estimation spaces at the agents and the fusion center to be\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Under suitable assumptions on these\nspaces, we prove that the algorithm is consistent, i.e., there exists a\nsubsequence of the estimated models which converges to a model in the strong\ntopology. To this end, we define estimation operators for the agents, fusion\ncenter, and, for every iteration of the algorithm constructively. We define\nvalid input data sequences, study the asymptotic properties of the norm of the\nestimation operators, and, find sufficient conditions under which the\nestimation operator until any iteration is uniformly bounded. Using these\nresults, we prove the existence of an estimation operator for the algorithm\nwhich implies the consistency of the considered estimation algorithm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
