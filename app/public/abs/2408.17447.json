The first scenario involves the\ncomputation of third-rank tensors representing second-order response\ncoefficients, relating the charge/thermal current densities to the combined\neffects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric\nfield/temperature gradient. On the premises that internode scatterings can be\nignored, the relaxation-time approximation leads to a quantized value for the\nnonvanishing components of each of these nonlinear response tensors,\ncharacterizing a single untilted RSW node. Furthermore, the final expressions\nturn out to be insensitive to the specific values of the chemical potential and\nthe temperature. The second scenario involves computing the magnetoelectric\nconductivity under the action of collinear electric ($\\mathbf E$) and magnetic\n($\\mathbf B$) fields, representing a planar Hall set-up. In particular, our\nfocus is in bringing out the dependence of the linear-in-$|\\mathbf B|$ parts of\nthe conductivity tensor on the intrinsic topological properties of the\nbandstructure, which are nonvanishing only in the presence of a nonzero tilt in\nthe energy spectrum.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
