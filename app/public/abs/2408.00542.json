Secure PIR complements this\nproblem by further requiring the contents of the data to be kept secure.\nPrivacy and security can be achieved by adding suitable noise to the queries\nand data using methods from secret sharing. In this paper, a new framework for\nhomomorphic secret sharing in secure and private information retrieval from\ncolluding servers is proposed, generalizing the original cross-subspace\nalignment (CSA) codes proposed by Jia, Sun, and Jafar. We utilize this\nframework to give a secure PIR construction using algebraic geometry codes over\nhyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus. It is shown that the proposed scheme\noffers interesting tradeoffs between the field size, file size, number of\ncolluding servers, and the total number of servers. When the field size is\nfixed, this translates in some cases to higher retrieval rates than those of\nthe original scheme. In addition, the new schemes exist also for some\nparameters where the original ones do not.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
