In this\narticle, we compute magnitude homology by constructing a minimal projective\nresolution. As a consequence, we determine magnitude homology of geodetic\nmetric spaces. We show that it is a free $\\mathbb Z$-module, and give a\nrecursive algorithm for constructing all cycles. As a corollary, we show that a\nfinite geodetic metric space is diagonal if and only if it contains no 4-cuts.\nMoreover, we give explicit computations for cycle graphs, Petersen graph,\nHoffman-Singleton graph, and a missing Moore graph. It includes another\napproach to the computation for cycle graphs, which has been studied by\nHepworth--Willerton and Gu.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
