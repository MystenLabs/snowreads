The thermal compatibility\ncondition, as well as a positive entropy-production property, is derived\nanalytically and further verified by numerical benchmark simulations.\nFurthermore, we examine how the different model parameters control density and\ntemperature evolution during dendritic solidification through extensive\nparameter studies. Finally, we extend our framework to the modeling of open\nsystems considering external mass and heat fluxes. This work sets the ground\nfor a comprehensive mesoscale model of non-isothermal solidification including\nthermal expansion within a positive entropy-producing framework, and provides a\nbenchmark for further meso- to macroscopic modeling of solidification.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
