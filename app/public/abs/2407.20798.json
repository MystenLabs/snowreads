DAAG hindsight relabels the agent's past experience by\nusing diffusion models to transform videos in a temporally and geometrically\nconsistent way to align with target instructions with a technique we call\nHindsight Experience Augmentation. A large language model orchestrates this\nautonomous process without requiring human supervision, making it well-suited\nfor lifelong learning scenarios. The framework reduces the amount of\nreward-labeled data needed to 1) finetune a vision language model that acts as\na reward detector, and 2) train RL agents on new tasks. We demonstrate the\nsample efficiency gains of DAAG in simulated robotics environments involving\nmanipulation and navigation. Our results show that DAAG improves learning of\nreward detectors, transferring past experience, and acquiring new tasks - key\nabilities for developing efficient lifelong learning agents.
