It is an extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity,\nequipped with a boundary term $B$. This theory exhibits gravitational waves\nregardless of the gauge adopted: they are the standard massless tensors plus a\nmassive scalar gravitational wave like in the case of $f(R)$ gravity. It is\nprecisely the boundary term $B$ that generates the massive scalar mode with an\neffective mass $m_{B}$ associated to a Klein-Gordon equation in the linearized\nboundary term. As in $f(Q)$ gravity also in $f(Q,B)$ non-metric gravity, a free\ntest particle follows a geodesic motion due to the covariant conservation with\nrespect to the Levi-Civita connection of the energy and momentum densities on\nshell. Therefore, in $f(Q,B)$ gravity, the proper acceleration between two\nneighboring worldlines traveled by two free point-like particle is governed by\na first-order geodesic deviation equation in the metric perturbation\n$h_{\\mu\\nu}$. Thanks to this approximate linear equation, $f(Q,B)$ non-metric\ngravity shows three polarization modes: two massless transverse tensor\nradiation modes, with helicity equal to 2, reproducing the standard plus and\ncross modes, exactly as in General Relativity, and an additional massive scalar\nwave mode with transverse polarization of zero helicity. We obtain the same\nresult both by considering the coincidence gauge and by leaving the gauge free.\nIn summary, three degrees of freedom propagate in the $f(Q,B)$ linearized\ntheory with amplitudes $\\tilde{h}^{(+)}$ and $\\tilde{h}^{(\\times)}$ for tensor\nmodes and amplitude $\\tilde{h}^{(s)}$ for the scalar mode. Specifically, both\n$f(Q,B)$ and $f(R)$ gravity involve the same massive transverse scalar\nperturbation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
