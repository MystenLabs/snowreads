These physics simulators, however,\nrequire substantial computational resources for accurate simulations. To\naddress these issues, deep learning emulators promise faster and scalable\nsimulations, yet they often remain expensive and difficult to train, limiting\ntheir practical use. Inspired by the Material Point Method (MPM), we present\nNeuralMPM, a neural emulation framework for particle-based simulations.\nNeuralMPM interpolates Lagrangian particles onto a fixed-size grid, computes\nupdates on grid nodes using image-to-image neural networks, and interpolates\nback to the particles. Similarly to MPM, NeuralMPM benefits from the regular\nvoxelized representation to simplify the computation of the state dynamics,\nwhile avoiding the drawbacks of mesh-based Eulerian methods. We demonstrate the\nadvantages of NeuralMPM on several datasets, including fluid dynamics and\nfluid-solid interactions. Compared to existing methods, NeuralMPM reduces\ntraining times from days to hours, while achieving comparable or superior\nlong-term accuracy, making it a promising approach for practical forward and\ninverse problems.
