With Wordle\nsolutions being gradually eliminated (with a new puzzle each day and no reuse),\nan improved strategy could be generated each day, but the computation time\nmakes a daily exhaustive search impractical. This paper shows that simple\nheuristics allow for fast generation of effective strategies and that little is\nlost by guessing only words that are possible solution words rather than more\nobscure words.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QaCcRnAYwWyh6LsFjc-i6xUMHx4HCLYv-YNfKRDQ8Mw","pdfSize":"259170"}
