While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt\nlearning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with\ntask-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios.\nInspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language\nmodels (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned\nGraph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and\ncross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we\npretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM.\nWe then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into\na fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified\ninstruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as\nnode classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design\nchoices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning,\nsetting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token\nembeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on\nunseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
