The aim of this paper is to develop a flexible and adaptive\nframework to generate optimal plans for collaborative robots and human workers\nto replace rigid, hard-coded production line plans in industrial scenarios.\nThis will be achieved by integrating the Planning Domain Definition Language\n(PDDL), Partial Order Planning Forwards (POPF) task planner, and a task\nallocation algorithm. The task allocation algorithm proposed in this paper\ngenerates a cost function for general actions in the industrial scenario, such\nas PICK, PLACE, and MOVE, by considering practical factors such as feasibility,\nreachability, safety, and cooperation level for both robots and human agents.\nThe actions and costs will then be translated into a language understandable by\nthe planning system using PDDL and fed into POPF solver to generate an optimal\naction plan. In the end, experiments are conducted where assembly tasks are\nexecuted by a collaborative system with two manipulators and a human worker to\ntest the feasibility of the theory proposed in this paper.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yJ1eIvxhVnBw2DsyYyatdTUPI_IzX4Pcf0YjeF9mWOM","pdfSize":"17426490"}
