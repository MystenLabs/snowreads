We make a connection between the asymptotic minimization of\nthese functionals, for big tensor powers of the polarization, and the\nminimization of the so-called Wess-Zumino-Witten functional defined on the\nspace of all relatively K\\\"ahler $(1, 1)$-forms on the fibration. We establish\nthe sharp lower bounds on the latter functional in terms of the limiting\nHarder-Narasimhan measure, which is a certain algebraic invariant of the\nfamily. As an application, in a fibered setting, we prove an asymptotic\nconverse to the Andreotti-Grauert theorem conjectured by Demailly.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zsdzyez57TkW-kgKwyKUPUc7I1EHIooXEtH2dqunK2g","pdfSize":"583926"}
