A\nposteriori error estimation plays a pivotal role in assessing the accuracy and\nreliability of computational solutions across various domains of science and\nengineering. This study delves into the theoretical underpinnings and\ncomputational considerations of a residual-based estimator.\n  Theoretically, the estimator is studied for cases with constant coefficients\nwhich jump across an interface as well as generalized scenarios with smooth\ncoefficients that jump across an interface. Theoretical findings demonstrate\nthe reliability and efficiency of the proposed estimators under all considered\ncases.\n  Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results,\nincorporating various immersed geometries and instances of high coefficients\njumps at the interface. Leveraging an adaptive algorithm, the estimator\nidentifies regions with singularities and applies refinement accordingly.\nResults substantiate the theoretical findings, highlighting the reliability and\nefficiency of the estimators. Furthermore, numerical solutions exhibit optimal\nconvergence properties, demonstrating resilience against geometric\nsingularities or coefficients jumps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
