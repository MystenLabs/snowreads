Error processes\nare far more complex than simple depolarizing noise applied to single gates,\nand error rates can vary greatly between different qubits, and at different\npoints in the circuit. Nevertheless, it would be useful to distill all this\ncomplicated behavior down to a single parameter: an effective error rate for a\nsimple uniform error model. Here we show that this can be done by means of the\naverage detector likelihood, which quantifies the rate at which error detection\nevents occur. We show that this parameter is predictive of the overall code\nperformance for two variants of the surface code: Floquet codes and the 3-CX\nsurface code. This is then used to define an effective error rate at which\nsimulations for a simple uniform noise model result in the same average\ndetector likelihood, as well as a good prediction of the logical error rate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
