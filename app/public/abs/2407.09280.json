For Hilbert spaces with dimension d>2, maximally entangled\nstates (MESs) help to improve the capacity and security of quantum\ncommunication protocols, among several other promising features. However, the\ndirect generation of MES in well-defined high-dimensional subspaces of the\ninfinite OAM basis has remained a challenge. Here, we formalize how the spatial\ndistribution of the pump beam and the nonlinear profile of the crystal can be\nsimultaneously utilized to generate MES without additional spatial filtering of\nOAM modes within a subspace. We illustrate our approach with maximally\nentangled qutrits (d=3) and ququints (d=5).\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nS5D-027DgNEohC8tWBoR4C6fVHD6nnMhJt3rM6l6Ho","pdfSize":"5274109","objectId":"0xa19e475e7cd7369d0b565bc75e00115f906e21b56b81b672fcabf029dc9fc21d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
