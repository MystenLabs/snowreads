With the advent of (distributed)\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), radio frequency (RF) WPT has become\nfeasible over extended distances. This study focuses on optimizing the energy\ndelivery to Energy Receivers (ERs) while minimizing system total transmit\npower. Rather than continuous power delivery, we optimize the precoding weights\nwithin specified time slots to meet the energy requirements of the ERs. Both\nunsynchronized (non-coherent) and synchronized (coherent) systems are\nevaluated. Our analysis indicates that augmenting the number of antennas and\ntransitioning from an unsynchronized to asynchronized full phase-coherent\nsystem substantially enhances system performance. This optimization ensures\nprecise energy delivery, reducing overshoots and overall energy consumption.\nExperimental validation was conducted using a testbed with84 antennas,\nvalidating the trends observed in our numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
