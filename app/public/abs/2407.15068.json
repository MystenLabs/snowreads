We validate our approach by fitting experimental charge\ndensity results and electron scattering experiments to a very good agreement.\nApplying our model, we calculate the spin-zero short-range correlations contact\nratios. Interestingly, for nuclei with $A>50$, we observe a notable dependence\non the neutron-to-proton ratio $N/Z$. Specifically, the probability per nucleon\nto find neutron-neutron pairs increases, while that of proton-proton pairs\ndecreases, whereas the probability of finding neutron-proton pairs remains\nrelatively constant. To interpret this isospin symmetry breaking effect, we\nemploy a simple model based on generalized Levinger constants, linking it to\ndifferences in nuclear proton and neutron radii.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
