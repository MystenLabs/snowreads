It is therefore important to carefully\nexamine unsupervised models to ensure not only that they produce accurate\npredictions, but also that these predictions are not \"right for the wrong\nreasons\", the so-called Clever Hans (CH) effect. Using specially developed\nExplainable AI techniques, we show for the first time that CH effects are\nwidespread in unsupervised learning. Our empirical findings are enriched by\ntheoretical insights, which interestingly point to inductive biases in the\nunsupervised learning machine as a primary source of CH effects. Overall, our\nwork sheds light on unexplored risks associated with practical applications of\nunsupervised learning and suggests ways to make unsupervised learning more\nrobust.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
