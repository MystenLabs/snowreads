Existing methods face the challenge of either\ntoo loose or too tight clustering, leading to under-segmentation or\nover-segmentation. To address this issue, we propose Part2Object, hierarchical\nclustering with object guidance. Part2Object employs multi-layer clustering\nfrom points to object parts and objects, allowing objects to manifest at any\nlayer. Additionally, it extracts and utilizes 3D objectness priors from\ntemporally consecutive 2D RGB frames to guide the clustering process. Moreover,\nwe propose Hi-Mask3D to support hierarchical 3D object part and instance\nsegmentation. By training Hi-Mask3D on the objects and object parts extracted\nfrom Part2Object, we achieve consistent and superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art models in various settings, including unsupervised instance\nsegmentation, data-efficient fine-tuning, and cross-dataset generalization.\nCode is release at https://github.com/ChengShiest/Part2Object\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2jWTnV-XVbEv5ccji6cLNlQ958xu5Y8gaLoGT4PIN1Q","pdfSize":"1704904","objectId":"0x8820ae41f97bbce6d21eac152147e382d099adc67d30b92cf6521a20eb3c0b11","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
