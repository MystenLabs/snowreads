They\nhave been used to date in different applications related to fluid mixing, drug\ndelivery or biomedicine. Here we realize an active version of a magnetic\nmicrogyroscope which is simultaneously driven by a photo-activated catalytic\nreaction and a rotating magnetic field. We investigate the uplift dynamics of\nthis colloidal spinner when it stands up and precesses around its long axis\nwhile self-propelling due to the light induced decomposition of hydrogen\nperoxide in water. By combining experiments with theory, we show that activity\nemerging from the cooperative action of phoretic and osmotic forces effectively\nincrease the gravitational torque which counteracts the magnetic and viscous\nones, and carefully measure its contribution.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
