This method does not involve Wilson lines and could greatly\nimprove the efficiency and precision of lattice QCD calculations. However,\nthere are concerns about whether the systematic uncertainties from Gribov\ncopies, which correspond to the ambiguity in lattice gauge-fixing, are under\ncontrol. This work gives an assessment of the Gribov copies' effect in the\nCoulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlators. We utilize different strategies for the\nCoulomb-gauge fixing, selecting two different groups of Gribov copies based on\nthe lattice gauge configurations. We test the difference in the resulted\nspatial quark correlators in the vacuum and a pion state. Our findings indicate\nthat the statistical errors of the matrix elements from both Gribov copies,\nregardless of the correlation range, decrease proportionally to the square root\nof the number of gauge configurations. The difference between the strategies\ndoes not show statistical significance compared to the gauge noise. This\ndemonstrates that the effect of the Gribov copies can be neglected in the\npractical lattice calculation of the quark parton distributions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bfkN-E8Q0fCNtMQH0u2cscylKgbM8kzDGEh_Ce-A7FI","pdfSize":"1291597"}
