We develop a\nvariety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and\ntwo-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from\nreal-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the\ntopological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the\nquantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or\nusing a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first\ntime that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid\ncharacterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is\nstabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion\nsymmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the\npresence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected\ntopological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing\nalong the critical line for weaker interactions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
