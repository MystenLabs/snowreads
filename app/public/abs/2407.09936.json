In WojoodNER-2024, we focus on fine-grained Arabic NER. We\nprovided participants with a new Arabic fine-grained NER dataset called\nwojoodfine, annotated with subtypes of entities. WojoodNER-2024 encompassed\nthree subtasks: (i) Closed-Track Flat Fine-Grained NER, (ii) Closed-Track\nNested Fine-Grained NER, and (iii) an Open-Track NER for the Israeli War on\nGaza. A total of 43 unique teams registered for this shared task. Five teams\nparticipated in the Flat Fine-Grained Subtask, among which two teams tackled\nthe Nested Fine-Grained Subtask and one team participated in the Open-Track NER\nSubtask. The winning teams achieved F-1 scores of 91% and 92% in the Flat\nFine-Grained and Nested Fine-Grained Subtasks, respectively. The sole team in\nthe Open-Track Subtask achieved an F-1 score of 73.7%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0yWbvyeUYgPDqzqk_g2s_LvSQqZOfpZxPa3kGOA8lw4","pdfSize":"693106","objectId":"0x9dcd86734d0ddef7114138333bbd12ee44a2f33938f4a31d9776e7801f5cce50","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
