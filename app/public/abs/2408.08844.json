Here, we use work of Chisholm, Deines,\nLong, Nebe and the third author to prove a general $p$-adic supercongruence\ntheorem through an explicit connection to CM hypergeometric elliptic curves\nthat provides $p$-adic analogues of these Ramanujan-Sato series. We further use\nthis theorem to construct explicit examples related to each of our explicit\nRamanujan-Sato series examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
