A gamma photon beam\nproduced by a laser wakefield accelerator provided a broadband gamma spectrum\nextending to above $E_\\gamma = 200$ MeV. These were collided with a dense x-ray\nfield produced by the emission from a laser heated germanium foil at $E_x\n\\approx 1.4$ keV, corresponding to an invariant mass of $\\sqrt{s} = 1.22 \\pm\n0.22$ MeV. In these asymmetric collisions elastic scattering removes one x-ray\nand one high-energy $\\gamma$ photon and outputs two lower energy $\\gamma$\nphotons. No changes in the $\\gamma$ photon spectrum were observed as a result\nof the collisions allowing us to place a 95% upper bound on the cross section\nof $1.5 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mu$b. Although far from the QED prediction, this\nrepresents the lowest upper limit obtained so far for $\\sqrt{s} \\lesssim 1$\nMeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
