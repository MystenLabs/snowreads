The need for these drastic measures stems from the analysis of a\ngroup selection model of temporarily formed random groups introduced by\nHamilton nearly fifty years ago to describe the fate of altruistic behavior in\na population. Challenging conventional wisdom, we show analytically here that\nstrong altruism evolves in Hamilton's original model in the case of biparental\nsexual reproduction. Moreover, when the cost of cooperation is small and the\namplified contribution shared by group members is large, cooperation is the\nonly stable strategy in equilibrium. Thus, our results provide a solution to\nthe `problem of origination' of strong altruism, i.e. how cooperation can take\noff from an initial low frequency of cooperators. We discuss a possible\nreassessment of cooperation in cases of viral co-infection, as cooperation may\neven be favored in situations where the prisoner's dilemma applies.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
