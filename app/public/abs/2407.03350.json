The use of SH is facilitated\nby mapping the particle coordinates onto a unit sphere, in practice often a\nstraightforward rescaling of the radial coordinate. However, when applied to\noblate- or prolate-shaped particles the SH analysis quality degenerates with\nsignificant oscillations appearing after the reconstruction. Here, we propose a\nspheroidal harmonics (SOH) approach for the expansion and reconstruction of\nprolate and oblate particles. This generalizes the SH approach by providing\nadditional parameters that can be adjusted per particle to minimize geometric\ndistortion, thus increasing the analysis quality. We propose three mapping\ntechniques for handling both star-shaped and non-star-shaped particles onto\nspheroidal domains. The results demonstrate the ability of the SOH to overcome\nthe shortcomings of SH without requiring computationally expensive solutions or\ndrastic changes to existing codes and processing pipelines.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1mQBMgWLJnrbxIhfwVr3cYxUnNWZ_T8fGLdt2ifLFj0","pdfSize":"32657276"}
