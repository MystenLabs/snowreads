These traditionally human\ndecisions are nowadays increasingly supported by data and the ultimate aim is\nto make them autonomous. This paper explores the challenges encountered in data\ndriven maintenance, and proposes to consider four aspects in a maturity\nframework: data / decision maturity, the translation from the real world to\ndata, the computability of decisions (using models) and the causality in the\nobtained relations. After a discussion of the theoretical concepts involved,\nthe exploration continues by considering a practical fault detection and\nidentification problem. Two approaches, i.e. experience based and model based,\nare compared and discussed in terms of the four aspects in the maturity\nframework. It is observed that both approaches yield the same decisions, but\nstill differ in the assignment of causality. This confirms that a maturity\nassessment not only concerns the type of decision, but should also include the\nother proposed aspects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
