Previous\nresearch mainly focused on uncertainty estimation in face verification, leaving\nthe open-set face recognition task underexplored. In open-set face recognition,\none seeks to classify an image, which could also be unknown. Here, the low\nvariance of probabilistic embedding does not imply a low error probability: an\nimage embedding could be close to several classes in a gallery, thus yielding\nhigh uncertainty. We propose a method aware of two sources of ambiguity in the\nopen-set recognition system: (1) the gallery uncertainty caused by overlapping\nclasses and (2) the uncertainty of the face embeddings. To detect both types,\nwe use a Bayesian probabilistic model of embedding distribution, which provides\na principled uncertainty estimate. Challenging open-set face recognition\ndatasets, such as IJB-C, serve as a testbed for our method. We also propose a\nnew open-set recognition protocol for whale and dolphin identification. The\nproposed approach better identifies recognition errors than uncertainty\nestimation methods based solely on image quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
