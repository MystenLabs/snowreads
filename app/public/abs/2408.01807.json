However, FFT analysis is limited by sampling frequency\nand time acquisition constraints, making it less effective under time-varying\nconditions. To overcome these difficulties, a novel BRB fault detection method\nfor non-stationary conditions is proposed. The proposed strategy is based on\nthe recently developed robust local mean decomposition (RLMD) and Hilbert\ntransform (HT) methods. Using these techniques, the BRB characteristic\nfrequency and amplitude component are obtained from only one phase stator\ncurrent allowing automation of the features detection process. in fact, HT is\nused to extract the stator current envelope (SCE). Then, the SCE is processed\nby RLMD for determining the sub signals production functions (PFs). Finally, HT\nis applied to the most sensible PF to compute its instantaneous frequency and\namplitude. The tracking of the BRB fault characteristic can inform us about the\ncondition of the induction motor. The effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic\nstrategy is validated through simulation conducted in the Matlab environment.\nThe simulation results show the capability of this method to track accurately\nthe frequency and amplitude of the 2sf component where f and s represent the\nfundamental stator current frequency and motor slip respectively\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
