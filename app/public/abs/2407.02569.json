We propose a novel warm start technique that is based on imaginary\ntime evolution, and allows for determining a set of initial parameters\nprioritizing lower energy states in a resource-efficient way. Using classical\nsimulations, we demonstrate that this warm start method significantly improves\nthe success rate and reduces the number of iterations required for the\nconvergence of Variational Quantum Eigensolver. The numerical results also\nindicate that the warm start approach effectively mitigates statistical errors\narising from a finite number of measurements, and to a certain extent\nalleviates the effect of barren plateaus.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
