Utilizing a 3D object detection\nnetwork, our system identifies objects of interest in LiDAR keyframes, refines\ntheir 3D poses with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, and tracks\nthem via Kalman filters and the Hungarian algorithm for data association. It\nthen updates existing object poses with new associated detections and creates\nnew object maps for unmatched detections. Using the maintained object-level\nmapping system, our system creates affordance-driven object costmaps for\nproactive collision avoidance in path planning. Additionally, we address the\nscarcity of indoor semantic LiDAR data by introducing an automated labeling\ntechnique. This method utilizes a CAD model database for accurate ground-truth\nannotations, encompassing bounding boxes, positions, orientations, and\npoint-wise semantics of each object in LiDAR sequences. Our extensive\nevaluations, conducted in both simulated and real-world robot platforms,\nhighlights the effectiveness of proactive object avoidance by using object\naffordance costmaps, enhancing robotic navigation safety and efficiency. The\nsystem can operate in real-time onboard and we intend to release our code and\ndata for public use.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
