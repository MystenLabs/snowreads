This multi-observable\nanalysis extends the previously published JETSCAPE Bayesian Inference\ndetermination of $\\hat{q}$, which was based solely on a selection of inclusive\nhadron suppression data. JETSCAPE is a modular framework incorporating detailed\ndynamical models of QGP formation and evolution, and jet propagation and\ninteraction in the QGP. Virtuality-dependent partonic energy loss in the QGP is\nmodeled as a thermalized weakly-coupled plasma, with parameters determined from\nBayesian calibration using soft-sector observables. This Bayesian calibration\nof $\\hat{q}$ utilizes Active Learning, a machine--learning approach, for\nefficient exploitation of computing resources. The experimental data included\nin this analysis span a broad range in collision energy and centrality, and in\ntransverse momentum. In order to explore the systematic dependence of the\nextracted parameter posterior distributions, several different calibrations are\nreported, based on combined jet and hadron data; on jet or hadron data\nseparately; and on restricted kinematic or centrality ranges of the jet and\nhadron data. Tension is observed in comparison of these variations, providing\nnew insights into the physics of jet transport in the QGP and its theoretical\nformulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
