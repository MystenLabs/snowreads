The systematic effects of such detectors\nintroduce residual modulation, leading to systematic biases in the polarization\ndetection results of the source. This paper discusses the systematic effects\nand their calibration and correction using the Gas Microchannel Plate-Pixel\nDetector (GMPD) prototype for POLAR-2/Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector\n(LPD). Additionally, we propose an algorithm that combines parameterization\nwith Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian iteration to eliminate residual\nmodulation. The residual modulation after data correction at different energy\npoints has been reduced to below 1%, and a good linear relationship is observed\nbetween the polarization degree and modulation degree. The improvement in\nmodulation degree after correction ranges from 2% to 15%, and the results\nexceed those of the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) above 5 keV.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
