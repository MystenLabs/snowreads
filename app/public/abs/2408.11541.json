In this\nwork, we analyze the performance of synthetic image detectors as deceptive\nsynthetic images evolve throughout their online lifespan. Our study reveals\nthat, despite advancements in the field, current state-of-the-art detectors\nstruggle to distinguish between synthetic and real images in the wild.\nMoreover, we show that the time elapsed since the initial online appearance of\na synthetic image negatively affects the performance of most detectors.\nUltimately, by employing a retrieval-assisted detection approach, we\ndemonstrate the feasibility to maintain initial detection performance\nthroughout the whole online lifespan of an image and enhance the average\ndetection efficacy across several state-of-the-art detectors by 6.7% and 7.8%\nfor balanced accuracy and AUC metrics, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
