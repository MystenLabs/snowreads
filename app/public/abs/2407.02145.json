A generalization of quantum state transfer\ncalled quantum routing concerns simultaneous transfers between multiple pairs\nin a quantum network, imposing limitations on its structure. In this article we\nconsider transfer of Gaussian states over noisy quantum networks with modular\nstructure, which have been identified as a suitable platform for quantum state\nrouting. We compare two noise models, affecting either the network topology or\nthe network constituents, studying their effects on both the transfer\nfidelities and the network properties. We find that the two models affect\ndifferent features of the network allowing for the identification and\nquantification of the noise. We then use these features as a guide towards\ndifferent strategies for the compensation of the noise, and examine how the\ncompensation strategies perform. Our results show that in general, modular\nnetworks are more robust to noise than monolithic ones.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
