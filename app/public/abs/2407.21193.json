However, vendor outages can hinder\ncustomer experiences. Consequently, eBay can disable a problematic vendor to\nprevent customer loss. Disabling the vendor too late risks losing customers\nwilling to switch to other vendors, while disabling it too early risks losing\nthose unwilling to switch. In this paper, we propose a data-driven solution to\nanswer whether eBay should disable a problematic vendor and when to disable it.\nOur solution involves forecasting customer behavior. First, we use a\nmultiplicative seasonality model to represent behavior if all vendors are fully\nfunctioning. Next, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to represent behavior if the\nproblematic vendor remains enabled. Finally, we use a linear model to represent\nbehavior if the vendor is disabled. By comparing these forecasts, we determine\nthe optimal time for eBay to disable the problematic vendor.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BbeLTq-WspziVjPC7SFbo-M9c_P2k5LKl4zlJpXTUK4","pdfSize":"945442","objectId":"0xde1514cbbdd7907de510431f74ced873b9c793d8949a369e48654d6e449cccd7","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
