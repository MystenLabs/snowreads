However, state-of-the-art\ntemporal action segmentation methods overlook the long tail and fail to\nrecognize tail actions. Existing long-tail methods make class-independent\nassumptions and struggle to identify tail classes when applied to temporal\nsegmentation frameworks. This work proposes a novel group-wise temporal logit\nadjustment~(G-TLA) framework that combines a group-wise softmax formulation\nwhile leveraging activity information and action ordering for logit adjustment.\nThe proposed framework significantly improves in segmenting tail actions\nwithout any performance loss on head actions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
