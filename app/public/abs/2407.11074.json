In this paper, to address the issue of low\naccuracy in long-term forecasting of spatial-temporal big data on traffic flow,\nwe propose an innovative model called Spatial-Temporal Retentive Network\n(ST-RetNet). We extend the Retentive Network to address the task of traffic\nflow forecasting. At the spatial scale, we integrate a topological graph\nstructure into Spatial Retentive Network(S-RetNet), utilizing an adaptive\nadjacency matrix to extract dynamic spatial features of the road network. We\nalso employ Graph Convolutional Networks to extract static spatial features of\nthe road network. These two components are then fused to capture dynamic and\nstatic spatial correlations. At the temporal scale, we propose the Temporal\nRetentive Network(T-RetNet), which has been demonstrated to excel in capturing\nlong-term dependencies in traffic flow patterns compared to other time series\nmodels, including Recurrent Neural Networks based and transformer models. We\nachieve the spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting task by integrating\nS-RetNet and T-RetNet to form ST-RetNet. Through experimental comparisons\nconducted on four real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ST-RetNet\noutperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in traffic flow forecasting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
