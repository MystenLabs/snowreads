Several attempts with a variety of\nobservables have been utilized in the past to understand the thermal and\nionization evolution of the Intergalactic Medium during EoR. In this study, we\nexplore the simultaneous prospects of two important observables which are\nexpected to be available in the near future, i.e. Dispersion Measure (DM) of\nhigh redshift FRBs and large scale 21 cm power spectra. For this purpose, we\nuse an earlier developed explicitly photon conserving semi numerical model,\n$\\texttt{SCRIPT}$ including realistic recombination and radiative feedback\neffect. We check that DM evolution of 100 mock FRBs at high redshifts ($7.0\\le\nz\\le15.0$) is sufficient to recover the underlying reionization model, while\n1000 FRB mocks at redshift range can constrain the reionization timeline within\nthe percentage level uncertainties at 68\\% confidence limit. Further, we study\nthe effect of including large scale 21~cm power spectra (using only a single\nbin, $k\\sim0.14~h/\\mathrm{cMpc}$) at three redshifts along with FRB DM\ndistribution. The joint exploration using these two observables can\nsignificantly improve the constraints on the various parameters ($\\lesssim 8\\%$\nuncertainties for reionization interval and midpoint at 95\\% confidence)\nalleviating the degeneracies and can narrow down the thermal history of the\nuniverse by discarding some of the extreme heating models.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
