An HHSC\ntypically consists of many agencies serving the same population. Information\ntechnology platforms differ in type and quality between agencies, so their data\nare usually isolated from one agency to another. Larger agencies may have\nsufficient data to train and test artificial intelligence (AI) tools but\nsmaller agencies typically do not. To address this gap, we introduce a\nFederated Learning (FL) approach enabling all agencies to train a predictive\nmodel collaboratively without sharing their sensitive data. We demonstrate how\nFL can be used within an HHSC to provide all agencies equitable access to\nquality AI and further assist human decision-makers in the allocation of\nresources within HHSC. This is achieved while preserving the privacy of the\npeople within the data by not sharing identifying information between agencies\nwithout their consent. Our experimental results using real-world HHSC data from\nCalgary, Alberta, demonstrate that our FL approach offers comparable\nperformance with the idealized scenario of training the predictive model with\ndata fully shared and linked between agencies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
