Previous benchmarks only focus on the\ncapacity of the MLLMs in medical visual question-answering (VQA) or report\ngeneration and fail to assess the performance of the MLLMs on complex clinical\nmulti-modal tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Medical Personalized\nMulti-modal Consultation (Med-PMC) paradigm to evaluate the clinical capacity\nof the MLLMs. Med-PMC builds a simulated clinical environment where the MLLMs\nare required to interact with a patient simulator to complete the multi-modal\ninformation-gathering and decision-making task. Specifically, the patient\nsimulator is decorated with personalized actors to simulate diverse patients in\nreal scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments to access 12 types of MLLMs,\nproviding a comprehensive view of the MLLMs' clinical performance. We found\nthat current MLLMs fail to gather multimodal information and show potential\nbias in the decision-making task when consulted with the personalized patient\nsimulators. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Med-PMC, showing\nthe potential to guide the development of robust and reliable clinical MLLMs.\nCode and data are available at https://github.com/LiuHC0428/Med-PMC.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_Nw0QBTdZ9kF1zUz0qz5s77KayEV4XiMddmKW0i7n8c","pdfSize":"684242"}
