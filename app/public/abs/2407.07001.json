First, we show the\n$L^1$-$L^q$ estimates for the Stokes flow with possibly non-solenoidal $L^1$\ninitial data, generalizing the results of Giga-Matsui-Shimizu [Math. Z. 1999]\nand Desch-Hieber-Pr\\\"uss [J. Evol. Equ. 2001]. Second, we construct mild\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the half space with mixed-type\npointwise decay or with pointwise decay alongside boundary vanishing. Finally,\nwe explore various coupled fluid systems in the half space including viscous\nresistive magnetohydrodynamics equations, a coupled system for the flow and the\nmagnetic field of MHD type, and the nematic liquid crystal flow. For each of\nthese systems, we construct mild solutions in $L^q$, pointwise decay, and\nuniformly local $L^q$ spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
