An\nessential area of communications improvement is reliably characterizing and\nminimizing interference on UAM aircraft from other aircraft and ground\nvehicles. To achieve this, reliable and accurate line-of-sight (LOS) models\nmust be used. In this work, we highlight the limitations of a LOS probability\nmodel extensively used in the literature in accurately predicting interference\ncaused by smart ground vehicles. Then, we introduce a novel probability of LOS\nmodel that improves interference prediction by incorporating the urban\ntopography and the dynamic positioning of ground vehicles on streets. Our\nmodel's parameters are derived from extensive simulations and validated through\nreal-world urban settings to ensure reliability and applicability.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
