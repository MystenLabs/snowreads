The objective of this work is\nto present an account of our experiences and activities carried out in Italian\nschools with this novel approach. The selection of projects and experiences\ndiscussed --in which students develop a range of core competencies such as\ncollaboration, creativity, critical thinking, experimentation, prototyping,\ncommunication and problem-solving; include tangible complex 3D printed\nstructures, large micro-controller board replicas and the visualization of wind\ndynamics and tiny invisible elementary particles among others. These hands-on\nexperiences demonstrate the benefits on the use of digital fabrication\ntechnologies implemented within a FabLab for STEM learning.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eJ0re16qi642za2cHsIBUJi6faW4_4ld2SKymoKwfeY","pdfSize":"7475512"}
