In the last couple\nyears progress has been made to understand their role in the context of matrix\nmodels, where it is possible to define a generalization of the volumes in terms\nof an infinite set of coupling constants $t_k$. Using a recent open string\nmatrix model construction we calculate the generalized Weil-Petersson volumes\nfor fixed genus $g = 0,1$ and an arbitrary number of boundaries $n$. Both\nresults are expressed in terms of the perturbative expansion of the solution to\nthe string equation of the matrix model in the closed string sector. The\nformalism has the added benefit of applying to type 0A superstring matrix\nmodels with nonzero Ramond-Ramond flux.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zws7-85WcI4o8fvoDZcVfcz-SvHgwOtju9QVgfDPBpQ","pdfSize":"135856"}
