We provide some applications of this result.\nFirst, we establish a canonical way to reduce the dimensionality of matrices by\ncomparing matrices of different dimensions in the space of DiKernels. Then, we\ndevelop a model of Lobby Competition where two lobbies compete to bias the\nopinion of a continuum of agents. We give sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of a Nash Equilibrium. Furthermore, we establish the conditions under\nwhich a Nash Equilibrium of the game induce an $\\varepsilon$-Nash Equilibrium\nof the discretization of the game. Finally, we put forward some elements for\nthe characterization of equilibrium strategies.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
