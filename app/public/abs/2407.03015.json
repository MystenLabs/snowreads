After the discovery of a particle that complies with\nthe properties of the Higgs boson of the Standard Model, all SM parameters are\nin principle determined. However, in order to verify or falsify the model, the\nfull form of the potential has to be determined. This includes the measurement\nof the triple and quartic scalar couplings. We here report on ongoing progress\nof measurements for multi scalar final states, with an emphasis on three\nSM-like scalar bosons at 125 GeV, but also mentioning other options. We discuss\nboth experimental progress and challenges as well as theoretical studies and\nmodels that can enhance such rates with respect to the SM predictions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
