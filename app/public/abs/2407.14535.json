The EU's Horizon 2050 initiative sets\nambitious goals to reduce these impacts through enhanced building renovation\nrates. The CoE HiDALGO2 supports this initiative by developing high-performance\ncomputing solutions, specifically through the Urban Building pilot application,\nwhich utilizes advanced CI/CD methodologies to streamline simulation and\ndeployment across various computational platforms, such as the EuroHPC JU\nsupercomputers. The present work provides an overview of the Ktirio Urban\nBuilding framework (KUB), starting with an overview of the workflow and a\ndescription of some of the main ingredients of the software stack and discusses\nsome current results performed on EuroHPC JU supercomputers using an innovative\nCI/CD pipeline.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
