The proposed framework leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to represent various events in a user's behavioral history, such as\nviewing an item, applying a coupon, or purchasing an item, as semantic\nembedding vectors. We train a model to predict transitions between events from\ntheir LLM embeddings, which can even generalize to unseen events by learning\nfrom diverse training data. In web-marketing applications, we leverage this\ntransition prediction model to simulate how users might react differently when\nnew campaigns or products are presented to them. This allows us to eliminate\nthe need for costly online testing and enhance the marketers' abilities to\nreveal insights. Our numerical evaluation and user study, utilizing BigQuery\nPublic Datasets from the Google Merchandise Store, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
