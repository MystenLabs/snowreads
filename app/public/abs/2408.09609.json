The behavior of the angles can\nbe explained by a transition in dominance of the orthogonal polarization modes\nor a vector rotation caused by a change in the phase difference between the\nmodes. Four polarization models are examined to quantify and understand the\nbehavior of the angles at a mode transition: coherent polarization modes,\npartially coherent modes, incoherent modes with nonorthogonal polarization\nvectors, and incoherent orthogonal modes with an elliptically polarized\nemission component. In all four models, the trajectory of the mode transition\non the Poincar\\'e sphere follows the geodesic that connects the orientations of\nthe mode polarization vectors. The results from the models can be similar,\nindicating that the interpretation of an observed transition within the context\nof a particular model is not necessarily unique. The polarization fraction of\nthe emission and the average ellipticity angle depend upon the statistical\ncharacter of the mode intensity fluctuations. The polarization fraction\nincreases as the fluctuations increase. The excursion in ellipticity angle can\nbe large when the mode intensities are quasi-stable and is suppressed when the\nintensity fluctuations are large.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
