While theoretical and experimental studies have extended this\nmodel to include various other energy scales, the effect of the lack of a\ncommon SIA axis is not well explored. Here we investigate the magnetic\nproperties of Ni(pyrimidine)(H$_{2}$O)$_{2}$(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, a chain compound\nwhere the tilting of Ni octahedra leads to a 2-fold alternation of the\neasy-axis directions along the chain. Muon-spin relaxation measurements\nindicate a transition to long-range order at $T_{\\text{N}}=2.3$\\,K and the\nmagnetic structure is initially determined to be antiferromagnetic and\ncollinear using elastic neutron diffraction experiments. Inelastic neutron\nscattering measurements were used to find $J_{0} = 5.107(7)$\\,K, $D =\n2.79(1)$\\,K, $J'_{2}=0.18(3)$\\,K and a rhombic anisotropy energy\n$E=0.19(9)$\\,K. Mean-field modelling reveals that the ground state structure\nhosts spin canting of $\\phi\\approx6.5^{\\circ}$, which is not detectable above\nthe noise floor of the elastic neutron diffraction data. Monte-Carlo simulation\nof the powder-averaged magnetization, $M(H)$, is then used to confirm these\nHamiltonian parameters, while single-crystal $M(H)$ simulations provide insight\ninto features observed in the data.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4kO3TbQyiuHs4r8y-SxHh5Ix-w8rLahzaId-Sez52es","pdfSize":"7566442"}
