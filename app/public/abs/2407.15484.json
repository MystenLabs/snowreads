Starting from the object surface, we define a radiant Ellicell that\nuniformly generates rays departing from each ellipsoid that parameterize the\n3DGS model. Each Ellicell ray is associated with the rendering parameters of\neach ellipsoid, which in turn is used to obtain the best bindings between the\ntarget image pixels and the cast rays. These pixel-ray bindings are then ranked\nto select the best scoring bundle of rays, which their intersection provides\nthe camera center and, in turn, the camera rotation. The proposed solution\nobviates the necessity of an \"a priori\" pose for initialization, and it solves\n6DoF pose estimation in closed form, without the need for iterations. Moreover,\ncompared to the existing Novel View Synthesis (NVS) baselines for pose\nestimation, 6DGS can improve the overall average rotational accuracy by 12% and\ntranslation accuracy by 22% on real scenes, despite not requiring any\ninitialization pose. At the same time, our method operates near real-time,\nreaching 15fps on consumer hardware.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
