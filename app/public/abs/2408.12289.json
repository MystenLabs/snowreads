In it, we\npresent overall ethical requirements and six ethical principles with\nvalue-specific recommendations for tools to implement these principles into\ntechnology. Our value-specific recommendations address the principles of\nfairness, privacy and data protection, safety and robustness, sustainability,\ntransparency and explainability and truthfulness. For each principle, we also\npresent examples of criteria for risk assessment and categorization of AI\nsystems and applications in line with the categories of the European Union (EU)\nAI Act. Our work is aimed at stakeholders who can take it as a potential\nblueprint to fulfill minimum ethical requirements for trustworthy AI and AI\nCertification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BuRuQeeTJzYFTxI_tCH_RI5uZMNjUmDi7tRo6tWJEm8","pdfSize":"524831"}
