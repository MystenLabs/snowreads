Based on a comprehensive\ninventory of 1,211 ground-based observatories and space missions, we assessed\nthe evolution of the number of astronomical facilities and their carbon\nfootprint from 1945 to 2022. We found that space missions dominate greenhouse\ngas emissions in astronomy, showing an important peak at the end of the\n1960ies, followed by a decrease that has turned again into a rise over the last\ndecade. Extrapolating past trends, we predict that greenhouse gas emissions\nfrom astronomical facilities will experience no strong decline in the future,\nand may even rise substantially, unless research practices are changed. We\ndemonstrate that a continuing growth in the number of operating astronomical\nfacilities is not environmentally sustainable. These findings should motivate\nthe astronomical community to reflect about the necessary evolutions that would\nput astronomical research on a sustainable path.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B2JOzfwAPWTLeoiB3j_0CXuQF_6xMSIowx1Y7rcuM_E","pdfSize":"1249375"}
