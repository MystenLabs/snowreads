A number of bilinear equations of the Hirota-Miwa type are\nobtained as its corollaries. We also consider the dispersionless version of the\nhierarchy as a set of nonlinear differential equations for the dispersionless\nlimit of logarithm of the tau-function (the $F$-function). We show that there\nis an elliptic curve built in the structure of the hierarchy, with the elliptic\nmodulus being a dynamical variable. This curve can be uniformized by elliptic\nfunctions, and in the elliptic parametrization many dispersionless equations of\nthe Hirota-Miwa type become equivalent to a single equation having a nice form.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
