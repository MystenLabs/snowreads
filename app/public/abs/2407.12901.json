We conduct an experiment that simultaneously measures $g^{(2)} (0)$\nthrough direct photocounting and reconstructs the Wigner function via homodyne\ntomography. The results confirm our theoretical predictions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
