Recent James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies\nwere in place beyond redshift $z = 14$, when the Universe was less than 300 Myr\nold. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as\ndamping-wing absorption of Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$), the principal hydrogen\ntransition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these\nsources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here\nwe report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES)\nof a galaxy at redshift $z = 13.0$ that reveal a singular, bright emission line\nunambiguously identified as Ly$\\alpha$, in addition to a smooth turnover. We\nobserve an equivalent width of $\\text{EW}_\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha} > 40 \\, \\AA$ (rest\nframe), previously only seen at $z < 9$ where the intervening intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with a very blue UV\ncontinuum, the Ly$\\alpha$ line indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer of\nionising photons, a significant fraction of which may escape. This suggests it\nresides in an early reionised region preventing complete extinction of\nLy$\\alpha$, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and\nthe onset of Reionisation only 330 Myr after the Big Bang.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LcGmbLQAUAQErIxDlTjlFh7nMSM6u4QD-nl8ebWcVCw","pdfSize":"10153078"}
