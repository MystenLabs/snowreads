Our method of proof relies on a\ndescription of the action of a reduced Perron-Frobenius operator by means of a\ncomparison to the symmetric simple random walk with an absorbing wall, aka\n`gambler's ruin problem'.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
