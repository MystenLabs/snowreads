However, the detection stability cannot be accessed\nby existing metrics such as mAP and MOTA, and consequently is less explored by\nthe community. To bridge this gap, this work proposes Stability Index (SI), a\nnew metric that can comprehensively evaluate the stability of 3D detectors in\nterms of confidence, box localization, extent, and heading. By benchmarking\nstate-of-the-art object detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, SI reveals\ninteresting properties of object stability that have not been previously\ndiscovered by other metrics. To help models improve their stability, we further\nintroduce a general and effective training strategy, called Prediction\nConsistency Learning (PCL). PCL essentially encourages the prediction\nconsistency of the same objects under different timestamps and augmentations,\nleading to enhanced detection stability. Furthermore, we examine the\neffectiveness of PCL with the widely-used CenterPoint, and achieve a remarkable\nSI of 86.00 for vehicle class, surpassing the baseline by 5.48. We hope our\nwork could serve as a reliable baseline and draw the community's attention to\nthis crucial issue in 3D object detection. Codes will be made publicly\navailable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
