This paper proposes an extension to the telegate and\nteledata protocols to allow for asynchronous classical communication which\nhides the cost of distributed quantum operations. We then discuss the benefits\nand limitations of these asynchronous protocols and propose a potential way to\nimprove these asynchronous protocols using nonunitary operators. Finally, a\nquantum network card is described as an example of how asynchronous quantum\noperations might be used.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
