These\ncompartment-specific properties have been widely used in clinical studies.\nHowever, conventional dMRI cannot disentangle differences in relaxations\nbetween tissue compartments, causing biased estimates of diffusion measures\nwhich also change with TE. To solve the problem, combined relaxometry-diffusion\nimaging methods have been developed in recent years, providing compartmental\nT2-diffusion or T2*-diffusion imaging respectively, but not T2 and T2*\ntogether. As they provide complementary information, a technique that can\nestimate both jointly with diffusion is appealing to neuroimaging studies. The\naim of this work is to develop a method to map compartmental T2-T2*-diffusion\nsimultaneously. Using an advanced MRI acquisition called diffusion-PEPTIDE, a\nnovel microstructure model is proposed and a multi-step fitting method is\ndeveloped to estimate parameters of interest. We demonstrate for the first time\nthat compartmental T2, T2* can be estimated simultaneously from in vivo data.\nwe further show the accuracy and precision of parameter estimation with\nsimulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
