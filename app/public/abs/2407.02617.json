We apply this method to a generic spin-boson Hamiltonian that has\nboth Tavis-Cummings and Holstein type couplings, and which has broad\napplications to a variety of quantum simulation platforms, polaritonic physics,\nand quantum chemistry. Additionally, we discuss how the recently developed\ntruncated Wigner approximation for open quantum systems can be applied to the\nsame Hamiltonian. We benchmark the performance of both methods and identify the\nregimes where each method is best suited to. Finally we discuss strategies to\nimprove each technique.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
