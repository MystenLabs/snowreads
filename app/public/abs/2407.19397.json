Traditional\nunsupervised domain adaptive detection methods often struggle with this shift,\nleading to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a\nnovel domain adaptive approach for lung nodule detection that leverages mean\nteacher self-training and contrastive learning. First, we propose a\nhierarchical contrastive learning strategy to refine nodule representations and\nenhance the distinction between nodules and background. Second, we introduce a\nnodule-level domain-invariant feature learning (NDL) module to capture\ndomain-invariant features through adversarial learning across different\ndomains. Additionally, we propose a new annotated dataset of X-ray images to\naid in advancing lung nodule detection research. Extensive experiments\nconducted on multiple X-ray datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach\nin mitigating domain shift impacts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
