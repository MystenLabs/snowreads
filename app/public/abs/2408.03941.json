A generally accepted derivation\nof this rule has not yet been proposed. In the given work, a simple physical\npicture is constructed within which the Born rule arises in a natural way. In\nthe proposed scheme, the interaction of a particle with a measuring apparatus\nis equivalent to creation of a \"mirror image\" of particle wave function in the\nspace region of interaction. The observable quantity is the product of the\nparticle wave function and its \"image\". The phase of the latter is reversed due\nto Newton's third law, thus leading to the Born rule.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
