When using cutoff regularization, a\nnew Feynman rule from the path integral measure is required if one is to\npreserve the symmetry. The physical running of the coupling with\nrenormalization scale arises from a UV finite Feynman integral in all schemes.\nWe reproduce the usual result with asymptotic freedom, but the pathway to\nobtaining the beta function can be different in different schemes. We also\ncomment on the way that this model evades the classic argument by Landau\nagainst asymptotic freedom in non-gauge theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
