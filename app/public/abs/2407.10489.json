This turns out to be an algebraic number\nstrictly between the obvious bounds of $2r-1$ and $2r$, tending to $2r$ as the\nrank tends to infinity. We also find an explicit expression for the exponential\ngrowth rate of the number of idempotents, and prove that this tends to\n$\\sqrt{e(2k-1)}$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
