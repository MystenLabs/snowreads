We provide a method to estimate the non-perturbative EW scale\ngeneration using the exact solution of the background equations of motion in a\nscalar theory via the Dyson-Schwinger approach. Particularly, we find an\nanalytical result for the Higgs mass in the strongly coupled regime in terms of\nits quartic self interaction term and the cut-off scale of the theory. We also\nshow that the Higgs sector is an essential part of the Standard Model as,\nwithout it, a Yang--Mills gauge theory cannot acquire mass even if a\nself-interaction term is present. Our analysis lead to a more realistic model\nbuilding with possible solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem and, in\ngeneral, to the dynamical generation of any scales scales in nature, be it the\nvisible sector or the dark sector.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
