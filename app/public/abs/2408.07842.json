By introducing functional index parallel\ntrends and no anticipation assumptions, this paper identifies and provides\nuniform inference procedures for QTT/DTT. The inference procedure applies under\nboth the canonical two-group and staggered treatment designs with balanced\npanels, unbalanced panels, or repeated cross-sections. Monte Carlo experiments\ndemonstrate the proposed method's robust and competitive performance, while an\nempirical application illustrates its practical utility.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
