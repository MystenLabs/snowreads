In particular,\nself-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean\nAdS$_4$, and non-compact $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to\nBurns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen\nmetric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise\nfrom a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological\nconstant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\\mathbb{CP}^1$\nat infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation\nof the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\\wedge$ which reduces to previously\nstudied algebras in various limits. A companion paper will discuss additional\ndetails and relations to previously studied self-dual black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gJdZbTnUl6B94Wb_rsm0r8n3Pnvu6CxksKtT3fVi1MY","pdfSize":"276441"}
