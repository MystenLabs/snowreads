We introduce a framework for\nsimulating quantum channels using ensembles of low-depth circuits in place of\nmany-qubit dilations. This naturally enables simulations of open systems, which\nwe demonstrate by preparing damped many-qubit GHZ states on ibm_hanoi. The\ntechnique further inspires two Hamiltonian simulation algorithms with\nasymptotic independence of the spectral precision, reducing resource\nrequirements by several orders of magnitude for a benchmark system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
