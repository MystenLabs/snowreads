To obtain this model, three singlet new\nHiggs superfields and right-handed neutrinos are added to the MSSM, which can\nexplain the results of neutrino oscillation experiments. The neutrino\ntransition magnetic moment is induced by electroweak radiative corrections. By\napplying effective Lagrangian method and on-shell scheme, we study the\nassociated Feynman diagrams and the transition magnetic moment of neutrinos in\nthe model. We fit experimental data for neutrino mass variances and mixing\nangle. Based on the range of data selection, the influences of different\nsensitive parameters on the results are analysed. The numerical analysis shows\nthat many parameters have an effect on the neutrino transition moment, such as\n$g_X$, $M_2$, $\\lambda_H$ and $g_{YX}$. For our numerical results, the order of\nmagnitude of $\\mu_{ij}^M/\\mu_B$ is around $10^{-20}$ $\\sim$ $10^{-19}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
