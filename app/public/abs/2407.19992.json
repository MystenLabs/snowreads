While the\nperformance of the ED algorithm has been improved greatly by introducing\nCNN-based models, current models still suffer from unsatisfactory precision\nrates especially when only a low error toleration distance is allowed.\nTherefore, model architecture for more precise predictions still needs an\ninvestigation. On the other hand, the unavoidable noise training data provided\nby humans would lead to unsatisfactory model predictions even when inputs are\nedge maps themselves, which also needs improvement. In this paper, more precise\nED models are presented with cascaded skipping density blocks (CSDB). Our\nmodels obtain state-of-the-art(SOTA) predictions in several datasets,\nespecially in average precision rate (AP), which is confirmed by extensive\nexperiments. Moreover, our models do not include down-sample operations,\ndemonstrating those widely believed operations are not necessary. Also, a novel\nmodification on data augmentation for training is employed, which allows\nnoiseless data to be employed in model training and thus improves the\nperformance of models predicting on edge maps themselves.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
