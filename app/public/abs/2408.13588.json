This model, referred to as RNN-HAR,\nextends the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model, a framework known for\nefficiently capturing long memory in realized measures, by integrating a\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) to handle non-linear dynamics. Loss-based\ngeneralized Bayesian inference with Sequential Monte Carlo is employed for\nmodel estimation and sequential prediction in RNN HAR. The empirical analysis\nis conducted using daily closing prices and realized measures from 2000 to 2022\nacross 31 market indices. The proposed models one step ahead VaR forecasting\nperformance is compared against a basic HAR model and its extensions. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed RNN-HAR model consistently outperforms\nall other models considered in the study.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
