However, it is not clear how TCP Prague, a prototype\nscalable congestion control for L4S, behaves when L4S is not yet universally\ndeployed. Specifically, we consider the question: in a partial L4S deployment,\nwill a user benefit by unilaterally switching from the status quo TCP to TCP\nPrague? To address this question, we evaluate the performance of a TCP Prague\nflow when sharing an L4S or non-L4S bottleneck queue with a non-L4S flow. Our\nfindings suggest that the L4S congestion control, TCP Prague, has less\nfavorable throughput or fairness properties than TCP Cubic or BBR in some\ncoexistence scenarios, which may hinder adoption.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
