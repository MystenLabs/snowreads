This approach needs to combine well-established entangling\noperations between distant registers using photonic degrees of freedom with\ndirect interactions between matter qubits within a solid-state register. The\nhigh-fidelity control of such a register, however, poses significant\nchallenges. In this work, we address these challenges with pulsed control\nsequences which modulate all inter-spin interactions to preserve the\nnearest-neighbor couplings while eliminating unwanted long-range interactions.\nWe derive pulse sequences, including broadband and selective gates, using\ncomposite pulse and shaped pulse techniques as well as optimal control methods.\nThis ensures robustness against uncertainties in spin positions, static offset\ndetunings, and Rabi frequency fluctuations of the control fields. The control\ntechniques developed here apply well beyond the present setting to a broad\nrange of physical platforms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods for the\nresource state generation for fusion-based quantum computing in four- and\nsix-spin systems encoded in the electronic ground states of nitrogen-vacancy\ncenters. We also outline other elements of the proposed architecture,\nhighlighting its potential for advancing quantum computing technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"th4UObur1QusmepExNmDYkhXhrsfMt4iXiGdquzcqxs","pdfSize":"1664462"}
