The look-ahead effect of CAVs is captured by a non-local\naveraged density within a certain distance (the look-ahead distance). We show,\nusing wave perturbation analysis, that increased look-ahead distance loosens\nthe stability criteria. Our numerical experiments, however, showed that a\nlonger look-ahead distance does not necessarily lead to faster convergence to\nequilibrium states. We also examined the impact of spatial distributions and\nmarket penetrations of CAVs and showed that increased market penetration helps\nstabilizing mixed traffic while the spatial distribution of CAVs have less\neffect on stability. The results revealed the potential of using CAVs to\nstabilize traffic, and may provide qualitative insights on speed control in the\nmixed autonomy environment.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
