Clark, R. Exel, E. Pardo, C. Starling, and A.\nSims in 2019, and we prove results generalizing theirs. Our first main result\nis a sufficient condition for simplicity of the Steinberg algebra satisfying\nconditions modeled on the behavior of the groupoid associated to the first\nGrigorchuk group. This closely resembles conditions found by B. Steinberg and\nN. Szak\\'acs. As a key ingredient we identify an infinite family of\n$2-(2q-1,q-1,q/2-1)$-designs, where $q$ is a positive even integer. We then\ndeduce the simplicity of the associated $C^*$-algebra, which is our second main\nresult. Results of similar type were considered by B. Steinberg and N.\nSzak\\'acs in 2021, and later by K. Yoshida, but their methods did not follow\nthe original methods of the five authors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
