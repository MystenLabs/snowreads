We illustrate this using (3+1)-dimensional Adjoint QCD\nwith two flavors of Weyl fermions as an example. For the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ case,\nC\\'ordova and Dumitrescu proposed a non-supersymmetric deformation of the\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory leading to dynamical abelianization, followed by\nmonopole condensation, and resulting in a confining infrared (IR) phase\ncharacterized by disjoint copies of the $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model. In this\nscenario, we point out that the abelianized phase has an emergent\nnon-invertible symmetry, which is matched with the non-invertible symmetry of\nthe IR $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ phase, associated to the Hopf solitons. This result\nillustrate how an emergent non-invertible symmetry can be used to provide a\nbridge connecting the IR solitons and their properties with the ones of\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom in gauge theories with one-form symmetries.\nMoreover, based on this insight we generalize these results to other gauge\ntheories with any number of colors, and propose a candidate for the UV baryon\noperator in all these cases.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
