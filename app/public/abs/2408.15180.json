Mason-Stothers Theorem is a\nfunction field analogue of the ABC conjecture that admits a much more\nelementary proof with many interesting consequences, including a polynomial\nversion of Fermat's Last Theorem. While years of dedicated effort are expected\nfor a full formalization of Fermat's Last Theorem, the simple proof of\nMason-Stothers Theorem and its corollaries calls for an immediate\nformalization.\n  We formalize an elementary proof of by Snyder in Lean 4, and also formalize\nmany consequences of Mason-Stothers, including (i) non-solvability of\nFermat-Cartan equations in polynomials, (ii) non-parametrizability of a certain\nelliptic curve, and (iii) Davenport's Theorem. We compare our work to existing\nformalizations of Mason-Stothers by Eberl in Isabelle and Wagemaker in Lean 3\nrespectively. Our formalization is based on the mathlib4 library of Lean 4, and\nis currently being ported back to mathlib4.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BgBOXU8j8_BNHLgyqqkuy84Mkjnz1GKKy0Xl-mv6xfI","pdfSize":"260519"}
