Therefore,\nthere is an urgent need to map the extent of tropical forest ecosystems.\nRecently, deep learning has come out as a powerful tool to map these ecosystems\nwith the caveat of curating high quality reference datasets. Since, manually\nannotating high quality reference datasets is time consuming and expensive,\nweakly supervised learning techniques offer the potential to train high quality\nmodels without the need for manually annotating large quantities of reference\ndatasets. In this manuscript, we propose two weakly supervised approaches that\nare based on Sentinel-1 SAR images, sparsely distributed pixel-wise high\nquality reference labels and densely distributed noisy reference labels. The\nproposed approaches were tested in a tropical setting in the Brazilian amazon.\nThe results demonstrate that high quality tropical forest maps can be derived\nfrom weakly supervised learning without the need for manually annotated labels.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
