Given a\ndirected edge-weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$, where $V=\\{r\\}\\cup S \\cup T$, and an\ninteger $k$, the goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph of $G$ in which there\nare $k$ edge-disjoint $rt$-paths for every terminal $t\\in T$. The problem is\nknow to be NP-hard. Furthermore, the question on whether a polynomial time,\nsubpolynomial approximation algorithm exists for $k$-DST was answered\nnegatively by Grandoni et al. (2018), by proving an approximation hardness of\n$\\Omega (|T|/\\log |T|)$ under $NP\\neq ZPP$. Inspired by modern day\napplications, we focus on developing efficient algorithms for $k$-DST in graphs\nwhere terminals have out-degree $0$, and furthermore constitute the vast\nmajority in the graph. We provide the first approximation algorithm for $k$-DST\non such graphs, in which the approximation ratio depends (primarily) on the\nsize of $S$. We present a randomized algorithm that finds a solution of weight\nat most $\\mathcal O(k|S|\\log |T|)$ times the optimal weight, and with high\nprobability runs in polynomial time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
