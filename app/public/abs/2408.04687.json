We study a variant where one face may be an exception. For a convex\npolygon P, if there is a convex polyhedron that has P as one face and all the\nother faces are convex polyiamonds, then we say that P can be domed. Our main\nresult is a complete characterization of which equiangular n-gons can be domed:\nonly if n is in {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12}, and only with some conditions on the\ninteger edge lengths.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cl_HZGLa-qUiKtzfSnKZoS0S18DO49o3zwctalZXrjw","pdfSize":"8029287"}
