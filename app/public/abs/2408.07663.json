While prior defenses mitigate these risks\nby perturbing or inspecting inputs, they ignore competing objectives, the\nunderlying cause of alignment failures. In this paper, we propose\nAlignment-Enhanced Decoding (AED), a novel defense that employs adaptive\ndecoding to address the root causes of jailbreak issues. We first define the\nCompetitive Index to quantify alignment failures and utilize feedback from\nself-evaluation to compute post-alignment logits. Then, AED adaptively combines\nAED and post-alignment logits with the original logits to obtain harmless and\nhelpful distributions. Consequently, our method enhances safety alignment while\nmaintaining helpfulness. We conduct experiments across five models and four\ncommon jailbreaks, with the results validating the effectiveness of our\napproach.
