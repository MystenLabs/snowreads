Existing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods struggle with complex feature\ndistributions and cannot effectively assess uncertainty, making it hard to\nevaluate the reliability of their processed results. To address these issues,\nwe propose a new method using a generative diffusion model (GDM). Here, in the\ntraining phase, we use the imaging results from sparse data as conditional\ninput, combined with noisy versions of dense data imaging results, for the\nnetwork to predict the added noise. After training, the network can predict the\nimaging results for test images from sparse data acquisition, using the\ngenerative process with conditional control. This GDM not only improves image\nquality and removes artifacts caused by sparse data, but also naturally\nevaluates uncertainty by leveraging the probabilistic nature of the GDM. To\novercome the decline in generation quality and the memory burden of large-scale\nimages, we develop a patch fusion strategy that effectively addresses these\nissues. Synthetic and field data examples demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly enhances imaging quality and provides effective uncertainty\nquantification.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
