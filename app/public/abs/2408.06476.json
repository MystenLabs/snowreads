The use of scheduling matrices, over\nscalar scheduling signals, realizes greater design freedom, which in turn can\nimprove closed-loop performance. The form and properties of the scheduling\nmatrices such that the overall gain-scheduled controller is VSP are explicitly\ndiscussed. The proposed gain-scheduled VSP controller is used to control a\nrigid two-link robot subject to model uncertainty where robust input-output\nstability is assured via the passivity theorem. Numerical simulation results\nhighlight the greater design freedom, resulting in improved performance, when\nscheduling matrices are used over scalar scheduled signals.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
