Further, we show that\nif the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching\noperations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of\ncommuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient\nalgorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends\nthat given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve\nthree qudit spin models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
