The model is then used to count the number of $d$-term silting\nobjects for linearly oriented $A_n$, recovering the result that they are\ncounted by the Pfaff-Fuss-Catalan numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
