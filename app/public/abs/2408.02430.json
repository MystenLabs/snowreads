The proposed framework utilized a quantized\nsequence of input with(out) continuous pretrained self-supervised\nrepresentation. We show the efficacy of the pipeline using limited data for\nArabic, a dialect-rich language containing more than 22 major dialects.\nPhonetically correct transcribed speech resources for dialectal Arabic are\nscarce. Therefore, we introduce ArabVoice15, a first-of-its-kind, curated test\nset featuring 5 hours of dialectal speech across 15 Arab countries, with\nphonetically accurate transcriptions, including borrowed and dialect-specific\nsounds. We described in detail the annotation guideline along with the analysis\nof the dialectal confusion pairs. Our extensive evaluation includes both\nsubjective -- human perception tests and objective measures. Our empirical\nresults, reported with three test sets, show that with only one and half hours\nof training data, our model improve character error rate by ~ 7\\% in\nArabVoice15 compared to the baseline.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hwGdIP6Ryv7-Iw7Yeh05e7Naby1HTWGMHXA4gLlqL_o","pdfSize":"2758591"}
