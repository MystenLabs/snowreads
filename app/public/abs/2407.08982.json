In this paper, we try to understand the driving\nforces of chiral CDW transition by chiral phonons from the electron-phonon\ncoupling scenario. We use the prototypal monolayer 1T-TiSe$_2$ as a case study\nto unveil the absence of chirality in the CDW transition and propose a general\napproach, i.e., symmetry-breaking stimuli, to engineer the chirality of CDW in\nexperiments. Inelastic scattering patterns are also studied as a benchmark of\nchiral CDW (CCDW, which breaks the mirror/inversion symmetry in 2D/3D systems).\nWe notice that the anisotropy changing of Bragg peak profiles, which is\ncontributed by the soft chiral phonons, can show a remarkable signature for\nCCDW. Our findings pave a path to understanding the CCDW from the chiral phonon\nperspective, especially in van der Waals materials, and provide a powerful way\nto manipulate the chirality of CDW.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
