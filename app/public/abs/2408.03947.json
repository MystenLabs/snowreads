The challenge focuses on detecting 18 workout activities (and\nthe null class) using accelerometer data from 4 wearables - one worn on each\nlimb. Data analysis revealed inconsistencies in wearable orientation within and\nacross participants, leading to exploring novel multi-wearable data\naugmentation techniques. We investigate three models using a fixed feature set:\n(i) \"raw\": using all data as is, (ii) \"left-right swapping\": augmenting data by\nswapping left and right limb pairs, and (iii) \"upper-lower limb paring\":\nstacking data by using upper-lower limb pair combinations (2 wearables). Our\nexperiments utilize traditional machine learning with multi-window feature\nextraction and temporal smoothing. Using 3-fold cross-validation, the raw model\nachieves a macro F1-score of 90.01%, whereas left-right swapping and\nupper-lower limb paring improve the scores to 91.30% and 91.87% respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
