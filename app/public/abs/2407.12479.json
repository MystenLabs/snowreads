This problem has remained\nunresolved due to the gap in simulation setup between recent collision\ndetection and response approaches and self-supervised neural simulators. The\nformer requires collision-free initial setups, while the latter necessitates\nrandom cloth instantiation during training. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nnovel loss based on Global Intersection Analysis (GIA). This loss extracts the\nvolume surrounded by the cloth region that forms the penetration. By\nconstructing an energy based on this volume, our self-supervised neural\nsimulator can effectively address cloth self-collisions. Moreover, we develop a\nself-collision-aware graph neural network capable of learning to handle\nself-collisions, even for parts that are topologically distant from one\nanother. Additionally, we introduce an effective external force scheme that\nenables the simulation to learn the cloth's behavior in response to random\nexternal forces. We validate the efficacy of SENC through extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments, demonstrating that it effectively\nreduces cloth self-collision while maintaining high-quality animation results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
