This supports design\nthinking in many ways: to capture domain knowledge, to support a wide variety\nof design activity, to analyze or predict properties of alternatives, to\nunderstand interactions and dependencies among design choices. We present a\nsampling of what designers, especially software designers, mean when they say\n\"design space\" and provide examples of the roles their design spaces serve in\ntheir design activity. This shows how design spaces can serve designers as\nlenses to reduce the overall space of possibilities and support systematic\ndesign decision making.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
