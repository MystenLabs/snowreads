We show that the system continues to exhibit\nBEC once the trap has been released and that the dynamics of the condensate is\ndescribed by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Like the recent work\n\\cite{BS}, we obtain optimal bounds on the number of excitations orthogonal to\nthe condensate state. In contrast to \\cite{BS}, however, whose main strategy\nconsists of controlling the number of excitations with regards to a suitable\nfluctuation dynamics $t\\mapsto e^{-B_t} e^{-iH_Nt}$ with renormalized\ngenerator, our proof is based on controlling renormalized excitation number\noperators directly with regards to the Schr\\\"odinger dynamics $t\\mapsto\ne^{-iH_Nt}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ioe6-T316reveTe239m5N70vcywua6A4UiHyVrk6KgI","pdfSize":"324594","objectId":"0x5fd57e17e334e1f44e5dfba6d526e423f3e940b111169ef1fc77786d16fcb3d0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
