Conventional methods of estimation rely on\ncoherent laser sources, and in turn suffer from inherent limitations in\nestimating weak absorption. Here we propose a new measurement strategy with\ncorrelated photons to determine the weak absorption by distinguishing the\noutput with and without photons, dubbed as the on-off measurement. Our\nimplementation within the strategy allows the estimation precision to reach the\nultimate quantum limit. We demonstrate that absorption spectroscopy that\nincorporates quantum correlations is capable of estimating weak absorption down\nto a single-photon level, even in noisy environments, achieving a precision\ncomparable to that obtained through several hundred photons in conventional\nabsorption spectroscopy. By introducing the quantum correlations, our work\navoids the occurrence of light-induced damage while breaking the classical\ninherent limitations in spectroscopy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
