However, deep\nneural networks often require large datasets of labeled samples to generalize\neffectively, and an important area of active research is semi-supervised\nlearning, which attempts to instead utilize large quantities of (easily\nacquired) unlabeled samples. One family of methods in this space is\npseudo-labeling, a class of algorithms that use model outputs to assign labels\nto unlabeled samples which are then used as labeled samples during training.\nSuch assigned labels, called pseudo-labels, are most commonly associated with\nthe field of semi-supervised learning. In this work we explore a broader\ninterpretation of pseudo-labels within both self-supervised and unsupervised\nmethods. By drawing the connection between these areas we identify new\ndirections when advancements in one area would likely benefit others, such as\ncurriculum learning and self-supervised regularization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F8izaR37RkNsJIvCsumFGYCfoXq7SGvV5nm-fQegbK8","pdfSize":"885160"}
