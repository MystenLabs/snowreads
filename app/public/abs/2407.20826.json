This paper explores a novel\nscenario where agents control both drift and diffusion. This leads to a fully\nnon-linear MFG system with a fully non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.\nWe use viscosity arguments to prove existence of solutions for the HJB\nequation, and then we adapt and extend a result from Krylov to prove a\n$\\mathcal C^3$ regularity for $u$ in the space variable. This allows us to\nprove a well-posedness result for the MFG system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
