However,\nexisting methods used for this purpose often are coarse-level and lack\nfine-grained analysis for efficient annotation. To mitigate these issues, this\npaper proposes a novel method for detecting retinal branching angles using a\nself-configured image processing technique. Additionally, we offer an\nopen-source annotation tool and a benchmark dataset comprising 40 images\nannotated with retinal branching angles. Our methodology for retinal branching\nangle detection and calculation is detailed, followed by a benchmark analysis\ncomparing our method with previous approaches. The results indicate that our\nmethod is robust under various conditions with high accuracy and efficiency,\nwhich offers a valuable instrument for ophthalmic research and clinical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
