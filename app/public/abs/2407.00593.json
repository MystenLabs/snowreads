Therefore, in attempts to\nquantize gravity, one may consider an infinite dimensional space of\n$2$-surfaces instead of an infinite dimensional space of $4$-dimensional\nLorentzian spacetimes. However, existing definitions for quasilocal mass only\napplies to surfaces outside an horizon whose mean curvature vector is\nspacelike. In this paper, we propose an extension of the Wang-Yau quasi-local\nenergy/mass to surfaces with timelike mean curvature vector, including in\nparticular trapped surfaces. We adopt the same canonical gauge as in the\nWang-Yau quasi-local energy but allow the pulled back \"killing vector\" to the\nphysical spacetime to be spacelike. We define the new quasi-local energy along\nthe Hamiltonian formulation of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. The new\ndefinition yields a positive definite surface energy density and a new\ndivergence free current. Calculations for coordinate spheres in Kerr family\nspacetime are shown. In the spherical symmetric case, our definition reduces to\na previous definition \\cite{lundgren2007self}.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"7fU-bymDV7x1h1xn33WaqXlryBdxdfG_Z5pD1BV8dDM","pdfSize":"383728"}
