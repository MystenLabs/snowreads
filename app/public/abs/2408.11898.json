One widely-used strategy to\nmitigate this problem has been to partition an operator's Pauli terms into sets\nof mutually commuting operators. Here, we introduce a method that relaxes this\nconstraint of commutativity, instead allowing for entirely arbitrary terms to\nbe grouped together, save a locality constraint. The key idea is that we\ndecompose the operator into arbitrary tensor products with bounded tensor size,\nignoring Pauli commuting relations. This method -- named $k$-NoCliD ($k$-local\nnon-Clifford diagonalization) -- allows one to measure in far fewer bases in\nmost cases, often (though not always) at the cost of increasing the circuit\ndepth. We introduce several partitioning algorithms tailored to both fermionic\nand bosonic Hamiltonians. For electronic structure, vibrational structure,\nFermi-Hubbard, and Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians, we show that $k$-NoCliD reduces\nthe number of circuit shots, often by a very large margin.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
