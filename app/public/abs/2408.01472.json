The advancements in Free Electron Laser technology have now\nmade it possible to investigate ultra-fast dynamics in materials science,\nbiology, chemistry, etc. In the SDL, an incident free electron laser pulse is\nsplit into two parts by a beam splitter: one half travels along the upper\nbranch, and the other half travels along the lower branch. These two pulses can\neither merge again in the collinear mode or travel along different optical\npaths toward the sample in the inclined mode. This setup achieves a temporal\nseparation of a few femtoseconds between the X-ray pulse pairs, which is\ncrucial for ultra-fast X-ray pump-probe experiments investigating rapid\ndynamics. This report provides detailed documentation of the mechanical and\nelectronic configuration of the test-stand, vacuum testing, the manufacturing\nof supporting cables, and the challenges encountered during the project.\nFinally, the SDL was successfully assembled and initially validated under\nultra-high vacuum (UHV) operating conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
