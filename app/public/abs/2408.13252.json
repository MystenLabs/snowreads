A desired virtual 3D scene should 1) exhibit\nomnidirectional view consistency, and 2) allow for free exploration in complex\nscene hierarchies. Existing methods either rely on successive scene expansion\nvia inpainting or employ panorama representation to represent large FOV scene\nenvironments. However, the generated scene suffers from semantic drift during\nexpansion and is unable to handle occlusion among scene hierarchies. To tackle\nthese challenges, we introduce LayerPano3D, a novel framework for full-view,\nexplorable panoramic 3D scene generation from a single text prompt. Our key\ninsight is to decompose a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at\ndifferent depth levels, where each layer reveals the unseen space from the\nreference views via diffusion prior. LayerPano3D comprises multiple dedicated\ndesigns: 1) we introduce a novel text-guided anchor view synthesis pipeline for\nhigh-quality, consistent panorama generation. 2) We pioneer the Layered 3D\nPanorama as underlying representation to manage complex scene hierarchies and\nlift it into 3D Gaussians to splat detailed 360-degree omnidirectional scenes\nwith unconstrained viewing paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nframework generates state-of-the-art 3D panoramic scene in both full view\nconsistency and immersive exploratory experience. We believe that LayerPano3D\nholds promise for advancing 3D panoramic scene creation with numerous\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
