Achieving homogeneity over the tweezers\narray is an important technical requirement, and our research focuses on\nimproving it for holographic arrays generated with a Spatial Light Modulator\n(SLM). We present a series of optimization methods to calculate better\nholograms, fueled by precise measurement schemes. These innovations enable to\nachieve intensity homogeneity with a relative standard deviation of 0.3 %,\nshape variations below 0.5 %, and positioning errors within 70 nm. Such\nultra-precise holographic optical tweezers arrays allow for the most demanding\napplications in quantum science with atomic arrays.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
