Given what the\ndetection by the existing Haloscope-type detector (HTD) biased only by a high\nstationary magnetic field, is just the second axion-photon energy converted\neffect and thus the detectable signal is still significantly weak, here we\npropose a feasible approach to upgrade the existing HTD by additionally\napplying a transverse rf modulated magnetic field for generating the\nfirst-order axion-photon energy converted signal. Accordingly, we argue that\nthe detection sensitivity of the upgrading HTD (UHTD) could be enhanced\nfeasibly by a few orders of magnitude, compared with those achieved by the\nexisting HTDs. The feasibility of the proposed UHTD is also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
