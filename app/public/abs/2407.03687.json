However, the complexities in the question types (bridge v.s.\ncomparison questions) and the reasoning types (sequential v.s. parallel\nreasonings) require more novel and fine-grained prompting methods to enhance\nthe performance of MHQA under the zero-shot setting. In this paper, we propose\nSTOC-TOT, a stochastic tree-of-thought reasoning prompting method with\nconstrained decoding for MHQA and conduct a detailed comparison with other\nreasoning prompts on different question types and reasoning types.\nSpecifically, we construct a tree-like reasoning structure by prompting the\nmodel to break down the original question into smaller sub-questions to form\ndifferent reasoning paths. In addition, we prompt the model to provide a\nprobability estimation for each reasoning path at each reasoning step. At\nanswer time, we conduct constrained decoding on the model to generate more\ngrounded answers and reduce hallucination. Experiments comparing STOC-TOT with\ntwo MHQA datasets and five large language models showed that our framework\noutperforms other reasoning prompts by a significant margin.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
