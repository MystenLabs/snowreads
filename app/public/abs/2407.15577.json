The currently observed values align with\nthe predictions of the standard model. In light of these recent updates, our\ninvestigation delves into the repercussions of new physics characterized by\nuniversal couplings to electrons and muons. We specifically focus on their\nimpact on various observables within the $B\\to K_2^*(1430)(\\to K\\pi)\\mu^+\n\\mu^-$ decay. These observables include the differential branching ratio,\nforward-backward asymmetry ($A_{FB}$), longitudinal polarization asymmetry\n($F_L$), and a set of optimized observables ($P_i$). Our findings indicate that\nthe branching ratio of $B\\to K_2^*(\\to K\\pi)\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ decay can be\nsuppressed up to $25\\%$ for various new physics solutions. Furthermore, all\npermissible new physics scenarios demonstrate finite enhancement in the muon\nforward-backward asymmetry $(A_{FB})$ as well as an increase in the value of\nthe optimized angular observable $P_2$. Moreover, in the presence of new\nphysics zero crossing points for $A_{FB}$ and $P_2$ shift towards higher $q^2$.\nThe current data have a mild deviation from SM predictions in $P_5'$ observable\nin the low-$q^2$ bin. We also explored massive $Z'$ models, which can generate\nuniversal 1D new physics scenarios, characterized by $C_9^{NP}<0$,\n$C_9^{NP}=-C_{10}^{NP}$, and $C_9^{NP}=-C_9'$. Using additional constraints\ncoming from $B_s-\\overline{B_s}$ mixing and neutrino trident process, we find\nthat the conclusions of the model-independent analysis remain valid.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
