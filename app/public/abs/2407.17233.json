We obtain a characterization\nof such shifts by polynomials with operator coefficients. The procedure of\nconstruction of all $ m $-isometric weighted shifts with positive weights is\ngiven. We answer the question when the weights of $ m $-isometric shifts are\ncommuting. The completion problem for $ m $-isometric weighted shifts with\noperator weights is solved. We characterize $ m $-isometric bilateral shifts\nthe adjoints of which are also $ m $-isometric. Several relevant examples are\nprovided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
