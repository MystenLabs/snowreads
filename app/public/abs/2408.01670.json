On that\nnote, Power Law Plateau (PLP) potential has gained a lot of attention. In this\nstudy, we demonstrate that implementing this inflationary model in an\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB) gravity background makes the model compatible with\nobservations while avoiding late-stage thermal inflation which is otherwise\nunavoidable in a standard scenario. More importantly, we have taken the PLP\nmodel as a case study to check the new slow-roll approximations method proposed\nin \\cite{Pozdeeva:2024ihc}. Then we take one step further to check the\nconsequence of generalized reheating in this scenario. Thus opening a new\npromising window to study inflationary dynamics in EGB gravity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
