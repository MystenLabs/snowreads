This suggests that there might be corresponding SUSY anomalies\ncoming from linearly divergent, triangle, Feynman diagrams. This paper\ndiscusses some progress and some outstanding issues related to these questions.\nThe concept of exotic pairs is introduced, with an example from the massless\nsupersymmetric standard model.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
