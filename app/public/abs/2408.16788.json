The room temperature microstructures are influenced by the high\ntemperature austenite phase, and the austenite microstructure is commonly\naccessed by reconstruction using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data\nof the final microstructure. A challenge for reconstruction of the PAG\nmicrostructure and subsequent austenite grain size measurement is the presence\nof austenite-phase annealing twins, and we address challenge with a new\n're-sort' algorithm. Our algorithm has been validated using the retained\naustenite regions (which were recovered via advanced pattern matching of EBSD\npatterns). We demonstrate that the re-sort algorithm improves the PAG\nreconstruction significantly, especially for the grain boundary network and\ncorrelation with other methods of grain size assessment and development of TMCP\nsteels.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
