By solving EISP, the internal relative\npermittivity of the scatterer can be non-invasively determined based on the\nscattered electromagnetic fields. Despite previous efforts to address EISP,\nachieving better solutions to this problem has remained elusive, due to the\nchallenges posed by inversion and discretization. This paper tackles those\nchallenges in EISP via an implicit approach. By representing the scatterer's\nrelative permittivity as a continuous implicit representation, our method is\nable to address the low-resolution problems arising from discretization.\nFurther, optimizing this implicit representation within a forward framework\nallows us to conveniently circumvent the challenges posed by inverse\nestimation. Our approach outperforms existing methods on standard benchmark\ndatasets.
