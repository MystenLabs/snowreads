Rev. X 13, 021017\n(2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to\njustify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard\nKirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons,\none source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results\nis the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the\npresence of Josephson junctions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
