As a first step, we\nanalyze the traversal of each individual path dimension. We derive a range of\nfeasible target accelerations for each intermediate waypoint of a\none-dimensional path using a binary search algorithm. Computing a trajectory\nfrom waypoint to waypoint leads to the fastest progress on the path when\nselecting the highest feasible target acceleration. Similarly, it is possible\nto calculate a trajectory that leads to minimum progress along the path. This\ninsight allows us to control the traversal of a one-dimensional path in such a\nway that a reference path length of a multi-dimensional path is approximately\ntracked over time. In order to improve the tracking accuracy, we propose an\niterative scheme to adjust the temporal course of the selected reference path\nlength. More precisely, the temporal region causing the largest position\ndeviation is identified and updated at each iteration. In our evaluation, we\nthoroughly analyze the performance of our method using seven-dimensional\nreference paths with different path characteristics. We show that our method\nmanages to quickly traverse the reference paths and compare the required\ntraversing time and the resulting path accuracy with other state-of-the-art\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
