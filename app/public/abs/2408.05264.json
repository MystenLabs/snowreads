Using a reconstruction based on data from\n$\\textit{Planck}$ and unWISE, we rule out non-linear Gpc-scale voids, provide\nthe tightest constraint on the intrinsic dipole ($<14 \\ {\\rm km/s}$ at $68\\%$\nconfidence), rule out matter-radiation isocurvature as an explanation of\ndiscrepancies between the measured CMB and galaxy number count dipoles, and\nconstrain the amplitude of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity ($-220\\lesssim\nf_{\\rm NL}\\lesssim 136$ at $68\\%$ confidence) and compensated isocurvature\n($-147\\lesssim A_{\\rm CIP} \\lesssim 281$ at $68\\%$ confidence). This\nrepresentative set of constraints on beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM scenarios demonstrates\nthe breadth of fundamental science possible with measurements of secondary CMB\nanisotropies such as the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
