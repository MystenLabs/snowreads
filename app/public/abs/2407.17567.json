The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear\ncombination of the Maxwell term and the Lorentz invariant $\\mathbf{E\\cdot B}$\nterm with a constant coefficient $\\theta$. We obtain an effective action\ndescribing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube\ninteraction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\\theta$\nterm can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also\nperform a dimensional reduction to show a $\\theta$ dependent flux attachment to\nthe itinerant fermions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
