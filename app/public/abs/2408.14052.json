Due to the potentially large\namplitudes of primordial perturbations on small scales, the contributions of\nhigh-order cosmological perturbations are highly significant. We propose a\nvertex approach applicable to the study of induced gravitational waves for\narbitrary higher orders. Using the vertex approach and tree diagrams, we can\ndirectly derive the explicit expressions of higher-order induced gravitational\nwaves without involving the complex and lengthy calculations of higher-order\ncosmological perturbations. Correlations between different tree diagrams\ncorrespond to the loop diagrams of two-point correlation functions of induced\ngravitational waves. Our investigation reveals that one-particle reducible\ndiagrams impact tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves while leaving scalar\ninduced gravitational waves unaffected.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
