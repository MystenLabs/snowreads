However, their poor sky localisation and the typical lack\nof observable electromagnetic (EM) counterparts make it difficult to\nconfidently identify their hosts, and study the environments that nurture their\nevolution. In this work, we show that $\\textit{detailed}$ information of the\nhost environment (e.g. the mass and steepness of the host potential) can be\ndirectly inferred by measuring the kinematic parameters (acceleration and its\ntime-derivatives) of the binary's center of mass using GWs alone, without\nrequiring an EM counterpart. We consider CBCs in various realistic environments\nsuch as globular clusters, nuclear star clusters, and active galactic nuclei\ndisks to demonstrate how orbit and environment parameters can be extracted for\nCBCs detectable by ground- and space-based observatories, including the LIGO\ndetector at A+ sensitivity, Einstein Telescope of the XG network, LISA, and\nDECIGO, $\\textit{on a single-event basis}$. These constraints on host stellar\nenvironments promise to shed light on our understanding of how CBCs form,\nevolve, and merge.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
