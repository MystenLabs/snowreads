This approach not only allows us to recreate the\nself-replication mechanism introduced earlier, but also significantly\nsimplifies the process. We introduced a new set of folding blocks that\nfacilitate the formation of secondary structures such as {\\alpha}-helices and\n\\b{eta}-sheets, as well as more advanced tertiary and quaternary structures,\nincluding self-replicating machines. The introduction of rotational degrees of\nfreedom leads to a reduced variety of blocks and, most importantly, reduces the\noverall size of the machines by a factor of five. In addition, we present a\nuniversal copier-constructor, a highly efficient self-replicating mechanism\ncomposed of approximately 40 blocks, including the restictions posed on it. The\npaper also addresses evolutionary considerations, outlining several steps on\nthe evolutionary ladder towards more sophisticated self-replicating systems.\nFinally, this study offers a clear rationale for nature's preference for\none-dimensional chains in constructing three-dimensional structures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
