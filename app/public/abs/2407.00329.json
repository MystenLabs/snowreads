The problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we consider a line-separable\nunit-disk version of the problem where all disks have the same radius and their\ncenters are separated from the points of $P$ by a line $\\ell$. We present an\n$O(n^{3/2}\\log^2 n)$ time algorithm for the problem. This improves the\npreviously best work of $O(n^2\\log n)$ time. Our result leads to an algorithm\nof $O(n^{{7}/{2}}\\log^2 n)$ time for the halfplane coverage problem (i.e.,\nusing $n$ weighted halfplanes to cover $n$ points), an improvement over the\nprevious $O(n^4\\log n)$ time solution. If all halfplanes are lower ones, our\nalgorithm runs in $O(n^{{3}/{2}}\\log^2 n)$ time, while the previous best\nalgorithm takes $O(n^2\\log n)$ time. Using duality, the hitting set problems\nunder the same settings can be solved with similar time complexities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
