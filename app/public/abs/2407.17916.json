For weak\nmechanical damping, we find dynamical instabilities leading to limit cycles.\nThey are signaled by strong fluctuations in the number of emitted photons, with\na large Fano factor. The phonon-number fluctuations exhibit a strikingly\nsimilar behavior. When the coupling strength becomes comparable to the\nmechanical frequency, non-classical mechanical states appear. We discuss the\nrelation with cavity optomechanical systems. Candidates for observing these\neffects include superconducting qubits, NV centers, and single molecules\ncoupled to oscillators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
