This extends the\nclassical computation for split groups done by Kac to the non-split quasi-split\ncase. For the proof we introduce and study equivariant conormed Chow rings,\nwhich are well adapted to the study of quasi-split groups and their homogeneous\nvarieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d__EqDc2Pf8L8F_A7lk0TwJVpGBJ5g7Y6JCAgZWuNvY","pdfSize":"754985"}
