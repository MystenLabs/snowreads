The proposed belief-space stochastic MPPI (BSS-MPPI) applies\nMonte-Carlo sampling to evaluate state distributions resulting from underlying\nsystematic disturbances, and utilizes a Control Barrier Function (CBF) inspired\nheuristic in belief space to fulfill the specified chance constraints. Compared\nto several previous stochastic predictive control methods, our approach applies\nto general nonlinear dynamics without requiring the computationally expensive\nsystem linearization step. Moreover, the BSS-MPPI controller can solve\noptimization problems without limiting the form of the objective function and\nchance constraints. By multi-threading the sampling process using a GPU, we can\nachieve fast real-time planning for time- and safety-critical tasks such as\nautonomous racing. Our results on a realistic race-car simulation study show\nsignificant reductions in constraint violation compared to some of the prior\nMPPI approaches, while being comparable in computation times.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
