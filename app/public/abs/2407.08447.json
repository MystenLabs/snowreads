However, both methods\nprimarily excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data -\ncharacterized by occlusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination -\nremains challenging. NeRFs can adapt to such conditions easily through\nper-image embedding vectors, but 3DGS struggles due to its explicit\nrepresentation and lack of shared parameters. To address this, we introduce\nWildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes\nwith 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and integrating an appearance\nmodeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. We\ndemonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS\nwhile surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data, all\nwithin a simple architectural framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
