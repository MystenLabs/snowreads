A key\nchallenge in this problem is resolving parameter redundancies and conflicts\nacross multiple models. Existing models have demonstrated that dropping a\nportion of delta parameters can alleviate conflicts while maintaining\nperformance. However, these methods often drop parameters either randomly or\nbased on magnitude, overlooking task-specific information embedded in\nfine-tuned models. In this paper, we propose an Activated Parameter Locating\n(APL) method that utilizes causal intervention to estimate parameter\nimportance, enabling more precise parameter drops and better conflict\nmitigation. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity associated with a\nlarge number of parameter partitions, we also introduce a theoretically\nsupported gradient approximation strategy for APL. Experiments on model merging\nwithin both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, along with associated\nanalyses, showcase the effectiveness of APL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
