We discuss\nthe strength of these singularities in terms of deformationally strong\nsingularities. Specifically, we analyze tidal forces in LTB spacetime,\ncalculating radial and angular tidal forces and Jacobi fields for the radially\nco-moving shell. To provide a comparative study, we consider both homogeneous\nand inhomogeneous cases. The matter field distribution at one-time slice can\ndiffer significantly from another, highlighting the potential for\ntime-dependent tidal deformation as a distinct observational signature. We\nfocus on a specific feature: the time-varying maximum of stretching in the\nradial tidal force, which we term the \"critical tidal boundary.\" In the\ninhomogeneous case, close to singularity time ($t<t_{s}$), the magnitudes of\ntidal forces vary substantially, with significant differences in compressive\nand stretching forces within a small physical radius $R(t,r)$. The resulting\nsingularity in the LTB metrics at the end state of gravitational collapse\nappears to be an Ori-strong singularity, characterized by infinite tidal\ndeformation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_7w1Xf4mB3_TDPIF_DKhM9drTW9O6GK-3awpTPznRIQ","pdfSize":"2787743"}
