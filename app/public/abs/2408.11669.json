A reflected graph map is a\nparticular case of a reflection map, which is defined using an embedding of\n$\\mathbb{C}^n$ in $\\mathbb{C}^{p}$ and then applying the action of a reflection\ngroup $G$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{p}$. In this work, we present a description of the\npresentation matrix of $f_*{\\cal O}_n$ as an ${\\cal O}_{n+1}$-module via $f$ in\nterms of the action of the associated reflection group $G$. We also give a\ndescription for a defining equation of the image of $f$ in terms of the action\nof $G$. Finally, we present an upper (and also a lower) bound for the\nmultiplicity of the image of $f$ and some applications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
