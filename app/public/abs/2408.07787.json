Operators of onion services devised several\nstrategies to protect their users against phishing. But as we show in this\nwork, none protect users against phishing without producing traces about\nvisited services - something that particularly vulnerable users might want to\navoid. In search of a solution we review prior research addressing this\nproblem, and find that only two known approaches, hash visualization and PAKE,\nare capable of solving this problem.\n  Hash visualization requires users to recognize large hash values. In order to\nmake hash visualization more practical we design a novel mechanism called\nrecognizer, which substantially reduces the amount of information that users\nmust recognize. We analyze the security and privacy properties of our system\nformally, and report on our prototype implementation as a browser extension for\nthe Tor web browser.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"m0Wy7_GYsd9LbAu3-L2fUEKIkdYpYvHNp2oHaWEcts8","pdfSize":"1372185"}
