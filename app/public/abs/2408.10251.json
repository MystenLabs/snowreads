In the aftermath of these devastating events, there is interest\nin identifying worst-case thresholds or upper bounds that quantify just how hot\ntemperatures can become. Generalized Extreme Value theory provides a\ndata-driven estimate of extreme thresholds; however, upper bounds may be\nexceeded by future events, which undermines attribution and planning for\nheatwave impacts. Here, we show how the occurrence and relative probability of\nobserved events that exceed a priori upper bound estimates, so-called\n\"impossible\" temperatures, has changed over time. We find that many\nunprecedented events are actually within data-driven upper bounds, but only\nwhen using modern spatial statistical methods. Furthermore, there are clear\nconnections between anthropogenic forcing and the \"impossibility\" of the most\nextreme temperatures. Robust understanding of heatwave thresholds provides\ncritical information about future record-breaking events and how their\nextremity relates to historical measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
