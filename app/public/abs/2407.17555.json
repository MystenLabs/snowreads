We implement a tailored component-separation\npipeline to map the thermal SZ Compton $y$-parameter over 98% of the sky.\nDespite lower angular resolution for galaxy cluster science, LiteBIRD provides\nfull-sky coverage and, compared to the Planck satellite, enhanced sensitivity,\nas well as more frequency bands to enable the construction of an all-sky\n$y$-map, with reduced foreground contamination at large and intermediate\nangular scales. By combining LiteBIRD and Planck channels in the\ncomponent-separation pipeline, we obtain an optimal $y$-map that leverages the\nadvantages of both experiments, with the higher angular resolution of the\nPlanck channels enabling the recovery of compact clusters beyond the LiteBIRD\nbeam limitations, and the numerous sensitive LiteBIRD channels further\nmitigating foregrounds. The added value of LiteBIRD is highlighted through the\nexamination of maps, power spectra, and one-point statistics of the various sky\ncomponents. After component separation, the $1/f$ noise from LiteBIRD is\neffectively mitigated below the thermal SZ signal at all multipoles.\nCosmological constraints on $S_8=\\sigma_8\\left(\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3\\right)^{0.5}$\nobtained from the LiteBIRD-Planck combined $y$-map power spectrum exhibits a\n15% reduction in uncertainty compared to constraints from Planck alone. This\nimprovement can be attributed to the increased portion of uncontaminated sky\navailable in the LiteBIRD-Planck combined $y$-map.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
