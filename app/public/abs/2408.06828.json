Existing approaches for this problem suffer from the effects of\nself-shadows, inter-reflections, and lack of constraints on the surface\nreflectance, leading to inaccurate decomposition of reflectance and\nillumination due to the ill-posed nature of inverse rendering. In this work, we\npropose a new method for neural inverse rendering. Our method jointly optimizes\nthe light source position to account for the self-shadows in images, and\ncomputes indirect illumination using a differentiable rendering layer and an\nimportance sampling strategy. To enhance surface reflectance decomposition, we\nintroduce a new regularization by distilling DINO features to foster accurate\nand consistent material decomposition. Extensive experiments on synthetic and\nreal datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods in reflectance decomposition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
