These detectors observe Cherenkov light emitted\nby charged particles travelling inside a pressurized gas vessel. A key\ncomponent of the XCET detector is the 45-degree flat mirror reflecting the\nCherenkov light towards the photomultiplier (PMT). A thorough analysis and\noptimization was conducted on the design and materials of this mirror, along\nwith the surface coatings and coating techniques. A suitable manufacturing\nprocess was selected, and the first mirror prototype was produced, installed,\nand tested in the East Area at CERN. Experimental data obtained during beam\ntests is presented to assess the efficiency of the new coating and materials\nused.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cYFEeFf8D1N8k35zPiWZxAvV4aoAouT0K3Y0eax8dwY","pdfSize":"4928371"}
