However, acquiring multiple\nimages, even of low quality, is possible with surveillance cameras. In this\nwork, we develop an algorithm based on diffusion models that utilize a\nlow-resolution image combined with features extracted from multiple low-quality\nimages to generate a super-resolved image while minimizing distortions in the\nindividual's identity. Unlike other algorithms, our approach recovers facial\nfeatures without explicitly providing attribute information or without the need\nto calculate a gradient of a function during the reconstruction process. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first time multi-features combined with\nlow-resolution images are used as conditioners to generate more reliable\nsuper-resolution images using stochastic differential equations. The FFHQ\ndataset was employed for training, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in\nfacial recognition and verification metrics when evaluated on the CelebA and\nQuis-Campi datasets.
