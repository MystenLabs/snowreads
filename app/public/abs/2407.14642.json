The goal is to refine\nthe process for determining a reasonable royalty using statistical methods in\ncases where there is risk and uncertainty regarding each party's disagreement\npayoffs (opportunity costs) in the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS). This paper\nuses a Bayes Cost approach to analyze Case 1, Case 2, and the Original Nash\nmodel from the authors' previous work. By addressing risk and uncertainty in\nthe NBS, the NBS emerges as a more reliable method for estimating a reasonable\nroyalty, aligning with the criteria outlined in Georgia Pacific factor fifteen.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
