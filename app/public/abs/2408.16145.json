This study\nproposes a driver drowsiness detection system, DrowzEE-G-Mamba, that combines\nElectroencephalography (EEG) with State Space Models (SSMs). EEG data, known\nfor its sensitivity to alertness, is used to model driver state transitions\nbetween alert and drowsy. Compared to traditional methods, DrowzEE-G-Mamba\nachieves significantly improved detection rates and reduced false positives.\nNotably, it achieves a peak accuracy of 83.24% on the SEED-VIG dataset,\nsurpassing existing techniques. The system maintains high accuracy across\nvarying complexities, making it suitable for real-time applications with\nlimited resources. This robustness is attributed to the combination of\nchannel-split, channel-concatenation, and channel-shuffle operations within the\narchitecture, optimizing information flow from EEG data. Additionally, the\nintegration of convolutional layers and SSMs facilitates comprehensive\nanalysis, capturing both local features and long-range dependencies in the EEG\nsignals. These findings suggest the potential of DrowzEE-G-Mamba for enhancing\nroad safety through accurate drowsiness detection. It also paves the way for\ndeveloping powerful SSM-based AI algorithms in Brain-Computer Interface\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BQmKE0bcqqKu-n2sg3BYlj3AWn5K087n0Tpw1RWWRB4","pdfSize":"668041"}
