These equations are formulated in\nan infinite horizon framework and provide a probabilistic representation for\nelliptic Partial Differential Equations of ergodic type. In order to build our\nnumerical scheme, we put forward a new representation of the PDE solution by\nusing a classical probabilistic representation of the gradient. Then, based on\nthis representation, we propose a fully implementable numerical scheme using a\nPicard iteration procedure, a grid space discretization and a Monte-Carlo\napproximation. Up to a limiting technical condition that guarantees the\ncontraction of the Picard procedure, we obtain an upper bound for the numerical\nerror. We also provide some numerical experiments that show the efficiency of\nthis approach for small dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
