These two factors\nimpact the quality of the SAR images significantly and prevent any attempt to\nextract valuable information from the processed data. The necessity for\nmitigating these effects in the field of SAR imaging is of high importance.\nTherefore, in this paper, we address the aforementioned issues and propose a\ntechnique to handle these shortcomings simultaneously. In fact, we combine the\nde-noising and contrast enhancement processes into a unified algorithm. The\nimage enhancement is performed based on the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram\nEqualization (CLAHE) technique. The verification of the proposed algorithm is\nperformed by experimental results based on the data that has been collected\nfrom the European Space Agency's ERS-2 satellite which operates in strip-map\nmode.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ppu9Q0v1gZF1xqbhgy3d7LYvPyQqpnWTCySdb94I-7Y","pdfSize":"1833951"}
