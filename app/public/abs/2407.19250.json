In\nthis talk, we present some insights from solving and analyzing the Friedmann\nequations and their implications to evolutionary cosmology. In particular, in\nthe Chaplygin fluid universe, we derive a universal formula for the asymptotic\nexponential growth rate of the scale factor which indicates that, as far as\nthere is a tiny presence of nonlinear (exotic) matter, linear (conventional)\nmatter makes contribution to the dark energy, which becomes significant near\nthe phantom divide line.

Gibbons, and\nYijun Li.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
