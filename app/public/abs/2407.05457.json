It turns out that the spectrum of composite collective\nmodes, $\\omega(k)$, has a qualitatively different form in the case of\n$H_{dem}<H_{an}$ and of $H_{dem}>H_{an}$. In the first case, the dependence\n$\\omega(k)$ has the same form as in previous studies, whereas in the second\ncase, the spectrum looks completely different. In particular, for moderate or\nweak anisotropy in ferromagnet the group velocity of collective modes\ndemonstrates inflection point where the group velocity become infinite and is\nsuperluminal. Furthermore, this point separates purely real and\ncomplex-conjugate solutions for the collective modes and is also {\\it exception\npoint}. We show that the difference of the CMs spectra can be revealed by Fiske\nexperiment, i.\\,e.\\,by measuring the $I-V$ characteristics in the presence of\nmagnetic field and voltage.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
