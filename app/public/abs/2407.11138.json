Yet, the process\nof identifying these properties can be difficult. Here, we create a\nhuman-in-the-loop machine learning (HITLML) model called VADecide and apply it\nto a parcel-level case study in Savannah, Georgia. The results show a higher\nprediction accuracy than was achieved when using a machine learning model\nwithout human input in the training. The HITLML approach also reveals\ndifferences between machine vs. human-generated results. Our findings\ncontribute to knowledge about the advantages and challenges of HITLML in urban\nplanning.\n  [Accepted for Publication at a Peer Review Journal]\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TEW6_yHv3A4DxzvIKzUYs0PHodxvOavDQbieVMbJxxc","pdfSize":"723455","objectId":"0x0d296ca157ed91aff5f4c3ccf32ef9b2639ce9479162bddb3584e238a39c721b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
