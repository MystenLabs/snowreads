However, the existence of\ndifferent types of SDQPTs and the associated conditions are yet to be elusive.\nIn this paper, we comprehensively classify SDQPTs by considering the\none-dimensional transverse field quantum XY model initialized in the ground\nstate. We find that there are only six types of SDQPTs, and three of which are\ncompletely new that had not yet been identified previously. The associated\nconditions for different SDQPTs are discussed in detail, and based on this, the\ndynamical phase diagrams are given. Our analytical method used to classify\nSDQPTs in one-dimensional transverse field quantum XY model can be applied to\nany other two-band models in one- and two-spatial dimensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
