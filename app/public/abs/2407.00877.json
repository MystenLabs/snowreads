World players are scrambling to win the race towards global QKD\nnetworks, even before the rules and policies required by such large endeavors\nwere even discussed. Several vendors are on the market, each with specific\nparameters and advantages (in terms of key rate, link range, KMS software,\netc.), hence considerable effort is now made towards standardization. While\nquantum communications is expected to reach a market size of up to \\$36B by\n2040, the largest QKD initiative to date is EuroQCI, which, due to its sheer\nscale, is forcing the market to mature. Although building a QKD network is\nbelieved to be trivial today, inter-connecting federated networks on a global\nscale is a heavy challenge. We propose QKD virtual networks not only as a\nuseful infrastructure abstraction for increased flexibility and granular\nsecurity, but as an inevitable solution for several problems that future QKD\nnetworks will encounter on the way towards widespread adoption.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
