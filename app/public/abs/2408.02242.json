One of the key reasons to adopt ML\nalgorithms over physics-based models is its computational efficiency advantage\nand flexibility to work with various data sets. The diverse applications,\nparticularly in emergency response and expanding over a large scale, demand the\nhydrological model in a short time and make researchers adopt data-driven\nmodeling approaches unhesitatingly. In this work, in the era of ML and deep\nlearning (DL), how it can help to improve the overall run time of physics-based\nmodel and potential constraints that should be addressed while modeling. This\npaper covers the opportunities and challenges of adopting ML for hydrological\nmodeling and subsequently how it can help to improve the simulation time of\nphysics-based models and future works that should be addressed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ecUmGRW_wO0hfUMt4YX16tBwvIYpP3leqkO_kGEGg4U","pdfSize":"133299"}
