In the testable learning framework, the goal is to\ndevelop a tester-learner such that if the data passes the tester, then one can\ntrust the output of the robust learner on the data.Our main result is the first\npolynomial time tester-learner for general halfspaces that achieves\ndimension-independent misclassification error. At the heart of our approach is\na new methodology to reduce testable learning of general halfspaces to testable\nlearning of nearly homogeneous halfspaces that may be of broader interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
