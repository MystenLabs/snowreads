Small-scale molecular processes\nhave a profound impact on large-scale astronomical evolution. The areas of\nsolid-state laboratory astrophysics and computational chemistry study these\nprocesses. We review the laboratory effort on ice spectroscopy; methodological\nadvances and challenges; and laboratory and computational studies of ice\nphysics and ice chemistry. The latter we put in context with the ice evolution\nfrom clouds to disks. Three takeaway messages from this review are\n  - Laboratory and computational studies allow interpretation of astronomical\nice spectra in terms of identification, ice morphology and, local environmental\nconditions as well as the formation of the involved chemical compounds.\n  - A detailed understanding of the underlying processes is needed to build\nreliable astrochemical models to make predictions on the abundances in space.\n  - The relative importance of the different ice processes studied in the\nlaboratory and computationally changes along the process of star and planet\nformation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
