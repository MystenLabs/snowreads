Although various methods have been proposed to reconstruct speaker\ninformation in generated speech, there is still room for improvement in\nachieving high similarity between generated and ground truth recordings.\nFurthermore, zero-shot voice conversion for speech in specific domains, such as\nwhispered, remains an unexplored area. To address this problem, we propose a\nSpeakerVC model that can effectively perform zero-shot speech conversion in\nboth voiced and whispered domains, while being lightweight and capable of\nrunning in streaming mode without significant quality degradation. In addition,\nwe explore methods to improve the quality of speaker identity transfer and\ndemonstrate their effectiveness for a variety of voice conversion systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Kvt6hIGfFzgw-3QS6K7biPBQ58uM2ZED7vXF1S4eoBE","pdfSize":"303632"}
