Heat is the sum of kinetic energy, system work, and system\npotential of gas, while force is the linear gradients of heat variation.\nExporters and importers of force are evident in terms of exotherm and\nendotherm. Temperature and volume gradients create asymmetric forces driving\nrotation and spin (self-rotation). It verifies that force transfer does not\nneed a medium. As an outstanding achievement, a succinct and general equation\nis derived to predict the equilibrium distance of molecular interaction without\nusing any assumption, such as van der Waals force and dispersion force. In\naddition, the origins and attributes of repulsion and attraction are disclosed.\nPredicting results is applausive. For example, at 298 K, Le for N2, O2, and CH4\nare 3.11, 3.11, and 3.68 A, comparable to the data adopted in MD simulations of\nthe literature. Furthermore, the relationship between electricity and mass is\nestablished. An electron is characterized as a particle with a large {\\alpha}\ndependent on the interaction distance. Two electrons are mutually attractive\nfrom a distance depending on temperature. The electromagnetic phenomena are\nintegrated.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
