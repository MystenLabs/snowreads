The\nS-index is widely used to investigate the magnetic activity of stars, however,\nits connection to the coverage of stellar magnetic structure is still poorly\nunderstood. We use the archives of full disk Ca II K images taken by the Royal\nObservatory of Belgium with the USET to derive the area fraction of the\nbrightest chromospheric structures over the last decade. These data allowed us\nto study the end of the solar cycle 24 and the beginning of solar cycle 25. The\nbrightest regions of the solar surface were then segmented using an algorithm\nbased on an intensity threshold. We computed the area fraction over the solar\ndisk and compared it with the S-index from TIGRE. For the detection of periodic\nmodulations, we applied a discrete Fourier power spectrum method to both\ndatasets. A tight linear relationship was found between the USET area fraction\nand the TIGRE S-index, with an improved correlation obtained in the\nlow-activity regime by considering the enhanced network. In both time series,\nwe detected the modulation caused by the rotation of bright structures on the\nsolar disk. However, this detection is constrained in the case of TIGRE due to\nits observation strategy. We studied the correlation between the disk coverage\nwith chromospheric structures and the variability of the S-index on an\noverlapping period of ten years. We concluded that the disk coverage index is a\ngood proxy for the S-index and will be useful in future studies of the magnetic\nactivity of solar-type stars. The USET area fraction dataset is most\nappropriate for evaluating the solar rotation period and will be used in future\nworks to analyze the impact of the inclination of the stellar rotation axis on\nthe detectability of such periodic modulations in solar-type stars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
