This provides a solid\nframework for the classical Hamiltonian formulation of such theories and the\nstudy of the dynamics of physical systems in the corresponding deformed phase\nspace. By further characterizing the functions that govern non-commutativity in\nthe configuration space using the algebra of angular momentum, we determine a\ngeneral form for the rotation generator in these theories and crucially, we\nshow that, under these conditions, unlike what has been previously found in the\nliterature at the quantum level, this requirement does not lead to the\nsuperselection of GUP models at the classical level. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat a properly defined GUP theory can be correctly interpreted classically if\nand only if the corresponding quantum commutators satisfy the Jacobi\nidentities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b6pGxRGqqtrMly0kTkwIPd8iBodmj99MjG_6pBIh-Ag","pdfSize":"269926"}
