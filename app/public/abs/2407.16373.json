Using a\nmodel binary PBH formation, the expected detection rate of such binary\nintermediate-mass PBHs by the TianQin space laser interferometer is calculated\nto be from a few to hundreds events per year for the assumed parameters of the\nPBH log-normal mass spectrum and abundance consistent with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\nresults. Distinctive features of such primordial IMBH mergings are vanishingly\nsmall effective spins, possible high redshifts $z>20$ and lack of association\nwith gas-rich regions or galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
