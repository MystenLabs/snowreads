Realized Volatility (RV) is an estimator of the volatility\ncalculated using high-frequency observed prices. RV has lately attracted\nconsiderable attention of econometrics and mathematical finance. However, it is\nknown that high-frequency data includes observation errors called market\nmicrostructure noise (MN). Nagakura and Watanabe[2015] proposed a state space\nmodel that resolves RV into true volatility and influence of MN. In this paper,\nwe assume a dependent MN that autocorrelates and correlates with return as\nreported by Hansen and Lunde[2006] and extends the results of Nagakura and\nWatanabe[2015] and compare models by simulation and actual data.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
