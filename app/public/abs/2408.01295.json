However, conventional far-field devices\nstruggle to generate reasonable powers at lower temperatures. Near-field\nthermophotovoltaics provide a pathway to substantially higher powers by\nleveraging photon tunneling effects. Here we present a large area near-field\nthermophotovoltaic device, created with an epitaxial co-fabrication approach,\nthat consists of a self-supported 0.28 cm2 emitter-cell pair with a 150 nm gap.\nThe device generates 1.22 mW at 460 C, a twenty-five-fold increase over the\nsame cell measured in a far-field configuration. Furthermore, the near-field\ndevice demonstrates short circuit current densities greater than the far-field\nphotocurrent limit at all the temperatures tested, confirming the role of\nphoton tunneling effects in the performance enhancement. Modeling suggests\nseveral practical directions for cell improvements and further increases in\npower density. These results highlight the promise of near-field\nthermophotovoltaics, especially for low temperature applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
