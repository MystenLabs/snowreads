The first realization of QET on\nsuperconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average\nenergy retrieval efficiency of 35.4% (observing only V ) by the receiver, Bob.\nIn this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the\nenergy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state\nhamiltonian H to achieve this, that conforms the constraints of Zero mean\nenergy and anti-commutative properties of the operations on the observable of\nthe senders and receiver. Our experimental results show a significant\nimprovement in energy retrieval, achieving an average efficiency of 65.5%\n(observing only V ), which is significantly higher than that of the 2-qubit\nsystem regarding practical usage. This advancement not only marks a step\nforward in practical quantum energy applications but also provides a new\nframework for future research in quantum energy teleportation and related\nquantum technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OGx8PLuLnPqMkQYCiHMgVS9Viaz_33Z9M6a8llUoaA4","pdfSize":"651035"}
