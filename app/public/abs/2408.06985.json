We compare to\nhistoric and recent experimental data, and find that the parametric optical\nmodel uncertainty in neutron-fragment correlated observables is significant in\nobservables involving neutron energies and multiplicities. Different\nphenomenological and microscopic potentials disagree, both with experiment and\nwith eachcother, which we attribute to the extrapolation of the\nphenomenological models away from stability, and to the limitations of the\nnuclear matter folding approach for the microscopic model. We comment on the\nrole of the optical model in future efforts to globally optimize fission\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
