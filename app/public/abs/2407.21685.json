We find a nonmonotonic dependence of the flow rate on the grain\naspect ratio a/b. Starting from spheres the flow rate grows and has two maxima\naround the aspect ratios of a/b = 0.6 (lentil-like ellipsoids) and a/b = 1.5\n(rice-like ellipsoids) reaching a flow rate increase of about 15% for lentils\ncompared to spheres. For even more anisometric shapes (a/b = 0.25 and a/b = 4)\nthe flow rate drops. Our results reveal two contributing factors to the\nnonmonotonic nature of the flow rate: both the packing fraction and the\nparticle velocity through the orifice are nonmonotonic functions of the grain\nshape. Thus, particles with slightly non-spherical shapes not only form a\nbetter packing in the silo but also move faster through the orifice than\nspheres. We also show that the resistance of the granulate against shearing\nincreases with aspect ratio for both elongated and flat particles, thus change\nin the effective friction of the granulate due to changing particle shape does\nnot coincide with the trend in the flow rate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
