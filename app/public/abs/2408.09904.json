A vital issue that must be addressed is the generation of energy from\nnon-renewable and often polluted sources. For this reason, the development of\nrenewable energy sources is of great importance. Unfortunately, too rapid\nspread of renewables can disrupt stability of the power system and lead to\nenergy blackouts. One should not simply support it, without ensuring\nsustainability and understanding of the diffusion process. In this research, we\npropose a new agent-based model of diffusion of photovoltaic panels. It is an\nextension of the $q$-voter model that utilizes multi-layer network structure.\nThe model is analyzed by Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field approximation.\nThe impact of parameters and specifications on the basic properties of the\nmodel is discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
