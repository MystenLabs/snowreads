Here, laser spectroscopy\ncan be performed on stored and cooled ion bunches and coasting beams. First\nspectra of $^{24,25}$Mg$^+$ ions are presented that were recorded by classical\nDoppler-limited fluorescence spectroscopy as well as $\\Lambda$-spectroscopy\nusing counter- and copropagating laser beams that are Doppler-shifted by\nseveral nm.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
