Therefore,\nhigh-dimensional data are often projected into two dimensions for\nvisualization. Many applications benefit from complex nonlinear dimensionality\nreduction techniques, but the effects of individual high-dimensional features\nare hard to explain in the two-dimensional space. Most visualization solutions\nuse multiple two-dimensional plots, each showing the effect of one\nhigh-dimensional feature in two dimensions; this approach creates a need for a\nvisual inspection of k plots for a k-dimensional input space. Our solution,\nFeature Clock, provides a novel approach that eliminates the need to inspect\nthese k plots to grasp the influence of original features on the data structure\ndepicted in two dimensions. Feature Clock enhances the explainability and\ncompactness of visualizations of embedded data and is available in an\nopen-source Python library.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MsPaoPznAykFrUkhjQhBcidUxAdCePtKMa9lcF1jgto","pdfSize":"4531802","txDigest":"2qphoyVt9uggeMkTKjfcPAzGrgYFTSHP7uxZDB3SujQ8","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
