To be\nspecific, Markov decision process and reinforcement learning are applied to\nestablish an agile adaptation mechanism for multi-mode communication devices\naccording to the driving scenarios and business requirements. Then, Q-learning\nis used to train the agile adaptation reinforcement learning model and output\nthe trained model. By learning the best actions to take in different states to\nmaximize the cumulative reward, and avoiding the problem of poor adaptation\neffect caused by inaccurate delay measurement in unstable communication\nscenarios. The experiments show that the proposed scheme can quickly adapt to\ndynamic vehicle networking environment, while achieving high concurrency and\ncommunication efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
