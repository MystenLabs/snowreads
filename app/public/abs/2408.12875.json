However, they often suffer from fairness issues due to inherent\nbiases in node attributes and graph structure, leading to unfair predictions.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel GNN framework, DAB-GNN, that\nDisentangles, Amplifies, and deBiases attribute, structure, and potential\nbiases in the GNN mechanism. DAB-GNN employs a disentanglement and\namplification module that isolates and amplifies each type of bias through\nspecialized disentanglers, followed by a debiasing module that minimizes the\ndistance between subgroup distributions to ensure fairness. Extensive\nexperiments on five datasets demonstrate that DAB-GNN significantly outperforms\nten state-of-the-art competitors in terms of achieving an optimal balance\nbetween accuracy and fairness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
