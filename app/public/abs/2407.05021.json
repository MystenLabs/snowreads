Different from previous researches that typically employ a global\nscheme for multiview registration, we propose to adopt an incremental pipeline\nto progressively align scans into a canonical coordinate system. Specifically,\ndrawing inspiration from image-based 3D reconstruction, our approach first\nbuilds a sparse scan graph with scan retrieval and geometric verification.\nThen, we perform incremental registration via initialization, next scan\nselection and registration, Track create and continue, and Bundle Adjustment.\nAdditionally, for detector-free matchers, we incorporate a Track refinement\nprocess. This process primarily constructs a coarse multiview registration and\nrefines the model by adjusting the positions of the keypoints on the Track.\nExperiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing\nmultiview registration methods on three benchmark datasets.
