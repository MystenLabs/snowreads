We find subtle differences with respect to the well-known single-site\nmean-field theory, especially in terms of gap, entanglement and quantum\ncriticality. The calculations are based on numerical diagonalization of\nHamiltonians with up to a few thousand spins. This is made possible by the\nenhanced symmetries of the model, which divide the Hamiltonian into many\nblock-diagonal sectors. The finite temperature phase diagram and the\ncharacteristic jump in heat capacity closely resemble the behavior in\nmean-field theory. However, unlike mean-field theory where excitations are\nalways gapped, the excitation gap in the infinite range model goes to zero from\nboth the paramagnetic side and from the ferromagnetic side on approach to the\nquantum critical point. Also, contrary to mean-field theory, at the quantum\ncritical point the Quantum Fisher Information becomes large, implying\nlong-range multi-partite entanglement. We find that the main role of\ntemperature is to shift statistical weights from one conserved sector to\nanother. However, low energy excitations in each sector arise only near the\nquantum critical point implying that low energy quantum fluctuations can arise\nonly in the vicinity of the quantum critical field where they can persist up to\ntemperatures of order the exchange constant.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jlbjsFjf6gmw2_kf-Ki5hc9B8rGHuNtdC_vgmjsIXKI","pdfSize":"428198"}
