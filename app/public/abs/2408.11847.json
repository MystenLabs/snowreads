However, efficiently interacting with these models\npresents a significant hurdle since LLMs often reside on proprietary or\nself-hosted API endpoints, each requiring custom code for interaction.\nConducting comparative studies between different models can therefore be\ntime-consuming and necessitate significant engineering effort, hindering\nresearch efficiency and reproducibility. To address these challenges, we\npresent prompto, an open source Python library which facilitates asynchronous\nquerying of LLM endpoints enabling researchers to interact with multiple LLMs\nconcurrently, while maximising efficiency and utilising individual rate limits.\nOur library empowers researchers and developers to interact with LLMs more\neffectively and enabling faster experimentation and evaluation. prompto is\nreleased with an introductory video (https://youtu.be/-eZAmlV4ypk) under MIT\nLicense and is available via GitHub\n(https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/prompto).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
