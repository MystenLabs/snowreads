In this problem, $m$ servers and $m$ requests arrive over time, and an\nonline algorithm can delay the matching between servers and requests by paying\nthe delay cost. The objective is to minimize the total distance and delay cost.\nWhen servers and requests lie in a known metric space, there is a randomized\n$O(\\log n)$-competitive algorithm, where $n$ is the size of the metric space.\nWhen the metric space is unknown a priori, Azar and Jacob-Fanani proposed a\ndeterministic\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}m^{\\log\\left(\\frac{3+\\epsilon}{2}\\right)}\\right)$-competitive\nalgorithm for any fixed $\\epsilon > 0$. This competitive ratio is tight when $n\n= 1$ and becomes $O(m^{0.59})$ for sufficiently small $\\epsilon$.\n  In this paper, we improve upon the result of Azar and Jacob-Fanani for the\ncase where servers and requests are on the real line, providing a deterministic\n$\\tilde{O}(m^{0.5})$-competitive algorithm. Our algorithm is based on the\nRobust Matching (RM) algorithm proposed by Raghvendra for the minimum cost\nbipartite perfect matching problem. In this problem, delay is not allowed, and\nall servers arrive in the beginning. When a request arrives, the RM algorithm\nimmediately matches the request to a free server based on the request's minimum\n$t$-net-cost augmenting path, where $t > 1$ is a constant. In our algorithm, we\ndelay the matching of a request until its waiting time exceeds its minimum\n$t$-net-cost divided by $t$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
