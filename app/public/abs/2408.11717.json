This paper analyzes the\ninterference caused by satellite networks on TN in the S-band. We examined the\ntransmission mechanisms of satellite signals and conducted simulations to\nevaluate interference intensity across varying slant ranges. Our findings\nindicate that the angle between the user equipment direction and the\nsub-satellite point direction from the beam center significantly impacts the\ninterference level.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eNbIZ7rM2SKVpcOYEIFe-Vu0bXEr_5sQfUv0S91E_vQ","pdfSize":"1082304"}
