Recently, Sharma et al. [K.K. Sharma,\nV.P Gerdt, Quantum Inf. Process 20, 195 (2021)] have shown the mathematical\nconnection between quantum information scrambling (QIS) and bipartite\nentanglement in non-thermal states. In the present work, we elegantly\ngeneralize this mathematical connection and study such connections in X-states,\nnon-maximally entangled Bell states, and Werner states\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
