In previous work, we used the theory of buildings and\nIwahori-Hecke algebras to obtain upper bounds on their size. As the next step\ntowards the classification of the maximal EKR-sets, we describe the eigenspaces\nfor the smallest eigenvalue of the opposition graphs. We determine their\nmultiplicity and provide a combinatorial description of spanning sets of these\nsubspaces, from which a complete description of the maximal Erd\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado\nsets of flags may potentially be found. This was recently shown to be possible\nfor type $A_n$, $n$ odd, by Heering, Lansdown, and the last author by making\nuse of the current work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gcqYN-RrflTiDwCXG1J9VOzAAZXEMDXMkLALvSFFXcY","pdfSize":"325960"}
