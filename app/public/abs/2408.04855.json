The regime of coupling constants\nwhere the theory is stable is identified and criteria for the occurrence of\nfixed points in that regime are found. For a certain range of Chern-Simons\nlevel, we find stable charge-gapped phase with spontaneously broken approximate\nscale invariance and a parametrically light dilaton. The Chern-Simons level can\nbe tuned to the stability edge resulting in exact scale invariance which is\nspontaneously broken, accompanied by a massless dilaton. For another, narrow\nrange of Chern-Simons levels we find a conformal window where the theory flows\nto a Wilson-Fisher-like fixed point and is a novel (and rare) example of a\nnon-supersymmetric non-trivial parity and time reversal violating three\ndimensional conformal field theory with scalar, spinor and vector fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
