Several cadmium (Cd) compounds containing elements\nfrom the alkali-metal and carbon groups including A$_2$CdX (A = Li, Na, and K;\nX = Pb, Sn, and Ge) are predicted by our ML models to exhibit very low\n$\\kappa_L$ values ($< 1.0 $ W/mK), rendering these materials suitable for\npotential thermal management and insulation applications. Further DFT\ncalculations of electronic and transport properties indicate that the figure of\nmerit, $ZT$, for thermoelectric performance can exceed 1.0 in compounds such as\nK$_2$CdPb, K$_2$CdSn, and K$_2$CdGe, which are thereby also promising\nthermoelectric materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hMoGC-NxKVNZ8yf8fzF_pDWgbSZZkuE21fTOZ0k_dC4","pdfSize":"7412283"}
