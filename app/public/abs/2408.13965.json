The same remains true for Lyapunov closed one\nform but in this presentation this fact is discussed only informally. These\nobservations are based on the smooth \" manifold with corner structures\" of the\nstable/unstable sets and of the set of trajectories of such vector fields.\n  (This paper is a written version of two talks with the same title given at\nIMAR Bucharest in November 2023)\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9mKgA5FUNios7g7an9y6Yc-wOVH4r1HWk1m9vVZ6Xto","pdfSize":"1835934"}
