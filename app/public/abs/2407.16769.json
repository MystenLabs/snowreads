This bound arises from Cauchy slice holography, a recently proposed\nduality between the bulk gravity theory and a `boundary' theory that lives on\nCauchy slices. The HCEB is the logarithm of the maximum number of states of\nthis theory that can pass through a given cut $\\sigma$ of a Cauchy slice\n$\\Sigma$ ($\\sigma$ is thus a codimension-2 surface in the bulk). We show that\nthe bound depends only on the codimension-2 data on $\\sigma$, and is thus\nindependent of the choice of slice $\\Sigma$. For classical states, the HCEB\nupper bounds the entanglement between two subregions of the boundary of\n$\\Sigma$.\n  We calculate the bound explicitly in pure three-dimensional GR with negative\ncosmological constant, where the Cauchy slice theory is the $T\n\\overline{T}$-deformation of the dual CFT. We find that the imaginary energy\neigenstates in the spectrum of the deformed theory play a crucial role for\nobtaining a valid bound in Lorentzian signature. Our bound agrees with the area\nof a surface at certain marginal and extremal surfaces, but differs elsewhere.\nIn particular, it exceeds the area by an arbitrarily large amount for\n(anti)trapped surfaces, such as those that lie inside a black hole. Finally, we\ndiscuss how these results can be used to write down tensor networks\ncorresponding to arbitrary Cauchy slices.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
