It has been designed to support several\ntypes of data traffic and to meet more performance requirements than ever\nbefore. These characteristics make 5G very attractive for current but also\nnovel public and private industries and services. However, because of coverage,\nregulatory, business, and security reasons, many of these novel applications\ncan only be deployed as part of a private network. The cost of licensed\nfrequencies makes such approach prohibitive for many stakeholders, and\ntherefore unlicensed frequency bands represent a more affordable option. Even\nso, private 5G networks for use in globally unlicensed frequency bands do not\nyet exist. In this paper we present the first end-to-end private 5G network\noperating in a globally unlicensed frequency band, using general purpose\ncomputers, open-source software and software-defined radio. We evidence its\nworking and show that the choice of the hardware can significantly affect the\nperformance of the network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
