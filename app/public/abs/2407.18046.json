Most existing INR-based\nASSR networks first extract features from the given low-resolution image using\nan encoder, and then render the super-resolved result via a multi-layer\nperceptron decoder. Although these approaches have shown promising results,\ntheir performance is constrained by the limited representation ability of\ndiscrete latent codes in the encoded features. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel ASSR method named GaussianSR that overcomes this limitation through 2D\nGaussian Splatting (2DGS). Unlike traditional methods that treat pixels as\ndiscrete points, GaussianSR represents each pixel as a continuous Gaussian\nfield. The encoded features are simultaneously refined and upsampled by\nrendering the mutually stacked Gaussian fields. As a result, long-range\ndependencies are established to enhance representation ability. In addition, a\nclassifier is developed to dynamically assign Gaussian kernels to all pixels to\nfurther improve flexibility. All components of GaussianSR (i.e., encoder,\nclassifier, Gaussian kernels, and decoder) are jointly learned end-to-end.\nExperiments demonstrate that GaussianSR achieves superior ASSR performance with\nfewer parameters than existing methods while enjoying interpretable and\ncontent-aware feature aggregations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FwI-lqZT4X02-p67tOQfBYMxqEjdImBwb7ujRFusWeo","pdfSize":"7928213"}
