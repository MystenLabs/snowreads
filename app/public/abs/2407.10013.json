The most promising avenue of its detection is via measurements of\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) $B$-polarization. However, this is not\nstraightforward due to (a) the fact that CMB maps are distorted by\ngravitational lensing and (b) the high-dimensional nature of CMB data, which\nrenders likelihood-based analysis methods computationally extremely expensive.\nIn this paper, we introduce an efficient likelihood-free, end-to-end inference\nmethod to directly infer the posterior distribution of the tensor-to-scalar\nratio $r$ from lensed maps of the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ polarization parameters.\nOur method employs a generative model to delense the maps and utilizes the\nApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm to sample $r$. We demonstrate\nthat our method yields unbiased estimates of $r$ with well-calibrated\nuncertainty quantification.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HaNgTAx38OFbAeF2jszp99YMiQpHX3TGuPH6rcTULI0","pdfSize":"9907538"}
