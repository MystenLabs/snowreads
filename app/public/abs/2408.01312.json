Among its various techniques, frequency modulated\ncontinuous wave (FMCW) LiDAR stands out due to its capability to operate with\nultralow return power, immunity to unwanted light, and simultaneous acquisition\nof distance and velocity. However, achieving a rapid update rate with\nsub-micron precision remains a challenge for FMCW LiDARs. Here, we present such\na LiDAR with a sub-10 nm precision and a 24.6 kHz update rate by combining a\nbroadband Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser with a silicon nitride\nsoliton microcomb. An ultrahigh frequency chirp rate up to 320 PHz/s is\nlinearized by a 50 GHz microcomb to reach this performance. Our theoretical\nanalysis also contributes to resolving the challenge of FMCW velocity\nmeasurements with nonlinear frequency sweeps and enables us to realize velocity\nmeasurement with an uncertainty below 0.4 mm/s. Our work shows how nanophotonic\nmicrocombs can unlock the potential of ultrafast frequency sweeping lasers for\napplications including LiDAR, optical coherence tomography and sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"INOLhieRkyDABlvkBCIm-OycEIlgBIBvsxxXd8Ctg68","pdfSize":"3606572","txDigest":"DwBYFdAicsNGv71QzbYB5h9HignUdmanhD3AeDVEMcby","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
