While\nextensive research has been conducted on Stokes drift in water wave flows, its\ncounterpart in electrohydrodynamic flows remains relatively unexplored.\nAddressing this gap, we investigate Stokes drift beneath periodic traveling\nirrotational waves on a dielectric fluid under the effect of normal electric\nfields. Through numerical simulations utilizing conformal mapping, we compute\nparticle trajectories and analyze the resultant Stokes drift behaviors beneath\nperiodic traveling waves. Our findings indicate that variations in the electric\nfield impact particle velocities while maintaining trajectory shapes. Moreover,\nthe kinetic energy associated with a particle depends on its depth location and\nis a non-decreasing convex function in a moving frame and a constant in a\nlaboratory frame.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
