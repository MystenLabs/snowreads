We\nshow that the statistics of the measured correlators contains sufficient\ninformation to characterise the entanglement, and to quantify the mixedness of\nthe state of the computer's register. The transition to the maximally mixed\nregime, in the embedding space, displays a sharp boundary between entangled and\nseparable states. Away from this boundary, the multipartite entanglement\nstructure is robust to finite noise.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
