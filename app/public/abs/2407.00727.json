The trace\nproblem asks whether every trace on the uniform tracial completion is the\n$\\|\\cdot\\|_{2,T(A)}$-continuous extension of a trace on A. We answer this\nquestion positively in the case of C*-algebras that tensorially absorb the\nJiang-Su algebra, such as those studied in the Elliott classification\nprogramme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
