Alternative to sun exposure (the primary\nsource of vitamin D), vitamin D can also be obtained from food (e.g., fish,\neggs, and meat) and supplements. However, vitamin D intake among Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander peoples is currently unknown. We aimed to provide the\nfirst quantification of vitamin D intake using nationally representative data\nfrom Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Methods: We used food\nconsumption data collected in the 2012-2013 National Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islander Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (n = 4,109) and vitamin\nD food composition data to quantify mean absolute vitamin D intake by sex, age\ngroup, and remoteness of location. Differences in mean vitamin D intake between\nsexes and between remoteness of location were assessed using the 95% confidence\ninterval (95% CI). Results: The mean (standard deviation (SD)) vitamin D intake\namong Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was 2.9 (3.0) {\\mu}g/day.\nMales had a statistically significantly higher mean (SD) [95% CI] vitamin D\nintake (3.2 (3.1) [3.0-3.4] {\\mu}g/day) than females (2.6 (2.7) [2.4-2.7]\n{\\mu}g/day). There were no statistically significant differences between mean\n(SD) [95% CI] vitamin D intake in non-remote (2.9 (2.2) [2.7-3.1] {\\mu}g/day)\nand remote areas (2.8 (4.8) [2.6-3.0] {\\mu}g/day). Conclusions: Vitamin D\nintake among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is low. Food-based\npublic health strategies could be developed to promote higher vitamin D intake\namong this population.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
