Further, it was found that certain deformations of asymptotically flat\nextremal black holes are marginal, causing the nature of the horizon to be\nstrongly sensitive to UV corrections -- in particular, Wilson coefficients\nassociated with consistent UV completions generically lead to worse behaviour\non the horizon. In this work, we extend the discussion of deformed horizons in\nthe presence of UV corrections to extremal charged black holes in AdS where we\nfind a tower of marginal perturbations for different black hole masses. We\nargue that the apparent UV sensitivity of marginal modes is, in fact, a feature\nof the UV theory which is correctly reproduced by the EFT, and illustrate this\nwith explicit UV completions confirming the validity of the EFT. We demonstrate\nthat the same holds for a scalar-Maxwell EFT with known UV completion. In the\ngravitational case, the sign of EFT corrections to marginal perturbations is\ngenerally connected with the signs implied by positivity bounds, with UV\ncompletions generically lead to worse behaviour on the horizon. We conjecture\nthat this result is more generic, and use this to derive more general\npositivity bound motivated by the weak gravity conjecture, which we illustrate\nwith further evidence.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
