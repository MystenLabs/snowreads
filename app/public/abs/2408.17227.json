This\npaper develops a framework to enhance actuaries' understanding of the cyber\nrisks associated with the developing digital asset ecosystem, as well as their\nmeasurement methods in the context of digital asset insurance. By integrating\nactuarial perspectives, we aim to enhance understanding and modeling of cyber\nrisks at both the micro and systemic levels. The qualitative examination sheds\nlight on blockchain technology and its associated risks, while our quantitative\nframework offers a rigorous approach to modeling cyber risks in digital asset\ninsurance portfolios. This multifaceted approach serves three primary\nobjectives: i) offer a clear and accessible education on the evolving digital\nasset ecosystem and the diverse spectrum of cyber risks it entails; ii) develop\na scientifically rigorous framework for quantifying cyber risks in the digital\nasset ecosystem; iii) provide practical applications, including pricing\nstrategies and tail risk management. Particularly, we develop\nfrequency-severity models based on real loss data for pricing cyber risks in\ndigit assets and utilize Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the tail risks,\noffering practical insights for risk management strategies. As digital assets\ncontinue to reshape finance, our work serves as a foundational step towards\nsafeguarding the integrity and stability of this rapidly evolving landscape.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g2EuGH8QzwnBEhFKCi9CrzQ5lv31jH6VD4tGwwekM4I","pdfSize":"828142"}
