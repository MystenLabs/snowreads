This limitation has driven the development of\nhyper-redundant and continuum robots. While these present unique advantages,\nthey face challenges in, for instance, weight, mechanical complexity, modeling\nand costs. The Minimally Actuated Serial Robot (MASR) has been proposed as a\nlight-weight, low-cost and simpler alternative where passive joints are\nactuated with a Mobile Actuator (MA) moving along the arm. Yet, Inverse\nKinematics (IK) and a general motion planning algorithm for the MASR have not\nbe addressed. In this letter, we propose the MASR-RRT* motion planning\nalgorithm specifically developed for the unique kinematics of MASR. The main\ncomponent of the algorithm is a data-based model for solving the IK problem\nwhile considering minimal traverse of the MA. The model is trained solely using\nthe forward kinematics of the MASR and does not require real data. With the\nmodel as a local-connection mechanism, MASR-RRT* minimizes a cost function\nexpressing the action time. In a comprehensive analysis, we show that MASR-RRT*\nis superior in performance to the straight-forward implementation of the\nstandard RRT*. Experiments on a real robot in different environments with\nobstacles validate the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
