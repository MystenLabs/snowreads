In [6], it was\nproved that the stationary Navier--Stokes equations on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is\nill-posed for solutions around zero. In contrast, considering solutions around\nthe non-zero constant flow, the perturbed system has a better regularity in the\nlinear part, which enables us to prove the unique existence of solutions in the\nscaling critical spaces of the Besov type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
