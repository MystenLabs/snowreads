Drawing on previous theoretical work, we modify\nthe mechanics of 802.11 to fairly minimize AoI in a wireless network consisting\nof several update nodes and a single base station. We implement this protocol\non a testbed of software defined radios (SDRs) and measure its performance\nunder a variety of settings compared to standard 802.11. We observe a 32%\nreduction in network average AoI and an 89% reduction in peak AoI in a last\ncome first served (LCFS) single-packet queue setting, as well as a 76%\nreduction in network average AoI and an 82% reduction in peak AoI in a first\ncome first served (FCFS) queue setting when the network is congested. We\nfurther show that when the network is uncongested, WiFair achieves the same\nperformance as 802.11, and we demonstrate its robustness to more bursty traffic\nby streaming live video.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
