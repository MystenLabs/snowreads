The main focus is on investigating\nthe group of common automorphisms of two orthogonal Fano planes and the\nautomorphism group of a suitably oriented Fano plane. We show that both groups\nare isomorphic to $F_{21},$ independently of the choice of the two orthogonal\nFano planes and of the choice of the orientation.\n  We show, moreover, that any triangular embedding of the complete graph $K_7$\ninto a surface is isomorphic to the classical toroidal biembedding and hence is\nface $2$-colorable, with the two color classes defining a pair of orthogonal\nFano planes. As a consequence, we show that, for any triangular embedding of\n$K_7$ into a surface, the group of the automorphisms that preserve the color\nclasses is the Frobenius group of order $21.$\n  This way we provide three geometrical representations of $F_{21}$. Also, we\napply the representation in terms of two orthogonal Fano planes to give an\nalternative proof that $F_{21}$ is the automorphism group of the Kirkman triple\nsystem of order $15$ that is usually denoted as #61.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
