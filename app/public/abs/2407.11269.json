We fix a Borel subgroup $\\mathbf{B} =\n\\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{U}$ with maximal torus $\\mathbf{T}$ and unipotent radical\n$\\mathbf{U}$, and let $L(\\lambda)$ denote an irreducible representation of $G_0\n:= \\mathbf{G}(\\mathcal{O}_F)$ with coefficients in a sufficiently large field\nof characteristic $p$. Set $G := \\mathbf{G}(F)$, etc.\n  Assuming $\\lambda$ is a $p$-small and sufficiently regular character and that\n$p - 1$ is greater than the Coxeter number of $\\mathbf{G}$, we show that the\ncomplex $L(U,\\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\\lambda)))$ splits as the orthogonal\ndirect sum of its cohomology objects in the derived category of smooth\n$T$-representations in characteristic $p$. (Here $L(U, -)$ denotes Heyer's left\nadjoint of parabolic induction, from the derived category of smooth\n$G$-representations to the derived category of smooth $T$-representations.)\nConsequently, this gives rise to a collection of morphisms of graded spherical\nHecke algebras $$\\displaystyle{\\bigoplus_{i \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}}\\textrm{Ext}_{G}^{i}\\left(\\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\\lambda)),~\\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\\lambda))\\right)\n\\longrightarrow \\bigoplus_{i \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}}\\textrm{Ext}_{T}^{i}\\left(\\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\\lambda))),~\\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\\lambda)))\\right)}$$\nindexed by $n=-[F:\\mathbb{Q}_p]\\dim(\\mathbf{U}), \\ldots, 0$, which we refer to\nas derived Satake morphisms. For $\\lambda=0$ and $n=0$, this recovers the\ngraded mod $p$ Satake homomorphism constructed by Ronchetti.\n  We also give some partial results for general standard parabolic subgroups\n$\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{N} \\subset \\mathbf{G}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
