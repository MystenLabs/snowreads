The freshness of cached service data is critical\nwhen providing satisfactory services to users, but has been overlooked in\nexisting research efforts. In this paper, we study the online low-latency and\nfresh service provisioning in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks.\nSpecifically, we jointly optimize the service caching, task offloading, and\nresource allocation without knowledge of future system information, which is\nformulated as a joint online long-term optimization problem. This problem is\nNP-hard. To solve the problem, we design a Lyapunov-based online framework that\ndecouples the problem at temporal level into a series of per-time-slot\nsubproblems. For each subproblem, we propose an online integrated\noptimization-deep reinforcement learning (OIODRL) method, which contains an\noptimization stage including a quadratically constrained quadratic program\n(QCQP) transformation and a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, and a\nlearning stage including a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm.\nExtensive simulations show that the proposed OIODRL method achieves a\nnear-optimal solution and outperforms other benchmark methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
