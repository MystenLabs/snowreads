These\ndistinctive traits are still present in partially coherent Airy beams as long\nas the reach of their back tail (and hence their energy content) is not\nimportantly reduced. To investigate the effects associated with the decrease of\nthe beam coherence and its power content (by smoothly reducing the reach of\ntheir back tails), here we introduce a novel and insightful methodology based\non a generalization of the concept of flux trajectory for paraxial partially\ncoherent beams. This methodologies emphasizes the role of phase relations, thus\nhelping to clarify why and how the beam smears out spatially along its\npropagation. This formalism, though, is general enough to tackle other types of\nstructured light beams with whatever degree of partial coherence, from full\ncoherence to total incoherence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
