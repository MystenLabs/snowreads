Traditional techniques such as tip of\nthe red giant branch (TRGB) or surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) are\nlimited in their widespread applicability, especially in the semi-resolved\nregime. In this work we turn to the rapidly growing field of simulation based\ninference to infer distances, and other physical properties, of dwarf galaxies\ndirectly from multi-band images. We introduce Silkscreen: a code leveraging\nneural posterior estimation to infer the posterior distribution of parameters\nwhile simultaneously training a convolutional neural network to extract summary\nstatistics from the images. Utilizing this combination of machine learning and\nBayesian inference, we demonstrate the method's ability to recover accurate\ndistances from ground-based survey images for a set of nearby galaxies ($2 < D\n({\\rm Mpc)} < 12$) with measured SBF or TRGB distances. We discuss caveats of\nthe current implementation along with future prospects, focusing on the goal of\namortized inference. For surveys like LSST, Silkscreen, once amortized, will\nfacilitate inference for new dwarf galaxies in a matter of seconds using only\nbroadband cutouts. While we focus here on dwarf galaxies, we note that this\nmethod can be generalized to more luminous systems as well.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
