The excitation pathway has an inverse relation between the optical\nsectioning strength and the effective field of view (FOV). Multiple approaches\nexist to extend the effective FOV, and here we focus on remote focusing to\naxially scan the light sheet, synchronized with a CMOS camera's rolling\nshutter. A typical axially scanned SPIM configuration for imaging large samples\nutilizes a tunable optic for remote focusing, paired with air objectives\nfocused into higher refractive index media. To quantitatively explore the\neffect of remote focus choices and sample space refractive index mismatch on\nlight sheet intensity distributions, we developed a computational model\nintegrating ray tracing and field propagation. We validate our model's\nperformance against experimental light sheet profiles for various SPIM\nconfigurations. Our findings indicate that optimizing the position of the\nsample chamber relative to the excitation optics can enhance image quality by\nbalancing aberrations induced by refractive index mismatch. We validate this\nprediction using a homebuilt, large sample axially scanned SPIM configuration\nand calibration samples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
