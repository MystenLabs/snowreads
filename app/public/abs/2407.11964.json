One method of achieving a long-range interaction is by coherent\nelectron spin shuttling through an array of silicon quantum dots. In order to\nexecute many shuttling operations with high fidelity, it is essential to\nunderstand the dynamics of qubit dephasing and relaxation during the shuttling\nprocess in order to mitigate them. However, errors arising after many repeated\nshuttles are not yet well documented. Here, we probe decay dynamics\ncontributing to dephasing and relaxation of a singlet-triplet qubit during\ncoherent spin shuttling over many $N$ repeated shuttle operations. We find that\nlosses are dominated by magnetic dephasing for small $N<10^3$ and by incoherent\nshuttle errors for large $N>10^3$. Additionally, we estimate shuttle error\nrates below $1\\times10^{-4}$ out to at least $N=10^3$, representing an\nencouraging figure for future implementations of spin shuttling to entangle\ndistant qubits.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8kxrxUbZA2XII2n1WISkoi9CZFwJ8FpXrJJatI7W_cg","pdfSize":"3713038"}
