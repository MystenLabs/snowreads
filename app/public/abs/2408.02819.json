Maker plays first and colors $m$ uncolored edges on each turn.\nBreaker colors only one uncolored edge on each turn. They make sure that\nadjacent edges get distinct colors. Maker wins if eventually every edge is\ncolored; Breaker wins if at some point, the player who is playing cannot color\nany edge. We define the \\textit{$(m,1)$-game chromatic index} of $G$ to be the\nsmallest positive integer $k$ such that Maker has a winning strategy with\n$|X|=k$. We determine the exact $(m,1)$-game chromatic indices of some\ncaterpillars and all wheels.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
