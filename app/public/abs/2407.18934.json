This technology has attracted considerable interest from researchers\nacross diverse domains such as manufacturing, security, transportation, and\ngaming. The metaverse has emerged as a significant enabler in these domains,\nfacilitating the integration of various technologies to create virtual replicas\nof physical assets. The utilization of 3D character animation, often referred\nto as avatars, is crucial for implementing the metaverse. Traditionally, costly\nmotion capture technologies are employed for creating a realistic avatar\nsystem. To meet the needs of this evolving landscape, we have developed a\nmodular framework tailored for asset digital twins as a more affordable\nalternative. This framework offers flexibility for the independent\ncustomization of individual system components. To validate our approach, we\nemploy the English peg solitaire game as a use case, generating a solution tree\nusing the breadth-first search algorithm. The results encompass both\nqualitative and quantitative findings of a data-driven 3D animation system\nutilizing motion primitives. The presented methodologies and infrastructure are\nadaptable and modular, making them applicable to asset digital twins across\ndiverse business contexts. This case study lays the groundwork for pilot\napplications and can be tailored for education, health, or Industry 4.0\nmaterial development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PjJpslSLvmuGNEDavubcAB7jNyISs7wUP52YBEIyLWU","pdfSize":"1402435"}
