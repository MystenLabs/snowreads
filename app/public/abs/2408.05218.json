In IEEE Transactions on Services Computing\n(Vol. 17 No. 2, March/April 2024), Li et al. proposed PRMKR: efficient\nprivacy-preserving ranked multi-keyword retrieval scheme, which was claimed to\nresist keyword guessing attack. However, we show that the scheme fails to\nresist keyword guessing attack, index privacy, and trapdoor privacy. Further,\nwe propose a solution to address the above said issues by correcting the errors\nin the important equations of the scheme.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
