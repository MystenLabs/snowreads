Specific lyrical themes and emotions may intensify\nexisting negative states in listeners and may lead to undesirable outcomes,\nespecially in listeners with mood disorders such as depression. Hence, it is\nimportant for such individuals to be mindful of their listening strategies. In\nthis study, we examine online music consumption of individuals at risk of\ndepression in light of lyrical themes and emotions. Lyrics obtained from the\nlistening histories of 541 Last.fm users, divided into At-Risk and No-Risk\nbased on their mental well-being scores, were analyzed using natural language\nprocessing techniques. Statistical analyses of the results revealed that\nindividuals at risk for depression prefer songs with lyrics associated with low\nvalence and low arousal. Additionally, lyrics associated with themes of denial,\nself-reference, and ambivalence were preferred. In contrast, themes such as\nliberation, familiarity, and activity are not as favored. This study opens up\nthe possibility of an approach to assessing depression risk from the digital\nfootprint of individuals and potentially developing personalized recommendation\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
