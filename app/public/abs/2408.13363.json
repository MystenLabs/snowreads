The main novelty\nlies in the transport term of the population density, which depends on the\nsecond-order derivatives of the chemical field. This term is derived as an\nanticipation-reaction steering mechanism of an infinitesimally small ant as its\nsize approaches zero. We establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness for\nthe model, and the propagation of regularity from the initial data. Then, we\nbuild a numerical scheme and present various examples that provide hints of\ntrail formation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
