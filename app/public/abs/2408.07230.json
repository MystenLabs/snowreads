This includes IS doctoral programs\nthat train Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D)\nresearchers. Without such technical knowledge many doctoral and postdoctoral\nresearchers will not feel confident in engaging in DSR research. Given the\nimportance of designing artifacts that are appropriate for a given context, an\nimportant question is how can ICT4D and other IS researchers increase their IS\ntechnical content knowledge and intimacy with the DSR process. In this paper we\npresent, a process for reviewing DSR papers that has as its objectives:\nenhancing technical content knowledge, increasing knowledge and understanding\nof approaches to designing and evaluating IS/IT artifacts, and facilitating the\nidentification of new DSR opportunities. This process has been applied for more\nthan a decade at a USA research university.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
