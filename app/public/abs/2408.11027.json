A fully automated and configurable\ngeometry enabling differentiation of all detector dimensions, including crystal\nwidths and thicknesses, is presented. The software architecture, development\nenvironment, and necessary components to implement a new detector concept from\nscratch are described. General AI/ML reconstruction strategies for future\ncollider detectors are discussed, based around the idea of picking the right\nneural network for each detector.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
