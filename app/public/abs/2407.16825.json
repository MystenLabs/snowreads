Using standard polynomial\ninterpolation in such cases can lead to highly inaccurate results due to\nnumerical ill-conditioning of the problem. Several techniques have been\ndeveloped to mitigate this issue, such as the mock-Chebyshev subset\ninterpolation and the constrained mock-Chebyshev least-squares approximation.\nThe high accuracy and the numerical stability achieved by these techniques\nmotivate us to extend these methods to histopolation, a polynomial\ninterpolation method based on segmental function averages.\n  While classical polynomial interpolation relies on function evaluations at\nspecific nodes, histopolation leverages averages of the function over\nsubintervals. In this work, we introduce three types of mock-Chebyshev\napproaches for segmental interpolation and theoretically analyse the stability\nof their Lebesgue constants, which measure the numerical conditioning of the\nhistopolation problem under small perturbations of the segments. We demonstrate\nthat these segmental mock-Chebyshev approaches yield a quasi-optimal\nlogarithmic growth of the Lebesgue constant in relevant scenarios.\nAdditionally, we compare the performance of these new approximation techniques\nthrough various numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
