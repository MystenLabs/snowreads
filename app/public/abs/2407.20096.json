We also characterize\nthe coproximinal subspaces and the co-Chebyshev subspaces of $ \\mathcal{D}_n $\nin terms of the $ * $-Property. We observe that a complete characterization of\nthe best coapproximation problem in $ \\ell_{\\infty}^n $ follows directly as a\nparticular case of our approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
