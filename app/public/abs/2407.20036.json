In this paper,\nwe consider scenarios where a designated edge in the network has the potential\nto fail after edges have already been purchased. If the edge does fail,\nprocurement of additional edges may be required to repair the flow and\ncompensate for the failed edge so as to maintain the original flow amount. We\nformulate a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to minimize the\ncosts of both the initial flow as well as the repaired flow. We introduce an\nalgorithm that finds the Pareto front between these two objectives, thereby\nproviding decision makers with a sequence of solutions that trade off initial\nflow cost with repaired flow cost. We demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy with\nan evaluation using real-world CO2 capture and storage infrastructure data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
