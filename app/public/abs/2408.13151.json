Here, using optical weak measurement, we observe spin-dependent\nand spin-independent angular shifts of the reflected beam, enhanced by SPR in a\nsubwavelength nickel grating. An enhanced in-plane photonic spin Hall effect\nmanifested in the angular splitting of circularly polarized photons with\nopposite helicity signs is demonstrated. We theoretically and experimentally\ndemonstrate that angular in-plane shifts can be changed from spin-independent\n(Goos-Hanchen shift) to spin-dependent (PSHE) when the incident beam\npolarization state changes. The SPR-induced depolarization of light and the\nmixing of polarization states are analyzed. High purity of spin separation and\na high degree of circular polarization are achieved with an optimal\npolarization state (preselection angle) and a resonance angle of incidence. The\nspineless spatial separation of two orthogonal components of the field with\ndiagonal linear polarizations is demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TohEqhW4cHxcev6f6xsOe35kKrdu8miAaVbB6tieKn8","pdfSize":"2381323"}
