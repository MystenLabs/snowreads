Recent advances towards realising stable\nhigh-coherence platforms for quantum computing has increased the importance of\nstudying TLS in solid-state quantum circuits, as they are a persistent source\nof decoherence and instability. Here we perform scanning gate microscopy on a\nlive superconducting quantum circuit at millikelvin temperatures to locate\nindividual TLS. Our method directly reveals the microscopic nature of TLS and\nis also capable of deducing the three dimensional orientation of individual TLS\nelectric dipole moments. Such insights, when combined with structural\ninformation of the underlying materials, can help unravel the detailed\nmicroscopic nature and chemical origin of TLS, directing strategies for their\neventual mitigation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
