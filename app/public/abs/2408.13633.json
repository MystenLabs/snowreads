It is devoted to the\nmodeling of the interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions.\nThe modeling of equilibrium phase transition is based on the modified\nCahn-Hilliard equation. The non-equilibrium phase transition is modeled by the\nSecond Schl\\\"ogl reaction system. We consider the advancing front, which\ncombines these both transitions. Different from [1], we consider here the\nmemory effects, i.e. the effects of non-Fickian diffusion. The traveling wave\nsolution is obtained, its dependence on the model parameters is studied in\ndetail. The relative importance of memory effects for different process regimes\nis estimated.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
