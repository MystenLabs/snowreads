As a proof of\nconcept, we train a transformer architecture on three seasons of data from a\nprofessional soccer league. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare the\nperformance of this transformer architecture to two baseline models: a Markov\nmodel and a multi-layer perceptron. Additionally, we discuss potential\napplications of our model. We provide an open-source implementation of our\nmethods at https://github.com/danielhocevar/Foundation-Model-for-Soccer.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rPTDe7oI-ddTnS4mXg38PyG2bjxuteKvhPdiJl_IoIA","pdfSize":"1226620"}
