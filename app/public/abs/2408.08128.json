In the context\nof matching theory this conjecture is especially noteworthy as $K_{3,3}$ and\nthe Heawood graph are both strongly tied to the important class of Pfaffian\ngraphs, with $K_{3,3}$ being the canonical non-Pfaffian graph and the Heawood\ngraph being one of the most noteworthy Pfaffian graphs.\n  Our main contribution is a proof that the Heawood graph is the only 2-factor\nHamiltonian, Pfaffian, cubic brace. This is shown by establishing that, aside\nfrom the Heawood graph, all Pfaffian braces contain a cycle of length four,\nwhich may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
