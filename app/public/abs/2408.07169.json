In 1981\nMcLean discovered via numerical methods that Stokes waves are unstable with\nrespect to transverse perturbations. In \\cite{CreNguStr} for the case of\ninfinite depth we proved rigorously that the spectrum of the water wave system\nlinearized at small Stokes waves, with respect to transverse perturbations,\ncontains unstable eigenvalues lying approximately on an ellipse. In this paper\nwe consider the case of finite depth and prove that the same spectral\ninstability result holds for all but finitely many values of the depth. The\ncomputations and some aspects of the theory are considerably more complicated\nin the finite depth case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
