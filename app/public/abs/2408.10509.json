Specifically, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) at\nany level of continuous treatment intensity is identified using a conditional\nparallel trends assumption. In this framework, estimating the ATTs requires\nfirst estimating infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, especially the\nconditional density of the continuous treatment, which can introduce\nsignificant biases. To address this challenge, estimators for the causal\nparameters are proposed under the double/debiased machine learning framework.\nWe show that these estimators are asymptotically normal and provide consistent\nvariance estimators. To illustrate the effectiveness of our methods, we\nre-examine the study by Acemoglu and Finkelstein (2008), which assessed the\neffects of the 1983 Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) reform. By\nreinterpreting their research design using a difference-in-differences approach\nwith continuous treatment, we nonparametrically estimate the treatment effects\nof the 1983 PPS reform, thereby providing a more detailed understanding of its\nimpact.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
