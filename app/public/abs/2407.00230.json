Here, we demonstrate that\na nanoparticle dielectrophoretic response can be quantitatively studied by a\nstraightforward visual delineation of the dielectrophoretic trapping volume. We\nreveal this volume by detecting the width of the region depleted of gold\nnanoparticles by the dielectrophoretic force. Comparison of the measured widths\nfor various nanoparticle sizes with numerical simulations obtained by solving\nthe particle-conservation equation shows excellent agreement, thus providing\naccess to the particles physical properties, such as polarizability and size.\nThese findings can be further extended to investigate various types of\nnano-objects $-$ including bio- and molecular aggregates $-$ and offer a robust\ncharacterization tool that can enhance the control of matter at the nanoscale.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
