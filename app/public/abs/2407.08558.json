While traditional on-road detectors are hindered by limited coverage\nand high costs, cloud computing and data mining of vehicular network data, such\nas driving speeds and GPS coordinates, present a promising and cost-effective\nalternative. Furthermore, minimizing data collection can significantly reduce\noverhead. However, limited data can lead to inaccuracies and instability in\nTFE. To address this, we introduce the spatial-temporal Mamba (ST-Mamba), a\ndeep learning model combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a Mamba\nframework. ST-Mamba is designed to enhance TFE accuracy and stability by\neffectively capturing the spatial-temporal patterns within traffic flow. Our\nmodel aims to achieve results comparable to those from extensive data sets\nwhile only utilizing minimal data. Simulations using real-world datasets have\nvalidated our model's ability to deliver precise and stable TFE across an urban\nlandscape based on limited data, establishing a cost-efficient solution for\nTFE.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nYdj0ljfw5D-WqilOmWenpv5bTANm243U4pEFsPNDfI","pdfSize":"1492000","objectId":"0xeda1d1dfc3541fc7bbd3483d5d2c6468395e39ece9a652919e1ac36b979500d1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
