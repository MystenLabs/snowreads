We apply Gavassino's restoration principle to derive a theoretical\nframework for cyclic information dynamics within these extreme gravitational\nenvironments. Our model focuses specifically on particles that enter CTCs near\nthe inner horizon of a Kerr-Newman black hole, examining how such curves might\naffect quantum state evolution, entanglement preservation, and information\nretention.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N6-OY-RfgvGk6PH5jjsnxEbCqBgw22m-9Dxo-LFW0uc","pdfSize":"138571"}
