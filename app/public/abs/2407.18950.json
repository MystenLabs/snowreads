The technology of artificial intelligence\n(AI), based on functionalism, claims to simulate or replicate human judgment.\nTo assess this claim, it is necessary to study whether AI judgment possesses\nthe characteristics of human judgment. This paper argues that AI judgments\nexhibit a form that cannot be understood in terms of the characteristics of\nhuman judgments according to Kant. Because the characteristics of judgment\noverlap, we can call this AI's uncertainty. Then, I show that concepts without\nphysical intuitions are not easy to explain when their functions are shown\nthrough vision. Finally, I illustrate that even if AI makes sentences through\nsubject and predicate in natural language, which are components of judgment, it\nis difficult to determine whether AI understands the concepts to the level\nhumans can accept. This shows that it is questionable whether the explanation\nthrough natural language is reliable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7_bZ_pmS36cPHbvLaMh0yyXI0atLRSnekWqrSCgX7mk","pdfSize":"661369","objectId":"0x0c1b36bffb5d694038bef242d8e5966162867305912f77f8089e789fcb23fb63","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
