We utilize the\nmultilinear eigenfunction estimate on compact manifold to treat the interaction\nof different frequencies, which is more complicated compared to the case of\nflat torus [C. Fan, G. Staffilani, H. Wang, B. Wilson, Anal. PDE, 11 (2018),\n919-944.] and waveguide manifold [Z. Zhao, J. Zheng, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53\n(2020), 3644-3660.]. Moreover, combining with the I-method adapted to the\nnon-periodic case, bilinear Strichartz estimates along with the scale-invariant\n$L^p$ linear Strichartz estimates, we partially obtain the similar result of\n[Z. Zhao, J. Zheng, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53 (2020), 3644-3660.] on non-flat\ncompact manifold setting. As a consequence, we obtain the polynomial bounds of\nthe $H^s$ norm of solution $u$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
