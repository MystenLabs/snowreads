Motivated by these\nadvances, we comprehensively study transport due to a temperature bias in a\nquantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute\nthe charge-current noise (so-called delta-$T$ noise), heat-current noise, and\nmixed noise and elucidate how these observables can be used to infer strongly\ncorrelated properties of the device. Our main focus is the extraction of\nso-called scaling dimensions of the tunneling anyonic quasiparticles, of\ncritical importance to correctly infer their anyonic exchange statistics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
