Due to the invariance of many geometric properties under bi-Lipschitz\nmaps, this result greatly facilitates the study of such spaces. We prove a\nnon-injective analog of this embedding theorem for spaces of finite Minkowski\ndimension. This allows for non-doubling spaces to be weakly embedded and\nstudied in the usual Euclidean setting. Such spaces often arise in the context\nof random geometry and mathematical physics with the Brownian continuum tree\nand Liouville quantum gravity metrics being prominent examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"t5-7qFBhn2hW_PamvP4ochESkcj1aaamIeDIN7248Ck","pdfSize":"187442"}
