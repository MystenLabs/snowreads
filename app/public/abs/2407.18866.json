In fact, when expressed in terms of the\ntrace of the extrinsic curvature tensor, we illustrate that this boundary term\nhas one-half the coefficient of the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term required\nsuch that the total (bulk plus boundary) off-shell classical action has a\nwell-posed variational principle with Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
