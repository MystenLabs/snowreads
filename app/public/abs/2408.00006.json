In the field of cloud\ncomputing, ensuring the reliability of microservices is of paramount concern\nand yet a remarkably challenging task. Despite the large amount of research in\nthis area, validation of anomaly detection algorithms in realistic environments\nis difficult to achieve. To address this challenge, we propose a framework to\nmimic the complex time series patterns representative of both normal and\nanomalous cloud microservices behaviors. We detail the pipeline implementation\nthat allows deployment and management of microservices as well as the\ntheoretical approach required to generate anomalies. Two datasets generated\nusing the proposed framework have been made publicly available through GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CRqEYENcy77rI_DQqgvjIDmaNIwcpK1JPOh8loagxcA","pdfSize":"1311254","txDigest":"AEfpfncVNG1iLeVJFQXe8VgLAjHCpq7sr2HVReh6h7nh","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
