A\nstandard method involves discretizing the spatial domain into finite difference\ncells and using demagnetization tensors to compute the field. Different\ndemagnetization tensors can result in contributions from adjacent cells that do\nnot approach zero, nor do their differences, even as the cell size decreases.\nThis work demonstrates that in three-dimensional space, a specific set of\nmagnetization tensors produces the same total demagnetization field as the\nCauchy principal value when the cell size approaches zero. Additionally, we\nprovide a lower bound for the convergence speed, validated through numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"go0Dc_8JO_6Q1-Goq4lJeklM9OKjjt0QlcgJD0vmRys","pdfSize":"453424","objectId":"0x5c7172e4cea0e844ee33194edf3f3f638df6cd851413301156775b8c474aaed3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
