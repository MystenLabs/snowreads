This integration inevitably\nincreases computing demands, risking real-time system stability. Vehicle Edge\nComputing (VEC) addresses this by offloading tasks to Road Side Unit (RSU),\nensuring timely services. Our previous work FLSimCo algorithm, which uses local\nresources for Federated Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), though vehicles often\ncan't complete all iterations task. Our improved algorithm offloads partial\ntask to RSU and optimizes energy consumption by adjusting transmission power,\nCPU frequency, and task assignment ratios, balancing local and RSU-based\ntraining. Meanwhile, setting an offloading threshold further prevents\ninefficiencies. Simulation results show that the enhanced algorithm reduces\nenergy consumption, improves offloading efficiency and the accuracy of\nFederated SSL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
