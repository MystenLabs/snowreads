Feature selection was\nperformed using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) technique. We\naimed to enhance clinical decision support through multimodal learning and\nfeature fusion. Results: Our SVM model, utilizing combined features from\nPyradiomics and MRCradiomics, achieved an AUC of 0.74 on the Multi-Improd\ndataset (Siemens scanner) but decreased to 0.60 on the Philips test set. The RF\nmodel showed similar trends, with notable robustness for models using\nPyradiomics features alone (AUC of 0.78 on Philips). Conclusions: These\nfindings demonstrate the potential of multimodal feature integration to improve\nthe robustness and generalizability of machine-learning models for clinical\ndecision support in prostate cancer detection. This study marks a significant\nstep towards developing reliable AI-driven diagnostic tools that maintain\nefficacy across various imaging platforms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Z2DqFZCajsAV2DpXyAY6wVflc8zSWSfFetpeq7ikcIU","pdfSize":"436738"}
