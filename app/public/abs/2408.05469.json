Recently, research on real-world\ndata sets reports intermittent interaction among social individuals. In this\npaper, we pay attention to this typical phenomenon of intermittent interaction\nby considering the state transition of network vertices between online and\nhidden based on the birth and death process. By continuous-time Markov theory,\nwe show that both the number of each vertex's online neighbors and the online\nnetwork size are stable and follow the homogeneous probability distribution in\na similar form, inducing similar statistics as well. In addition, all\npropositions are verified via simulations. Moreover, we also present the degree\ndistributions based on small-world and scale-free networks and find some\nregular patterns by simulations. The application in fitting real networks is\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
