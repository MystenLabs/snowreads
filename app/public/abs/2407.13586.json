We study the poset module\nstructure in homology induced by the simultaneous filtrations of $S$ by the\nsub-level sets of the functions $f_i$ from an algorithmic and quantitative\npoint of view. For fixed dimensional homology we prove a singly exponential\nupper bound on the complexity of these modules which are encoded as certain\nsemi-algebraically constructible functions on $\\mathrm{R}^p \\times\n\\mathrm{R}^p$. We also deduce for semi-algebraic filtrations of bounded\ncomplexity, upper bounds on the number of equivalence classes of finite poset\nmodules that such a filtration induces -- establishing a tight analogy with a\nwell-known graph theoretical result on the \"speed'' of algebraically defined\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"88yl6N1PJ-5_lvO-ftKyEL5g6vl2aCO_JYHfpl2BNI4","pdfSize":"696034","objectId":"0xd201b41a3627d4f970e4644330d6c1825c1858b07fa4d15c522b9bcf42b140ad","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
