By employing\nthe ``potential approach\" previously used for the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, we derive transparent boundary conditions for the NNLS equation on\nmetric graphs. These conditions eliminate backscattering at graph vertices,\nwhich is crucial for minimizing losses in signal, heat, and charge transfer in\nvarious applications such as optical fibers, optoelectronic networks, and\nlow-dimensional materials.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f0_APGt-jxmVHNETwDA-zxs9kJ3Nzmh2dwvYmcpJaHI","pdfSize":"1884817"}
