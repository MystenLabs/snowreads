Dose distributions from arrays of 16\nparallel minibeams centered on a rectangular or hexagonal grid were constructed\nfrom the parameterized minibeam profiles to simulate the lateral convergence of\nthe minibeams resulting in a homogeneous dose field in the target tumor volume.\nPeak-to-valley dose ratios (PVDR) and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were\ncalculated for the parameterized dose distributions and compared with those\nobtained directly from Geant4 modeling of minibeam arrays. The similarity of\nthe results obtained by these two methods suggests that the fast calculation of\ndose profiles of minibeam arrays based on the DGR parameterizations proposed\nfor the first time in this work can replace the time-consuming MC modeling in\nfuture preclinical studies and also in the development of treatment planning\nsystems for minibeam therapy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
