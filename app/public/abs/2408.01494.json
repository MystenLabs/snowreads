We identify features that make the Friedel oscillations and\nmagnetization distinct from other materials with nontrivial spin texture such\nas Rashba metals. Because time-reversal symmetry is broken in altermagnets,\nboth magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities lead to local magnetization with the\nspatial pattern that reflects the symmetry of the altermagnetic splitting. The\nperiod of the corresponding oscillations provides an alternative way to\nquantify the altermagnetic spin splitting and the shape of the altermagnetic\nbands. The LDOS pattern in $p$-wave magnets, which respect combined\ntime-reversal and translation symmetries, is rich. It reveals anisotropy\nrelated directly to the spin splitting, but surprisingly also features LDOS\noscillations with a doubled period in the proximity of the impurity. The latter\neffect is also observed in a Rashba metal with an exchange field and originates\nfrom the interplay of propagating and evanescent waves. The obtained results\nare instrumental for investigating altermagnets and unconventional $p$-wave\nmagnets and impurity effects via tunneling probes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
