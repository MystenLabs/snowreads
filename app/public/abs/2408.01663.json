These 'speed-ups' are achieved by utilizing a\nresource known as magic. Measuring the amount of magic used by a device allows\nus to quantify its potential computational power. Without this property,\nquantum computers are no faster than classical computers. Whether magic can be\naccurately measured on large-scale quantum computers has remained an open\nproblem. To address this question, we introduce Pauli instability as a measure\nof magic and experimentally measure it on the IBM Eagle quantum processor. We\nprove that measuring large (i.e., extensive) quantities of magic is\nintractable. Our results suggest that one may only measure magic when a quantum\ncomputer does not provide a speed-up. We support our conclusions with both\ntheoretical and experimental evidence. Our work illustrates the capabilities\nand limitations of quantum technology in measuring one of the most important\nresources in quantum computation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
