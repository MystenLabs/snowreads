Feedforward-based methods\ngenerally outperform feedback in high-frequency range, but their performances\nare more susceptible to perturbations. In this work, we focus on the\nPound-Drever-Hall (PDH)-feedforward method we demonstrated recently [Yu-Xin\nChao et al., Optica 11(7), 945-950 (2024)] and analyze the factors that affect\nits long-term stability. By constructing a simple circuit allowing for adaptive\ncontrol of the feedforward gain in response to power fluctuations of cavity\ntransmission, we demonstrate a robust $\\geq 40$~dB suppression of laser phase\nnoise around 2~MHz and a noise suppression bandwidth up to 50~MHz. In\ncomparison, when using normal PDH feedback, robust noise suppression of over 40\ndB can only occur for frequencies below tens of kHz in most setups. Our\nfindings may pave the way for general usage of PDH feedforward and allow for\nsimple construction of low-noise lasers for precise quantum controls and\nprecision metrology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
