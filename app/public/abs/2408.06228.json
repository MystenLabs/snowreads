One important aspect that distinguishes between\nclassical PR and ordinary resonance is that in the former, if the initial\nenergy of the system is at its minimum (${\\dot x}={x}=0$), the system does not\nevolve. In a quantum system, however, even when the system is in the minimum\nenergy (ground) state, the system has non-trivial evolution under PR due to the\ndelocalized nature of the ground state wavefunction. Here we study the\nevolution of such a system which exhibits a purely quantum effect with no\nclassical analog. In particular, we focus on the quantum mechanical analog of\nPR by varying with time the parabolic potential i.e. the frequency of the\nquantum harmonic oscillator\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1zZKJGt-BpCTlb8OHcwHSfxd19iAElRQAbnROGHJxgA","pdfSize":"624223"}
