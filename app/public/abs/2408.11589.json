Vehicle Color Recognition (VCR) has\ngarnered significant research interest because color is a visually\ndistinguishable attribute of vehicles and is less affected by partial occlusion\nand changes in viewpoint. Despite the success of existing methods for this\ntask, the relatively low complexity of the datasets used in the literature has\nbeen largely overlooked. This research addresses this gap by compiling a new\ndataset representing a more challenging VCR scenario. The images - sourced from\nsix license plate recognition datasets - are categorized into eleven colors,\nand their annotations were validated using official vehicle registration\ninformation. We evaluate the performance of four deep learning models on a\nwidely adopted dataset and our proposed dataset to establish a benchmark. The\nresults demonstrate that our dataset poses greater difficulty for the tested\nmodels and highlights scenarios that require further exploration in VCR.\nRemarkably, nighttime scenes account for a significant portion of the errors\nmade by the best-performing model. This research provides a foundation for\nfuture studies on VCR, while also offering valuable insights for the field of\nfine-grained vehicle classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
