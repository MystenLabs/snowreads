However, catching these failures is time consuming and such algorithms\ncannot adapt well to changes in designs, and sometimes variations in everyday\nbehavior. More importantly, the number of units to monitor in a high-volume\nmanufacturing environment is too big for manual monitoring or for a simple\nprogram. Here we develop a novel program that combines both rule-based\ndecisions and machine learning models that can not only learn and adapt to such\nday-to-day variations or long-term design changes, but also can be applied at\nscale to the high number of manufacturing units in use today. Using the current\nstate-of-the-art technologies, we then deploy this program at-scale to handle\nthe needs of ever-increasing demand from the manufacturing environment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
