We prove that such\nequations almost always exhibit finite-time singularities for smooth and\nlocalized solutions. Singularities can even form in settings where solutions\ndissipate an energy. Such equations arise naturally as models in various\nphysical settings such as inviscid and complex fluids.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
