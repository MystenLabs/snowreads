Existing solutions struggle to achieve\nthis feat -- current cybersec-tailored approaches are still limited in\nexpressivity, and methods successful in other domains do not scale well for\nlarge volumes of data, rendering frequent retraining impossible. This work\nproposes a new perspective for learning from graph data that is modeling\nnetwork entity interactions as a large heterogeneous graph. High expressivity\nof the method is achieved with neural network architecture HMILnet that\nnaturally models this type of data and provides theoretical guarantees. The\nscalability is achieved by pursuing local graph inference, i.e., classifying\nindividual vertices and their neighborhood as independent samples. Our\nexperiments exhibit improvement over the state-of-the-art Probabilistic Threat\nPropagation (PTP) algorithm, show a further threefold accuracy improvement when\nadditional data is used, which is not possible with the PTP algorithm, and\ndemonstrate the generalization capabilities of the method to new, previously\nunseen entities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UCwh6Db01o_WvHth1zx91m9J-9pD5qONjsCcyzceDr4","pdfSize":"1021262"}
