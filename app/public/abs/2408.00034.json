When the pathogen transmission\nexhibits one way propagation, it is possible to observe different possible\nendemic equilibria. We characterize in a general setting all the equilibria,\nusing a decomposition of the space into atoms, given by the transmission\noperator. We also prove that the proportion of infected individuals converges\nto an equilibrium, which is uniquely determined by the support of the initial\ncondition.We extend those results to infinite-dimensional SIS models with\nreservoir or with immigration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
