Recent advancements include ensemble multi-environment hybrid\nQ-learning algorithms, which utilize multiple Q-learning algorithms across\nstructurally related but distinct Markovian environments and outperform\nexisting Q-learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and complexity in\nlarge-scale wireless networks. We herein conduct a comprehensive coverage\nanalysis to ensure optimal data coverage conditions for these algorithms.\nInitially, we establish upper bounds on the expectation and variance of\ndifferent coverage coefficients. Leveraging these bounds, we present an\nalgorithm for efficient initialization of these algorithms. We test our\nalgorithm on two distinct real-world wireless networks. Numerical simulations\nshow that our algorithm can achieve %50 less policy error and %40 less runtime\ncomplexity than state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms.\nFurthermore, our algorithm exhibits robustness to changes in network settings\nand parameters. We also numerically validate our theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
