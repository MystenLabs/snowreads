It is\nknown that if $\\Gamma \\lhd \\Gamma_0 < \\mathrm{PGL}_2(K)$ is a Schottky group\nnormally contained in a larger group which is generated by order-$p$ elements\neach fixing $2$ points $a_i, b_i \\in \\mathbb{P}_K^1$, then the quotient of a\ncertain subset of the projective line $\\mathbb{P}_K^1$ by the action of\n$\\Gamma$ can be algebraized as a superelliptic curve $C : y^p = f(x) / K$. The\nsubset $S \\subset K \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ consisting of these pairs $a_i, b_i$ of\nfixed points is mapped bijectively modulo $\\Gamma$ to the set $\\mathcal{B}$ of\nbranch points of the superelliptic map $x : C \\to \\mathbb{P}_K^1$. A conjecture\nof Gerritzen and van der Put, in the case that $C$ is hyperelliptic and $K$ has\nresidue characteristic $\\neq 2$, compares the cluster data of $S$ with that of\n$\\mathcal{B}$. We show that this conjecture requires a slight modification in\norder to hold and then prove a much stronger version of the modified conjecture\nthat holds for any $p$ and any residue characteristic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
