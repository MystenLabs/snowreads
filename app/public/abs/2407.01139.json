The column density of\nCH$_3^{18}$OH is in some star-forming regions so high that the search for\nCH$_3^{17}$OH is promising. But only very few transition frequencies of\nCH$_3^{17}$OH with a microwave accuracy have been published thus far. We\nrecorded the rotational spectrum of CH$_3^{17}$OH between 38 and 1095 GHz\nemploying a methanol sample enriched in $^{17}$O to 20\\%. A torsion-rotation\nHamiltonian model based on the rho-axis method was employed to fit the data, as\nin our previous studies. We searched for rotational transitions of\nCH$_3^{17}$OH in the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA obtained with the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the high-mass\nstar-forming region Sgr B2(N). The observed spectra were modeled under the\nassumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The assignments cover $0\n\\le J \\le 45$, $K_a \\le 16$, and mainly the $v_ t = 0$ and 1 torsional states.\nThe Hamiltonian model describes our data well. The model was applied to derive\na line list for radio-astronomical observations. We report a tentative\ndetection of CH$_3^{17}$OH along with secure detections of the more abundant\nisotopologs of methanol toward Sgr B2(N2b). The derived column densities yield\nisotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 25, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = 240, and\n$^{18}$O/$^{17}$O = 3.3, which are consistent with values found earlier for\nother molecules in Sgr B2. The agreement between the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O isotopic\nratio that we obtained for methanol and the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O ratios reported\nin the past for other molecules in Sgr B2(N) strongly supports our tentative\ninterstellar identification of CH$_3^{17}$OH. The accuracy of the derived line\nlist is sufficient for further radio astronomical searches for this methanol\nisotopolog toward other star-forming regions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
