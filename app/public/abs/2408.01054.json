Each rule in that class maximizes\n$\\sum_if(\\pi^i)$ where $\\pi^i$ is an agent $i$'s satisfaction and $f$ could be\nany twice differentiable, increasing and concave real function. Based on a\nsingle quantity we call the \\textit{'Inequality Aversion'} of $f$ (elsewhere\nknown as \"Relative Risk Aversion\"), we derive bounds on the Egalitarian loss,\nwelfare loss and the approximation of \\textit{Average Fair Share}, leading to a\nquantifiable, continuous presentation of their inevitable trade-offs. In\nparticular, we show that the Nash Product Rule satisfies\\textit{ Average Fair\nShare} in our setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vtYlJ7iQQeNCw3I5nSw2U9hPGC4dhVhvu9uK_bofP54","pdfSize":"205327"}
