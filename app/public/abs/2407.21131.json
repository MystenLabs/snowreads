Our analysis relies on a vector fixed-point approach based on the\nfixed-point theorems of Perov, Schauder, Leray-Schauder, and Avramescu.\nAdditionally, for a related semi-observability problem, we employ a novel\ntechnique utilizing Bielecki equivalent norms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
