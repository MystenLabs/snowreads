The energy spectra, $E(k)$, is determined from the decaying\nturbulence behind the bubble swarm obtained using particle image velocimetry\n(PIV). As the bubble Reynolds number decreases, the signature $k^{-3}$ of the\nenergy spectra for the bubble induced turbulence is replaced by a scaling\nsimilar to the classical $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov's scaling, where $k$ is the\nwavenumber. We find that for Re $<$ $O$(100) the slope of the normalized energy\nspectra is no longer independent on the gas volume fraction. This is further\ncorroborated using spatial correlation of the velocity vector behind the bubble\nswarm. Thus, we provide experimental evidence to the claim by\n\\citet{mazzitelli2003effect} that at low Reynolds numbers the normalized energy\nspectra of the bubble induced turbulence will no longer show the $k^{-3}$\nscaling because of the absence of bubble wake and that the energy spectra will\ndepend on the number of bubbles, thus non-universal.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
