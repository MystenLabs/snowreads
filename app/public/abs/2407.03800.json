The\nexcitation proceeds via the core interaction with any of the external nucleons.\nWe assume the $^{11}$B ground and low-lying excited states [$\\frac32^-$ (0.0\nMeV), $\\frac52^-$ (4.45 MeV), $\\frac72^-$ (6.74 MeV)] and the excited states\n[$\\frac12^-$ (2.12 MeV), $\\frac32^-$ (5.02 MeV)] to be members of $K=\\frac32^-$\nand $K=\\frac12^-$ rotational bands, respectively. The dynamical core excitation\nresults in a significant cross section for the reaction leading to the\n$\\frac52^-$ (4.45 MeV) excited state of $^{11}$B that cannot be populated\nthrough the single-particle excitation mechanism. The detailed agreement\nbetween the theoretical calculations and data depends on the used optical model\nparametrizations and the kinematical configuration of the detected nucleons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
