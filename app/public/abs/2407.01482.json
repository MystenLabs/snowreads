A key ingredient for this is a computation of the\nSegal $K$-theory of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces with a\nnilpotent endomorphism, which we do over any field $\\mathbb F$. We also discuss\nthe topological cases of $\\mathbb F =\\mathbb C,\\mathbb R$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
