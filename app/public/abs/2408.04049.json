We prove several results of this form and demonstrate that no estimate\ncan hold before that time. As an example application, we construct solutions to\ngraphical curve shortening flow starting with initial data that is merely an\n$L^1$ function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
