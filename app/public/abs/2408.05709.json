Actually, even if a user is interested in the live-streaming\nauthor, it still may be an negative watching (e.g., short-view < 3s) since the\nreal-time content is not attractive enough. Therefore, for live-streaming\nrecommendation, there exists a challenging task: how do we recommend the\nlive-streaming at right moment for users? Additionally, our platform's major\nexposure content is short short-video, and the amount of exposed short-video is\n9x more than exposed live-streaming. Thus users will leave more behaviors on\nshort-videos, which leads to a serious data imbalance problem making the\nlive-streaming data could not fully reflect user interests. In such case, there\nraises another challenging task: how do we utilize users' short-video behaviors\nto make live-streaming recommendation better?\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
