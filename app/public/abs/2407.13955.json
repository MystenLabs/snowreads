We\ngive sufficient conditions for local uniqueness, i.e. conditions that guarantee\nthat the linearization of this non-linear inverse problem admits a unique\nsolution. Our method is inspired by a method to study local uniqueness of\ninverse problems with internal functionals in the continuum, where the inverse\nproblem is reformulated as a redundant system of differential equations. We use\nour method to derive local uniqueness conditions for other discrete inverse\nproblems with internal functionals including a discrete analogue of the inverse\nSchr\\\"odinger problem and problems where the resistors are replaced by\nimpedances and dissipated power at the zero and a positive frequency are\navailable. Moreover, we show that the dissipated power measurements can be\nobtained from measurements of thermal noise induced currents.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
