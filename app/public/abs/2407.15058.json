Our criterion is applicable to a wide range of systems, including in\nparticular dispersive equations. Its verification is in nature related to\nseveral topics, i.e., asymptotic compactness in dynamical systems, global\nstability of evolution equations, and localized control problems.\n  As an initial application, we exploit the exponential mixing of random\nnonlinear wave equations with degenerate damping, critical nonlinearity, and\nphysically localized noise. The essential challenge lies in the fact that the\nweak dissipation and randomness interact in the evolution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
