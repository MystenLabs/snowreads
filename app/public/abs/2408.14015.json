Our tests are inherently sequential, being valid at\narbitrary data-dependent stopping times, but they are new even for fixed sample\nsizes, giving type-I error control without any regularity conditions. We\nachieve this by modifying and extending a proposal by Huber (1965) in the point\nnull versus point alternative case. Our test statistic is a nonnegative\nsupermartingale under the null, even with a sequentially adaptive contamination\nmodel where the conditional distribution of each observation given the past\ndata lies within an $\\epsilon$ (total variation) ball of the null. The test is\npowerful within an $\\epsilon$ ball of the alternative. As a consequence, one\nobtains anytime-valid p-values that enable continuous monitoring of the data,\nand adaptive stopping. We analyze the growth rate of our test supermartingale\nand demonstrate that as $\\epsilon\\to 0$, it approaches a certain\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the null and alternative, which is the\noptimal non-robust growth rate. A key step is the derivation of a robust\nReverse Information Projection (RIPr). Simulations validate the theory and\ndemonstrate excellent practical performance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F7yOM8kWFDuNHPfHycx3ejPDcv_bA4Mn-8NwbM7UqMQ","pdfSize":"2373377"}
