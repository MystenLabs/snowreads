The non-linear nature of the\nmodel allows to couple the magnetic field to the quarkonium inner structure\nwithout having to introduce back-reacting charged flavour degrees of freedom.\nThe magnetic field dependent melting temperature is computed from the spectral\nfunctions and suggests a switch from magnetic to inverse magnetic catalysis\nwhen the magnetic field increases. We also discuss the differences due to the\nanisotropy brought in by the external field.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y63R-gXcxyS_wlVo6qrVZ-e-PuVU6df35y7nwzlp_e8","pdfSize":"1169707"}
