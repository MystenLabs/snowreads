We calculate both spin\npolarization in bulk in the linear response and antiparallel spin polarization\nnear the boundary in the quadratic response against electric fields. We also\nwork out spin polarization induced by the fluctuating electric fields, i.e.,\nnoises. Based on these results, we address chirality-induced spin selectivity\n(CISS) without biased inputs, CISS at room temperature, and the\nenantio-selective interaction between chiral materials and a magnetic\nsubstrate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
