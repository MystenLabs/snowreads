This paper suggests that this\nenhancement hinges on random matrix phonons mediating Cooper pairing more\nefficiently than bulk phonons. We develop the Eliashberg theory of\nsuperconductivity in chaotic grains, calculate the random phonon spectrum and\nsolve the Eliashberg equations numerically. Self-averaging of the effective\nelectron-phonon coupling constant is noted, which allows us to fit the\nnumerical data with analytical results based on a generalization of the Berry\nconjecture. The key insight is that the phonon density of states, and hence\n$T_{c}$, shows an enhancement proportional to the ratio of the perimeter and\narea of the grain - the Weyl law. We benchmark our results for aluminum films,\nand find an enhancement of $T_{c}$ of about $10\\%$ for a randomly-generated\nshape. A larger enhancement of $T_{c}$ is readily possible by optimizing grain\ngeometries. We conclude by noticing that mesoscopic shape fluctuations in\nrealistic granular structures should give rise to a further enhancement of\nglobal $T_{c}$ due to the formation of a percolating Josephson network.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
