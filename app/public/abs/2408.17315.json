HLSCs are\ncharacterized by two distinct properties: spectral conversion and light\nextraction. Unlike traditional LSCs, HLSCs focus on converting energy from one\npart of the solar spectrum (typically green) to a specific range (usually red)\nand aim for the converted photons to exit the device from the bottom surface\nrather than the edge surfaces. In this study, we start by examining the\nspecific requirements of horticulture to clarify the motivation for using\nHLSCs. We re-evaluate and propose new optical metrics tailored to HLSCs.\nAdditionally, we analyse potential loss channels for direct red emission and\nconverted red emission. Utilizing Monte Carlo ray tracing method and\nexperimental data, we further explore the factors influencing these loss\nchannels. Our work provides a fundamental discussion on HLSCs and offers design\nguidelines for future HLSC research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
