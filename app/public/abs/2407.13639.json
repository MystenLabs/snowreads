The expansion is developed in\npowers of adiabatic coordinate velocity, and it is used for computing the\nCP-violating seed asymmetry at the front of the phase transition wall, that\nsources the eventual baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). We implement the\nmethod in a benchmark model, with a CP-violating mass arising from a\ndimension-5 operator coupling the fermion to a singlet scalar field. We find\nthat the higher moment calculations yield a BAU that can significantly differ\nfrom the commonly used two-moment approximation. We discuss in detail the\nunderlying approximations in the moment method and propose a new truncation\nscheme for the expansion, that appears to give more numerically robust results\nthan the previous schemes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
