This\nresult is known to be stronger than the classical Tur\\'an theorem. In this\npaper, we consider hypergraph extensions of spectral Tur\\'an theorem. For\n$k\\geq r\\geq 2$, let $H_{k+1}^{(r)}$ be the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained\nfrom $K_{k+1}$ by enlarging each edge with a new set of $(r-2)$ vertices. Let\n$F_{k+1}^{(r)}$ be the $r$-uniform hypergraph with edges: $\\{1,2,\\ldots,r\\} =:\n[r]$ and $E_{ij} \\cup\\{i,j\\}$ over all pairs $\\{i,j\\}\\in\n\\binom{[k+1]}{2}\\setminus\\binom{[r]}{2}$, where $E_{ij}$ are pairwise disjoint\n$(r-2)$-sets disjoint from $[k+1]$. Generalizing the Tur\\'an theorem to\nhypergraphs, Pikhurko [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 103 (2013) 220--225] and\nMubayi and Pikhurko [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 97 (2007) 669--678] respectively\ndetermined the exact Tur\\'an number of $H_{k+1}^{(r)}$ and $F_{k+1}^{(r)}$, and\ncharacterized the corresponding extremal hypergraphs.\n  Our main results show that $T_r(n,k)$, the complete $k$-partite $r$-uniform\nhypergraph on $n$ vertices where no two parts differ by more than one in size,\nis the unique hypergraph having the maximum $p$-spectral radius among all\n$n$-vertex $H_{k+1}^{(r)}$-free (resp. $F_{k+1}^{(r)}$-free) $r$-uniform\nhypergraphs for sufficiently large $n$. These findings are obtained by\nestablishing $p$-spectral version of the stability theorems. Our results offer\n$p$-spectral analogues of the results by Mubayi and Pikhurko, and connect both\nhypergraph Tur\\'an theorem and hypergraph spectral Tur\\'an theorem in a unified\nform via the $p$-spectral radius.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
