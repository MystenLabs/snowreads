In particular, despite the common terminology, $\\mathfrak g$ is not a\nLie algebra. We construct classes of ${\\mathbb Z}_2\\times{\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded\nLie algebras corresponding to the classical Lie algebras, in terms of their\ndefining matrices. For the ${\\mathbb Z}_2\\times{\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie\nalgebra of type $A$, the construction coincides with the previously known\nclass. For the ${\\mathbb Z}_2\\times{\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra of type\n$B$, $C$ and $D$ our construction is new and gives rise to interesting defining\nmatrices closely related to the classical ones but undoubtedly different. We\nalso give some examples and possible applications to parastatistics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
