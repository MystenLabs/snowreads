In several applications, including biological\nworkflows, chemical equations, and computational data flow analysis, these\ngraphs often exhibit a tree-like nesting structure, where sibling clusters are\ndisjoint. Common compound graph layouts prioritize the lowest level of the\ngrouping, down to the individual ungrouped vertices, which can make the higher\nlevel grouped structures more difficult to discern, especially in deeply nested\nnetworks. Leveraging the additional structure of the tree-like nesting, we\ncontribute an overview+detail layout for this class of compound graphs that\npreserves the saliency of the higher level network structure when groups are\nexpanded to show internal nested structure. Our layout draws inner structures\nadjacent to their parents, using a modified tree layout to place substructures.\nWe describe our algorithm and then present case studies demonstrating the\nlayout's utility to a domain expert working on data flow analysis. Finally, we\ndiscuss network parameters and analysis situations in which our layout is well\nsuited.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BtVAg3vQBB3P69w2cg6WfkSIFjY5clqturCNRAaBo78","pdfSize":"1635685"}
