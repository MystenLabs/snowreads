If the profile\nof the expected PSF is known fairly well through characterization of the\ntelescope and detector used for observing, one can simulate the undersampled\nPSF at many positions on a simulated pixel grid. The true centroid positions\nare known since the PSFs are simulated, and so one can match up each\nundersampled PSF images to its true centroid location, thus forming a lookup\ntable. One then assigns the centroid position of an observed PSF to the\nposition associated with the PSF in the lookup table that has the smallest\nsquared residual with respect to the observed PSF. We examine a few PSF sizes\nand demonstrate that the lookup table provides better centroid positions\ncompared to a fitting algorithm when the PSFs are undersampled, even in the\npresence of noise.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5fL66rsdLtItTPpzjrFskgEDF27FOGAIbbg8WGmGgcE","pdfSize":"238788"}
