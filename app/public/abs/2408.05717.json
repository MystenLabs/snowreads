Specifically, the proposed network enhances\nthe traditional pyramid network by adding an additional shared auxiliary\ndecoder for image pairs. This decoder provides multi-scale high-level feature\ninformation from unblended image pairs for the registration task. During the\nregistration process, we also design a multi-scale feature fusion block to\nextract the most beneficial features for the registration task from both global\nand local contexts. Validation results indicate that this method can capture\ncomplex deformations while achieving higher registration accuracy and\nmaintaining smooth and plausible deformations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
