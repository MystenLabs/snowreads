In an SEM, the electron probe information\nis lost as the beam interacts with the specimen. We show how the probe phase\ninformation can be recovered from reconstructed probe intensity estimates.\nControlled defocus was used to capture a focal-series of SEM images of\n$28.5\\;nm $ gold ($\\mathrm{Au} $) nanoparticles ($\\mathrm{NPs} $) on a carbon\n($\\mathrm C $) film. These images were used to reconstruct their respective\nprobe intensities to create a focal-series of probe intensities, which were the\ninput to the phase retrieval pipeline. Using the complete description\n(intensity and phase) of the electron probe wavefunction at the specimen plane,\nwe report the $PSF_{optics} $ for multiple data sets for beam energy\n$E\\;=20\\;keV\\; $. This work opens up new possibilities for an alternative way\nof aberration correction and aberration-free imaging in scanning electron\nmicroscopy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
