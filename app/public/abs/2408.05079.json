Nearly recurrent episodes are\nidentified from simulations and then converged using a standard Newton-\nGMRES-hookstep method, however with much greater diversity than previous\nstudies which performed this 'recurrent flow analysis'. Unstable periodic and\nrelative periodic orbits are able to be identified which span larger values of\ndissipation rate, i.e. corresponding to extreme bursting events. The triad\nvariables are found to provide a more natural way to weight the greater variety\nof spatial modes active in such orbits than a standard Euclidian norm of\ncomplex Fourier amplitudes. Moreover the triad variables build in a reduction\nof the continuous symmetry of the system which avoids the need to search over\ntranslations when obtaining relative periodic orbits. Armed with these orbits\nwe investigate optimal weightings when reconstructing the statistics of\nturbulence and suggest that, in fact, a simple heuristic weighting based on the\nsolution instability provides a very good prediction, provided enough\ndynamically relevant orbits are included in the expansion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Owa0PT4vPcpvZwksFe8pcumxXcyWDVvn_jOYQ-vTwB8","pdfSize":"5396882"}
