Utilizing Yurke and Denker's quantum circuit network theory within\nthe framework of continuous MERA (cMERA) in AdS space, we analyze the\nquantization and interactions of transmission lines. The metric is revealed to\nbe described by the inductance of the quantum circuit, which is AdS-space in\nits 0-limit. These results provide new insights into handling and controlling\ncomplex phenomena in quantum circuits, potentially advancing the understanding\nof quantum computing and quantum communication.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
