The\npresentation is intentionally pedagogical and most calculations are reported\nstep by step. In the disk-corona model, the spectrum of a source has three\ncomponents: a thermal component from the disk, a Comptonized component from the\ncorona, and a reflection component from the disk. These notes review only the\nrelativistic calculations. The formulas presented here are valid for\nstationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically-flat, circular spacetimes, so they can\nbe potentially used for a large class of black hole solutions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
