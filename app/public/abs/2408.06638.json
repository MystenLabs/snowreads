However, due to the\ncontinuity problem in regression, existing conditional distribution alignment\ntheory and methods with discrete prior, which are proven to be effective in\nclassification settings, are no longer applicable. In this work, focusing on\nthe feasibility problems in DAR, we establish the sufficiency theory for the\nregression model, which shows the generalization error can be sufficiently\ndominated by the cross-domain conditional discrepancy. Further, to characterize\nconditional discrepancy with continuous conditioning variable, a novel\nConditional Operator Discrepancy (COD) is proposed, which admits the metric\nproperty on conditional distributions via the kernel embedding theory. Finally,\nto minimize the discrepancy, a COD-based conditional invariant representation\nlearning model is proposed, and the reformulation is derived to show that\nreasonable modifications on moment statistics can further improve the\ndiscriminability of the adaptation model. Extensive experiments on standard DAR\ndatasets verify the validity of theoretical results and the superiority over\nSOTA DAR methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
