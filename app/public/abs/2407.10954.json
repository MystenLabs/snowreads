Traditional CSG\nrelies on min, max operators to perform boolean operations on implicit shapes.\nBut because these boolean operators are discontinuous and discrete in the\nchoice of operations, this makes optimization over the CSG representation\nchallenging. Drawing inspiration from fuzzy logic, we present a unified boolean\noperator that outputs a continuous function and is differentiable with respect\nto operator types. This enables optimization of both the primitives and the\nboolean operations employed in CSG with continuous optimization techniques,\nsuch as gradient descent. We further demonstrate that such a continuous boolean\noperator allows modeling of both sharp mechanical objects and smooth organic\nshapes with the same framework. Our proposed boolean operator opens up new\npossibilities for future research toward fully continuous CSG optimization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
