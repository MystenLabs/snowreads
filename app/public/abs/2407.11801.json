In this context an important role is played\nby the component group of the stabilizer of a nilpotent element. In this work,\nthe aim is to show computational methods to obtain explicit generators of the\ncomponent group of the centralizer of a nilpotent element in a simple Lie\nalgebra over $\\mathbb{C}$. In some cases such generators had already been\ndetermined by impressive hand calculations but these often use the specific\nform of the chosen representative and are thus not immediately applicable to\ndifferent representatives of the same orbit. It is then interesting to show how\nto overcome this issue constructing specific algorithms: for the classical\ntypes there is a straightforward method that directly translates well-known\ntheoretical constructions; for the exceptional types we devise a method using\nthe double centralizer of an $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple. In particular, it gives\nan independent construction of the component group, that does not depend on the\nprior knowledge of its isomorphism type. For our purposes, we needed to\nconstruct many algorithms which have been mainly implemented in the\ncomputational algebra system GAP.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
