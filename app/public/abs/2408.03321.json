Here, we explore in particular the implications for the\ncombination of reheating and inflationary-model parameter space considering\n$R+R^2$ inflation and a broad class of $\\alpha$-attractor and D-brane models.\nThese inflationary models completely cover the $n_s$-$r$ parameter space\nallowed by Planck and BICEP/Keck data and represent good targets for future CMB\nand large-scale structure experiments. We perform a Bayesian model comparison\nof inflationary models, taking into account the reheating uncertainties.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2dwaquNAoKFmeK134GBzYpTVHbXNVI5lkyHzm_-RflU","pdfSize":"2494471"}
