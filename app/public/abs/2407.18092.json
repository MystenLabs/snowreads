In our model we assume that the\nvotes are fixed and known and the proposers want to set as high project prices\nas possible, provided that their projects get selected and the prices are not\nbelow the minimum costs of their delivery. We study the existence of pure Nash\nequilibria (NE) in such games, focusing on the AV/Cost, Phragm\\'en, and Method\nof Equal Shares rules. Furthermore, we report an experimental study of\nstrategic cost selection on real-life PB election data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
