However, existing sources based on bulk\ncrystals are limited in brightness due to the short interaction length and only\nallow for limited dispersion engineering. Here, we present an integrated PDC\nsource based on a Ti:LiNbO$_3$ waveguide that generates broadband bi-photons\nwith central wavelengths at $860\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $2800\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Their\nspectral bandwidth exceeds $25\\,\\mathrm{THz}$ and is achieved by simultaneous\nmatching of the group velocities and cancellation of group velocity dispersion\nfor the signal and idler field. We provide an intuitive understanding of the\nprocess by studying our source's behaviour at different temperatures and pump\nwavelengths, which agrees well with simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
