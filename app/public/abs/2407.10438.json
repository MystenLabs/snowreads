While extensively\nstudied in bulk materials, AMR effects in these materials are typically weak.\nRecent advancements indicate that two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnetic\nmaterials possess unique magnetic properties, potentially including significant\nAMR characteristics. In this study, we utilize density functional theory and\nthe Boltzmann transport equation to investigate AMR in magnetic monolayers\nCrPX3 (X = S, Se, Te). Our findings reveal a substantially large AMR in these\n2D magnetic compounds. This enhancement is attributed to magnetization\n(M)-dependent spin-orbit coupling (SOC), arising from the broken symmetry\nbetween in-plane and out-of-plane orientations. This results in significant\nM-dependent band splitting and subsequent variations in electron velocity.\nAdditionally, we find that the M-dependent SOC is significantly enhanced by\nincreasing the atomic number of the chalcogen X in CrPX3, achieving an\nexceptional 150% AMR in CrPTe3. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that AMR\ncan be effectively modulated by applying biaxial strain, resulting in a twofold\nincrease with a 4% strain. These findings propose a novel approach to enhancing\n2D-based AMR spintronic devices, making a substantial contribution to the\nfield.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
