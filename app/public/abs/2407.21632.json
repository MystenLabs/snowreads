For symbolic regression problems, variants that use an\nepsilon-threshold or batches of training cases, among others, have led to\nperformance improvements. Lately, especially variants that combine lexicase\nselection and down-sampling strategies have received a lot of attention. This\npaper evaluates random as well as informed down-sampling in combination with\nthe relevant lexicase-based selection methods on a wide range of symbolic\nregression problems. In contrast to most work, we not only compare the methods\nover a given evaluation budget, but also over a given time as time is usually\nlimited in practice. We find that for a given evaluation budget,\nepsilon-lexicase selection in combination with random or informed down-sampling\noutperforms all other methods. Only for a rather long running time of 24h, the\nbest performing method is tournament selection in combination with informed\ndown-sampling. If the given running time is very short, lexicase variants using\nbatches of training cases perform best.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
