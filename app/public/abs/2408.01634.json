In the low\ntransverse momentum ($p_T$) region $p_T/A < 1.5$ GeV/$c$, where $A$ is the mass\nnumber of a nucleus, the in-jet coalescence factor $B_2^\\text{In-jet}$ for\ndeuteron production, given by the ratio of the in-jet deuteron number to the\nsquare of the in-jet proton number, is found to be larger than the coalescence\nfactor $B_2$ in the medium perpendicular to the jet by a factor of about 10 in\n$pp$ collisions and of 25 in $p-$Pb collisions, which are consistent with the\nALICE measurements at the LHC. Such large low-momentum enhancements mainly come\nfrom coalescence of nucleons inside the jet with the medium nucleons.\nCoalescence of nucleons inside the jet dominates deuteron production only at\nthe higher $p_T$ region of $p_T/A\\gtrsim 4$ GeV/$c$, where both the yield ratio\n$d/p$ of deuteron to proton numbers and the $B_2$ are also significantly larger\nin the jet direction than in the direction perpendicular to the jet due to the\nstrong collinear correlation among particles produced from jet fragmentation.\nStudying jet-associated deuteron production in relativistic nuclear collisions\nthus opens up a new window to probe the phase-space structure of nucleons\ninside jets.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7j7x-tIDMXiMQq9uuIUAotXztHSG8AUvIF1b1im8lr4","pdfSize":"1217999"}
