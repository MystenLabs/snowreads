However, existing CTDG models encounter challenges\nstemming from noise and limited historical data. Graph Data Augmentation (GDA)\nemerges as a critical solution, yet current approaches primarily focus on\nstatic graphs and struggle to effectively address the dynamics inherent in\nCTDGs. Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for\nparameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To\naddress these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA\nmethod tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture,\nincorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion\nmodel, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target\nnodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via\npre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target\nnodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate\nConda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to\noptimize performance. Extensive experimentation across six widely used\nreal-world datasets showcases the consistent performance improvement of our\napproach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
