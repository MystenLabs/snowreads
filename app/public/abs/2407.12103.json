In the long time limit, we show that such\ncorrelation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the\ncorrelations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the\nspectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate\nenergy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which\nhighlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this\nbehavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the\nEigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization\nin the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in\na more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature.\nImportantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show\nself-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the\ntime average does not coincide with the ensemble average.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
