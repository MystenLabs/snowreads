The hot ionic component is described within the framework of the\nkinetic theory, since the Larmor radius of the injected ions appears to be\ncomparable to or even larger than the characteristic scale of the magnetic\nfield inhomogeneity. The electron drag of the hot ions is taken into account,\nwhile the angular scattering due to ion-ion collisions is neglected. The\nbackground warm plasma, on the contrary, is considered to be in local thermal\nequilibrium, i.e. has a Maxwellian distribution function and is described in\nterms of magnetohydrodynamics. The density of the hot ions is assumed to be\nnegligible compared to that of the warm plasma. Both the conventional\ngas-dynamic loss and the non-adiabatic loss specific to the diamagnetic\nconfinement mode are taken into account. In this work, we do not consider the\neffects of the warm plasma rotation as well as the inhomogeneity of the\nelectrostatic potential. A self-consistent theoretical model of the plasma\nequilibrium is constructed. In the case of the cylindrical bubble, this model\nis reduced to a simpler one. The numerical solutions in the limit of a thin\ntransition layer of the diamagnetic bubble are found. Examples of the\nequilibria corresponding to the GDMT device are considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
