In this paper, we construct the\nelectromagnetic helicity flux operators which form a non-Abelian group in\ngeneral dimensions, among which the minimal helicity flux operators form the\nmassless representation of the little group, a finite spin unitary irreducible\nrepresentation of the Poincar\\'e group. As in four dimensions, they generate an\nextended angle-dependent transformation on the Carrollian manifold.\nInterestingly, there is no known corresponding bulk duality transformation in\ngeneral dimensions. However, we can construct a topological Chern-Simons term\nthat evaluates the minimal helicity flux operators at $\\mathcal{I}^+$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
