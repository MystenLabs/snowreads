The\noriginal initial conditions problem is transformed into a boundary value\nproblem. The boundary value problem is then solved and transformed back to the\ninitial conditions one. Subsequently, a general method for obtaining numerical\nmethods using an arbitrary number of linearly independent approximating\nfunctions is outlined.\n  This is part one of a series of three papers, in the second of which a\nnumerical method is obtained, using Bernstein polynomials of arbitrarily high\norder. The numerical evidence for the convergence of the method will be\npresented in the third part paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1ipGEXkk-T694VbM-3Bow035C6AU5GxudgHBo12X0W8","pdfSize":"344147"}
