The\nlifetime of the resulting shock waves plays an important role in determining\nthe intensity of the generated GWs. We have simulated decaying primordial\nacoustic turbulence in three dimensions and make a prediction for the universal\nshape of the energy spectrum by using its self-similar decay properties and the\nshape of individual shock waves. The shape for the spectrum is used to\ndetermine the time dependence of the fluid kinetic energy and the energy\ncontaining length scale at late times. The inertial range power law is found to\nbe close to the classically predicted $k^{-2}$ and approaches it with\nincreasing Reynolds number. The resulting model for the velocity spectrum and\nits decay in time is combined with the sound shell model assumptions about the\ncorrelations of the velocity field to compute the GW power spectrum for flows\nthat decay in less than the Hubble time. The decay is found to bring about a\nconvergence in the spectral amplitude and the peak power law that leads to a\npower law shallower than the $k^9$ of the stationary case.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
