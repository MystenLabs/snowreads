Bridging the gap between the science and telescope\ndomains is the key responsibility of OSO, requiring considerations of\nusability, performance, availability and accessibility, amongst others. This\npaper describes the state of the observatory software as we approach\nconstruction milestones, how the applications meet these requirements using a\nmodern technology architecture, and challenges so far.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YUTvuJ_IdKRZJ93fRxBYaco-u1-iOAWmDPtLw5jEm4Q","pdfSize":"1028962"}
