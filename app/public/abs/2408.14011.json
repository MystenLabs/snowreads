By using the volume of\nconcurrence regular polygonal pyramid we first derive the GME measure of\nfour-partite quantum systems. From our measure it is verified that the GHZ\nstate is more entangled than the W state. Then we study the GME measure for\nmultipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. A well defined GME measure\nis constructed based on the volume of the concurrence regular polygonal\npyramid. Detailed example shows that our measure can characterize better the\ngenuine multipartite entanglements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
