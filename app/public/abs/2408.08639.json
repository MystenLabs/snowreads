This inherent complexity\nlimits our ability to characterise quantum many-body systems, highlighting the\nneed for innovative approaches to unlock their full potential. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel method to solve the Hamiltonian Learning (HL)\nproblem-inferring quantum dynamics from many-body state trajectories-using\nNeural Differential Equations combined with an Ansatz Hamiltonian. Our method\nis reliably convergent, experimentally friendly, and interpretable, making it a\nstable solution for HL on a set of Hamiltonians previously unlearnable in the\nliterature. In addition to this, we propose a new quantitative benchmark based\non power laws, which can objectively compare the reliability and generalisation\ncapabilities of any two HL algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our method against\nstate-of-the-art HL algorithms with a 1D spin-1/2 chain proof of concept.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
