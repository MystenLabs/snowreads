Studying the prototypical\ncase when $\\Gamma=\\mathbb{Z}_p^d$ is a power of a cyclic group of prime order,\nLetzter and Morrison recently showed that $n(\\mathbb{Z}_p^d) \\le O(pd(\\log\nd)^2)$ and that $n(\\mathbb{Z}_2^d)\\le O(d \\log d)$. They then posed the problem\nof proving an (asymptotically optimal) upper bound of $n(\\mathbb{Z}_p^d)\\le\nO(pd)$ for all primes $p$ and $d \\in \\mathbb{N}$. In this paper, we solve this\nproblem for $p=2$ and improve their bound for all primes $p \\ge 3$ by proving\n$n(\\mathbb{Z}_2^d)\\le 5d$ and $n(\\mathbb{Z}_p^d)\\le O(pd\\log d)$. While the\nfirst bound determines $n(\\mathbb{Z}_2^d)$ up to a multiplicative error of $5$,\nthe second bound is tight up to a $\\log d$ factor. Moreover, our result shows\nthat a tight bound of $n(\\mathbb{Z}_p^d)=\\Theta(pd)$ for arbitrary $p$ and $d$\nwould follow from a (strong form) of the well-known conjecture of Jaeger,\nLinial, Payan and Tarsi on additive bases in $\\mathbb{Z}_p^d$.\n  Along the way to proving these results, we establish a generalization of a\nhypergraph matching result by Haxell in a matroidal setting. Concretely, we\nobtain sufficient conditions for the existence of matchings in a hypergraph\nwhose hyperedges are labelled by the elements of a matroid, with the property\nthat the edges in the matching induce a basis of the matroid. We believe that\nthese statements are of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
