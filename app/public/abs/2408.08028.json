Unlike local probability density methods, this\nwork adopts a global integral perspective by regarding a control volume as the\nsample space. Doing so enables the divergence theorem to be used to expose\ncontributions made by uncertain or stochastic boundary fluxes and internal\ncross-gradient mixing in the equation governing the joint probability\ndistribution's evolution. Advection and diffusion across the control volume's\nboundary result in source and drift terms, respectively, whereas internal\nmixing, in general, corresponds to the sign-indefinite diffusion of probability\ndensity. Several typical circumstances for which the corresponding diffusion\ncoefficient is negative semidefinite are identified and discussed in detail.\nThe global joint probability perspective is the natural setting for available\npotential energy and the incorporation of uncertainty into bulk, volume\nintegrated, models of transport and mixing. Finer-grained information in space\ncan be readily obtained by treating coordinate functions as observables. By\nextension, the framework can be applied to networks of interacting control\nvolumes of arbitrary size.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
