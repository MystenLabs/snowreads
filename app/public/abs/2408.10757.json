The verification of this certification needs to be done\nlocally without the knowledge of the whole graph. More precisely, a distributed\nalgorithm, called a verifier, is executed on each vertex. The verifier observes\nthe local neighborhood up to a constant distance and either accepts or rejects.\nWe examine the trade-off between the visibility radius and the size of\ncertificates. We describe a procedure that decreases the radius by encoding the\nneighbourhood of each vertex into its certificate. We also provide a\ncorresponding lower bound on the required certificate size increase, showing\nthat such an approach is close to optimal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
