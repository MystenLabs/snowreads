Results align\nexcellently with experimental absolute binding energies and profiles. The\nspectrum of ethane serves as a ``spectral seed'', with each longer alkane's\natom-specific spectrum displaying similar characteristics, albeit with shifts\nand slight intensity adjustments. Detailed assignments clarify the distinct\nspectra in short alkanes ($n$=1--4) and their stabilization in long alkanes\n($n$=5--8). Carbons are classified as central or distal (C$_1$ and C$_2$), with\ncentral carbons contributing nearly identically to the lowest-energy feature A,\nwhile distal carbons contribute to the second lowest-energy feature B (both are\n0-0 transitions). Increasing molecule size adds more central carbons, enhancing\nfeature A and weakening feature B. Our analysis identifies two dominant\nFranck-Condon-active vibrations: C$^*$--H stretching ($\\sim$3400-3500\ncm$^{-1}$) and bending ($\\sim$1400-1500 cm$^{-1}$) modes. Structural analysis\nshows that core ionization minimally affects alkane geometry, less than in ring\ncompounds from previous studies. This work extends our protocol from rigid ring\ncompounds to flexible molecules, contributing to building a high-resolution\ntheoretical XPS library and enhancing the understanding of vibronic coupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oSxPbwrAAwpVNbmYML2MHCCb2g6j9LRuDJ7m2CdLB24","pdfSize":"2171794"}
