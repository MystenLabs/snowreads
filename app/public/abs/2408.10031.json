One\nof the key properties for a good training set is the balancing among the\nclasses. When the input distribution is heavily imbalanced in the number of\ninstances, the learning process could be hindered or difficult to carry on. To\nthis end, we propose a Dynamic Label Injection (DLI) algorithm to impose a\nuniform distribution in the input batch. Our algorithm computes the current\nbatch defect distribution and re-balances it by transferring defects using a\ncombination of Poisson-based seamless image cloning and cut-paste techniques. A\nthorough experimental section on the Magnetic Tiles dataset shows better\nresults of DLI compared to other balancing loss approaches also in the\nchallenging weakly-supervised setup.
