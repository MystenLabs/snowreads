To capture this effect, we employ a\nStackelberg game-theoretic framework, where the DSO seeks to overcome the\ninformation asymmetry and refine its incentive strategies by learning from DERA\nbehavior over multiple iterations. We introduce a model-based online learning\nalgorithm for the DSO, aimed at inferring the relationship between incentives\nand DERA responses. Given the uncertain nature of these responses, we also\npropose a distributionally robust incentive design model to control the\nprobability of voltage regulation failure and then reformulate it into a convex\nproblem. This model allows the DSO to periodically revise distribution\nassumptions on uncertain parameters in the decision model of the DERA. Finally,\nwe present a gradient-based method that permits the DSO to adaptively modify\nits conservativeness level, measured by the size of a Wasserstein metric-based\nambiguity set, according to historical voltage regulation performance. The\neffectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated through numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
