Specifically, we focus on the Gaussian case,\nwhich can be reformulated as a well-studied problem: recovering a semi-labeled\ntree from a distance metric. We introduce randomized procedures that achieve\nquery complexity of optimal order. Additionally, we provide statistical\nanalysis for scenarios where the tree distances are noisy. The Gaussian setting\ncan be extended to other situations, including the binary case and\nnon-paranormal distributions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
