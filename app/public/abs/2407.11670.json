In the first stage, the algorithm\nreceives the value of $m$ and the processing times of $n$ jobs; it has to\npartition the jobs into $b$ groups called bags. In the second stage, the\nmachine speeds are revealed and the bags are assigned to the machines, i.e.,\nthe algorithm produces a schedule where all the jobs in the same bag are\nassigned to the same machine. The objective is to minimize the makespan (the\nlength of the schedule). The algorithm is compared to the optimal schedule and\nit is called $\\rho$-robust, if its makespan is always at most $\\rho$ times the\noptimal one.\n  Our main result is an improved bound for equal-size jobs for $b=m$. We give\nan upper bound of $1.6$. This improves previous bound of $1.8$ and it is almost\ntight in the light of previous lower bound of $1.58$. Second, for\ninfinitesimally small jobs, we give tight upper and lower bounds for the case\nwhen $b\\geq m$. This generalizes and simplifies the previous bounds for $b=m$.\nFinally, we introduce a new special case with relatively small jobs for which\nwe give an algorithm whose robustness is close to that of infinitesimal jobs\nand thus gives better than $2$-robust for a large class of inputs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
