Effective closed-loop control of tethered\nmagnetic devices contributes to the achievement of autonomous vascular robotic\nsurgery. In this article, we employ a magnetic actuation system equipped with a\nsingle rotatable permanent magnet to achieve closed-loop deflection control of\nthe MSCR. To this end, we establish a differential kinematic model of MSCRs\nexposed to non-uniform magnetic fields. The relationship between the existence\nand uniqueness of Jacobian and the geometric position between robots is\ndeduced. The control direction induced by Jacobian is demonstrated to be\ncrucial in simulations. Then, the corresponding quasi-static control (QSC)\nframework integrates a linear extended state observer to estimate model\nuncertainties. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed QSC framework is\nvalidated through comparative trajectory tracking experiments with the PD\ncontroller under external disturbances. Further extensions are made for the\nJacobian to path-following control at the distal end position. The proposed\ncontrol framework prevents the actuator from reaching the joint limit and\nachieves fast and low error-tracking performance without overshooting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
