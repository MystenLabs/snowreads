Previous studies of cavitation bubble dynamics mainly consider\nbubbles in stagnant-water tubes, but the dynamics of cavitation bubbles in\ntubes with flow is not clear. This study investigates the dynamics of\ncavitation bubbles in tubes with flow by numerical simulations. The results\nshow that, unlike bubbles in stagnant-water tubes, bubbles under the combined\neffects of water inflow and tube wall confinement exhibit asymmetric behavior\nalong the axis of the tube. The inflow suppresses the development of the bubble\ninterface near the tube inlet, causing that side of the interface to move with\nthe inflow. In contrast, the expansion and contraction of the bubble and the\ngeneration of liquid jets occur on the side near the outlet. This feature\nresults in significant asymmetry in the bubble interface, therefore we\nintroduce a skewness parameter to characterize the difference in length between\nthe left and right parts of the bubble during the bubble evolution. The\nevolution of the bubble significantly affects the mass flow rate at the outlet\nof the tube, and even leads to backflow during the bubble contraction process.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
