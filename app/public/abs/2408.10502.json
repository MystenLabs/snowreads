We obtain asymptotic\nexpressions for the Bhattacharyya bound on misclassification error\nprobabilities for heavy-tailed renewal processes.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
