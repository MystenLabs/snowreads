Using bibliometric methods, this study detected patterns suggesting a\nreliance on unconventional authorship practices, such as gift, honorary, and\nsold authorship, to inflate publication metrics. The study underscores the need\nfor reforms by universities, policymakers, funding agencies, ranking agencies,\naccreditation bodies, scholarly publishers, and researchers to maintain\nacademic integrity and ensure the reliability of global ranking systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
