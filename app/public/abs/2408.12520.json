The proofs are based on the quantum trace maps, embeddings of\n(reduced) stated SL($n$)-skein algebras into quantum tori appearing in higher\nTeichm\\\"uller theory. Thanks to the Unicity theorem in [BG02, FKBL19], we can\nunderstand the representation theory of (reduced) stated SL($n$)-skein\nalgebras. Moreover, the applications are beyond low-dimensional topology. For\nexample, we can access to the representation theory of unrestricted quantum\nmoduli algebras, and that of quantum higher cluster algebras potentially.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
