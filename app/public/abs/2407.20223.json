The method frames\npoint clouds as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS),\nleveraging SE(3)-equivariant features for direct feature space registration. A\nnovel RKHS distance metric is proposed, offering reliable performance amidst\nnoise, outliers, and asymmetrical data. An unsupervised training approach is\nintroduced to effectively handle limited ground truth data, facilitating\nadaptation to real datasets. The proposed method outperforms classical and\nsupervised methods in terms of registration accuracy on both synthetic\n(ModelNet40) and real-world (ETH3D) noisy, outlier-rich datasets. To our best\nknowledge, this marks the first instance of successful real RGB-D odometry data\nregistration using an equivariant method.
