This study explores a user-friendly graphical\ninterface enabling the drawing of masked regions for inpainting by an Hourglass\nDiffusion Transformer (HDiT) model trained on MIDI piano roll images. To\nenhance note generation in specified areas, masked regions can be \"repainted\"\nwith extra noise. The non-latent HDiTs linear scaling with pixel count allows\nefficient generation in pixel space, providing intuitive and interpretable\ncontrols such as masking throughout the network and removing the need to\noperate in compressed latent spaces such as those provided by pretrained\nautoencoders. We demonstrate that, in addition to inpainting of melodies,\naccompaniment, and continuations, the use of repainting can help increase note\ndensity yielding musical structures closely matching user specifications such\nas rising, falling, or diverging melody and/or accompaniment, even when these\nlie outside the typical training data distribution. We achieve performance on\npar with prior results while operating at longer context windows, with no\nautoencoder, and can enable complex geometries for inpainting masks, increasing\nthe options for machine-assisted composers to control the generated music.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-sfpWHm2xk2RVRV5llg6je6YxkmG7h_6gWR9zDgTMzE","pdfSize":"987493","objectId":"0x91cb9f5d547ff646786f692f746cea003030eb113bf4565870e027c052c2265e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
