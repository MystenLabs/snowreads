In\nthis paper we consider the concentration of the space itself, namely the\nconcentration of the metric $d(x,y)$ for a fixed $y\\in \\Omega$. For any $y\\in\n\\Omega$, the concentration of $d(x,y)$ is guaranteed for product distributions\nin high dimensions $n$, as $d(x,y)$ is a Lipschitz function in $x$. In fact, in\nthe product setting, the rate at which the metric concentrates is of the same\norder in $n$ for any fixed $y\\in \\Omega$. The same thing, however, cannot be\nsaid for certain dependent (non-product) distributions. For the Boolean cube\n$I_n$ (a widely analyzed simple model), we show that, for any dependent\ndistribution, the rate of concentration of the Hamming distance $d_H(x,y)$, for\na fixed $y$, depends on the choice of $y\\in I_n$, and on the variance of the\nconditional distributions $\\mu(x_k \\mid x_1,\\dots, x_{k-1})$, $2\\leq k\\leq n$.\nWe give an inductive bound which holds for all probability distributions on the\nBoolean cube, and characterize the quality of concentration by a certain\npositive (negative) correlation condition. Our method of proof is advantageous\nin that it is both simple and comprehensive. We consider uniform bounding\ntechniques when the variance of the conditional distributions is negligible,\nand show how this basic technique applies to the concentration of the entire\nclass of Lipschitz functions on the Boolean cube.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N0q9dX6OSyk-gyKCx2HrkPxTCjPB6tuXEgSyzlFPVs0","pdfSize":"226771","txDigest":"7dS9FXDB5sqqV7UqxNQN5WLU1FTecLUjo8tKNUmyyp46","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
