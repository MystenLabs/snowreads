Our approach builds on the\noptimization of sprite parameters to fit the raster video. For efficiency, we\nassume static textures for sprites to reduce the search space while preventing\nartifacts using a texture prior model. To further speed up the optimization, we\nintroduce the initialization of the sprite parameters utilizing a pre-trained\nvideo object segmentation model and user input of single frame annotations. For\nour study, we construct the Crello Animation dataset from an online design\nservice and define quantitative metrics to measure the quality of the extracted\nsprites. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms baselines\nfor similar decomposition tasks in terms of the quality/efficiency tradeoff.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
