This paper answers this open question affirmatively. Actually, our\napproach shows that the result holds for domains that are sets of finite\nperimeter with a uniform upper bound on the density, and it also allows for\nslit discontinuities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
