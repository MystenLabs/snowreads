We check whether the correlation functions\nand bound state formation rate satisfy the sum rule which follows from the\ncompleteness of quantum states. The sum rule is not satisfied but it is close\nto it, suggesting that the inferred scattering parameters, which determine the\ncorrelation functions, are not fully consistent with the potential responsible\nfor the bound state existence.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
