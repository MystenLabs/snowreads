This transformation has given rise to\ncybersecurity concerns, among which data poisoning attack emerges as a new\nthreat as ITS increasingly relies on data. In data poisoning attacks, attackers\ninject malicious perturbations into datasets, potentially leading to inaccurate\nresults in offline learning and real-time decision-making processes. This paper\nconcentrates on data poisoning attack models against ITS. We identify the main\nITS data sources vulnerable to poisoning attacks and application scenarios that\nenable staging such attacks. A general framework is developed following\nrigorous study process from cybersecurity but also considering specific ITS\napplication needs. Data poisoning attacks against ITS are reviewed and\ncategorized following the framework. We then discuss the current limitations of\nthese attack models and the future research directions. Our work can serve as a\nguideline to better understand the threat of data poisoning attacks against ITS\napplications, while also giving a perspective on the future development of\ntrustworthy ITS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QKfVFKf80j79MPlP8htWVl0K3u7WyiMJiMH5TQyKNM4","pdfSize":"1361978"}
