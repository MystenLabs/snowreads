The\ndetermination of an optimal path length requires a predefined step size, while\nthe ideal step size must account for errors along the selected path. Ensuring\nreversibility further complicates this tuning problem. In this paper, we\npresent a method for locally adapting the step size in NUTS that is an instance\nof the Gibbs self-tuning (GIST) framework. Our approach guarantees\nreversibility with an acceptance probability that depends exclusively on the\nconditional distribution of the step size. We validate our step-size-adaptive\nNUTS method on Neal's funnel density and a high-dimensional normal\ndistribution, demonstrating its effectiveness in challenging scenarios.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
