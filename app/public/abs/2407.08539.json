The principles of their equilibria are explained and illustrated,\nand contrasted with solitons. A literature review mostly prior to 2016\nhighlights the key historical developments of the field. Progress since,\nespecially in hole acceleration, stability, and multi-dimensional effects, is\nsummarized in more detail.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Geophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
