The result is a unifying\nframework for modeling and analyzing multi-agent, knowledge-based, dynamic\nsystems. On the modeling side, we propose a process algebraic, agent-oriented\nspecification language that makes such a framework easy to use for practical\npurposes. On the verification side, we define a modal logic encompassing\ntemporal and epistemic operators.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
