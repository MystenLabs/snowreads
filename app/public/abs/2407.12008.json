Focusing on realizing a\nfunctional RISC-V cloud ecosystem, the Vitamin-V European project developed an\nOpenStack cluster utilizing genuine hardware. In this poster, we detail the\nefforts done in porting and setting up the cluster and the many software\nservices required by OpenStack to properly run on real hardware. In this\nposter, we detail our efforts on building an minimal viable prototype OpenStack\ncluster using real hardware. The cluster is almost functional, and we expect it\nto be complete in the next few months.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
