For this purpose,\nwe use 350 galaxy clusters selected from the 2500 $\\rm{deg^2}$ SPT-SZ survey.\nWe model the dark matter distribution using the NFW profile for the main halo\nalong with the Einasto profile for the substructure. The largest signal is seen\nfor the cluster SPT-CL J2021-5257 with a significance of around $3\\sigma$. The\nbest-fit dark matter mass and annihilation cross-section for this cluster are\nequal to $(64.0 \\pm 11.8)$ GeV and $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle= (6.0 \\pm 0.6)\n\\times 10^{-25} \\rm{cm^3 s^{-1}}$ for the $\\bar{b} b$ annihilation channel.\nHowever, this central estimate is in conflict with the limits on annihilation\ncross-section from dwarf spheroidal galaxies and hence cannot be attributed to\ndark matter annihilation. Three other clusters show significance between\n$2-2.5\\sigma$, whereas all the remaining clusters show null results. The most\nstringent 95\\% c.l. upper limit, which we obtain among the clusters with\nsignificance $>2\\sigma$ is from SPT-CL J2300-5331, given by $\\langle \\sigma v\n\\rangle = 9 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{cm}^3 \\text{s}^{-1}$ for a dark matter mass\nof 10 GeV corresponding to the $b\\bar{b}$ annihilation channel.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yjUqQjcAnaDQSYVYYecGxiYA-uDvr4kDnydHfo0GnPo","pdfSize":"866832"}
