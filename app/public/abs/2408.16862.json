For example,\nswitching and decomposed models describe complex systems using latent variables\nthat evolve according to simple locally linear dynamics. However, existing\nmethods for latent variable estimation are not robust to dynamical noise and\nsystem nonlinearity due to noise-sensitive inference procedures and limited\nmodel formulations. This can lead to inconsistent results on signals with\nsimilar dynamics, limiting the model's ability to provide scientific insight.\nIn this work, we address these limitations and propose a probabilistic approach\nto latent variable estimation in decomposed models that improves robustness\nagainst dynamical noise. Additionally, we introduce an extended latent dynamics\nmodel to improve robustness against system nonlinearities. We evaluate our\napproach on several synthetic dynamical systems, including an\nempirically-derived brain-computer interface experiment, and demonstrate more\naccurate latent variable inference in nonlinear systems with diverse noise\nconditions. Furthermore, we apply our method to a real-world clinical\nneurophysiology dataset, illustrating the ability to identify interpretable and\ncoherent structure where previous models cannot.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6d5YpBI831-kOy2MhkHb0bfJ0XhrddZA2TIl8GJ8jp8","pdfSize":"4643901"}
