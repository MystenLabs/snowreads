This result was proved independently by Z. Gao and S.-W. Zhang\n(arXiv:2407.01304) by different methods. In genus 3 we show that the\nGreen--Griffiths invariant of this normal function is a Teichmuller modular\nform of weight (4,0,-1) and use this to show that the rank of the Ceresa normal\nfunction is exactly 1 along the hyperelliptic locus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
