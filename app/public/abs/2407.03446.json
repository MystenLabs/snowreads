This paper consists of a\ntheoretical exploration of the integration of computational power and\nmathematical frameworks, particularly through Topological Data Analysis (TDA)\n(Carlsson, Vejdemo-Johansson, 2022) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), to\nforecast societal trends through social media data analysis. By examining\nsocial media as a reflective surface of collective human behavior through the\nsystematic behaviorist approach (Glenn, et al., 2016), I argue that these tools\nprovide unprecedented clarity into the dynamics of large communities. This\nstudy dialogues with Asimov's work, drawing parallels between his visionary\nconcepts and contemporary methodologies, illustrating how modern computational\ntechniques can uncover patterns and predict shifts in social behavior,\ncontributing to the emerging field of digital sociology -- or even,\nPsychohistory itself.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
