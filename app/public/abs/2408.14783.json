The constraints are associated\nwith the coadjoint orbits of the dual groups, respectively identified as\n$O(p,M-p)$, $U(p, M-p)$ and $Sp(p, M-p)$. These actions are presented in a\nuniversal form by making use of the twistor variables taking value in $\\mathbb\nR$, $\\mathbb C$ and $\\mathbb H$, respectively. We find that the massless,\nmassive and the conformal particles (namely the singletons) of any spins appear\nfor the compact dual groups with $p=0$ reproducing many of the results in\nearlier literature, whereas more exotic particle species, such as various\ntachyons, continuous spin particles and BdS particles appear for the\nnon-compact dual groups.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
