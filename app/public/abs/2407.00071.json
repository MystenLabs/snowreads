Yet the performance of LLMs at\nreasoning tasks have been subpar and the reasoning capability of LLMs is a\nmatter of significant debate. While it has been shown that the choice of the\nprompting technique to the LLM can alter its performance on a multitude of\ntasks, including reasoning, the best performing techniques require human-made\nprompts with the knowledge of the tasks at hand. We introduce a framework for\nwhat we call Combinatorial Reasoning (CR), a fully-automated prompting method,\nwhere reasons are sampled from an LLM pipeline and mapped into a Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. The framework investigates\nwhether QUBO solutions can be profitably used to select a useful subset of the\nreasons to construct a Chain-of-Thought style prompt. We explore the\nacceleration of CR with specialized solvers. We also investigate the\nperformance of simpler zero-shot strategies such as linear majority rule or\nrandom selection of reasons. Our preliminary study indicates that coupling a\ncombinatorial solver to generative AI pipelines is an interesting avenue for AI\nreasoning and elucidates design principles for future CR methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
