[JHEP03(2024)148] proposed a new experiment called\nSHiNESS at the upcoming European Spallation Source (ESS) facility, making use\nof the 2-GeV proton beam there impinging on a fixed target, in order to search\nfor hidden sterile neutrinos that could lie in different mass ranges and arise\nwith distinct signatures. Such signatures include excesses in electron-positron\npairs that may originate from displaced decays of long-lived particles (LLPs).\nAt the ESS, the dominant sources of such LLPs are decays at rest of $\\pi^+$\nmesons and $\\mu^+$ leptons. We choose to investigate theoretical scenarios of\nlong-lived light binos in the R-parity-violating supersymmetry and long-lived\nweak-violating electrophilic axionlike particles, as these LLPs can be produced\nfrom decays of $\\pi^+$ and $\\mu^+$. Since the $\\pi^+$'s and $\\mu^+$'s decay at\nrest at the ESS, we compute the spectra of the therefrom produced LLPs, and\nthus estimate the expected sensitivity reach of SHiNESS to the LLPs in these\ntwo scenarios. Our calculation shows that in most of the relevant benchmark\nscenarios, SHiNESS can probe large parameter regions of these models beyond the\nexisting bounds, in just a couple of years of data-collection time.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wPRKWKRWSKTWUflgEb98kD9ja80Jaq-ZUXqeaBnCzjQ","pdfSize":"1225255"}
