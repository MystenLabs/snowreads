The signature transform, a Cartan type\ndevelopment, translates paths into high-dimensional feature vectors, capturing\ntheir intrinsic characteristics. Under natural conditions, the expectation of\nthe signature determines the law of the signature, providing a statistical\nsummary of the data distribution. This property facilitates robust modeling and\ninference in machine learning and stochastic processes. Building on previous\nwork by the present authors [Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus\nexpansions, FoM Sigma '22] we here revisit the actual computation of expected\nsignatures, in a general semimartingale setting. Several new formulae are\ngiven. A log-transform of (expected) signatures leads to log-signatures\n(signature cumulants), offering a significant reduction in complexity.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pf7UYjUKzVpo6Y-1a_nXOYrQHTnusIArv0ViulRpS38","pdfSize":"884078"}
