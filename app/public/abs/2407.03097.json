As a corollary, we prove the\nsame existence for \\'etale morphisms on quasi-projective varieties and any\npoints on it. We apply the proof of this fact to dynamical Lang-Siegel problem.\nNamely, we prove that local height function associated with zero-dimensional\nsubscheme grows slowly along orbits of a rational map under reasonable\nassumption. Also if local height function associated with any proper closed\nsubscheme grows fast on a subset of an orbit of a self-morphism, we prove that\nsuch subset has Banach density zero under some assumptions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
