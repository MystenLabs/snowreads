A significant generalization of the convolution theorem that\nestablishes the equivalence between the fading memory property and the\navailability of convolution representations of linear filters is proved. This\nresult extends a previous such characterization to a complete array of weighted\nnorms in the definition of the fading memory property. Additionally, the main\ntheorem shows that the availability of convolution representations can be\ncharacterized, at least when the codomain is finite-dimensional, not only by\nthe fading memory property but also by the reunion of two purely topological\nnotions that are called minimal continuity and minimal fading memory property.\nFinally, when the input space and the codomain of a linear functional are\nHilbert spaces, it is shown that minimal continuity and the minimal fading\nmemory property guarantee the existence of interesting embeddings of the\nassociated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and approximation results of\nsolutions of kernel regressions in the presence of finite data sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ok4IgvT-UKfQkkx1s0WNcjFbqwazvqktMOGKzhBi0g8","pdfSize":"352397"}
