Under the assumption that a part of the interface between two\nmedia with different constant conductivities is of class $C^2$ in a\nneighborhood of a point $x$ on it, we extract the mean curvature of the\ninterface at $x$ from the initial behavior of temperature at $x$. This result\nis purely local in space. As a corollary, when the whole Euclidean space\nconsists of two media globally with different constant conductivities, it is\nshown that if a connected component $\\Gamma$ of the interface is of class $C^2$\nand is stationary isothermic, then the mean curvature of $\\Gamma$ must be\nconstant. Moreover, we apply this result to some overdetermined problems for\ntwo-phase heat conductors and obtain some symmetry theorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
