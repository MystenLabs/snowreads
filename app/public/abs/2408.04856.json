However,\ndeploying eBPF programs across a heterogeneous cloud environment presents\nchallenges, including compatibility issues across different kernel versions,\noperating systems, runtimes, and architectures. Traditional deployment methods,\nsuch as standalone containers or tightly integrated core applications, are\ncumbersome and inefficient, particularly when dynamic plugin management is\nrequired. To address these challenges, we introduce Wasm-bpf, a lightweight\nruntime on WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI). Leveraging\nWasm platform independence and WASI standardized system interface, with\nenhanced relocation for different architectures, Wasm-bpf ensures\ncross-platform compatibility for eBPF programs. It simplifies deployment by\nintegrating with container toolchains, allowing eBPF programs to be packaged as\nWasm modules that can be easily managed within cloud environments.\nAdditionally, Wasm-bpf supports dynamic plugin management in WebAssembly. Our\nimplementation and evaluation demonstrate that Wasm-bpf introduces minimal\noverhead compared to native eBPF implementations while simplifying the\ndeployment process.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Operating Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
