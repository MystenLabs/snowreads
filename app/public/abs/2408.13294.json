The proposed framework utilizes an\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) to provide dynamic-linear thermal model\nparameters considering building information and disturbances in real time,\nthereby facilitating the practical MPC of the AHU system. The proposed\nframework allows users to establish new setpoints for a closed-loop control\nsystem, enabling customization of the thermal environment to meet individual\nneeds with minimal use of the AHU. The experimental results demonstrate the\ncost benefits of the proposed machine-learning-based MPC-IoT framework,\nachieving a 57.59\\% reduction in electricity consumption compared with a\nclock-based manual controller while maintaining a high level of user\nsatisfaction. The proposed framework offers remarkable flexibility and\neffectiveness, even in legacy systems with limited building information, making\nit a pragmatic and valuable solution for enhancing the energy efficiency and\nuser comfort in pre-existing structures.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PILCzgv8GR-Z8-qQdFoI16nBvQ1nUwdbjtiG3p4FvnI","pdfSize":"16990348"}
