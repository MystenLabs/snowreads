To remedy this limitation, we propose a model\nof Boolean hypernetworks, which generalize standard Boolean networks. Utilizing\nthe bijection between hypernetworks and bipartite networks, we show how Boolean\nhypernetworks generalize standard Boolean networks. We derive ensembles of\nBoolean hypernetworks from standard random Boolean networks and simulate the\ndynamics of each. Our results indicate that several properties of Boolean\nnetwork dynamics are affected by the addition of multi-way interactions, and\nthat these additions can have stabilizing or destabilizing effects.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fnrN320VuXbjZ2TQh6DbtzdhNCbwJmGtMX2Rp4LZ9Qk","pdfSize":"932559"}
