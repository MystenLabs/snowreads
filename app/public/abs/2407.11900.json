With this aim\nwe study the model system of vortices in the $\\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd superconductor\nwhere correlated defects seem to play a determinant role for the nucleation of\na gel vortex phase at low densities. We directly image vortices in extended\nfields-of-view and show that the disordered vortex structure in this material\nis anti-hyperuniform, contrasting with the case of vortex structures nucleated\nin samples with point-like disorder. Based on numerical simulations, we show\nthat this anti-hyperuniform structure arises both, from the interaction of a\ndiluted vortex structure with a fourfold-symmetric correlated disorder quite\nlikely generated when cleaving the samples and from the out of equilibrium\nnature of the quenched configuration.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MUV5AtYH5KAVc8uH2cz2BVWk4E-RmzUvFI-1_hz97jU","pdfSize":"4994264","objectId":"0x4bd2d4cd2e11b3d7f84932f5cb451531ea10901b25c57898883c8bba8660d560","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
