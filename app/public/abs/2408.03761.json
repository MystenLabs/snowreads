Imitating the examination process performed by a human\nsonographer, MMSummary is designed as a three-stage pipeline, progressing from\nkeyframe detection to keyframe captioning and finally anatomy segmentation and\nmeasurement. In the keyframe detection stage, an innovative automated workflow\nis proposed to progressively select a concise set of keyframes, preserving\nsufficient video information without redundancy. Subsequently, we adapt a large\nlanguage model to generate meaningful captions for fetal ultrasound keyframes\nin the keyframe captioning stage. If a keyframe is captioned as fetal biometry,\nthe segmentation and measurement stage estimates biometric parameters by\nsegmenting the region of interest according to the textual prior. The MMSummary\nsystem provides comprehensive summaries for fetal ultrasound examinations and\nbased on reported experiments is estimated to reduce scanning time by\napproximately 31.5%, thereby suggesting the potential to enhance clinical\nworkflow efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pMeVMLsv_175hTX0ZczkV1fecR4xHiUNhMICrxFIgZM","pdfSize":"5095580"}
