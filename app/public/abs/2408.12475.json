To obtain the\ndiscriminative representations for each class, we extend a textual corpus for\neach class derived from the large language models (LLMs) and enrich the visual\nprototypes by integrating the contextual semantic information. Besides, We\nintroduce an unbalanced optimal transport strategy for feature matching that\nmitigates the impact of class-unrelated features, thereby facilitating more\neffective decision-making. Experimental results on five FSAR datasets\ndemonstrate that our method set a new benchmark, beating the second-best\ncompetitors with large margins.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
