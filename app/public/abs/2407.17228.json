Often, the data involved is not limited to clinical\ndata but also includes additional omics features (e.g. proteomics).\nConsequently, data is distributed not only across hospitals but also across\nomics centers, which are labs capable of generating such additional features\nfrom biosamples. This scenario leads to a hybrid setting where data is\nscattered both in terms of samples and features. In this hybrid setting, we\npresent an efficient reformulation of the Kernel Regularized Least Squares\nalgorithm, introduce two variants and validate them using well-established\ndatasets. Lastly, we discuss security measures to defend against possible\nattacks.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
