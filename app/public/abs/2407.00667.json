Noise amplitude has a\nrelative model. The work offers both theoretical calculations and theorems, as\nwell as experimental results. Classic machine learning problems were chosen as\nexperiments -- linear and logistic regression, computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
