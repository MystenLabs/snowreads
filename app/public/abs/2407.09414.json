The physics of charged particle beam propagation in the space\nplasma environment is discussed and the long-range (>100 A.U.) advantage of\nrelativistic electron beams is emphasized. A preliminary statite based beam\nemitter for powering probes to ~0.1c is proposed and the challenges in\nbeam-power uses are explored.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iz92CxQxXX1OEDu7PXGOe72CgsZ-Kj3UG7JJL9Y-pBM","pdfSize":"1325304"}
