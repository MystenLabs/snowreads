This is thanks to the absence of mass terms in the\npotential and the resulting logarithmic structure of the zero-temperature\neffective potential. It is known that imposing a symmetry at classical level\ndoes not prohibit breaking it by quantum corrections. In the case of scale\nsymmetry, a mass term can in principle appear through renormalisation. This is\nnot the case in the commonly used $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ or Coleman-Weinberg\nschemes. In this work, we renormalise a scale-invariant model in the on-shell\nscheme to check whether parameterising it with the physical masses will\nintroduce mass terms to the potential. We find that indeed mass terms appear\nfor an arbitrary choice of the physical masses. However, we formulate an\non-shell condition for radiative symmetry breaking, sufficient and necessary\nfor the cancellation of mass terms in the renormalised potential, yielding a\nlogarithmic potential needed for supercooled phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
