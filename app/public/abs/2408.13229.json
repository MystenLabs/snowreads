In contrast to previous methods which often assume\nsimplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger\nrolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous\nmanipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the\nobject. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling\nmethod, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables and includes\nthose in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows\nfor the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally\nadjust the contact points. Our method is tested in a peg alignment task and a\nscrewdriver turning task, where it outperforms the baselines in terms of\nachieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We\nalso successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task,\ndemonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
