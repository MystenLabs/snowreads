This completes previous work on\nfactorizations of classical groups with a solvable factor. In particular, it\nresolves the final uncertain case in the long-standing problem of determining\nexact factorizations of almost simple groups. As a byproduct of the\nclassification, we also obtain a new characterization of one-dimensional\ntransitive groups, offering further insights into their group structure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
