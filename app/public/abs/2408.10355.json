They are ideal systems to harness\nquantum transport straintronics (QTS), i.e. using mechanical strain to control\nquantum transport. Their large subband energy spacing ($\\sim$ 0.8 eV) leads to\ntransistors with a single quantum transport channel. We adapt an applied model\nto study QTS in uniaxially-strained quasi-metallic-SWCNT transistors. The\ndevice parameters are based on an existing experimental platform, with channel\nlengths of $L=$ 50 nm, diameters $d\\approx$ 1.5 nm, and strains up to\n$\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}\\approx$ 7 $\\%$. We demonstrate that the charge\ncarrier's propagation angle $\\Theta$ is fully tunable with\n$\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}$. When $\\Theta$ reaches 90$^o$, the conductance $G$\nis completely suppressed. A strain-generated band gap can be tuned up to\n$\\approx$ 400 meV. Mechanical strain adds both scalar $\\phi_{\\varepsilon}$ and\nvector $\\textbf{A}$ gauge potentials to the transistor's Hamiltonian. These\npotentials create a rich spectrum of quantum interferences in $G$, which can be\ndescribed as a mechanical Aharonov-Bohm effect. The charge carriers' quantum\nphase can be controlled by purely mechanical means. For instance, a full 2$\\pi$\nphase shift can be induced in a (12,9) tube by a 0.7 $\\%$ strain change. This\nwork opens opportunities to add quantitative quantum transport strain effects\nto the tools box of quantum technologies based on 2D materials and their\nnanotubes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XR9Gvuo25khtuo5i2US6md4FojgE_cLHWdk79WjPxQ0","pdfSize":"5930533"}
