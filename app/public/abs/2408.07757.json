SLAM\ntechnology is widely used, especially for the navigation and control of\nautonomous robots. This paper discusses various works in developing WiFi-based\nlocalization and challenges in achieving high-accuracy geometric maps. This\npaper introduces the concept of inverse k-visibility developed from the\nk-visibility algorithm to identify the free space in an unknown environment for\nplanning, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Comprehensive experiments,\nincluding those utilizing single and multiple RSSI signals, were conducted in\nboth simulated and real-world environments to demonstrate the robustness of the\nproposed algorithm. Additionally, a detailed analysis comparing the resulting\nmaps with ground-truth Lidar-based maps is provided to highlight the\nalgorithm's accuracy and reliability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
