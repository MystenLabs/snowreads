Most existing methods for entanglement detection\nrely heavily on a complete description of the quantum state, which requires\nnumerous measurements and complex setups. This makes these theoretically sound\napproaches costly and impractical, as the system size increases. In this work,\nwe propose a multi-view neural network model to generate representations\nsuitable for entanglement structure detection. The number of required quantum\nmeasurements is polynomial rather than exponential increase with the qubit\nnumber. This remarkable reduction in resource costs makes it possible to detect\nspecific entanglement structures in large-scale systems. Numerical simulations\nshow that our method achieves over 95% detection accuracy for up to 19 qubits\nsystems. By enabling a universal, flexible and resource-efficient analysis of\nentanglement structures, our approach enhances the capability of utilizing\nquantum states across a wide range of applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
