The study evaluates the performance of various CVNNs, such as the\ncomplex-valued feedforward neural network (CVFNN), split-complex feedforward\nneural network (SCFNN), complex radial basis function (C-RBF), fully-complex\nradial basis function (FC-RBF) and phase-transmittance radial basis function\n(PT-RBF), in realistic 5G communication scenarios. Results demonstrate\nimprovements in mean squared error (MSE), convergence, and bit error rate (BER)\naccuracy. The C-RBF and PT-RBF architectures show the most promising outcomes,\nsuggesting that RBF-based CVNNs provide a reliable and efficient solution for\ncomplex and noisy communication environments. These findings have potential\nimplications for applying advanced neural network techniques in next-generation\nwireless systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2IL670oclWJxICjj-nBm8xPEoCOUUlxZ_50HHTB_KLs","pdfSize":"2482953"}
