This observable has been\nrecently used to access the low-energy interaction of hadrons emitted in the\nfinal state of high-energy collisions, delivering unprecedented precision\ninformation of the interaction among strange hadrons. The formalism for\nparticle pairs is well established and it relates the measured correlation\nfunctions with the scattering wave function and the emission source. In the\npresent work we analyze the $NN\\Lambda$ scattering in free space and relate the\ncorresponding wave function to the $pp\\Lambda$ correlation measurement\nperformed by the ALICE collaboration. The three-body problem is solved using\nthe hyperspherical adiabatic basis. Regarding the $p\\Lambda$ and $pp\\Lambda$\ninteractions, different models are used and their impact on the correlation\nfunction is studied. The three body force considered in this work is anchored\nto describe the binding energy of the hypertriton and to give a good\ndescription of the two four-body hypernuclei. As a main result we have observed\na huge, low-energy peak in the $pp\\Lambda$ correlation function, mainly\nproduced by the $J^\\pi=1/2^+$ three-body state. The study of this peak from an\nexperimental as well as a theoretical point of view will provide important\nconstraints to the two- and three-body interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"i6pbJsa6BUXc18P6hgsMFzSsF4PrO4xfJPdGQItS-nc","pdfSize":"971776","txDigest":"BWJmt8eHih91GrLeTJcaoh5CT56jNjHkN3cQJQkcoBiE","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
