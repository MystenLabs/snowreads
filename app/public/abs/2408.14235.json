Here, the most probable transition pathway of a\nnoise-induced collapse of the northern overturning circulation in a\nspatially-continuous two-dimensional model with surface temperature and\nstochastic salinity forcings is directly computed using Large Deviation Theory\n(LDT). This pathway reveals the fluid dynamical mechanisms of such a collapse.\nParadoxically it starts off with a strengthening of the northern overturning\ncirculation before a short but strong salinity pulse induces a second\noverturning cell. The increased atmospheric energy input of this two-cell\nconfiguration cannot be mixed away quickly enough, leading to the collapse of\nthe northern overturning cell and finally resulting in a southern overturning\ncirculation. Additionally, the approach allows us to compare the probability of\nthis collapse under different parameters in the deterministic part of the\nsalinity surface forcing, which quantifies the increase in collapse probability\nas the bifurcation point of the system is approached.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BD-mr37RAepfNFGOvskoct-yIFPXPZcLA_x3nYWV00Y","pdfSize":"2340088"}
