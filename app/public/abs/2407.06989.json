In\nparticular, we examine the phenomenon of seemingly discontinuous paths that\nparticles take in nested Mach-Zender interferometer experiments. We extend on\nexisting path integral approaches for weak values by deriving expressions to\nmodel a sequence of weak measurements, and study the probe shifts across the\ndifferent branches of a weak value interferometer. We apply this to scrutinise\ntwo scenarios of interest, one which treats photons as measurement apparatus\nvia their spatial projection operators, and the second treating mirrors as\nprobes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
