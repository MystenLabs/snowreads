Within this domain, current guarantees either\nfall short with suboptimal guarantees or demand prior knowledge of mixing time.\nTo address these issues, we introduce Randomized Accelerated Natural Actor\nCritic, a method that integrates Multi-level Monte-Carlo and Natural Actor\nCritic. Our approach is the first to achieve global convergence rate of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ without requiring knowledge of mixing time,\nsignificantly surpassing the state-of-the-art bound of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/T^{1/4})$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
