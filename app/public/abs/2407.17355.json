In this paper we find sufficient conditions for $L/K$ to admit a\nGalois scaffold. This leads to sufficient conditions for the ring of integers\n$\\mathfrak{O}_L$ to be free of rank 1 over its associated order\n$\\mathfrak{A}_{L/K}$, and to stricter conditions which imply that\n$\\mathfrak{A}_{L/K}$ is a Hopf order in the group ring $K[G]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
