We show that a graph and all its induced subgraphs are strongly nice\nif and only if it is claw-free, which strengthens a result of Stanley and\nprovides further evidence for the well-known conjecture on the Schur positivity\nof claw-free graphs. As another application, we solve Wang and Wang's\nconjecture on the non-Schur positivity of squid graphs $Sq(2n-1;1^n)$ for $n\n\\ge 3$ by proving that these graphs are not strongly nice.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
