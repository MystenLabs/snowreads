The simulations\nare applied to organic crystals inspired by rubrene and cover multiple\ntransport regimes. This includes calculations of the intrinsic Hall\nconductivity in pristine crystals, which are connected with a simple\ndescription of semi-classical electron transport that involves the concept of\nclosed electronic orbits in the band structure, which can be easily calculated\nin density functional theory. Furthermore, this framework is employed to\nsimulate temperature-dependent longitudinal and transverse mobilities in\nrubrene. These simulations are compared to experimental findings, providing\ninsights into these results by characterizing the non-ideality of the Hall\neffect due to the influence of vibrational disorder. We finally investigate the\nconditions for the observation of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the\nlongitudinal resistivity and quantized Hall plateaus in the transverse\nresistivity. A clear picture why this is not observed in rubrene is developed.\nThese insights into classical and quantum Hall effects and their intermediates\nin organic semiconductors establish a blueprint for future explorations in\nsimilar systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Wg0Xe5RC9xblJhHismxZwW09HMnfwsrFXRcgxXEhzv8","pdfSize":"12032373"}
