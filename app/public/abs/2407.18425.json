It is shown that there exists the critical Fujita exponent\nwhich separates systematic blow-up of the solutions from possible global\nexistence, and the critical exponent is independent of the parameter $\\alpha$.\nDifferent from the general scaling argument for parabolic problems, the main\ningredients of our proof are suitable decay estimates of the solution operator\nand the construction of the test function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
