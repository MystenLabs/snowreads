The RKS method utilizes the one- and two-particle\nreduced density matrices to alleviate any numerical artifacts stemming from a\nfinite basis (e.g., Gaussian- or Slater-type orbitals). The KZG approach relies\nsolely on the density to find the XC potential, by combining a systematically\nconvergent finite-element basis with appropriate asymptotic correction on the\ntarget density. The RKS method, being designed for a finite basis, offers\ncomputational efficiency. The KZG method, using a complete basis, provides\nhigher accuracy. In this work, we combine both the methods to simultaneously\nafford accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we use the RKS solution as\ninitial guess to the KZG method to attain a significant $3-11\\times$ speedup.\nThis work also presents a direct comparison of the XC potentials from the RKS\nand the KZG method and their relative accuracy on various weakly and strongly\ncorrelated molecules, using their ground state solutions from accurate\nconfiguration interaction calculations solved in a Slater orbital basis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
