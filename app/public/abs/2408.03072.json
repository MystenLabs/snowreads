Alignment in a face-on binary guarantees\nlow rotational broadening, while alignment in an edge-on binary maximizes the\nrotational broadening. In contrast, if spin-orbit angles ($\\psi$) are random,\nrotational broadening should not depend on orbital inclination. Using this\ntechnique, we investigated a sample of 2{,}727 astrometric binaries from Gaia\nDR3 with F-type primaries and orbital periods between 50 and 1000 days\n(separations 0.3--2.7~au). We found that $\\psi$ is strongly associated with\n$e$, the orbital eccentricity. When $e<0.15$, the mean spin-orbit angle is\n$\\langle\\psi\\rangle = 6.9_{-4.1}^{+5.4}$\\,degrees, while for $e>0.7$, it rises\nto $\\langle\\psi\\rangle = 46_{-24}^{+26}$\\,degrees. These results suggest that\nsome binaries are affected by processes during their formation or evolution\nthat excite both orbital eccentricity and inclination.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fg-IiaQ-kn56f8FNBvL8HKxMohIrmQ7XaoHrOIkfxq4","pdfSize":"2053095"}
