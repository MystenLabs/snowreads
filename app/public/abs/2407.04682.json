For simplicity, we focus only on the dominant quadrupolar mode of the\nradiation. We demonstrate that such tails become more prominent as eccentricity\nincreases. Exploring the phenomenology of the tails in both spinning and\nnon-spinning eccentric binaries, with the spin magnitude varying from\n$\\chi=-0.6$ to $\\chi=+0.6$ and eccentricity as high as $e=0.98$, we find that\nthese tails can be well approximated by a slowly decaying power law. We study\nthe power law for varying systems and find that the power law exponent lies\nclose to the theoretically expected value $-4$. Finally, using both plunge\ngeodesic and radiation-reaction-driven orbits, we perform a series of numerical\nexperiments to understand the origin of the tails in BBH simulations. Our\nresults suggest that the late-time tails are strongly excited in eccentric BBH\nsystems when the smaller black hole is in the neighborhood of the apocenter, as\nopposed to any structure in the strong field of the larger black hole. Our\nanalysis framework is publicly available through the \\texttt{gwtails} Python\npackage.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
