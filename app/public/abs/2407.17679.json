Likewise, women of\ncolor (WOC) have used it to protest, share information and support one another\nthrough its various affordances. However, Instagram is known to have frequent\nupdates, and recently the updates have been more drastic. The newest update\nchanged the recommendation algorithm such that it showed video-oriented content\n(reels) from unknown accounts over static media from a user's own network.\nSeveral marginalized communities, and especially WOC resisted this change and\nothers that led to it. Due to the backlash, Instagram rolled back its changes.\nDrawing from past HCI work on digital platforms for marginalised communities, I\npropose a qualitative study informed by the open research strategy to\nunderstand why WOC are resisting these changes, and eventually provide\nimplications for design that can help implement changes in a more inclusive\nmanner.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BnKS98qvVwqAfeO8Ksu1qrpk8EO20S0ls5JCoLA73vo","pdfSize":"167421"}
