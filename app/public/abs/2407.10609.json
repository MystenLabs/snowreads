We establish the following crucial phenomenon: the range of\npartially isometric Toeplitz operators is always a Beurling-type invariant\nsubspace of $H_{\\mathcal{E}}^2(\\mathbb{D}^n)$. Using this result, we prove that\npartially isometric Toeplitz operators always admit the following\nfactorization: \\[ T_{\\Phi} = M_{\\Gamma} M_{\\Psi}^*, \\] where\n$\\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{z}), \\Psi(\\boldsymbol{z})$ are operator-valued inner\nfunctions on $\\mathbb{D}^n$, governed by certain conditions that force\n$M_{\\Gamma} M_{\\Psi}^*$ to become a Toeplitz operator. Our results are new even\nin the case of Hardy spaces over the unit disc, and extend the work of\nBrown-Douglas, Deepak-Pradhan-Sarkar on scalar-valued Hardy spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cd_x7zo1_bDnu9hqRofr6i_NL2LVMPojdpq1oA1WxwU","pdfSize":"263541"}
