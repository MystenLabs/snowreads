We obtain an\naveraged Plancherel formula for BV functions and a characterisation of sets of\nfinite perimeter in terms of their Fourier transform. We also sharpen a result\nof Herz concerning the \"set derivative\" of the Fourier transform of the\ncharacteristic function of a set. Finally, we obtain a new proof of the\nisoperimetric inequality and sharp bounds on the $L^2$-discrepancy of BV\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
