However, creating a SAPPhIRE model of a\ntechnical or a natural system requires sourcing technical knowledge from\nmultiple technical documents regarding how the system works. This research\ninvestigates how to generate technical content accurately relevant to the\nSAPPhIRE model of causality using a Large Language Model, also called LLM. This\npaper, which is the first part of the two-part research, presents a method for\nhallucination suppression using Retrieval Augmented Generating with LLM to\ngenerate technical content supported by the scientific information relevant to\na SAPPhIRE con-struct. The result from this research shows that the selection\nof reference knowledge used in providing context to the LLM for generating the\ntechnical content is very important. The outcome of this research is used to\nbuild a software support tool to generate the SAPPhIRE model of a given\ntechnical system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
