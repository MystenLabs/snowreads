In this\nnote, we explore the existence of successor topologies in topological groups,\nparticularly focusing on non-abelian connected locally compact groups. Our main\ncontributions are twofold: for a connected locally compact group $(G, \\tau)$,\nwe show that (1) if $(G, \\tau)$ is compact, then $\\tau$ has a precompact\nsuccessor if and only if there exists a discontinuous homomorphism from $G$\ninto a simple connected compact group with dense image, and (2) if $G$ is\nsolvable, then $\\tau$ has no successors. Our work relies on the previous\ncharacterization of locally compact group topologies on abelian groups\nprocessing successors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LMViTKWLNm6gtBuzUheLU-jOd5WzhXzZZcj4KrN6MAQ","pdfSize":"408001"}
