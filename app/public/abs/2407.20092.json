In this respect,\nrecently developed quantum processors based, e.g., on superconducting circuits\nmay alternatively be employed as the basic platform for ultra-low-power\nconsumption classical processors, in addition to obvious applications in\nquantum information processing and quantum computing. Here we propose a\nsingle-photon microwave switch based on a circuit quantum electrodynamics\nsetup, in which a single control photon in a transmission line is able to\nswitch on/off the propagation of another single photon in a separate line. The\nperformances of this single-photon switch are quantified in terms of the photon\nflux through the output channel, providing a direct comparison of our results\nwith available data. Furthermore, we show how the design of this microwave\nswitch enables the recovery of the single control photon after the switching\nprocess. This proposal may be readily realized in state-of-art superconducting\ncircuit technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rYx_57qELAl2EJr3z1NJt925k1SanNEDKBQpNAT7fiE","pdfSize":"2649547"}
