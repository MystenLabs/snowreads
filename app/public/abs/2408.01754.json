In\nthis work, a comprehensive model linking the probability of quantum measurement\nerrors (infidelity) to PMD is developed and validated by experimental\nmeasurements of differential group delay and quantum bit error rate (QBER). Our\nresearch proposes effective methods to mitigate PMD effects for broadband\nentangled photons and evaluates the impact of higher-order PMD effects. The\nmodel provides an experimentally verified framework for the optimization of\ncommercial quantum key distribution systems in deployed fiber optic lines.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WtXrMEQscmJE7MSdhRzSsJMOjl80_zF5CxF4S19w3Xc","pdfSize":"4788128"}
