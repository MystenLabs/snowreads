Chance constraints are introduced and integrated into the\nsensing quality of service (QoS) framework to precisely control the impact of\nthe resulting RCS uncertainties. Taking into account the dynamic nature of the\nRCS, we jointly optimize the MA positions and the communication and sensing\nbeam design for minimization of the total transmit power at the base station\n(BS) while ensuring the individual communication and sensing task QoS\nrequirements. To tackle the resulting non-convex mixed integer non-linear\nprogram (MINLP), we develop an iterative algorithm to obtain a high quality\nsuboptimal solution. Our numerical results reveal that the proposed MA-enhanced\nISAC system cannot only significantly reduce the BS transmit power compared to\nsystems relying on fixed antenna positions and antenna selection but also\ndemonstrates remarkable robustness to RCS fluctuations, underscoring the\nmultifaceted benefits of exploiting MAs in ISAC systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"l2r3NgV2wG5D_OZQjfDaBp8c-4M8gebasPNOxUeyEpM","pdfSize":"510389","objectId":"0x4cf3ca8047f034e3d86601b9c2d46119ddc08813fadb914bf8ff64216badc2c3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
