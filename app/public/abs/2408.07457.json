However, there is a significant disproportion in the availability\nof resources between the two variants, with Brazilian Portuguese having more\nabundant resources. This inequity can impact the quality of translation\nservices accessible to European Portuguese speakers. To address this issue, we\npropose the development of a Brazilian Portuguese to European Portuguese\ntranslation system, leveraging recent advancements in neural architectures and\nmodels. To evaluate the performance of such systems, we manually curated a gold\ntest set comprising 500 sentences across five different topics. Each sentence\nin the gold test set has two distinct references, facilitating a\nstraightforward evaluation of future translation models. We experimented with\nvarious models by fine-tuning existing Large Language Models using parallel\ndata extracted from movie subtitles and TED Talks transcripts in both Brazilian\nand European Portuguese. Our evaluation involved the use of conventional\nautomatic metrics as well as a human evaluation. In addition, all models were\ncompared against ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, which currently yields the best results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-pBT2LudPamFtxSdgXYXedfyLK7ig_VX-y-10tERBlQ","pdfSize":"120018"}
