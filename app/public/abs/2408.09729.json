The basic scenario\nis given by a large swarm of micro-scale particles (''agents'') and a\nparticular target region (''tumor'') within a system of passageways. Agents are\ntoo small to contain on-board power or computation and are instead controlled\nby a global external force that acts uniformly on all particles, such as an\napplied fluidic flow or electromagnetic field. The challenge is to deliver all\nagents to the target region with a minimum number of actuation steps.\n  We provide a number of results for this challenge. We show that the\nunderlying problem is NP-complete, which explains why previous work did not\nprovide provably efficient algorithms. We also develop several algorithmic\napproaches that greatly improve the worst-case guarantees for the number of\nrequired actuation steps. We evaluate our algorithmic approaches by numerous\nsimulations, both for deterministic algorithms and searches supported by deep\nlearning, which show that the performance is practically promising.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
