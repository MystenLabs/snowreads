As a simple consequence, we obtain the Gagliardo-Nirenberg type\ninequality and as its application we show global well-posedness of nonlinear\nPDEs in the noncommutative Euclidean space. Moreover, we show that the\nlogarithmic Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the Nash inequality for\npossibly different constants in this noncommutative setting by completing the\nlist in noncommutative Varopoulos's theorem in [37]. Finally, we present a\ndirect application of the Nash inequality to compute the time decay for\nsolutions of the heat equation in the noncommutative setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
