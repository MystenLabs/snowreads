In this work, we introduce Coport, a novel public code\nspecifically designed for covariant polarized ray-tracing radiative transfer\ncomputations in any spacetime. Written in Julia, Coport includes an interface\nfor visualizing numerical results obtained from HARM, a publicly available\nimplementation of the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code. We\nvalidate the precision of our code by comparing its outputs with the results\nfrom a variety of established methodologies. This includes the verification\nagainst analytical solutions, the validation through thin-disk assessments, and\nthe evaluation via thick-disk analyses. Notably, our code employs a methodology\nthat eliminates the need for separating the computations of spacetime\npropagation and plasma propagation. Instead, it directly solves the coupled,\ncovariant, polarized radiative transfer equation in curved spacetime,\nseamlessly integrating the effects of gravity with plasma influences. This\napproach sets our code apart from the existing alternatives and enhances its\naccuracy and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"utssO8dG5pMY_e39p12XFmipaRd5V1E12sxEdwjgOqo","pdfSize":"2970072"}
