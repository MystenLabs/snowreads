This study delves into the application of DNNs across a wide\nspectrum of intricate causal inference tasks, where direct estimation falls\nshort and necessitates multi-stage learning. Examples include estimating the\nconditional average treatment effect and dynamic treatment effect. In this\nframework, DNNs are constructed sequentially, with subsequent stages building\nupon preceding ones. To mitigate the impact of estimation errors from early\nstages on subsequent ones, we integrate DNNs in a doubly robust manner. In\ncontrast to previous research, our study offers theoretical assurances\nregarding the effectiveness of DNNs in settings where the dimensionality $p$\nexpands with the sample size. These findings are significant independently and\nextend to degenerate single-stage learning problems.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
