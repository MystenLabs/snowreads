The\nSoftware process framework consists of activities that constantly require\nroutine human interaction, leading to the possibility of errors and\nuncertainties. AI can assist software development managers, software testers,\nand other team members by leveraging LLMs, GenAI models, and AI agents to\nperform routine tasks, risk analysis and prediction, strategy recommendations,\nand support decision making. AI has the potential to increase efficiency and\nreduce the risks encountered by the project management team while increasing\nthe project success rates. Additionally, it can also break down complex notions\nand development processes for stakeholders to make informed decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an approach in which AI tools and technologies can be\nutilized to bestow maximum assistance for agile software projects, which have\nbecome increasingly favored in the industry in recent years.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
