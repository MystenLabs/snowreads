Ambient particulate\nmatter is a primary driver of this effect. Namely, PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.0\ndisplay a systemic lack of accurate and high-definition reporting. This project\nsuggests and implements a prototype for a distributed and low cost model for\nreporting such data and designs a novel framework in order to remedy three main\nshortfalls of previously implemented systems. First, their central operation\nand distribution, and therefore their requirement of trust in a central\ngoverning body. Second, their requirement of the purchase of comparatively\nhigh-cost devices for ordinary consumers. Finally, their high degree of error\nand accordingly low functional certainty. This project explores the creation of\nAirChain, a prototype system utilizing blockchain technology that will\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of low-cost sensors when paired with simple\nmicrocontroller devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q1Sk2VEIFdUU_a7I2UwjINHMLa5tZEN-QQffqo8jeCM","pdfSize":"823457"}
