This is\nequivalent to solve a fourth-order non-linear elliptic boundary value problem\nwith a third-order non-linear equation and homogeneous Neumann conditions at\nthe boundary. The problem admits a Mean-field type variational formulation,\nsimilar to the one obtained by Cruz-Bl\\'azquez and Ruiz for a related problem\nin two dimensions, with the associated energy functional being bounded from\nbelow but, in general, not coercive. By imposing symmetry conditions, we are\nable to prove the existence of minimizers, especially when $Q,T\\geq 0$. To the\nbest of our knowledge, these are the first existence results obtained for this\nsetting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
