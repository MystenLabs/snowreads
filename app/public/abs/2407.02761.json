Such a proximity\nroute depends to a great extent on the control of the delicate interfacial\ncoupling of the two constituents. However, a recent experiment reported the\nfailure to reproduce such a topological superconductor, which is ascribed to\nthe negligence of the electrical short by the superconductor in the theoretical\nproposal. Here, we reproduce this topological superconductor with attention to\nthe interface control. The resulted conductance matrix under a wide magnetic\nfield range agrees with the fingerprint of this topological superconductor.\nThis allows us to develop a phase diagram that unveils three regions\nparameterized by various coupling limits, which not only supports the\nfeasibility to fabricate the topological superconductor by proximity but also\nfully explains the origin of the previous debate. The present work provides a\ncomprehensible guide on fabricating the topological superconductor.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
