In this work, we answer an important question: What is the minimum\namount of data required to extract features for accurate battery prognosis and\ndiagnosis? Based on the first principle, we successfully extracted the best\ntwo-point feature (BTPF) for accurate battery prognosis and diagnosis using the\nfewest data points (only two) and the simplest feature selection method\n(Pearson correlation coefficient). The BTPF extraction method is tested on 820\ncells from 6 open-source datasets (covering five different chemistry types,\nseven manufacturers, and three data types). It achieves comparable accuracy to\nstate-of-the-art features in both prognosis and diagnosis tasks. This work\nchallenges the cognition of existing studies on the difficulty of battery\nprognosis and diagnosis tasks, subverts the fixed pattern of establishing\nprognosis and diagnosis methods for complex dynamic systems through deliberate\nfeature engineering, highlights the promise of data-driven methods for field\nbattery prognosis and diagnosis applications, and provides a new benchmark for\nfuture studies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
