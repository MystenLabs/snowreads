In this study, we demonstrate\nthat the compression part of an acoustic wave can generate tension that\ninitiates the vaporization. This counter-intuitive process is explained by the\noccurrence of Gouy phase shift due to the focusing of the acoustic wave inside\nthe droplet. Our analysis unifies the existing theories for acoustic droplet\nvaporization under a single framework and is supported by experiments and\nsimulations. We use our theory to identify governing parameters that allow to\nvaporize droplets using predominantly compression waves, which are safer in\nmedical use.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"psPKsLATUG4VwLWedyiYqL2PdFqIegJEfWF5i-3pAEw","pdfSize":"1073347"}
