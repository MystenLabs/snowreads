Using the\nlattice congruence induced by an ideal $I$ of $A$ we establish a functor $F_I:\n\\mathfrak{T}(A) \\to \\mathfrak{T}(A/I)$ and if $\\mathrm{tors } A$ is finite an\ninclusion $\\mathcal{I}: \\mathfrak{T}(A/I) \\to \\mathfrak{T}(A)$. We characterise\nwhen these functors are full, faithful and adjoint. As a consequence we find a\nnew family of algebras for which $\\mathfrak{T}(A)$ admits a faithful group\nfunctor.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
