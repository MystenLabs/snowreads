By using the well\nestablished SIII Skyrme parametrization, without any special adjustments\nrelated to low-energy isomer, the single-particle spectrum provided by the\nmodel reproduces the correct isomer $K^{\\pi}=3/2^{+}$ spin and parity, and the\nrelative proximity of the isomeric state to the $K^{\\pi}=5/2^{+}$ ground state,\nyet on the keV scale. We show that this approach may provide microscopic\nestimates for some related observables, such as the quadrupole and octupole\nmoments, deformation parameters as well as magnetic dipole moments. Its ability\nto provide a prediction for the M1 isomer transition probability is discussed.\nThe obtained $^{229}$Th single-particle structure is compared with that\nprovided by calculations in neighbouring actinide isotopes and isotones,\nallowing us to assess the more general role of the considered mechanism for the\nformation of low-energy isomers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Nq-RWFU2oxUMu07m0DDHiSjblfMA2SDov_pmUn91uUE","pdfSize":"631664"}
