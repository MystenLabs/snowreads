Theoretical treatments so far have\nconsidered the magnetic inertia as a scalar quantity. Here, we explore the\nmagnetic inertial dynamics with a magnetic inertia tensor as macroscopic\nderivations predicted it to be a tensor. First, the inertia tensor has been\ndecomposed into three terms: (a) scalar and isotropic inertia, (b) anisotropic\nand symmetric inertia tensor, (c) chiral and antisymmetric tensor. Further, we\nemploy linear response theory to the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation\nwith the inertia tensor and calculate the effect of chiral and anisotropic\ninertia on ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. It is established\nthat the precession and nutation resonance frequencies decrease with scalar\nmagnetic inertia. Our results suggest that the nutation resonance frequencies\nfurther reduce due to inertia tensor. However, the effective damping of the\nnutation resonance increases with the chiral and antisymmetric part of the\ninertia tensor. We show that the precession resonances remain unaffected, while\nthe nutation resonances are modified with the chiral magnetic inertia.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
