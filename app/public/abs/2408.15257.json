Traditional text\nclassification methods usually rely on feature representations such as the bag\nof words model or TF-IDF, which overlook the semantic connections between words\nand make it challenging to grasp the deep structural details of the text.\nRecently, GNNs have proven to be a valuable asset for text classification\ntasks, thanks to their capability to handle non-Euclidean data efficiently.\nHowever, the existing text classification methods based on GNN still face\nchallenges such as complex graph structure construction and high cost of model\ntraining. This paper introduces a text classification optimization algorithm\nutilizing graph neural networks. By introducing adaptive graph construction\nstrategy and efficient graph convolution operation, the accuracy and efficiency\nof text classification are effectively improved. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method surpasses traditional approaches and\nexisting GNN models across multiple public datasets, highlighting its superior\nperformance and feasibility for text classification tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
