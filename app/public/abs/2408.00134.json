Maps\nare used to investigate general properties of dynamical systems and to model\nvarious natural and socioeconomic systems. They are also used in engineering.\nMany natural and almost all socioeconomic systems possess memory which, in many\ncases, is power-law-like memory. Generalized fractional maps, in which memory\nis not exactly the power-law memory but the asymptotically power-law-like\nmemory, are used to model and investigate general properties of these systems.\nIn this paper we extend the definition of the notion of generalized fractional\nmaps of arbitrary positive orders that previously was defined only for maps\nwhich, in the case of integer orders, converge to area/volume-preserving maps.\nFractional generalizations of H'enon and Lozi maps belong to the newly defined\nclass of generalized fractional maps. We derive the equations which define\nperiodic points in generalized fractional maps. We consider applications of our\nresults to the fractional and fractional difference H'enon and Lozi maps.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fxKcsD6NgHN1_ESPovA0ppJuVGTyKYVG8MHluG6O-Ig","pdfSize":"173757","txDigest":"HRRZPRYF1FMRMZfAp6hFLgKj2XAyz3sjNNdABwe99VFD","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
