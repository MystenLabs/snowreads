A Machine Learning interatomic potential is developed to perform\nmolecular dynamics simulations. We show that the energy spectra expected from\nDark Matter and neutrino coherent scattering are affected by the crystal\ndefects and we provide reference predictions. We discuss the special case of\nthe spectrum of nuclear recoils induced by neutron capture, which could offer a\nunique sensitivity to the calculated stored energies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eTv_u6it4y6eOnblJGVio7CV59P1FYBdbiOlW2AhljY","pdfSize":"470527","objectId":"0x49d081ab18ad03da3c12528209610b905a00d1ddf1cb8f40a856adc3393ca915","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
