These problems require\ncomputing the reach-avoid set, which ensures that all its elements can safely\nreach a target set despite any disturbance within pre-specified bounds. Our\nframework has two main parts: offline learning of a newly designed reach-avoid\nvalue function and post-learning certification. Compared to prior works, our\nnew value function is Lipschitz continuous and its associated Bellman operator\nis a contraction mapping, both of which improve the learning performance. To\nensure deterministic guarantees of our learned reach-avoid set, we introduce\ntwo efficient post-learning certification methods. Both methods can be used\nonline for real-time local certification or offline for comprehensive\ncertification. We validate our framework in a 12-dimensional crazyflie drone\nracing hardware experiment and a simulated 10-dimensional highway takeover\nexample.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U6eeXgvpgkozGbfhpzvHRZ0uhfNrp4M1Q77QFUoUahU","pdfSize":"6265749"}
