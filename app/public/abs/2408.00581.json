The first approach transforms the original setting into a stochastic\nsystem with zero initial states. This transformation naturally leads to\nequations with controlled diffusion. A detailed analysis of dominant subspaces\nand bounds for the reduction error is provided in this controlled diffusion\nframework. Subsequently, we introduce a reduced system for the original\nframework and prove an a-priori error bound for the first ansatz. This bound\ninvolves so-called Hankel singular values that are linked to a new pair of\nGramians. A second strategy is presented that is based on the idea of reducing\ncontrol and initial state dynamics separately. Here, different Gramians are\nused in order to derive a reduced model and their relation to dominant\nsubspaces are pointed out. We also show an a posteriori error bound for the\nsecond approach involving two types of Hankel singular values.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
