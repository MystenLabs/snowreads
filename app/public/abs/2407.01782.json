Unlike human\nvision, which efficiently selects only the essential visual areas for further\nprocessing, leading to high speed and low energy consumption, deep vision\nmodels process the entire image. In this work, we examine this issue from a\nbroader perspective and propose a solution that could pave the way for the next\ngeneration of more efficient vision models. Basically, convolution and pooling\noperations are selectively applied to altered regions, with a change map sent\nto subsequent layers. This map indicates which computations need to be\nrepeated.
