The reflection spectrum is Fano\nshape. The Fano resonance has an asymmetric and sharp resonance peak can be\nindependently tuned by changing the asymmetric coupling factor of the first\nmicro-ring. The transmission spectrum is electromagnetically induced\ntransparency(EIT)-like shape. The (EIT)-like resonance can be independently\ntuned by changing the absorption factor and the phase shift factor of the\nsecond micro-ring. The Fano and EIT-like resonance have low loss and high\nnear-field localization characteristics, our research has promising\napplications in optical communication and opto-electronic modulators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
