This makes it desirable to find analogues of\nthis paradox in simple and experimentally accessible systems, whose resolutions\nmay shed light on this longstanding and fundamental problem. Here, we review\nand resolve the apparent \"information paradox\" in two different interfaces\nseparating Abelian and non-Abelian quantum Hall states. In both cases, the\ninformation carried by the pseudospin degree of freedom of the Abelian anyons\nget scrambled when they cross the interface and enter the non-Abelian quantum\nHall liquid. Nevertheless, it is found that the scrambling mechanism depends on\nthe nature of the interface. The corresponding analogues of different concepts\nin black hole physics such as event horizon, black hole interior, Hawking\nradiation, and Page curve will also be discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
