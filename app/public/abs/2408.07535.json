The prediction is based\non the analyticity properties of the Chern-Simons correlator combined with the\nbasic features of gravity. Depending on the quality-level of the\n$U(1)_{B+L}$-symmetry, $\\eta_w$ emerges as a $B+L$ pseudo-Goldstone boson or as\na St\\\"uckelberg $2$-form of the electroweak gauge redundancy. An intriguing\nscenario of the first category is the emergence of $\\eta_w$ in the form of the\nphase of a $U(1)_{B+L}$-violating fermion condensate triggered by the\ninstantons, somewhat similarly to $\\eta'$-meson in QCD. Regardless of its\nparticular origin, the presence of $\\eta_w$-meson in the theory appears to be a\nmatter of consistency.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IDeq-WCDGwLL05IwL3ce6WDYgdhD77yDRKHSXLrMMa4","pdfSize":"225458"}
