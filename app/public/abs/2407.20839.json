Examining quantum efficiency and\nemitted phonons in the charge transfer state (CTS), we explore scenarios like\nvariations of the environment beyond the CTS and repulsive/attractive\npotentials. The donor-acceptor interface significantly influences the injection\nprocess, with minimal impact from the environment beyond the CTS. Attractive\npotentials can create localized electron states at the interface, below the\nacceptor band, without necessarily hampering a good injection at higher\nenergies. Exploring different recombination processes, including acceptor-side\nand donor-side recombination, presents distinct phases in the energy-injection\nversus recombination rate. Our study highlights the important role of the type\nof recombination in determining the quantum efficiency and the existence of hot\nor cold charge transfer states. Finally, depending on the initial energy of the\nelectron on the donor side, three distinct injection regimes are exhibited. The\npresent model should be helpful for optimizing organic photovoltaic cell\ninterfaces, highlighting the critical parameter interplay for enhanced\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hGdG_W588LolbB30BwcUsgUVlPMmPeg-rEdecblg004","pdfSize":"1501665"}
