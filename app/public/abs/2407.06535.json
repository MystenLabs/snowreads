Amongst the different reconstruction techniques,\ninverse synthesis methods generally provide high precision but rely on rigid\nanalytical models of a thin film system. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel\nflexible inverse synthesis method that uses angular spectrum wave propagation\nand does not rely on rigid model assumptions. Amongst other evaluated\nparameters, our algorithm is capable of evaluating the geometrical properties\nof thin film surfaces, which reduces the variance caused by inverse synthesis\noptimization routines and significantly improves measurement precision. The\nproposed method could potentially allow for the characterization of \"uncommon\"\nthin film samples that do not fit the current model assumptions, as well as the\ncharacterization of samples with higher complexity, e.g., multi-layer systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
