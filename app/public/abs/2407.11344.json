However, the\nRGB modality may struggle in certain circumstances, e.g., nighttime, while\nothers, e.g., event data, own their merits; thus, it is imperative for the\nfusion model to discern robust and fragile modalities, and incorporate the most\nrobust and fragile ones to learn a resilient multi-modal framework. To this\nend, we propose a novel method, named MAGIC, that can be flexibly paired with\nvarious backbones, ranging from compact to high-performance models. Our method\ncomprises two key plug-and-play modules. Firstly, we introduce a multi-modal\naggregation module to efficiently process features from multi-modal batches and\nextract complementary scene information. On top, a unified arbitrary-modal\nselection module is proposed to utilize the aggregated features as the\nbenchmark to rank the multi-modal features based on the similarity scores. This\nway, our method can eliminate the dependence on RGB modality and better\novercome sensor failures while ensuring the segmentation performance. Under the\ncommonly considered multi-modal setting, our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance while reducing the model parameters by 60%. Moreover, our method is\nsuperior in the novel modality-agnostic setting, where it outperforms prior\narts by a large margin of +19.41% mIoU\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
