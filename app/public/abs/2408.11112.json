In this context, the MLOps discipline emerges as a solution to automate\nthe life cycle of Machine Learning models, ranging from experimentation to\nmonitoring in productive environments. Research results shows MLOps is a\nconstantly evolving discipline, with challenges and solutions for integrating\ndevelopment and production environments, publishing models in production\nenvironments, and monitoring models throughout the end to end development\nlifecycle. This paper contributes to the understanding of MLOps techniques and\ntheir most diverse applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
