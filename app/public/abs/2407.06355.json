This workshop was held at Seton Hall University in South Orange,\nNJ, USA on January 9, 2024. It was co-located with the 25th International\nSymposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP 2024), which took place on\nJanuary 10-12, 2024.\n  The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers, and professionals that\nuse, or are interested in the use of, functional programming in education.\nTFPIE aims to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas, and\nworks-in-progress on the use of functional programming in education are\ndiscussed.\n  TFPIE workshops have previously been held in St Andrews, Scotland (2012),\nProvo, Utah, USA (2013), Soesterberg, The Netherlands (2014), Sophia-Antipolis,\nFrance (2015), College Park, MD, USA (2016), Canterbury, UK (2017), Gothenburg,\nSweden (2018), Vancouver, Canada (2019), Krakow, Poland (2020), online due to\nCOVID-19 (2021, 2022, with some talks from TFPIE 2022 also presented in person\nat the Lambda Days in Krakow, Poland), and Boston, MA, USA (2023, back\nin-person).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
