We deduce\nthe $C$- and $CP$-odd quark operators that contribute to $\\eta\\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$ originating from the mass-dimension 6 Standard Model effective\nfield theory. The corresponding hadron-level operators that generate a\nnon-vanishing $I=0$ amplitude at order $p^6$ in the chiral effective theory are\npresented for the first time, in addition to the leading order\noperatorsascribed to the $I=2$ final state. By fitting the KLOE-2 and the most\nrecent BESIII experimental data, we determine the coefficients of the lowest\norder $I=0$ and $I=2$ amplitudes and estimate the potential new physics energy\nscale. We also perform an impact study of the future $\\eta\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
