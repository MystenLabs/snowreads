In this work, we investigate the\ndifferential rapidity-dependent entanglement entropy within the proton and its\nconnection to final-state hadrons, aiming to elucidate its QCD evolution. Our\nanalysis reveals a strong agreement between the rapidity dependence of von\nNeumann entropy, obtained from QCD evolution equations, and the corresponding\nexperimental data on hadron entropy. These findings provide compelling evidence\nfor the emergence of a maximally entangled state, offering new insights into\nthe nonperturbative structure of protons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
