Denoting these circuit\nfamilies $\\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ for $\\textit{bounded polynomial threshold\ncircuits}$ parameterized by an integer-valued degree-bound $k$, we prove three\nhardness results separating these classes from constant-depth quantum circuits\n($\\mathsf{QNC}^0$).\n  $\\hspace{2em}$ - We prove that the parity halving problem [WKS+19], which\n$\\mathsf{QNC}^0$ over qubits can solve with certainty, remains average-case\nhard for polynomial size $\\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ circuits for all\n$k=\\mathcal{O}(n^{1/(5d)})$.\n  $\\hspace{2em}$ - We construct a new family of relation problems based on\ncomputing $\\mathsf{mod}\\ p$ for each prime $p>2$, and prove a separation of\n$\\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits over higher dimensional quantum systems (`qupits')\nagainst $\\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ circuits for the same degree-bound parameter as\nabove.\n  $\\hspace{2em}$ - We prove that both foregoing results are noise-robust under\nthe local stochastic noise model, by introducing fault-tolerant implementations\nof non-Clifford $\\mathsf{QNC}^0/|\\overline{T^{1/p}}>$ circuits, that use\nlogical magic states as advice.\n  $\\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ circuits can compute certain classes of Polynomial\nThreshold Functions (PTFs), which in turn serve as a natural model for neural\nnetworks and exhibit enhanced expressivity and computational capabilities.\nFurthermore, for large enough values of $k$, $\\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ contains\n$\\mathsf{TC}^0$ as a subclass. The main challenges we overcome include\nestablishing classical average-case lower bounds, designing non-local games\nwith quantum-classical gaps in winning probabilities and developing\nnoise-resilient non-Clifford quantum circuits necessary to extend beyond qubits\nto higher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yIV9wAfQTY6PdKxCYwCZ93U8d1DDZX0sgSHYyFW5lCM","pdfSize":"2032002"}
