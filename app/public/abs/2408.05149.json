The analysts\nmainly perform attribution manually, given the complex nature of this task. AI\nand, more specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be\nleveraged to support cybersecurity analysts during the attribution process.\nHowever powerful these techniques are, they need to deal with the lack of\ndatasets in the attack attribution domain. In this work, we will fill this gap\nand will provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset on\ncyber-attack attribution. We designed our dataset with the primary goal of\nextracting attack attribution information from cybersecurity texts, utilizing\nnamed entity recognition (NER) methodologies from the field of NLP. Unlike\nother cybersecurity NER datasets, ours offers a rich set of annotations with\ncontextual details, including some that span phrases and sentences. We\nconducted extensive experiments and applied NLP techniques to demonstrate the\ndataset's effectiveness for attack attribution. These experiments highlight the\npotential of Large Language Models (LLMs) capabilities to improve the NER tasks\nin cybersecurity datasets for cyber-attack attribution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
