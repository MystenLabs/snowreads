JWST is finally enabling us to measure Ly$\\alpha$ emission deep\ninto the epoch of reionisation for an increasing number of galaxies. However,\ndiscrepancies between measurements of Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW$_0$) of\nLy$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) have been noted between JWST and ground-based\nfacilities. We employ SPICE, a suite of radiation-hydrodynamical simulations\nfeaturing different stellar feedback models, and investigate the impact of\nradiative transfer effects and observational systematics on the measured\nLy$\\alpha$ EW$_0$. We perform radiative transfer of Ly$\\alpha$ and UV photons\nfor SPICE galaxies to mimic slit spectroscopy for ground-based slits and\nJWST-MSA pseudo-slits. Spatial Ly$\\alpha$-UV offsets exist independently of\nfeedback model, and are common ($>70$% galaxies) with median values of\n$\\approx0.07-0.11''$ and these predictions are consistent with the observed\nspatial offsets. Spatial Ly$\\alpha$-UV offsets are a major cause of loss of\nflux for JWST-MSA observations, with median pseudo-slit losses of $\\approx65$%,\nand $\\approx30$% cases suffering from $>95$% pseudo-slit losses. Even in the\nabsence of such spatial offsets, the presence of extended emission can cause\nmedian pseudo-slit losses of $40$%, with $4$% cases suffering from $>95$%\npseudo-slit losses. Complex galaxy morphologies or misplaced JWST-MSA\npseudo-slit can lead to under-estimated UV continuum, resulting in spuriously\nhigh estimates of EW$_0$ from JWST in $6-8$% of galaxies. We compare the\npredictions from {\\tt SPICE} to 25 galaxies with Ly$\\alpha$ emission\nobservations from both the ground and JWST. The EW$_0^{\\tt JWST}$ and the\nEW$_0^{\\tt Ground}$ exhibit scatter in line with predictions, indicating that\nboth physical and systematic effects are likely at play.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
