However, despite significant\ntheoretical promise, the practical realization and observation of many new\neffects and capabilities leveraging such temporal degrees of freedom have\nremained elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of\nenhanced absorption of electromagnetic waves in a continuously modulated\ntime-varying system, exceeding one of the key theoretical limits of linear\ntime-invariant absorbers. This is achieved by harnessing the\nfrequency-wavevector transitions and enhanced interference effects enabled by\nbreaking both continuous space- and time-translation symmetries in a\nperiodically time-modulated absorbing structure operating at radio-frequencies.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate broadband coherent wave absorption using a\nsecondary control wave, observing a nearly perfect, reconfigurable,\nanti-reflection effect over a broad continuous bandwidth. Our findings provide\nnew insights to challenge existing paradigms on the limits of wave absorption\nand may pave the way to the development of devices that operate in a regime\nfundamentally beyond the reach of any linear time-invariant system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
