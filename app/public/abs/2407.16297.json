By using the Serre spectral sequence induced by\nthe fibration $BU_n\\to BPU_n\\to K(\\mathbb{Z},3)$, we compute the integral\ncohomology of $BPU_n$ in dimensions less than $15$ except for $4\\mid n$ in\ndimension $14$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
