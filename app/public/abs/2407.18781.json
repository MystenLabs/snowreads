Indeed, this martingale is obtained by\nstretching a reference Brownian motion so as to meet the data $\\mu,\\nu$. Unless\n$\\mu$ is a Dirac, the existence of a Bass martingale is a delicate subject,\nsince for instance the reference Brownian motion must be allowed to have a\nnon-trivial initial distribution $\\alpha$, not known in advance. Thus the key\nto obtaining the Bass martingale, theoretically as well as practically, lies in\nfinding $\\alpha$.\n  In \\cite{BaSchTsch23} it has been shown that $\\alpha$ is determined as the\nminimizer of the so-called Bass functional. In the present paper we propose to\nminimize this functional by following its gradient flow, or more precisely, the\ngradient flow of its $L^2$-lift. In our main result we show that this gradient\nflow converges in norm to a minimizer of the Bass functional, and when $d=1$ we\nfurther establish that convergence is exponentially fast.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
