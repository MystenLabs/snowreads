While this ``artificial H2 molecule'' constitutes a\nmilestone towards the development of nanocrystal chemistry, the strength of the\ncoupling has proven to be smaller than intended. The reason is that, when an\nexciton is photo-induced in the system, the hole localizes inside the CdSe\ncores and captures the electron, thus preventing its delocalization all over\nthe dimer. Here, we predict, by means of k$\\cdot$p theory and configuration\ninteraction calculations, that using trions instead of neutral excitons or\nbiexcitons restores the electron delocalization. Positive trions are\nparticularly apt because the strong hole-hole repulsion makes electron\ndelocalization robust against moderate asymmetries in the cores, thus keeping a\nhomodimer-like behavior. Trion-charged colloidal quantum dot molecules have the\npotential to display quantum entanglement features at room temperature with\nexisting technology.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
