{"id":"2408.17335","title":"Why do elites extend property rights: unlocking investment and the\n  switch to public goods","authors":"Alastair Langtry","authorsParsed":[["Langtry","Alastair",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 14:49:53 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-09-02","timestamp":1725029393000,"abstract":"  This paper presents a new rationale for a self-interested economic elite\nvoluntarily extending property rights. When agents make endogenous investment\ndecisions, there is a commitment problem. Ex-post, the elite face strong\nincentives to expropriate investments from the non-elite (who don't have\nproperty rights), which dissuades investment. Extending property rights to new\ngroups can resolve this problem, even for those not given property rights, by\nmaking public good provision more attractive to the elite. Unlike other models\nof franchise extensions, extending property rights in this paper does not\ninvolve the elite ceding control to others. Rather, it changes the incentives\nthey face. Additionally, adding identity groups to the model shows that an\nelite faces weaker incentives to resolve the commitment problem when it is part\nof a minority identity -- identity fragmentation makes it harder for a society\nto extend property rights.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
