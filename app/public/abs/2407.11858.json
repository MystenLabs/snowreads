In this\nLetter, we analyse the properties of the Euclidean random matrix associated to\nthe radiative dynamics of a cold atomic cloud, previously investigated in the\ncontexts of photon localization and Dicke super- and subradiance. We present\nevidence of a new type of phase transition, surprisingly controlled by the\ncooperativeness parameter, rather than the spatial density or the diagonal\ndisorder. The numerical results corroborate the occurrence of such a phase\ntransition at a critical value of the cooperativeness parameter, above which\nthe lower edge of the spectrum vanishes exhibiting a macroscopic accumulation\nof eigenvalues. Independent evaluations based on the two phenomena provide the\nsame value of the critical cooperativeness parameter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
