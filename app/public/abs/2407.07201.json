We\nmatch detailed information on store-level crimes to administrative scanner data\nfrom the universe of transactions for cannabis retailers in Washington state.\nExploiting quasi-experimental variation from the timing of store-level\nrobberies and burglaries, we find that crimes cause a 1.8% increase in retail\nprices at victimized stores. Nearby rivals of victimized stores increase prices\nby a similar amount with a two-month lag. Retailers' price responses are not\ndriven by demand effects, increased wholesale costs, or strategic price\nresponses. Instead, they are consistent with precautionary security\nexpenditures. We find the largest pass-through rates for independent stores and\nin less concentrated markets. We estimate that crime imposes a 1% \"hidden\" unit\ntax on affected stores, implying an annual negative welfare effect of\napproximately $30.6 million, with consumers bearing two-thirds of this burden.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
