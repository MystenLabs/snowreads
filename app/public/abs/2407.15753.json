We incorporate externally-produced prior\ninformation about the EOS to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the\ninference process. We apply this method to the GW170817 event and assess its\nperformance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating prior\nEOS information in the inference process, leading to sharper conclusions and\nmore rapid inference on new detections. This approach has the potential to\nenhance our understanding of neutron stars and the nuclear EOS in future\ngravitational wave observations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
