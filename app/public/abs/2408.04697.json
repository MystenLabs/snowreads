Since these objects can participate in hard\nfew-body scattering processes, they can readily transfer energy to stellar\nsystems, and, in particular, can disrupt wide binaries. However, disruption is\nnot the only possible outcome of such few-body processes. Primordial black\nholes could also participate in exchange processes, in which one component of a\nbinary system is ejected and replaced by the black hole itself. In this case,\nthe remaining object in the binary would dynamically appear to have an\ninvisible companion. We study the rate of exchange processes for primordial\nblack holes as a component of dark matter and evaluate possible mechanisms for\ndetecting such binaries. We find that many such binaries plausibly exist in the\nSolar neighborhood, and show that this process can account for observed binary\nsystems whose properties run counter to the predictions of isolated binary\nevolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
