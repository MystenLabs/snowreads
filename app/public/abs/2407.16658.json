The aim is to retrieve\nthe relevant video with the modified content from a database of videos. In this\nchallenging task, the first step is to acquire large-scale training datasets\nand collect high-quality benchmarks for evaluation. In this work, we introduce\nEgoCVR, a new evaluation benchmark for fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval\nusing large-scale egocentric video datasets. EgoCVR consists of 2,295 queries\nthat specifically focus on high-quality temporal video understanding. We find\nthat existing Composed Video Retrieval frameworks do not achieve the necessary\nhigh-quality temporal video understanding for this task. To address this\nshortcoming, we adapt a simple training-free method, propose a generic\nre-ranking framework for Composed Video Retrieval, and demonstrate that this\nachieves strong results on EgoCVR.
