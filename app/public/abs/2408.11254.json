We investigate how variations in\ndissipation parameters influence the system, uncovering shrimp-shaped\nstructures that represent intricate transitions between regular and chaotic\ndynamics. Key findings include the analysis of period-doubling bifurcations and\nthe onset of chaos. We utilize Lyapunov exponents to distinguish between stable\nand chaotic regions. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of\nnonlinear and chaotic dynamics in optical systems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
