This new algorithm is\neffective in shortening the total length of the AMEW while maintaining the\ndesired wavelength range. Moreover, this analytical algorithm requires much\nfewer computing resources than traditional numerical algorithms. With the new\nalgorithm, we demonstrate a broadband and highly efficient polarization\nsplitter-rotator (PSR) on a lithium-niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform with\nan LN thickness of 500 nm. According to our simulation, the length of the PSR\nis shortened by 3.5 times compared to the linear design. The fabricated PSR,\nwith a total length of 2 mm, exhibits an insertion loss (IL) of 0.8 dB and a\npolarization extinction ratio (ER) of 12.2 dB over a wavelength range exceeding\n76 nm.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
