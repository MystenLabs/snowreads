Traditional methods struggle to detect complex patterns and\nanomalies in network traffic effectively. To address this issue, we propose a\nsystem combining deep learning, data balancing (K-means + SMOTE),\nhigh-dimensional reduction (PCA and FCBF), and hyperparameter optimization\n(Extra Trees and BO-TPE) to enhance intrusion detection performance. By\ntraining on extensive datasets like CIC IDS 2018 and CIC IDS 2017, our models\ndemonstrate robust performance and generalization. Notably, the ensemble model\n\"VGG19\" consistently achieves remarkable accuracy (99.26% on CIC-IDS2017 and\n99.22% on CSE-CIC-IDS2018), outperforming other models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"67EUOCM-ajUPxdnlx_mc0W-76CR4HRagOF32gh7jyG8","pdfSize":"1360723"}
