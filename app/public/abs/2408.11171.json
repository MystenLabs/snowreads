Time delay phenomena frequently\narise in various real-world systems, making their accurate modeling and\nsimulation crucial for understanding and prediction. We consider a series of\nmodel problems, ranging from Parabolic, Hyperbolic to Neutral PDEs with time\ndelay and apply the iterative techniques DNWR and NNWR for solving in parallel.\nWe present the theoretical foundations, numerical implementation, and\ncomparative performance analysis of these two methods. Through numerical\nexperiments and simulations, we explore their convergence properties,\ncomputational efficiency, and applicability to various types of PDEs with time\ndelay.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
