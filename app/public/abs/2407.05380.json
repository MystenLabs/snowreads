This involves estimating the mean of singular\nseries over any product of lattices, which is of independent interest. As a\nconsequence, we establish the convergence of both sequences of suitably\nnormalized primes to a standard Poisson point process.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
