This\nis in contrast to our recent work using the (light-front) energy density\n$T^{+-}$. Indeed, by comparing these two currents, we identify terms that are\nresponsible for the violation of the current conservation. Numerical results\nbased on basis light-front quantization show that the violation effects are\nsmall and the $D$-term extracted from the two currents are close to each other,\nhence validating our previous work using $T^{+-}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GEb6uryDSSab77ViPjys-N7vtSuIWzEUmYuQIwGHl7s","pdfSize":"1085567"}
