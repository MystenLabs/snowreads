To overcome these\nchallenges, we present a novel architecture for future regenerative and\nprogrammable satellite payloads and utilize interconnected modem banks to\npromote higher scalability and flexibility. We formulate an optimization\nproblem to efficiently manage traffic among these modem banks and balance the\nload. Additionally, we provide comparative numerical simulation results,\nconsidering end-to-end delay and packet loss analysis. The results illustrate\nthat our proposed architecture maintains lower delays and packet loss even with\nhigher traffic demands and smaller buffer sizes.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
