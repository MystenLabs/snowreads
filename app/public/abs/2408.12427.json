In particular, for a wide class of\ninhomogeneous initial data we prove that the dynamics near the $t = 0$\nsingularity are well-described by ODEs reminiscent of Kasner bounces. Unlike\nprevious works regarding bounces, our spacetimes are not necessarily spatially\nhomogeneous, and a crucial step is proving so-called asymptotically velocity\nterm dominated (AVTD) behaviour, even in the presence of nonlinear BKL bounces\nand other phenomena such as spikes. (A similar phenomenon involving bounces and\nAVTD behaviour, though not spikes, can also be seen in our companion paper \"BKL\nbounces outside homogeneity: Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field in surface\nsymmetry\", albeit in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model in\nsurface symmetry.) One particular application is the study of (past)\ninstability of certain polarized Gowdy spacetimes, including some Kasner\nspacetimes. Perturbations of such spacetimes are such that the singularity\npersists, but the intermediate dynamics -- between initial data and the\nsingularity -- feature BKL bounces.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y_15zxQarl-P1kaULbgGTo5RbFoKGri1wJ7e36P_C50","pdfSize":"595887"}
