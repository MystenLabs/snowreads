Specifically, we enhance the LLM with fine-grained entity types,\nevent types and their definitions extracted from an external knowledge base.\nThese knowledge are injected into our system via designed templates. We also\naugment the data to balance the label distribution and adapt the task setting\nto real world scenarios in which event mentions are expressed as natural\nlanguage sentences. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the\ninjected knowledge on modeling semantic plausibility of events. An error\nanalysis further emphasizes the importance of identifying non-trivial entity\nand event types.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
