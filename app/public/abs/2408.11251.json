However, defect detection in\nlarge-scale production machinery is becoming increasingly important. Due to\ntheir large size and height, it is often challenging for professionals to\nconduct defect inspections on such large machinery. For example, the inspection\nof aging and misalignment of components on tall machinery like towers requires\ncompanies to assign dedicated personnel. Employees need to climb the towers and\neither visually inspect or take photos to detect safety hazards in these large\nmachines. Direct visual inspection is limited by its low level of automation,\nlack of precision, and safety concerns associated with personnel climbing the\ntowers. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a system based on neural network\nmodeling (NeRF) of 3D twin models. By comparing two digital models, this system\nenables defect detection at the 3D interface of an object.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
