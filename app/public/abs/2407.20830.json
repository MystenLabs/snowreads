However, conventional federated learning techniques have\nprivacy and security vulnerabilities due to the exposure of models, parameters\nor updates, which can be exploited as an attack surface. This paper presents\nFederated Knowledge Recycling (FedKR), a cross-silo federated learning approach\nthat uses locally generated synthetic data to facilitate collaboration between\ninstitutions. FedKR combines advanced data generation techniques with a dynamic\naggregation process to provide greater security against privacy attacks than\nexisting methods, significantly reducing the attack surface. Experimental\nresults on generic and medical datasets show that FedKR achieves competitive\nperformance, with an average improvement in accuracy of 4.24% compared to\ntraining models from local data, demonstrating particular effectiveness in data\nscarcity scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"8mv9jdxQrH7vnO7Aj4P5PhhUuEifMNe83Z3YY5yMbaI","pdfSize":"1231276"}
