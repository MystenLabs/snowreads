Bipolar thermal conductivity analysis performed for their sub-group\nbased on rare-earth (R) metals, RNiSb, indicated on high mobility ratio in\nfavor of electrons. The suggestion found its experimental verification and led\nto significant improvement of thermoelectric properties in $n$-type doped\nseries ScNiSb$_{1-x}$Te$_x$. Recently, an alternative interpretation of\ntransport properties in ScNiSb was proposed, where multi-parameter fit lead to\nmobility ratio in favor of holes. In this work we discuss the details of\nelectrical properties and thermoelectric performance of ScNiSb in context of\nstructural disorder. The article considers also relevant assumptions regarding\nband degeneracy and scattering mechanisms for effective mass modeling in\nScNiSb. Lastly, technical difficulties of the model proposed by the others are\naddressed. We believe, that the provided insight will be useful for\nunderstating electrical transport in half-Heusler compounds, which can\ncontribute to further improvement of their thermoelectric performance.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AQb36agBA1P1wvlbe_RpLo12brQZCPmqgct4axyRw0g","pdfSize":"151352"}
