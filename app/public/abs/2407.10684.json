While public blockchains enhance\ntransparency and reliability, they conflict with confidentiality. To address\nthis, we introduce Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for\nInteroperating Applications (MARTSIA). MARTSIA provides read-access control at\nthe message-part level through user-defined policies and certifier-declared\nattributes, so that only authorized actors can interpret encrypted data while\nall blockchain nodes can verify its integrity. To this end, MARTSIA resorts to\nblockchain, Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption and distributed\nhash-table data-stores.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
