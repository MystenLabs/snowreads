More precisely, we show that on a generic closed Riemannian\nmanifold the distance to the minimizing set of metrics is controlled\nquadratically by the $Q$-curvature energy deficit, extending recent work by\nEngelstein, Neumayer and Spolaor in the case $k=1$. Next we prove, for any\ninteger $1 \\leq k< \\frac{n}{2}$, the existence of an $n$-dimensional Riemannian\nmanifold such that the $k$-th order $Q$-curvature deficit controls a higher\npower of the distance to the minimizing set. We believe that these degenerate\nexamples are of independent interest and can be used for further development in\nthe field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
