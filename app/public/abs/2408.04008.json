We uncover a\ngeneralized fractional Josephson effect with a periodicity that increases\nlinearly with system size in one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ chains at selected\nanisotropies and phase-fixing boundary fields. The effect combines arbitrary\ninteger periodicities in a single system, exceeding the $4\\pi $ and $8\\pi $\nperiodicity of superconducting Josephson effects of Majorana zero modes and\nother exotic quasiparticles. We reveal a universal energy-phase relation and\nconnect the effect to the recently discovered phantom helices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
