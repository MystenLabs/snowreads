These materials exhibit exceptional optical, mechanical,\nand acoustic properties, making them of great interest in materials science and\nengineering. Traditional methods for creating hyperuniform structures,\nincluding collective-coordinate optimization and centroidal Voronoi\ntessellations, have primarily been computational and face challenges in\ncapturing the complexity of naturally occurring systems. This study introduces\na comprehensive theoretical framework to generate hyperuniform structures\ninspired by the collective organization of biological cells within an\nepithelial tissue layer. By adjusting parameters such as cell elasticity and\ninterfacial tension, we explore a spectrum of hyperuniform states from fluid to\nrigid, each exhibiting distinct mechanical properties and types of density\nfluctuations. Our results not only advance the understanding of hyperuniformity\nin biological tissues but also demonstrate the potential of these materials to\ninform the design of novel materials with tailored properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JMKh2DaHTFT_rMOIROV3jdJ_nh-6770_GNZyQgG5-FI","pdfSize":"10408113"}
