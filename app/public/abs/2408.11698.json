Under a certain genericity condition on the rank two\nbundles, we propose a general mechanism to compute the degree two GV invariants\nof local curves. In particular, we determine all the degree two GV invariants\nwhen the base curve has genus two. Combined with previous work by Bryan and\nPandharipande, we obtain the GV/GW correspondence in this case. When the base\ncurve has genus greater than two, we calculate GV invariants for some extremal\ngenera, providing evidence for the GV/GW conjecture for curves of higher genus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
