One approach to achieve this goal is by\npredicting demand at the station level. Bike-sharing systems, as a form of\ntransit service, contribute to the reduction of air and noise pollution, as\nwell as traffic congestion. This study focuses on predicting travel demand\nwithin a bike-sharing system. A novel hybrid deep learning model called the\ngate graph convolutional neural network is introduced. This model enables\nprediction of the travel demand at station level. By integrating trajectory\ndata, weather data, access data, and leveraging gate graph convolution\nnetworks, the accuracy of travel demand forecasting is significantly improved.\nChicago City bike-sharing system is chosen as the case study. In this\ninvestigation, the proposed model is compared to the base models used in\nprevious literature to evaluate their performance, demonstrating that the main\nmodel exhibits better performance than the base models. By utilizing this\nframework, transportation planners can make informed decisions on resource\nallocation and rebalancing management.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
