These super high-resolution images present unique\nchallenges due to their immense size and computational demands. To address\nthis, we introduce 'SaccadeDet', an innovative architecture for gigapixel-level\nobject detection, inspired by the human eye saccadic movement. The cornerstone\nof SaccadeDet is its ability to strategically select and process image regions,\ndramatically reducing computational load. This is achieved through a two-stage\nprocess: the 'saccade' stage, which identifies regions of probable interest,\nand the 'gaze' stage, which refines detection in these targeted areas. Our\napproach, evaluated on the PANDA dataset, not only achieves an 8x speed\nincrease over the state-of-the-art methods but also demonstrates significant\npotential in gigapixel-level pathology analysis through its application to\nWhole Slide Imaging.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
