It forms the\nfoundational basis for the renowned Biot-Savart formula in fluid dynamics, the\ntheoretical solution of the pressure Poisson equation, and et al. Despite their\nimportance, the theoretical derivation of the Green's function is both\ntime-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we employed DISCOVER, an\nadvanced symbolic regression method leveraging symbolic binary trees and\nreinforcement learning, to identify unknown Green's functions for several\nelementary partial differential operators, including Laplace operators,\nHelmholtz operators, and second-order differential operators with jump\nconditions. The Laplace and Helmholtz operators are particularly vital for\nresolving the pressure Poisson equation, while second-order differential\noperators with jump conditions are essential for analyzing multiphase flows and\nshock waves. By incorporating physical hard constraints, specifically symmetry\nproperties inherent to these self-adjoint operators, we significantly enhanced\nthe performance of the DISCOVER framework, potentially doubling its efficacy.\nNotably, the Green's functions discovered for the Laplace and Helmholtz\noperators precisely matched the true Green's functions. Furthermore, for\noperators without known exact Green's functions, such as the periodic Helmholtz\noperator and second-order differential operators with jump conditions, we\nidentified potential Green's functions with solution error on the order of\n10^(-10). This application of symbolic regression to the discovery of Green's\nfunctions represents a pivotal advancement in leveraging artificial\nintelligence to accelerate scientific discoveries, particularly in fluid\ndynamics and related fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
