The decay rate of LFV processes is\ncalculated in the CMSSM model at the grand unified scale ~2\\times{10}^{16} GeV.\nThe upper limit predicted results of LFV processes of branching ratio (BR) of Z\nboson decays for the three decay channels are found to be in the order of\n\\mathrm{~1\\times}{\\mathrm{10}}^{\\mathrm{-9}},\n\\mathrm{~1\\times}{\\mathrm{10}}^{\\mathrm{-9}}and\n\\mathrm{~1\\times}{\\mathrm{10}}^{\\mathrm{-10}} respectively, which corresponds\nwith the predicted sensitivity of the future colliders (FCC-ee/CEPC).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
