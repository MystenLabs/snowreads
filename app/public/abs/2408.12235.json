However, most of the\nexisting adaptive network models fall short of capturing these group dynamics,\nas they focus solely on pairwise interactions. In this study, we employ\nadaptive higher-order networks to describe these systems by proposing a general\nframework incorporating both adaptivity and group interactions. We demonstrate\nthat global synchronization can exist in those complex structures, and we\nprovide the necessary conditions for the emergence of a stable synchronous\nstate. Additionally, we analyzed some relevant settings, and we showed that the\nnecessary condition is strongly related to the master stability equation,\nallowing to separate the dynamical and structural properties. We illustrate our\ntheoretical findings through examples involving adaptive higher-order networks\nof coupled generalized Kuramoto oscillators with phase lag. We also show that\nthe interplay of group interactions and adaptive connectivity results in the\nformation of stability regions that can induce transitions between\nsynchronization and desynchronization\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S1htDryM0kp2RM97aTnUU21kI5l2rpK4MME5_ae3BY0","pdfSize":"1099044"}
