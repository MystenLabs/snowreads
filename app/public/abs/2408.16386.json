In the\npresent work, we begin with a systematic study of such corrections in the\ncontext scalar toy models whose perturbative Bunch-Davies wavefunction enjoys\nan intrinsic definition in terms of cosmological polytopes, focusing on\none-loop graphs. Owing to the underlying twisted period integral representation\nthey admit, their combinatorial structure along with their vector space\nstructure, emerging from polynomial ideals algebra and intersection theory, are\nexploited to set-up and analyse the differential equations that the two- and\nthree-site one-loop corrections have to satisfy upon variation of the external\nkinematic variables. We find that, while the two-site contribution can be\nwritten in terms of multiple-polylogarithms, this is no longer true for the\nthree-site case, for which elliptic structures appear. As a non-trivial check,\nwe consider the scattering amplitude limit, recovering the known result in\nterms of polylogarithms only.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
