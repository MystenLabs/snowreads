The model was proposed in [Giannino, Iuorio, Soresina, forthcoming]\nto account for stable stationary spacial patterns considering only biomass and\ntoxicity, and its fast-reaction (cross-diffusion) limit was formally derived\nand numerically investigated. In this paper, the cross-diffusion limiting\nsystem is rigorously obtained as the fast-reaction limit of the\nreaction-diffusion system with fast-reaction terms by performing a bootstrap\nargument involving energies. Then, a thorough well-posedness analysis of the\ncross-diffusion system is presented, including a $L^\\infty_{x,t}$-bound,\nuniqueness, stability, and regularity of weak solutions. This analysis, in\nturn, becomes crucial to establish the convergence rate for the fast reaction\nlimit, thanks to the key idea of using an inverse Neumann Laplacian operator.\nFinally, numerical experiments illustrate the analytical findings on the\nconvergence rate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
