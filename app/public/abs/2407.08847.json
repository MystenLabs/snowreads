Many quantum\nmachine learning techniques have been developed for solving classification\nproblems, such as distinguishing between phases of matter or quantum processes.\nSimilarly, one can consider a more general problem of regression, when the task\nis to predict continuous labels quantifying some property of quantum states,\nsuch as purity or entanglement. In this work, we propose a data-agnostic method\nfor predicting such properties. The method is based on the notion of\nparametrized quantum circuits, and it seeks to find an observable the\nexpectation of which gives the estimation of the property of interest with\npresumably low variance. We numerically test our approach in learning to\npredict (i) the parameter of a parametrized channel given its output state,\n(ii) entanglement of two-qubit states, and (iii) the parameter of a\nparametrized Hamiltonian given its ground state. The results show that the\nproposed method is able to find observables such that they provide highly\naccurate predictions of the considered properties, and in some cases even\nsaturate the Cramer-Rao bound, which characterizes the prediction error.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
