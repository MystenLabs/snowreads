In this\nwork, we propose for sparse Gaussian Process Regression type MLIP a stochastic\nuncertainty measure akin to the query-by-committee approach often used in\nconjunction with neural network based MLIPs. The uncertainty measure is coined\n\\textit{\"label noise\"} ensemble uncertainty as it emerges from adding noise to\nthe energy labels in the training data. We find that this method of calculating\nan ensemble uncertainty is as well calibrated as the one obtained from the\nclosed-form expression for the posterior variance when the sparse GPR is\ntreated as a projected process. Comparing the two methods, our proposed\nensemble uncertainty is, however, faster to evaluate than the closed-form\nexpression. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed uncertainty measure acts\nbetter to support a Bayesian search for optimal structure of Au$_{20}$\nclusters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"igSBhxlwSequd1YWPDfQtY5cLWpHmL6wdb7B48AhaPM","pdfSize":"700523"}
