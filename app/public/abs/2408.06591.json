Since the PN Hamiltonian has a particular formulation that\nincludes a dominant Newtonian part and a perturbation PN part, we present the\ngeneralized flow-composed Runge--Kutta (GFCRK) method with a free parameter\n$\\lambda$ to PN Hamiltonian systems. It is shown that the GFCRK method is\nsymplectic once the underlying RK method is symplectic, and it is symmetric\nonce the underlying RK method is symmetric under the setting $\\lambda=1/2$.\nNumerical experiments with the 2PN Hamiltonian of spinning compact binaries\ndemonstrate the higher accuracy and efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method\nthan the underlying symplectic RK. Meanwhile, the numerical results also\nsupport higher efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method than the semi-explicit\nmixed symplectic method of the same order.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
