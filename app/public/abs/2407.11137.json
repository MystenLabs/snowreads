We shall call\nthis effect quantum bungee jumping: in the familiar quantum tunneling scenario\none heading towards a wall is expected to bounce off it but instead passes\nthrough, while in the present scenario one jumping off a cliff is expected to\nfall but instead is pulled back. We discuss a particular example of a potential\ndisplaying this property, and study its energy eigenstates and spectrum.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
