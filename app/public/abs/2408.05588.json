As it is with classical networking, a simulation ecosystem\nallows for application development, standardization, and overall community\nbuilding. Currently, there is limited traction towards building a quantum\nnetworking community-there are limited open-source platforms, challenging\nframeworks with steep learning curves, and strong requirements of software\nengineering skills. Our Quantum Network Development Kit (QNDK) project aims to\nsolve these issues. It includes a graphical user interface to easily develop\nand run quantum network simulations with very little code. It integrates\nvarious quantum network simulation engines and provides a single interface to\nthem, allowing users to use the features from any of them. Further, it deploys\nsimulation execution in a cloud environment, offloading strong computing\nrequirements to a high-performance computing system. In this paper, we detail\nthe core features of the QNDK and outline the development roadmap to enabling\nvirtual quantum testbeds.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LLi4uiSb5BNYYphjDopY0HRm1TsyRfDTXT38UJ1h7M8","pdfSize":"898806"}
