Let\n$\\mathcal{K}_n=(\\mathcal{V}_n,\\mathcal{E}_n)$ be the complete graph with $n$\nvertices and $o\\in\\mathcal{V}_n$ be a special vertex called the root.\nInitially, $1+\\eta_o$ active particles are placed at the root and $\\eta_v$\ninactive particles are placed at each other vertex\n$v\\in\\mathcal{V}_n\\setminus\\{o\\}$, where $\\{\\eta_v\\}_{v\\in \\mathcal{V}_n}$ are\ni.i.d. random variables. At each instant of time, each active particle may die\nwith probability $1-p$. Every active particle performs a simple random walk on\n$\\mathcal{K}_n$ until the moment it dies, activating all inactive particles it\nhits along its path. Let $V_\\infty(\\mathcal{K}_n,p)$ be the total number of\nvisited vertices by some active particle up to the end of the process, after\nall active particles have died. In this paper, we show that\n$V_\\infty(\\mathcal{K}_n,p_n)\\geq (1-\\epsilon)n$ with high probability for any\nfixed $\\epsilon>0$ whenever $p_n\\rightarrow 1$. Furthermore, we establish the\ncritical growth rate of $p_n$ so that all vertices are visited. Specifically,\nwe show that if $p_n=1-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\log n}$, then\n$V_\\infty(\\mathcal{K}_n,p_n)=n$ with high probability whenever\n$0<\\alpha<E(\\eta)$ and $V_\\infty(\\mathcal{K}_n,p_n)<n$ with high probability\nwhenever $\\alpha>E(\\eta)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
