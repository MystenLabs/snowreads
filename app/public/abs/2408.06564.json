We model this by an inhomogeneous and possibly anisotropic medium\nwith embedded obstacles and the EM waves cannot penetrate inside the obstacles.\nSuch a situation naturally arises in studying inverse EM scattering problems\nfrom complex mediums with partial boundary measurements, or inverse problems\nfrom EM mediums with metal inclusions. We develop a novel theoretical framework\nby showing that the embedded obstacles can be effectively approximated by a\ncertain isotropic medium with a specific choice of material parameters. We\nderive sharp estimates to verify this effective approximation and also discuss\nthe practical implications of our results to the inverse problems mentioned\nabove, which are longstanding topics in inverse scattering theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SLC9Whb8Tw-wOVqaqIZyiSToRZjHVE2uqu7_aTAS1Qw","pdfSize":"716668"}
