This process is successfully demonstrated\nin general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the\ncoordinate system regular on the event horizon, by which one can estimate the\noutward Poynting flux, although the direct energy release through the horizon\nshown in the simulations does not provide an intuitive picture. We revisit the\nmechanism of BH energy reduction by utilizing the coordinate system singular on\nthe horizon, in which the falling membrane of past accreted matter should exist\nabove the horizon. We find that the Poynting flux is produced at the boundary\nbetween the falling membrane and the magnetically-dominated inflow, and the\nfront of the inflow creates the negative electromagnetic energy, which reduces\nthe rotational energy of spacetime. We also clarify that the poloidal electric\ncurrent does not form a closed circuit within the magnetically-dominated flow.\nPrevious interpretations of the BZ process and possibilities of the ideal MHD\nviolation and BH charging are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
