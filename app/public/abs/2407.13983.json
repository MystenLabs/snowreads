To close this loophole, we propose a practical\nCVQSS scheme using local LO (LLO), which is called LLO-CVQSS. In this scheme,\nLO is no longer generated by each user but can be locally generated by the\nlegitimate party, i.e., the dealer. This waives the necessity that all LOs have\nto be transmitted through an untrusted channel, which makes CVQSS system\nnaturally immune to all LO-aimed attacks, greatly enhancing its practical\nsecurity. We also develop a specially designed phase compensation method for\nLLO-CVQSS so that the phase noise of the whole system can be eliminated. We\nfinally construct a noise model for LLO-CVQSS and derive its security bound\nagainst both eavesdroppers and dishonest users. Numerical simulation shows that\nLLO-CVQSS is able to support 30 users at the same time and its maximal\ntransmission distance reaches 112 km, revealing that LLO-CVQSS is not only has\nthe ability to defend itself against all LO-aimed attacks but also has the\npotential for building large-scale practical quantum communication networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
