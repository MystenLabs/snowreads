There has been a\nlong line of work showing upper bounds on this density. One curious feature of\ndense unit distance avoiding sets is that they appear to be ``clumpy,'' i.e.\nforbidding unit distances comes hand in hand with having more than the expected\nnumber distance $\\approx 2$ pairs.\n  In this work we rigorously establish this phenomenon in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We\nshow that dense unit distance avoiding sets have over-represented distance\n$\\approx 2$ pairs, and that this clustering extends to typical unit distance\navoiding sets. To do so, we build off of the linear programming approach used\npreviously to prove upper bounds on the density of unit distance avoiding sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
