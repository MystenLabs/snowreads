This symmetry of the\nflux-density variability is consistent with earlier work, and we interpret it\nas caused by the dominance of Doppler boosting, as opposed to gravitational\nlensing, in Sgr~A*'s light curve. A relativistic, semi-physical model of Sgr~A*\nconfirms an inclination angle $i<45$ degrees. The model also shows that the\nemission of the intrinsic radiative process can have some asymmetry even though\nthe observed emission does not. The third-moment structure function, which is a\nmeasure of the skewness of the light-curve increments, may be a useful summary\nstatistic in other contexts of astronomy because it senses only temporal\nasymmetry, i.e., it averages to zero for any temporally symmetric signal.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
