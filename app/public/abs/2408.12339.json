Although the merits of graphons to describe large and unlabelled\nnetworks are clear, they traditionally are used for describing only binary edge\ninformation, which limits their utility for more complex relational data.\nDecorated graphons were introduced to extend the graphon framework by\nincorporating richer relationships, such as edge weights and types. This\nspecificity in modelling connections provides more granular insight into\nnetwork dynamics. Yet, there are no existing inference techniques for decorated\ngraphons. We develop such an estimation method, extending existing techniques\nfrom traditional graphon estimation to accommodate these richer interactions.\nWe derive the rate of convergence for our method and show that it is consistent\nwith traditional non-parametric theory when the decoration space is finite.\nSimulations confirm that these theoretical rates are achieved in practice. Our\nmethod, tested on synthetic and empirical data, effectively captures additional\nedge information, resulting in improved network models. This advancement\nextends the scope of graphon estimation to encompass more complex networks,\nsuch as multiplex networks and attributed graphs, thereby increasing our\nunderstanding of their underlying structures.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
