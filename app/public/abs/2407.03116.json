We leverage programmable\nsingle-qubit rotations and global spin-spin interactions among all ions,\nreducing the dependence on resource-intensive two-qubit gates in conventional\ngate-based methods. We apply HEA-TI to state engineering of cluster states and\nanalyze the scaling of required quantum resources. We also apply HEA-TI to\nsolve the ground state problem of chemical molecules $\\mathrm{H_{2}}$,\n$\\mathrm{LiH}$ and $\\mathrm{F_{2}}$. We numerically analyze the quantum\ncomputing resources required to achieve chemical accuracy and examine the\nperformance under realistic experimental noise and statistical fluctuation. The\nefficiency of this ansatz is shown to be comparable to other commonly used\nvariational ansatzes like UCCSD, with the advantage of substantially easier\nimplementation in the trapped-ion quantum simulator. This approach showcases\nthe hardware-efficient ansatz as a powerful tool for the application of the\nnear-term quantum computer.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
