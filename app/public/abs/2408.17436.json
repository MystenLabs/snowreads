This work focuses on\ninvestigating the FCNC process $B_{c}\\to D_{s}^{*} \\left(\\to\nD_{s}\\pi\\right)\\ell^{+}\\ell^{-}(\\ell=e,\\mu,\\tau)$. Being an exclusive process,\nthe initial and final state meson matrix elements involve the form factors,\nwhich are non-perturbative quantities and need to be calculated using specific\nmodels. By using the form factors calculated in the covariant light-front quark\nmodel, we analyze the branching fractions and angular observables such as the\nforward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$, polarization fractions (Longitudinal and\ntransverse) $F_{L(T)}$, CP asymmetry coefficients $A_{i}$ and CP-averaged\nangular coefficients $S_{i}$, both in the SM and some new physics (NP)\nscenarios. Some of these physical observables are a potential source of finding\nthe physics beyond the SM and help us distinguish various NP scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1OztGBXiaYurQZAmCpQTbpTyKzPw-wWU4j_uyed_6E8","pdfSize":"1162494"}
