To address these drawbacks, we present IG-SLAM, a dense RGB-only\nSLAM system that employs robust Dense-SLAM methods for tracking and combines\nthem with Gaussian Splatting. A 3D map of the environment is constructed using\naccurate pose and dense depth provided by tracking. Additionally, we utilize\ndepth uncertainty in map optimization to improve 3D reconstruction. Our decay\nstrategy in map optimization enhances convergence and allows the system to run\nat 10 fps in a single process. We demonstrate competitive performance with\nstate-of-the-art RGB-only SLAM systems while achieving faster operation speeds.\nWe present our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and EuRoC\ndatasets. The system achieves photo-realistic 3D reconstruction in large-scale\nsequences, particularly in the EuRoC dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"mcdtQtkSSPLGDX8ARKuOp6lly-Oq1iiG9huausJ0NEE","pdfSize":"4975186"}
