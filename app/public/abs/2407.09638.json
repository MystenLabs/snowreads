Respect for the elderly\nis endogenous. Parents cultivate an interest in consuming culture in their\nchildren; when they are older, children compensate their elders proportional to\nthe degree to which their interests were previously cultivated. We show that\nthis model is functionally equivalent to one in which cultural goods are\ntransferred across generations. We focus on the relative well-being of the\nelderly and use the model to explain patterns in their relative well-being\nacross societies. An important theme is that the cultivation of culture and\nnorms for the respect and support of the elderly bear a nonlinear relationship\nwith many economic variables, such as capital and or land intensity in\nproduction. We also discuss the interaction of property rights with production,\nassets such as productive resources, and relative treatment of the elderly.\nInsecurity of some types of property rights, such as rights over output, may\nbenefit the elderly, while secure rights over productive resources may also\nbenefit the elderly. We discuss how the elderly could be affected by\ndemographic, technological and policy changes in both developing and developed\neconomies.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
