We observed the BOAT with XMM-Newton 2.3 d after the prompt. The\nX-ray afterglow was still very bright and we collected the largest number of\nphotons with the Reflection Grating Spectrometers (RGS) on a GRB. We searched\nthe RGS data for narrow emission or absorption features. We did not detect any\nbright line feature. A candidate narrow feature is identified at a (rest-frame)\nenergy of 1.455+0.006-0.014 keV, consistent with an Mg XII K{\\alpha} emission\nline, slightly redshifted (0.012) with respect to the host galaxy. We assessed\na marginal statistical significance of 3.0sigma for this faint feature based on\nconservative Monte Carlo simulations, which requires caution for any physical\ninterpretation. If this line feature would be for real, we propose that it\nmight originate from the reflection in the innermost regions of the infalling\nfunnel from low-level late-time activity emission of the central engine.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
