For theories whose $\\beta$-function is determined by the\nanomalous dimensions of the fields, such as supersymmetric theories, this\ncorresponds to a renormalisation scheme change to a momentum subtraction\nscheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vSHsvXiUPW5cOdjTamjS57fK259neeHyw5Ytmfl-JPk","pdfSize":"132250"}
