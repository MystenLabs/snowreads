We consider a new\nperspective on interference management using semantic communication.\nSpecifically, a multi-user semantic communication system is considered on\nmoderate interference channels (ICs), for which a novel framework of deep\nlearning-based prompt-assisted semantic interference cancellation (DeepPASIC)\nis proposed. Each transmitted signal is partitioned into common and private\nparts. The common parts of different users are transmitted simultaneously in a\nshared medium, resulting in superposition. The private part, on the other hand,\nserves as a prompt to assist in canceling the interference suffered by the\ncommon part at the semantic level. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed DeepPASIC outperforms conventional interference management strategies\nunder moderate interference conditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
