Associate a graph $\\mathcal{E}_G$ (called the co-Engel\ngraph of $G$) with $G$ whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $x$\nand $y$ are adjacent if $[x, {}_k y] \\neq 1$ and $[y, {}_k x] \\neq 1$ for all\npositive integer $k$. This graph, under the name ``Engel graph'', was\nintroduced by Abdollahi. Let $L(G)$ be the set of all left Engel elements of\n$G$. In this paper, we realize the induced subgraph of co-Engel graphs of\ncertain finite non-Engel groups $G$ induced by $G \\setminus L(G)$. We write\n$\\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ to denote the subgraph of $\\mathcal{E}_G$ induced by $G\n\\setminus L(G)$. We also compute genus, various spectra, energies and Zagreb\nindices of $\\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ for those groups. As a consequence, we determine\n(up to isomorphism) all finite non-Engel group $G$ such that the clique number\nis at most $4$ and $\\mathcal{E}^-$ is toroidal or projective. Further, we show\nthat $\\coeng{G}$ is super integral and satisfies the E-LE conjecture and the\nHansen--Vuki{\\v{c}}evi{\\'c} conjecture for the groups considered in this paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uyTFX7b2zt_xLpiKrH-jpx3FndRMJi3IjFJrf6sGm7A","pdfSize":"249918"}
