Our main contribution consists of\nresolving several long-standing open questions in this context. For most of\nthese questions, we obtain the first quantitative improvement over power-of-$2$\npolicies and their nearby derivatives, which have been state-of-the-art in\nterms of provable performance guarantees since the mid-80's.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
