In this model, each site $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ starts closed\nand an attempt to open it occurs at time $t=t_s$, where $(t_s)_{s \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^2}$ is a sequence of independent random variables uniformly\ndistributed on the interval $[0,1]$. The site will open if the volume\ndifference between the two largest clusters adjacent to it is greater than or\nequal to a constant $r$ or if it has at most one adjacent cluster. Through\nnumerical analysis, we determine the critical threshold $t_c(r)$ for various\nvalues of $r$, verifying that $t_c(r)$ is non-decreasing in $r$ and that there\nexists a critical value $r_c=5$ beyond which percolation does not occur.\nAdditionally, when $t=1$ and $1 \\leq r \\leq 9$, we estimate the averages of the\ndensity of open sites, the number of distinct cluster volumes, and the volume\nof the largest cluster.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
