We reveal that the\nswallowtail degeneracy structure enables nontrivial braiding of complex\neigenvalues by looping around an exceptional line in the parameter space. Our\nfindings provide a comprehensive understanding of the degeneracy geometry in\ntwo-mode driven-dissipative bosonic quadratic systems, opening new pathways\ntoward topologically nontrivial control of Gaussian states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
