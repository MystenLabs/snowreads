Currently, two potential methods exist to achieve this objective.\nThe first involves using inverted harmonic potential (IHP) to spatially\ndelocalize quantum states through coherent inflation [1]. The second method\nemploys a spin-dependent force to separate two massive wave packets spatially\n[2]. The disadvantage of the former method is the slow initial coherent\ninflation, while the latter is hindered by the diamagnetism of spin-embedded\nnanocrystals, which suppresses spatial separation. In this study, we integrate\ntwo methods: first, we use the spin-dependent force to generate initial spatial\nseparation, and second, we use IHP to achieve coherent inflating trajectories\nof the wavepackets. This approach enables the attainment of massive large\nspatial superposition in minimal time. For instance, a spatial superposition\nwith a mass of $10^{-15}$ kg and a size of 50 $\\mu$m is realized in $0.1$\nseconds. We also calculate the evolution of wave packets in both harmonic\npotential (HP) and IHP using path integral approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
