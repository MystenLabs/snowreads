The vibroacoustic model consists of a plate\ncoupled to a fluid into which the plate radiates sound due to a turbulent\nboundary layer excitation. This excitation is subject to uncertainties due to\nthe stochastic nature of the turbulence and the computational cost of\nsimulating the coupled problem with stochastic forcing is very high. The\nproposed method approximates the output uncertainties in an efficient way, by\nreducing the evaluation cost of the model in terms of DOFs and samples by using\nthe factors of the SVD low-rank approximation directly as input for the MOR\nalgorithm. Here, the covariance matrix of the vector of unknowns can\nefficiently be approximated with only a fraction of the original number of\nevaluations. Therefore, the approach is a promising step to further reducing\nthe computational effort of large-scale vibroacoustic evaluations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
