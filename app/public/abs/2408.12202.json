The\ngoal of this review is to endow the reader with a deep knowledge of the\nhistorical and latest tools to monitor mitochondrial calcium events in the\nbrain, as well as a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in\nbrain mitochondrial calcium signaling. We will discuss the main calcium probes\nused in the field, their mitochondrial targeting strategies, their key\nproperties and major drawbacks. In addition, we will detail the main roles of\nmitochondrial calcium handling in neuronal tissues through an extended report\nof the recent studies using mitochondrial targeted calcium sensors in neuronal\nand astroglial cells, in vitro and in vivo.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
