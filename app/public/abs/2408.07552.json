Given that the 3-5 {\\mu}m mid-infrared\n(MIR) band has extremely low solar background radiation and strong scattering\nresistance, it is one of the ideal bands for free-space quantum communication.\nHere, firstly, we report on the preparation of a high-quality MIR (3370 nm) and\ntelecom band (1555 nm) two-color polarization-entangled photon source, then we\nuse this source to realize a principle QKD based on free-space and fiber hybrid\nchannels in a laboratory. The theoretical analysis clearly shows that a\nlong-distance QKD over 500 km of free-space and 96 km of fiber hybrid channels\ncan be reached simultaneously. This work represents a significant step toward\ndeveloping all-day global-scale quantum communication networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
