A pair of vertices\nfrom communities $i,j$ is given label $\\ell$ with probability\n$p_{ij}^{(\\ell)}$, and the goal is to recover the community partition. We\npropose a simple spectral algorithm for exact community recovery, and show that\nit achieves the information-theoretic threshold in the logarithmic-degree\nregime, under the assumption that the eigenvalues of certain parameter matrices\nare distinct and nonzero. Our results generalize recent work of Dhara, Gaudio,\nMossel, and Sandon (2023), who showed that a spectral algorithm achieves the\ninformation-theoretic threshold in the Censored SBM, which is equivalent to the\nLSBM with $L = 2$. Interestingly, their algorithm uses eigenvectors from two\nmatrix representations of the graph, while our algorithm uses eigenvectors from\n$L$ matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QiNSqV0eVNnifqoq-ThsA-Bk5O5VgJNJ7fzsdpGkK6w","pdfSize":"221553"}
