The focus\nis on control, scheduling, and resource allocation for sensory observation to\nensure timely delivery to the DT model deployed in the cloud. \\phuc{Timely and\nrelevant information, as characterized by optimized data acquisition policy and\nlow latency, are instrumental in ensuring that the DT model can accurately\nestimate and predict system states. However, optimizing closed-loop control\nwith DT and acquiring data for efficient state estimation and control computing\npose a non-trivial problem given the limited network resources, partial state\nvector information, and measurement errors encountered at distributed sensing\nagents.} To address this, we propose the \\emph{Age-of-Loop REinforcement\nlearning and Variational Extended Kalman filter with Robust Belief\n(AoL-REVERB)}, which leverages an uncertainty-control reinforcement learning\nsolution combined with an algorithm based on Value of Information (VoI) for\nperforming optimal control and selecting the most informative sensors to\nsatisfy the prediction accuracy of DT. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nDT platform can offer satisfactory performance while halving the communication\noverhead.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KrVOMxpqXzCSEWI2uRH018tJeQMXuwkhyMlB-PBzOlE","pdfSize":"1448463"}
