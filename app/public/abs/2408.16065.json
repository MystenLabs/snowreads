By\nemploying the massive spinor-helicity formalism we identify the interactions\nwhich have a smooth massless limit as expected from the superHiggs mechanism.\nThese interactions are then used to on-shell construct four-point massive\nspin-3/2 amplitudes using an all-line transverse shift for the external\nmomenta, which correctly reproduces the contact gravitino interactions in the\n$N=1$ supergravity Lagrangian. The on-shell constructed four-point amplitudes\nare also used to derive well-known unitarity bounds in supergravity. In\nparticular, by adding scalar and pseudoscalar interactions to construct the\nfour-point massive spin-3/2 amplitudes that scale as $E^2$ in the high-energy\nlimit, we recover the on-shell Polonyi model with a Planck scale unitarity\nbound. These effective three-point interactions and on-shell recursion\nrelations provide an alternative and simpler way to study the interactions of\nmassive spin-3/2 particles without a Lagrangian or the use of Feynman diagrams.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
