We begin by examining two\nextreme cases of voting weight distributions: Equal-Weight (EW), where each\nvoter has equal voting weight, and Dominant-Weight (DW), where a single voter\nholds a majority of the voting weights before any delegation occurs. We show\nthat vote delegation tends to benefit the ex-ante minority under EW, i.e., the\nalternative with a lower initial probability of winning. The converse holds\nunder DW distribution. Through numerical simulations, we extend our findings to\narbitrary voting weight distributions, showing that vote delegation benefits\nthe ex-ante majority when it leads to a more balanced distribution of voting\nweights. Finally, in large communities where all agents have equal voting\nweight, vote delegation has a negligible impact on the outcome. These insights\nprovide practical guidance for governance decisions in blockchains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
