This gives the first example of a locally checkable coloring problem\nwhich is known to have a Baire measurable solution on Borel graphs but not a\ncomputable solution on highly computable graphs. We also prove the analogous\nresult in the measure setting for hyperfinite graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
