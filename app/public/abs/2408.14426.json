Our model is used to compute the\nnuclear modification factor $R_{AB}$ of light and heavy flavor hadrons,\naveraged over realistic collision geometries for central and peripheral $A+A$\nand central $p / d / {}^3\\text{He} + A$ collisions at LHC and RHIC. We find\nthat the predicted suppression in small systems is almost entirely due to\nelastic energy loss. Our results are keenly sensitive to the crossover between\nelastic energy loss calculated with Hard Thermal Loop propagators and vacuum\npropagators, respectively, which leads to a large theoretical uncertainty. We\nfind that the $R_{AB}$ is largely insensitive to the form of the elastic energy\nloss distribution - Gaussian or Poisson - surprisingly so in small systems\nwhere the central limit theorem is inapplicable. We present an expansion of the\n$R_{AB}$ in terms of the moments of the energy loss probability distribution,\nwhich allows for a rigorous understanding of the dependence of the $R_{AB}$ on\nthe underlying energy loss distribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
