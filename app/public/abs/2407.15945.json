We show here that a variant of an entanglement enabled intensity\ninterferometry ($E^2 I^2$) proposed by Cotler and Wilczek provides a powerful\nalternative to HBT interferometry in extracting fundamental nonperturbative\nfeatures of QCD at high energies. In particular, we show that the spatial\ndistributions of color singlet (pomeron) configurations in nuclei can be\nobtained from exclusive resonant decays of $\\rho$-mesons into $\\pi^\\pm$-pairs\nin ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions (UPCs) at RHIC and the\nLHC. The $E^2 I^2$ framework developed here is quite general. It can be\nemployed to extract information on the spin structure of pomeron couplings as\nwell as enhance the discovery potential for rare odderon configurations from\nexclusive vector meson decays into few-particle final states both in UPCs and\nat the Electron-Ion Collider.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
