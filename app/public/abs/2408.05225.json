The\njustification of differentiation formulas is made by using the concept of the\nuniform convergence. This approach is applied to the Mittag-Leffler function\ndepending on two parameters and, additionally, for the 3-parametric\nMittag-Leffler functions (namely, for the Prabhakar function and the Le Roy\ntype functions), as well as for the 4-parametric Mittag-Leffler function (and,\nin particular, for theWright function). The differentiation with respect to the\ninvolved parameters is discussed also in case those special functions which are\nrepresented via the Mellin-Barnes integrals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
