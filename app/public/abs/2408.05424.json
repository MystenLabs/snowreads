The concept of Inverse symmetric division\ndeg index $(ISDD)$ was introduced in the chemical graph theory very recently.\nIn spite of this, a few papers have already appeared with this index in the\nliterature. Ghorbani et al. proposed Inverse symmetric division deg index and\nis defined as $$ISDD(G)=\\sum\\limits_{v_iv_j\\in\nE(G)}\\,\\displaystyle{\\frac{d_id_j}{d^2_i+d^2_j}},$$ where $d_i$ is the degree\nof the vertex $v_i$ in $G$. In this paper, we obtain some lower and upper\nbounds on the inverse symmetric division deg index $(ISDD)$ of graphs in terms\nof various graph parameters, with identifying extremal graphs. Moreover, we\npresent two relations between the Inverse symmetric division deg index and the\nvarious topological indices of graphs. Finally, we give concluding remarks with\nfuture work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fQoMuhSm0XNAXQ81v5FCWzLsHtIpNElQNoh5r67qG4k","pdfSize":"201505"}
