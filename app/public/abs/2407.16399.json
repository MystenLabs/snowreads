Our approximation method is equivalent to the well\nknown Milstein scheme as long as the rate of convergence is concerned, i.e. it\nis strongly convergent with order one, but has the additional desirable\nproperty of being exact for linear diffusion coefficients. Our approach is\ninspired by Wick-type Wong-Zakai arguments in the sense that we only smooth the\nwhite noise through polygonal approximation of the Brownian motion while keep\nthe equation in differential form. A first order Taylor expansion of the\ndiffusion coefficient allows us to solve the resulting equation explicitly and\nhence to provide an implementable approximation scheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
