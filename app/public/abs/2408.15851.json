Its experimental\nconfiguration makes it possible to distinguish between all three neutrino\nflavours, opening a unique opportunity to probe physics of heavy flavour\nproduction at the LHC in the region that is not accessible to ATLAS, CMS and\nLHCb. It can also explore lepton flavour universality in the neutral sector,\nand search for feebly interacting particles. The detector has been commissioned\nand installed in 2021-2022. A first set of data has since then been collected,\nproviding the first observation of neutrinos produced at a collider. This paper\ndiscusses the detector technologies being used to study high-energy neutrinos\nat the LHC, and their performance in terms of physics reach. The necessary\nupgrades to operate at high-luminosity LHC are presented, as well as a proposed\nexperiment to perform neutrino measurements at the newly approved Beam Dump\nFacility.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
