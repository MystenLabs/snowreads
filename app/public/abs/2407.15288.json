Thus, the E2E SLA should be decomposed to partial\nSLAs, assigned to each of these domains. Assuming a two level management\narchitecture consisting of an E2E service orchestrator and local domain\ncontrollers, we consider that the former is only aware of historical data of\nthe local controllers' responses to previous slice requests, and captures this\nknowledge in a risk model per domain. In this study, we propose the use of\nNeural Network (NN) based risk models, using such historical data, to decompose\nthe E2E SLA. Specifically, we introduce models that incorporate monotonicity,\napplicable even in cases involving small datasets. An empirical study on a\nsynthetic multidomain dataset demonstrates the efficiency of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
