In this paper, we propose\nForest2Seq, a framework that formulates indoor scene synthesis as an\norder-aware sequential learning problem. Forest2Seq organizes the inherently\nunordered collection of scene objects into structured, ordered hierarchical\nscene trees and forests. By employing a clustering-based algorithm and a\nbreadth-first traversal, Forest2Seq derives meaningful orderings and utilizes a\ntransformer to generate realistic 3D scenes autoregressively. Experimental\nresults on standard benchmarks demonstrate Forest2Seq's superiority in\nsynthesizing more realistic scenes compared to top-performing baselines, with\nsignificant improvements in FID and KL scores. Our additional experiments for\ndownstream tasks and ablation studies also confirm the importance of\nincorporating order as a prior in 3D scene generation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fdvkSQEFJ0ntdAEHYMYBz_fSSeBkHuIRBRCM533SCtU","pdfSize":"14839300"}
