Working in a minimal realistic extension of\nthe Standard Model by two right-handed neutrino flavours, we show that the\nnon-observation of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ will impose strong bounds on the heavy\nneutrino properties that are complementary to the limits obtained from Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis and collider searches. For an inverted mass hierarchy of the\nlight neutrinos we find that improved limits on $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ from\nnext-generation experiments will restrict the allowed parameter space for fixed\nmass splitting to narrow bands in the mass-mixing plane. Further combining this\nwith the requirement to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via\nleptogenesis reduces these bands to windows in parameter space that are\nconstrained in all directions and can be targeted by direct searches at\naccelerators. For a normal mass hierarchy, only parts of the parameter space\ncan be probed by such experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
