We simulate the time evolution\nof one-dimensional ${\\bf Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on IBM's superconducting\n156-qubit device ibm\\_fez. We consider the Floquet circuit made of the Trotter\ndecomposition of Hamiltonian evolution and focus on its dynamics toward\nthermalization. Quantum simulation with the help of error mitigation is\nsuccessful in running the Floquet circuit made of $38$ and $116$ qubits up to\n$10$ Trotter steps in the best case. This is enough to reach the early stage of\nprethermalization. Our work would be a benchmark for the potential power of\nquantum computing for high-energy physics problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4rd33UVBhlTLpEG4rI5GmLSNjjR098m7tfW_SrXWfSk","pdfSize":"697831"}
