In quantum simulation and learning of quantum many-body\nsystems, an important subroutine consists of implementing a controlled\nHamiltonian time-evolution. Given only black-box access to the uncontrolled\nevolution $e^{-iHt}$, controlizing it, i.e., implementing\n$\\mathrm{ctrl}(e^{-iHt}) = |0\\langle\\rangle 0|\\otimes I + |1\\langle\\rangle 1\n|\\otimes e^{-iHt}$ is non-trivial. Controlization has been recently used in\nquantum algorithms for transforming unknown Hamiltonian dynamics [OKTM24]\nleveraging a scheme introduced in Refs. [NSM15, DNSM21]. The main idea behind\nthe scheme is to intersperse the uncontrolled evolution with suitable\noperations such that the overall dynamics approximates the desired controlled\nevolution. Although efficient, this scheme uses operations randomly sampled\nfrom an exponentially large set. In the present work, we show that more\nefficient controlization schemes can be constructed with the help of orthogonal\narrays for unknown 2-local Hamiltonians. This construction can also be\ngeneralized to $k$-local Hamiltonians. Moreover, our controlization schemes\nbased on orthogonal arrays can take advantage of the interaction graph's\nstructure and be made more efficient.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IcBpPxFsupv-gs_S_8xAvWWtzvi0LEeljC4x14zWSPE","pdfSize":"526746"}
