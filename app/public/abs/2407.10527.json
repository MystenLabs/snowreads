The measured spectra are used to study the $p_{\\rm T}$ and rapidity\ndependence of the coalescence parameter $B_2$, which quantifies the coalescence\nprobability of antideuterons. The $p_{\\rm T}$ and rapidity dependence of the\nobtained $B_2$ is extrapolated for $p_{\\rm T}> 1.7$ GeV/$c$ and $|y|>0.7$ using\nthe phenomenological antideuteron production model implemented in PYTHIA 8.3 as\nwell as a baryon coalescence afterburner model based on EPOS 3. Such\nmeasurements are of interest to the astrophysics community, since they can be\nused for the calculation of the flux of antinuclei from cosmic rays, in\ncombination with coalescence models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UsGo7EQ4m1O4g8oOIXy7ZehIuFbq51bWGrEunLcy2iw","pdfSize":"876345"}
