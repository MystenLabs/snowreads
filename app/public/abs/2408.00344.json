Indeed, for many applications, the target sound signal and its\nspatial cues carry important information about the sound source. Binaural TSE\ncan be realized with a neural network trained to output only the desired sound\ngiven a binaural mixture and an embedding characterizing the desired sound\nclass as inputs. Conventional TSE systems are trained using signal-level\nlosses, which measure the difference between the extracted and reference\nsignals for the left and right channels. In this paper, we propose adding\nexplicit spatial losses to better preserve the spatial cues of the target\nsound. In particular, we explore losses aiming at preserving the interaural\nlevel (ILD), phase (IPD), and time differences (ITD). We show experimentally\nthat adding such spatial losses, particularly our newly proposed ITD loss,\nhelps preserve better spatial cues while maintaining the signal-level metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tnoBnPrbtz1dXgz9QxfG3hED4UWurC0sGVnab2hmPdQ","pdfSize":"325528","txDigest":"VW93fTGWkjWt2hiHS2akLW3yaQcL9qm6fHBi95dNk87","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
