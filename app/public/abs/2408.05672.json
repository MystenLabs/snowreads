A\ncomprehensive survey of stochastic calculus principles applied to option\npricing is offered, highlighting insights from Peter Carr and Lorenzo\nTorricelli's ``Convex Duality in Continuous Option Pricing Models\". This\nmanuscript adopts techniques such as Monte-Carlo Simulation and machine\nlearning algorithms to examine the propositions of Carr and Torricelli, drawing\ncomparisons between the Logistic and Bachelier models. Additionally, it\nsuggests directions for potential future research on option pricing methods.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s1Q-xbkqjD57wpK2C9YGn4lInfcPmqnz8J8G2re1dYA","pdfSize":"1289761"}
