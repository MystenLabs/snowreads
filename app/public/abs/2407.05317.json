We show\nthat the inclusion can be uniquely recovered from a single measurement. We also\nderive a stability estimate of Lipschitz type of the inversion. The proof of\nstability is based on an integral representation and a new observability\ninequality for the wave equation with piecewise constant speed that is of\ninterest itself.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
