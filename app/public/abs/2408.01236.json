Here we provide an experimental realization of such\nsystems in terms of organic radicals on a metallic surface. The ground state of\norganic radicals is a Kramer's doublet that can be modeled by a spin 1/2 degree\nof freedom. Using on-surface synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\ntip manipulation, one can controllably engineer and characterize chains of\norganic radicals on a Au(111) surface. The spatial-resolved differential\nconductance reveals site-dependent low-energy excitations, which support the\npicture of emergent many-body Kondo physics. Using quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we show that a Kondo lattice model of spin chains on a metallic\nsurface reproduces accurately the experimental results. This allows us to\ninterpret the experimental results in terms of a heavy fermion metal, below the\ncoherence temperature. We foresee that the tunability of these systems will\npave the way to realize quantum simulators of heavy fermion criticality.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
