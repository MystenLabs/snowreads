We propose Interlacing Balance Measure (IBM) as a new two-sample testing\napproach. We consider the {\\it Degree-Corrected Mixed-Membership (DCMM)} model\nfor undirected networks, where we allow severe degree heterogeneity,\nmixed-memberships, flexible sparsity levels, and weak signals. In such a broad\nsetting, how to find a test that has a tractable limiting null and optimal\ntesting performances is a challenging problem. We show that IBM is such a test:\nin a broad DCMM setting with only mild regularity conditions, IBM has $N(0,1)$\nas the limiting null and achieves the optimal phase transition.\n  While the above is for undirected networks, IBM is a unified approach and is\ndirectly implementable for directed networks. For a broad directed-DCMM\n(extension of DCMM for directed networks) setting, we show that IBM has $N(0,\n1/2)$ as the limiting null and continues to achieve the optimal phase\ntransition. We have also applied IBM to the Enron email network and a gene\nco-expression network, with interesting results.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
