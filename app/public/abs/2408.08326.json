We consider a straight line in this region, such that the\ndirection of propagation of the plane wave is not parallel to this line. We\nshow that the radiation solution in the exterior region is uniquely determined\nby the intensity of the total solution on an interval of this line. In\nparticular, this result solves one of the old mathematical questions of\nholography in its two-dimensional setting. Our proofs also contribute to the\ntheory of the Karp expansion of radiation solutions in two dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
