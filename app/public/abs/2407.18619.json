We\npropose sufficient conditions that lead to $C^1$ blow-up. In particular, we\nfind that smooth solutions can break down in finite time even if the gradient\nof initial velocity is identically zero. The density and the gradient of the\nvelocity become unbounded as time approaches the lifespan of the smooth\nsolution. The Lagrangian formulation reduces the singularity formation problem\nto finding a zero of the associated second-order ODE.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
