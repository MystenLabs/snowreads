For example, there are several international certification schemes in\ntesting, such as those provided by the International Software Testing\nQualifications Board (ISTQB), which have been issued to more than 914K testers\nso far. To train the highly qualified test engineers of tomorrow, it is\nimportant for both university educators and trainers in industry to be aware of\nthe status of software testing education in academia versus its training in\nindustry, to analyze the relationships of these two approaches, and to assess\nways on how to improve the education / training landscape. For that purpose,\nthis paper provides a pragmatic overview of the issue, presents several\nrecommendations, and hopes to trigger further discussions in the community,\nbetween industry and academia, on how to further improve the status-quo, and to\nfind further best practices for more effective education and training of\nsoftware testers. The paper is based on combined ~40 years of the two authors'\ntechnical experience in test engineering, and their ~30 years of experience in\nproviding testing education and training in more than six countries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"On9VtGF_equdEJ2SESuht1A55amryeNbyo9Qpkbyttk","pdfSize":"1177421"}
