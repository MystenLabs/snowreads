Given the\nboundary vertex weight and the edge weight of the graph, we develop\nreconstruction procedures to recover the interior vertex weight from the\nNeumann boundary spectral data on a class of finite, connected and weighted\ngraphs. The procedures are divided into two stages: the first stage\nreconstructs the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map for the graph wave equation from the\nNeumann boundary spectral data, and the second stage reconstructs the interior\nvertex weight from the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map using the boundary control\nmethod adapted to weighted graphs. For the second stage, we identify a class of\nweighted graphs where the unique continuation principle holds for the graph\nwave equation. The reconstruction procedures are further turned into an\nalgorithm, which is implemented and validated on several numerical examples\nwith quantitative performance reported.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
