Comprising many\noverlapping subsets of different sizes, they serve as predictions of the\ninstructions required to code a solution for any problem. Currently, this\napproach employs a single, large family of subsets meaning that some problems\ncan search thousands of subsets before a solution is found. In this paper we\nintroduce the use of test case type signatures as hyper-heuristics to select\none of many, smaller families of instruction subsets. The type signature for\nany set of test cases maps directly to a single family and smaller families\nmean that fewer subsets need to be considered for most problems. Having many\nfamilies also permits subsets to be reordered to better reflect their relative\noccurrence in human code - again reducing the search space size for many\nproblems. Overall the new approach can further reduce the size of the inductive\nprogramming search space by between 1 and 3 orders of magnitude, depending on\nthe type signature. Larger and more consistent reductions are possible through\nthe use of more sophisticated type systems. The potential use of additional\ntest case features as hyper-heuristics and some other possible future work is\nalso briefly discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
