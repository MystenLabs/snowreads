The\nemulator maps linear displacement fields to their corresponding nonlinear\ndisplacements from N-body simulations at specific redshifts. Designed as a\nneural network, the emulator incorporates style parameters that encode\ndependencies on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and the linear growth factor $D(z)$ at\nredshift $z$. We train our model on the six-dimensional N-body phase space,\npredicting particle velocities as the time derivative of the model's\ndisplacement outputs. This innovation results in significant improvements in\ntraining efficiency and model accuracy. Tested on diverse cosmologies and\nredshifts not seen during training, the emulator achieves percent-level\naccuracy on scales of $k\\sim~1~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}~h$ at $z=0$, with improved\nperformance at higher redshifts. We compare predicted structure formation\nhistories with N-body simulations via merger trees, finding consistent merger\nevent sequences and statistical properties.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mlrJK8CBaNTV0zRaC5xfG8nMHLBiiBtHME1wcdQVtQc","pdfSize":"9703252"}
