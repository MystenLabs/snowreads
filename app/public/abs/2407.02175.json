This is the\nfirst step to start a mathematical theory of complex systems. Every notion is\nintroduced both using an intuitive description by listing lots of examples, and\nusing a modern mathematical language.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
