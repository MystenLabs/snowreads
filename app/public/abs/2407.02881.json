However, neural networks\n(NNs) employing these operators typically exhibit lower accuracy compared to\nconventional NNs with identical structures. ShiftAddAug uses costly\nmultiplication to augment efficient but less powerful multiplication-free\noperators, improving performance without any inference overhead. It puts a\nShiftAdd tiny NN into a large multiplicative model and encourages it to be\ntrained as a sub-model to obtain additional supervision. In order to solve the\nweight discrepancy problem between hybrid operators, a new weight sharing\nmethod is proposed. Additionally, a novel two stage neural architecture search\nis used to obtain better augmentation effects for smaller but stronger\nmultiplication-free tiny neural networks. The superiority of ShiftAddAug is\nvalidated through experiments in image classification and semantic\nsegmentation, consistently delivering noteworthy enhancements. Remarkably, it\nsecures up to a 4.95% increase in accuracy on the CIFAR100 compared to its\ndirectly trained counterparts, even surpassing the performance of\nmultiplicative NNs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MPGp5alJAtoRBTxcguuGo__6pUloOaWbjtw8Iv5i49U","pdfSize":"2937269"}
