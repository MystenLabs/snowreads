To this end, we propose VIS, the first\nvariational analysis framework for yield problems, enabling a systematic\nrefinement for OMSV. For instance, VIS reveals that the classic OMSV is\nsuboptimal, and the optimal/true OMSV should always stay beyond the failure\nboundary, which enables a free improvement for all OMSV-based methods\nimmediately. Using VIS, we show a progressive refinement for the classic OMSV\nincluding incorporation of full covariance in closed form, adjusting for\nasymmetric failure distributions, and capturing multiple failure regions, each\nof which contributes to a progressive improvement of more than 2x. Inheriting\nthe simplicity of OMSV, the proposed method retains simplicity and robustness\nyet achieves up to 29.03x speedup over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We\nalso demonstrate how the SOTA yield optimization, ASAIS, can immediately\nbenefit from our True OMSV, delivering a 1.20x and 1.27x improvement in\nperformance and efficiency, respectively, without additional computational\noverhead.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
