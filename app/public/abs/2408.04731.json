Although some of these materials are topological, the Raman\nsignatures of electronic band topology have remained largely unexplored. On a\ntheoretical study of 2D massive Dirac fermions, we report a selection rule and\na peculiar phase difference between the Raman tensor elements, which are\nsensitive to the sign of the Dirac mass. We discuss on the applicability of our\nresults to Chern insulators and to magnetized monolayers of transition metal\ndichalcogenides.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
