This problem is a natural extension of the Directed\nFeedback Arc Set problem and is also known to be motivated by certain scenarios\narising in the study of housing markets. The complexity of the problem, when\nparameterized by solution size (i.e., size of the deletion set), has remained\nunresolved and has been highlighted in several papers. In this work, we answer\nthis question by ruling out (subject to the usual complexity assumptions) a\nfixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for this parameter and conduct a\nbroad analysis of the problem with respect to other natural parameterizations.\nWe prove both positive and negative results. Among these, we demonstrate that\nthe problem is also hard (W[1]-hard or even para-NP-hard) when parameterized by\neither treewidth or maximum degree alone. Complementing our lower bounds, we\nestablish that the problem is in XP when parameterized by treewidth and FPT\nwhen parameterized either by both treewidth and maximum degree or by both\ntreewidth and solution size. We show that these algorithms have near-optimal\nasymptotic dependence on the treewidth assuming the Exponential Time\nHypothesis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
