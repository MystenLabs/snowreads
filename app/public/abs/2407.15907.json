Carver and Daniel S. Katz on how\npeople learn programming languages. It's based on a talk Jeff gave at the first\nUS-RSE Conference (US-RSE'23), which led Dan to think about human languages\nversus computer languages. Dan discussed this with Jeff at the conference, and\nthis discussion continued asynchronous, with this column being a record of the\ndiscussion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
