Fine-tuned\ntransformer-based models outperform human annotators in some annotation tasks,\nbut they require large manually annotated training datasets. In our\ncontribution, we explore to which degree a manually annotated dataset can be\nautomatically replicated with today's NLP methods, using unsupervised machine\nlearning and zero- and few-shot learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
