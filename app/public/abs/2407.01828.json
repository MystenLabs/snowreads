The metric\nentropy (Kolmogorov-Sinai) is central in Ornstein's theory of Bernoulli shifts\n- it is a complete invariant for such maps. In this article we consider zip\nshift spaces, which extends the bilateral symbolic shift into a two-alphabet\nsymbolic dynamical system and are ergodic and mixing systems with a chaotic\nbehavior. A class of examples of maps isomophically mod 0 to zip shifts are the\nn-to-1 baker's maps, which represents a non-invertible model of deterministic\nchaos. We calculate the metric and folding entropies of a generic zip shift\nsystem, and relate the two. For the metric entropy, we find the general form\nfor cylinder sets pulled-back by the shift dynamics, and use the\nKolmogorov-Sinai theorem to calculate the metric entropy of the zip shift\nsystem. For the folding entropy, we find the disintegration of the zip shift\nmeasure relative to the pullback of the atomic partition, and relate it to the\nzip shift measure in a simple formula.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
