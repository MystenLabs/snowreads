It\nelucidates the pivotal role of categorical data clustering in diverse fields\nsuch as health sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, education,\nengineering and economics. Practical comparisons are conducted for algorithms\nhaving public implementations, highlighting distinguishing clustering\nmethodologies and revealing the performance of recent algorithms on several\nbenchmark categorical datasets. Finally, challenges and opportunities in the\nfield are discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DKZIQQkA2m3UovZKnRVQd6dHdxE03D6pFTJblQNCeaI","pdfSize":"4411110"}
