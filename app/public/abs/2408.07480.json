Even though BF expansions are an\nintuitive and straightforward model to use, they suffer from quadratic\ncomputational complexity in the number of BFs if the predictive variance is to\nbe computed. We develop a method to automatically select the most important BFs\nfor prediction in a sub-domain of the model domain. This significantly reduces\nthe computational complexity of computing predictions while maintaining\npredictive accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated using two numerical\nexamples, where reductions up to 50-75% are possible without significantly\nreducing the predictive accuracy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SMQNysj8Hq7isVX9SVKmctnJV61iOB9s7FWcFd3kLng","pdfSize":"359360"}
