Existence theorems\nfor the trajectories of these disclinations are presented, considering both the\ndynamics without predefined preferred directions of motion in an isotropic\nmedium and the dynamics in which the disclinations move parallel to predefined\ndirections, modeling a crystalline material. The analysis is illustrated with a\nnumber of numerical solutions to demonstrate various relevant configurations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
