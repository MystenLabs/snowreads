We analyze the\nzero-error capacity of the semantic channel using a comprehensive framework\nthat accommodates multiple input and output memories. Our approach reveals a\nmore sophisticated and detailed model compared to the classical memory\nchannels, highlighting the impact of memory on achieving error-free\ncommunication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
