This study\nevaluates the effectiveness of pre-processing techniques and the effect of\nadditional depthwise separable convolution on EEG vision transformers (ViTs) in\na pretrained model architecture. We introduce a novel method, the EEG Deeper\nClustered Vision Transformer (EEG-DCViT), which combines depthwise separable\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers, enriched by a\npre-processing strategy involving data clustering. The new approach\ndemonstrates superior performance, establishing a new benchmark with a Root\nMean Square Error (RMSE) of 51.6 mm. This achievement underscores the impact of\npre-processing and model refinement in enhancing EEG-based applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XM7dAYl02bAbouaSTxpVTONreGBGFkdDP-TlPfv5GGo","pdfSize":"2460608"}
