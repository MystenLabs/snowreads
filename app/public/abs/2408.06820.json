We propose a fine-grained search\ncell that combines basic mathematical operations to model activation functions,\nallowing for the exploration of novel activations. Our approach enables the\nidentification of specialized activations, leading to improved performance in\nevery model we tried, from image classification to language models. Moreover,\nthe identified activations exhibit strong transferability to larger models of\nthe same type, as well as new datasets. Importantly, our automated process for\ncreating customized activation functions is orders of magnitude more efficient\nthan previous approaches. It can easily be applied on top of arbitrary deep\nlearning pipelines and thus offers a promising practical avenue for enhancing\ndeep learning architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"59MjJ3v60eM2qqCm7U5fUsKXtvfjqaWeviDhwEII4q0","pdfSize":"645131"}
