Then, we identify the associated GLT symbols and GLT\nmomentary symbols in the general setting and in the specific case, by providing\nin both cases a spectral and singular value analysis. More specifically, we use\nthe GLT tools in order to study the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues and\nsingular values of the considered BDF matrix-sequences, in connection with the\ngiven non-uniform grids.
