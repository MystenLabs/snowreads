It is shown that the monomorphisms of the groupoid\n$(\\mathbb{R}^+, d^+)$ coincide with the injective ultrametric-preserving\nfunctions and that the automorphisms of $(\\mathbb{R}^+, d^+)$ coincide with the\nself-homeomorphisms of $\\mathbb{R}^+$. The structure of endomorphisms of\n$(\\mathbb{R}^+, d^+)$ is also described.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
