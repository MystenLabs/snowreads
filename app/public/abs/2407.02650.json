The\nmodel is based on the coupling of the Frequency Dependent Fluctuating Charges\nand Fluctuating Dipoles ($\\omega$FQF$\\mu$), specifically designed to describe\nplasmonic substrates, and the polarizable Fluctuating Charges (FQ) classical\nforce field to model the solvating environment. The resulting\n$\\omega$FQF$\\mu$/FQ approach accounts for the interactions between the\nradiation and the NP, as well as with the surrounding solvent molecules, by\nincorporating mutual interactions between the plasmonic substrate and solvent.\n$\\omega$FQF$\\mu$/FQ is validated against reference TD-DFTB/FQ calculations,\ndemonstrating remarkable accuracy, particularly in reproducing plasmon\nresonance frequency shifts for structures below the quantum-size limit. The\nflexibility and reliability of the approach are also demonstrated by simulating\nthe optical response of homogeneous and bimetallic NPs dissolved in pure\nsolvents and solvent mixtures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"T9UVUnunuWVht-Q5_-4wAca1pq_Hm4elR9GXc1Rm57w","pdfSize":"4459393"}
