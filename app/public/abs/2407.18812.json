For this scenario, we propose AEMS-SR (Anytime Error\nMinimization Search with State Requests), a principled online planning\nalgorithm tailored for POMDPs with state requests. By representing the search\nspace as a graph instead of a tree, AEMS-SR avoids the exponential growth of\nthe search space originating from state requests. Theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates AEMS-SR's $\\varepsilon$-optimality, ensuring solution quality,\nwhile empirical evaluations illustrate its effectiveness compared with AEMS and\nPOMCP, two SOTA online planning algorithms. AEMS-SR enables efficient planning\nin domains characterized by partial observability and costly state requests\noffering practical benefits across various applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
