However, the relative importance of the wave-mean flow and\nwave-wave interactions for the Kelvin wave growth compared to the direct wave\nexcitation by the external forcing has not been made clear. This study\ndemonstrates the resonant Kelvin wave excitation by interactions of subtropical\nRossby waves and the mean flow using a spherical shallow-water model. The use\nof Hough harmonics as basis functions makes Rossby and Kelvin waves prognostic\nvariables of the model and allows the quantification of terms contributing to\ntheir tendencies in physical and wave space. The simulations show that Kelvin\nwaves are resonantly excited by interactions of Rossby waves and the balanced\nzonal mean flow in the subtropics, provided the Rossby and Kelvin wave\nfrequencies, which are modified by the mean flow, match. The resonance\nmechanism is substantiated by analytical expressions. The Kelvin wave\ntendencies are caused by velocity and depth tendencies: The velocity tendencies\ndue to the meridional advection of zonal mean velocity can be outweighed by the\nzonal advection of Rossby wave velocity or by the depth tendencies due to\nRossby wave divergence. Identifying the resonant excitation mechanism in data\nshould contribute to the quantification of Kelvin wave variability originating\nin the subtropics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
