For\nhistorical reasons the new model is referred to as geometrical Green-Naghdi\ntype (gGN) system. The gGN system is fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive. It\nis endowed with an exact energy conservation law, and admits several types of\nexact travelling wave solutions. We analyze the propagation properties compare\nthem to those of Chassagne et al. JFM 2019, including a characterization of\nundular bores via the analogy by Lemoine. Finally the system is recast in two\nuseful forms appropriate for its numerical approximations, whose properties are\ndiscussed. Our results allow to further confirm the existence of these\ndispersive processes (highlighted in Chassagne et al JFM 2019) having a fully\nhydrostatic nature and modelled by the 2D hyperbolic nonlinear shallow water\nsimulations. Finally, the numerical fully validate the new gGN model proposed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
