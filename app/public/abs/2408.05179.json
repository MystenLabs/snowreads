Measurements of radioactive secondaries, such\nas $^{10}$Be or $^{26}$Al, which decay equivalently throughout the diffusive\nvolume, are expected to provide the strongest constraints. This has motivated\nsignificant observational work to constrain their isotopic ratios, along with\ntheoretical work to constrain the cross-section uncertainties that are thought\nto dominate radioactive secondary fluxes. In this work, we show that the\nimprecise modelling of the Milky Way spiral arms significantly affects our\nability to translate $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes into constraints on the\ndiffusive halo height, biasing our current results. Utilizing state-of-the-art\nspiral arms models we produce new predictions for the $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al\nfluxes that motivate upcoming measurements by AMS-02 and HELIX.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"85up_fqlV8YPFotHnP0mhAiQRAIxejv-2W6vqIZeJqI","pdfSize":"1416848"}
