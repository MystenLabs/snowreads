Examining heavy-flavour production across different collision systems\nand event multiplicities provides information about multi-parton interactions\nand the development of a strongly-interacting medium in high-multiplicity pp\nand p-Pb collisions. In Pb-Pb collisions, measurements of the nuclear\nmodification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) for charm and beauty hadrons provide a means\nto characterise the in-medium energy loss of heavy quarks in the quark-gluon\nplasma (QGP). In addition, measurements of the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) for\nheavy quarks provide insights into their diffusion and their participation in\nthe collective motion of the QGP. In this contribution, recent results of charm\nand beauty production measured with the ALICE detector are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
