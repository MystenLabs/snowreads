Recent studies have explored the asymptotic\nconvergence behavior of using Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression in contextual\nstochastic optimization; however, the performance guarantee under finite\nsamples remains an open question. This paper derives a finite-sample\ngeneralization bound of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator with a spherical kernel\nunder a generic loss function. Based on the generalization bound, we further\nestablish a suboptimality bound for the solution of the Nadaraya-Watson\napproximation problem relative to the optimal solution. Finally, we derive the\noptimal kernel bandwidth and provide a sample complexity analysis of the\nNadaraya-Watson approximation problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N4k2GlLHyMislgkjNwApzuLJ-yv_K8KoIcW6jjlE--s","pdfSize":"167619"}
