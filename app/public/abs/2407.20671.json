These algebras\nare for any integrable weight type $II_{\\infty}$ factors admitting a crossed\nproduct representation with respect to modular automorphisms. In this context\nwe define Inflationary Cosmology as the flow of integrable weights and the dual\nautomorphism as the flow generator. Using some basic properties of integrable\nweights we show that any type $II_1$ dS algebra cannot be represented as the\n$\\epsilon=0$ limit ( for $\\epsilon$ the slow roll parameter ) of the gauge\ninvariant algebra defined by any integrable weight. This strongly indicates\nthat the pure dS algebra defined as the $\\epsilon=0$ limit is algebraically non\nexistent.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
