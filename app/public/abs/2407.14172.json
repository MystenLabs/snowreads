This TI-GEVD-DANSE algorithm as\nwell as the original TI-DANSE algorithm exhibit a non-strict convergence, which\ncan lead to numerical instability over time, particularly in scenarios where\nthe estimation of accurate spatial covariance matrices is challenging. An\nadaptive filter coefficient normalization strategy is proposed to mitigate this\nissue and enable the stable performance of TI-(GEVD-)DANSE. The method is\nvalidated in numerical simulations including dynamic acoustic scenarios,\ndemonstrating the importance of the additional normalization.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xa0NvIhn9VG1Iu5o-1doRxUjZA-sPWJc2nIQXBxND80","pdfSize":"206912"}
