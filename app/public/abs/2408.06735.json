Khan and M. Young proved a mean Lindel\\\"{o}f estimate for the\nsecond moment of Maass form symmetric-square $L$-functions $L(\\text{sym}^2\nu_{j},1/2+it)$ on the short interval of length $G\\gg\n|t_j|^{1+\\epsilon}/t^{2/3}$, where $t_j$ is a spectral parameter of the\ncorresponding Maass form. Their estimate yields a subconvexity estimate for\n$L(\\text{sym}^2 u_{j},1/2+it)$ as long as $|t_j|^{6/7+\\delta} \\ll\nt<(2-\\delta)|t_j|$. We obtain a mean Lindel\\\"{o}f estimate for the same moment\nin shorter intervals, namely for $G\\gg |t_j|^{1+\\epsilon}/t$. As a corollary,\nwe prove a subconvexity estimate for $L(\\text{sym}^2 u_{j},1/2+it)$ on the\ninterval $|t_j|^{2/3+\\delta}\\ll t\\ll |t_j|^{6/7-\\delta}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
