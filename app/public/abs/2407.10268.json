ZrRe2 crystallizes in a C14-type\nstructure (space group P63/mmc), with cell parameters a=b=5.2682(5) and\nc=8.63045 . Resistivity and magnetic susceptibility data both suggest that\nZrRe2 exhibits a sharp superconducting transition above 6.1 K. The measured\nlower and upper critical fields are 6.27 mT and 12.77 T, respectively, with a\nlarge upper critical field that approached the Pauli limit.Measurements of the\nheat capacity confirm the presence of bulk superconductivity, with a normalized\nspecific heat change of 1.24 and an electron-phonon strength of 0.69 . DFT\ncalculations revealed that the band structure of ZrRe2 is intricate and without\nvan-Hove singularity. The observed large specific heat jump, combined with the\nelectron-phonon strength , suggests that ZrRe2 is a weakly coupled type II\nsuperconductor.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
