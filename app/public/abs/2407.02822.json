The main goal is twofold: one is to extend the\none-species case to the two-species case where the electron mass is finite and\nthe ion mass is sufficiently large, and the other is to modify the\n$G$-functional such that it involves the norm in $L^{d+1}$ instead of $L^2$ as\nwell as derivatives up to only the first order.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
