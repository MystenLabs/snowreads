Let $Cl(O)$ be the group of proper $O$-ideals and $Cl(O)[2]$ the kernel of\nmultiplication by $2$ in $Cl(O)$. We describe explicitly the group $Cl(O)[2]$.\nIn particular, we prove that its order is\n  $2^{s_D-1}$ where $s_D$ is the number of prime divisors of $D$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
