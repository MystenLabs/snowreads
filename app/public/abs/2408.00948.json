This study explores\nthe ability of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically, GPT-4o-mini to\nimprove traffic management at urban intersections. We recruited GPT-4o-mini to\nanalyze, predict position, detect and resolve the conflicts at an intersection\nin real-time for various basic scenarios. The key findings of this study to\ninvestigate whether LLMs can logically reason and understand the scenarios to\nenhance the traffic efficiency and safety by providing real-time analysis. The\nstudy highlights the potential of LLMs in urban traffic management creating\nmore intelligent and more adaptive systems. Results showed the GPT-4o-mini was\neffectively able to detect and resolve conflicts in heavy traffic, congestion,\nand mixed-speed conditions. The complex scenario of multiple intersections with\nobstacles and pedestrians saw successful conflict management as well. Results\nshow that the integration of LLMs promises to improve the effectiveness of\ntraffic control for safer and more efficient urban intersection management.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
