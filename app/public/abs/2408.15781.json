For\nnon-Hermitian systems, it is natural to expect that determining the Hamiltonian\nrequires a pair of both left and right eigenstates. Here, we observe that it\ncan be sufficient to determine a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian from a single right\nor left eigenstate. Our approach is based on the quantum covariance matrix,\nwhere the solution of Hamiltonian corresponds to the complex null vector. Our\nscheme favours non-Hermitian Hamiltonian learning on experimental quantum\nsystems, as only the right eigenstates there can be accessed. Furthermore, we\nuse numerical simulations to examine the effects of measurement errors and show\nthe stability of our scheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
