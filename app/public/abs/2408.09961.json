The outcome of the\ninvestigated inelastic scattering is creation of new spin-waves beams of\nfrequencies shifted by the edge mode frequencies. We report that inelastically\nscattered spin-wave beams in both stimulated splitting and confluence processes\nnot only change their direction of propagation, but also undergo lateral shifts\nalong the interface, analogous to the Goos-H\\\"anchen effect. We report that the\nlateral shifts of inelastically scattered beams can be much larger than the\nclassical Goos-H\\\"anchen shifts for reflected spin waves, taking both positive\nand negative values. In addition, we report the cascade nonlinear excitation of\nspin-wave leaky modes accompanied by a substantial increase in the value of the\nlateral shift of the inelastically scattered spin-wave beam in the confluence\nprocess. Our results are an important contribution to the understanding of the\nnonlinear nature of spin waves, which is crucial for spin wave applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YokwyS75UjiZnBiW1JjFruNPETlm-1PaCKjrh3bP7ro","pdfSize":"2456606"}
