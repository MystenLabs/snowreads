Here we\nshowed that using physical encoding rather than the widely used one-hot\nencoding can significantly improve the OOD performance by increasing the\nmodels' generalization performance, which is especially true for models trained\nwith small datasets. Our benchmark results of both composition- and\nstructure-based deep learning models over six datasets including formation\nenergy, band gap, refractive index, and elastic properties predictions\ndemonstrated the importance of physical encoding to OOD generalization for\nmodels trained on small datasets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
