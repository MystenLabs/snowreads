In this paper, the possibility of using\nthis difference to discover or constrain 2HDM is studied. As a main result, the\nallowed parameter space of 2HDM type-II is found in the light of possible\nprecise measurements from the LHC experiments. It is shown that combination of\nthe constraints from these measurements with the previous constraints on 2HDM,\nfrom direct search and flavour physics, can rule out the main part of the 2HDM\nparameter space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-bxGPuoC-sQtoDwfjZH8Wt6OuSLgkxJXP92i91Y9NIs","pdfSize":"680407"}
