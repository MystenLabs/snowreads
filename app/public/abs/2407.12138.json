The proposed approach consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) synthetic data generation using 3D modeling of surgical tools\nwith articulation rigging and physically-based rendering; (2) a tailored pose\nestimation framework combining object detection with pose estimation and a\nhybrid geometric fusion strategy; and (3) a training strategy that utilizes\nboth synthetic and real unannotated data, employing domain adaptation on real\nvideo data using automatically generated pseudo-labels. Evaluations conducted\non videos of open surgery demonstrate the good performance and real-world\napplicability of the proposed method, highlighting its potential for\nintegration into medical augmented reality and robotic systems. The approach\neliminates the need for extensive manual annotation of real surgical data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
