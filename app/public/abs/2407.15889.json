Two years later, Prisner extended the game to directed\ngraphs. While the properties of parallel chip-firing games on undirected graphs\nhave been extensively studied, their analogs for parallel chip-firing games on\ndirected graphs have been sporadic. In this paper, we prove the outstanding\nanalogs of the core results of parallel chip-firing games on undirected graphs\nfor those on directed graphs. We find the possible periods of a parallel\nchip-firing game on a directed simple cycle and use Gauss-Jordan Elimination on\na Laplacian-like matrix to establish a lower bound on the maximum period of a\nparallel chip-firing game on a directed complete graph and a directed complete\nbipartite graph. Finally, we use the method of motors by Jiang, Scully, and\nZhang to show that a binary string $s$ can be the atomic firing sequence of a\nvertex in a parallel chip-firing game on a strongly connected directed graph if\nand only if $s$ contains 1 or $s=0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TEj2NmdBPJ6deV_Hn9NVtLoL2nhVNnYkjvJb-gVKJVc","pdfSize":"238280","objectId":"0x479a7fc5a2eb4a4a6a7ea7f5390b4c13133597b3d57a4d68c136f83570e1b7ee","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
