We find that the fusion of\nMajorana Kramers pairs is a process that Ising anyons fuse independently in the\ntwo distinct time-reversal sectors. Considering the full fusion including the\ninitialization and the fusion, we explore the observation of a supersymmetry\nthat emerges in time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors, and design\nthe schemes for the nontrivial fusion and the trivial fusion to show the\nnon-Abelian statistics of Majorana Kramers pairs. We also show the possible\ninfluence of local adiabatic mixing on the fusion and the differentiation\nbetween distinct fusion processes remains feasible even in the presence of such\nmixing. Our proposals are applied in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave topological\nsuperconductors, and the theoretical framework can be extended to the fusion of\nmultiple Majorana zero modes protected by unitary symmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
