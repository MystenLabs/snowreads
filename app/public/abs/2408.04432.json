We do so by obtaining the Hubble and deceleration parameter,\nrespectively $H(z)$ and $q(z)$, from both datasets using a non-parametric\nreconstruction, so that our results do not depend on any {\\it a priori}\nassumptions about the underlying cosmological model. We find that the\nreconstructed $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ from SDSS are significantly inconsistent with\nthose obtained from DESI, and that both are only marginally consistent with the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model ($\\sim 3\\sigma$ confidence level). Interestingly, the\ncombined SDSS and DESI dataset reconciles with the standard model. These\nresults are mostly unchanged with respect to different assumptions on the sound\nhorizon scale value, as well as different reconstruction kernels. We also\nverify the results for the null diagnostic $\\mathcal{O}_{\\rm m}(z)$, finding\nthat SDSS favours a quintessence-like dark energy model, whereas a phantom-like\ndark energy is preferred by DESI data, and once again the combined dataset\nstrongly agrees with $\\Lambda$CDM. Therefore, our results call the attention\nfor further examination of such inconsistency, as they can lead to biased and\ndivergent results regarding the validity of the standard model, or the\nsuggestion of new physics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
