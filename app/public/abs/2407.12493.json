The quark matter is modeled using the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model\nimproved to account for vector and 't Hooft interactions as well as\nantisymmetric pairing among the red/green up and down quarks. The unpaired\nexcitations are the strange quarks and the blue up or down quarks. We compute\nthe relaxation rates associated with $d$ and $s$-quark decay and electron\ncapture processes on $u$ quark for blue color. The resulting bulk viscosity for\ndensity oscillations in the 1--10\\,kHz range shows a resonant peak at $T\\sim\n5\\,\\MeV$, and the damping time may drop below 10 ms. This is short enough to\naffect the postmerger evolution and is very similar to the damping predicted in\nnuclear matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
