Then a cost-effective and\nefficient in-context learning based method is employed to prevent LLMs from\nutilizing dataset biases during generation. Experimental results show that CAL\ncan effectively recognize typical biased instances and induce various bias\npatterns for debiasing LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
