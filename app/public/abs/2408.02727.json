In\ncontrast, the scattering amplitudes of massless particles with spin are very\nsimple. We propose that the reason for the unreasonable complexity of these\ncorrelators lies in the use of inconvenient kinematic variables. For example,\nin de Sitter space, consistency with unitarity and the background isometries\nimply that the correlators must be conformally covariant and also conserved.\nHowever, the commonly used kinematic variables for correlators do not make all\nof these properties manifest. In this paper, we introduce twistor space as a\npowerful way to satisfy all kinematic constraints. We show that conformal\ncorrelators of conserved currents can be written as twistor integrals, where\nthe conservation condition translates into holomorphicity of the integrand. The\nfunctional form of the twistor-space correlators is very simple and easily\nbootstrapped. For the case of three-point functions, we verify explicitly that\nthis reproduces known results in embedding space. We also perform a\nhalf-Fourier transform of the twistor-space correlators to obtain their\ncounterparts in momentum space. We conclude that twistors provide a promising\nnew avenue to study conformal correlation functions that exposes their hidden\nsimplicity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
