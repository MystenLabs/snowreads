Let $\\mathcal{P}(D)$ be the set of paths in a digraph $D$. An\n$H$-subdivision $(f,g)$ in a digraph $D$ is a pair of bijections $f :\nV(H)\\rightarrow V(D)$ and $g : A(H) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{P}(D)$ such that for\nevery arc $uv\\in A(H)$, $g(uv)$ is a path from $f(u)$ to $f (v)$, and distinct\narcs map into internally vertex disjoint paths in $D$. Further, $D$ is\narbitrary $H$-linked if any $k$ distinct vertices in $D$ can be extended to an\n$H$-subdivision $(f,g)$, and the length of each subdivision path can be\nspecified as a number of at least four. In this paper, we prove that there\nexists a positive integer $n_0 = n_0(k,q)$ such that if $D$ is an oriented\ngraph of order $n\\geq n_0$ with minimum semi-degree at least $(3n+3k+6q-3)/8$,\nthen $D$ is arbitrary $H$-linked. This minimum semi-degree is sharp. Also, we\nrefine the bounds on the semi-degree of sufficiently large arbitrary $k$-linked\noriented graphs, sufficiently large arbitrary $l$-ordered oriented graphs, and\nsufficiently large oriented graphs with disjoint cycles of prescribed lengths\ncontaining prescribed arcs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
