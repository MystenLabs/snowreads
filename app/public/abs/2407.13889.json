It is made of a Python package for time and space discretizations\nand of two packages (one in Matlab and one in C++) implementing the calibration\nof the probabilistic models for stochastic spatio-temporal data proposed in the\ncompanion paper arXiv:2203.16371v2.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
