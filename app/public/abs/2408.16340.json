Our approach leverages a combination of\nbottom-up and top-down paths at the transmitter to autoregressively generate\nmultiple hierarchical representations of the original image. These\nrepresentations are then directly mapped to channel symbols for transmission by\nthe JSCC encoder. We extend this framework to scenarios with a feedback link,\nmodeling transmission over a noisy channel as a probabilistic sampling process\nand deriving a novel generative formulation for JSCC with feedback. Compared\nwith existing approaches, our proposed HJSCC provides enhanced adaptability by\ndynamically adjusting transmission bandwidth, encoding these representations\ninto varying amounts of channel symbols. Extensive experiments on images of\nvarying resolutions demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing\nbaselines in rate-distortion performance and maintains robustness against\nchannel noise. The source code will be made available upon acceptance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
