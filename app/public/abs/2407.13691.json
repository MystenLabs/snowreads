However, to make the generation results controllable, existing methods\n(e.g. Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets, cGAN) require labeled dataset to\ntrain the model, which is demanding in practice because many field measurement\ndata lacks descriptive labels. In this paper, we introduce the Information\nMaximizing Generative Adversarial Nets (infoGAN) to achieve interpretable\nfeature extraction and controllable synthetic data generation based on the\nunlabeled electrical time series dataset. Features with clear physical meanings\ncan be automatically extracted by maximizing the mutual information between the\ninput latent code and the classifier output of infoGAN. Then the extracted\nfeatures are used to control the generation results similar to a vanilla cGAN\nframework. Case study is based on the time series datasets of power load and\nrenewable energy output. Results demonstrate that infoGAN can extract both\ndiscrete and continuous features with clear physical meanings, as well as\ngenerating realistic synthetic time series that satisfy given features.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
