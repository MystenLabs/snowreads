Households' attentiveness is measured by their accuracy of\ninflation expectations and perceptions. Relative to non-stockholders,\nstockholders produce more accurate inflation forecasts and backcasts, disagree\nless about future inflation, and adjust their outlook more responsively to\nnews, suggesting that stock-market participation raises households' attention.\nFrequent changes in stock prices incentivize stockholders to closely monitor\nfinancial markets for optimal trading, given the low cost of acquiring\ninformation. Consequently, paying attention to the macroeconomy helps hedge the\nrisks associated with holding stocks. Therefore, attention heterogeneity driven\nby stockholdings can be a channel through which the distributional consequences\nof monetary policy are created.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
