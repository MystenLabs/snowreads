In three papers written around 1990, Erd\\H{o}s,\nGimbel and collaborators raised several open problems regarding the\nrelationship of the chromatic and cochromatic number of a graph. In this short\nnote, we address several of these problems, in particular\n  -we disprove a conjecture of Erd\\H{o}s, Gimbel and Straight from 1988,\n  -answer negatively a problem posed by Erd\\H{o}s and Gimbel in 1993, and\n  -give positive evidence for a 1000\\$--question of Erd\\H{o}s and Gimbel.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
