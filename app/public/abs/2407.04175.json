An LTS is a surface that specifies the strong gravity region,\nwhich is a generalization of the photon sphere in the Schwarzschild spacetime.\nIt turns out that there are an infinite number of marginal LTSs. At the leading\norder of the small Kerr parameter, all of the marginal LTSs have the same area.\nHowever, one can see that the maximal marginal LTS among them is uniquely\ndetermined at the higher order.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
