The well-established geometric features of the robot\nflange are exploited by directly capturing its point cloud data. In particular,\nan iterative method is proposed to facilitate point cloud processing toward a\nrefined calibration outcome. Several extensive experiments are conducted over a\nrange of collaborative robots, including Universal Robots UR5 & UR10 e-series,\nFranka Emika, and AUBO i5 using an industrial-grade 3D scanner Photoneo Phoxi S\n& M and a commercial-grade 3D scanner Microsoft Azure Kinect DK. Experimental\nresults show that translational and rotational errors converge efficiently to\nless than 0.28 mm and 0.25 degrees, respectively, achieving a hand-eye\ncalibration accuracy as high as the camera's resolution, probing the hardware\nlimit. A welding seam tracking system is presented, combining the flange-based\ncalibration method with soft tactile sensing. The experiment results show that\nthe system enables the robot to adjust its motion in real-time, ensuring\nconsistent weld quality and paving the way for more efficient and adaptable\nmanufacturing processes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ObAl9eA8-w_bmImWpGu2ygWcqQw05ZSsWNN1NL8uPl8","pdfSize":"7962336"}
