We generalize this theorem to higher\ngenus surfaces and expand the twisted Kasteleyn matrices corresponding to spin\nstructures on the surface, analogously to the rank-1 case of Cimasoni,\nReshetikhin. In the process of the proof, we give an alternate geometric\nderivation of the planar web trace theorem, relying on the spin geometry of\nembedded loops and a `racetrack construction' used to immerse loops in the\nblowup graph on the surface.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
