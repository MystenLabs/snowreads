This\nexact sequence was used by Kobayashi and Otto to prove the equivalence of\nPride's finite homological type (FHT) property with the homological finiteness\ncondition bi-$\\mathrm{FP}_3$. Guba and Sapir used this exact sequence to\ndescribe the abelianization of a diagram group. We prove here a generalization\nof this exact sequence of bimodules for presentations of associative algebras.\nOur proof is more elementary than the original proof for the special case of\nmonoids.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
