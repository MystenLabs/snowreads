Contrary to an earlier approach, we give\npriority to locality, resulting in a sixth order evolution equation. For this\nnew area preserving flow, we prove a global existence result. Additionally, by\npenalizing the length, we show convergence to an area constrained critical\npoint of the elastic energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
