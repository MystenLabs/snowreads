In field-polarized chiral magnets, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction induces three-magnon interactions that violate time-reversal\nsymmetry and interfere with the four-magnon scattering, thereby breaking\nmicroscopic detailed balance and causing thermal Hall currents. This mechanism\noperates without disorder or Berry curvature and is intrinsic to interacting\nspin systems. We argue that it can be as significant as the band-geometric\nanomalous velocity, highlighting the importance of magnon correlations in\nthermal Hall physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
