We do not aim to\nbe exhaustive and we do not cover important areas of development such as the\nresults on the problem in classes of finite groups or the version of the\nproblem that focuses on spectral measures instead of sets. The selection of the\nmaterial has been strongly influenced by personal taste, history and\ncapabilities. We are trying to be more descriptive than detailed and we point\nout several open questions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
