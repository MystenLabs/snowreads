A domain wall junction in the domain wall network turns out to\nbe a skyrmion with half topological charge and, therefore, the found domain\nwall network has a second topological nature, a skyrmion crystal. More\nspecifically, we present a ground-state phase diagram of the chiral magnet with\nvarying anisotropy parameters consisting of skyrmion lattices, chiral soliton\nlattices, and ferromagnetic states. In the presence of the square anisotropy,\nthe skyrmion crystal forms a domain wall network. The size of domains in the\ndomain wall network is shown to be tunable by an external magnetic field,\noffering a way to realize experimentally detectable domain wall networks.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
