The current precise\ndeterminations of neutrino mixings have discarded some of the most studied\nproposals, such as the one involving a $\\mu-\\tau$ exchange symmetry. In this\nwork, we investigate the relation of a still allowed $\\mu-\\tau$ reflection\nsymmetry with the constraints of a magic pattern in the neutrino mass matrix.\nWe show that both conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously in an exact but\nrather in an approximate way. Such considerations are used to restrict the\nvalues of CP-violating phases and some observables, like the neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay amplitude and the solar angle, that can be explored with\nforthcoming results.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
