Due to their qualified output, steganographic texts become\nsimilar to human and have attracted most of the steganography researchers'\nattention. However, running a language model requires a strong computation\nplatform. It limits the applicable scenario of steganography, since those\nelectronic devices controlled by the decoder may not even equipped with a GPU.\nTraditional provably secure steganography methods cannot be applied to this\nlow-resource scenario. Therefore, we aim at design a novel steganography\nframework that is practical in a low-resource scheme. We start from the\nrigorous probability analysis with the help of hypothesis testing techniques to\nconstruct an theoretical framework. Then we prove the security and robostness\nof our framework and point out its optimization goal. We test our theoretical\nframework in some famous LLMs and the results have proved its usability. There\nare still some practical problems and this gives the direction of future work.\nWe hope that this work will expand the practical scope of steganography and\ncreate a new branch of steganography.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
