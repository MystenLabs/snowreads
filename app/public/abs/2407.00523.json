A total of 78\nvariables was found in the field of the cluster. Many of these variables are\nincluded in the Catalogue of Variable Stars in Galactic Globular Clusters\n(Clement et al. 2001), OGLE or Gaia-DR3 data releases. A membership analysis\nbased on the proper motions of Gaia-DR3 revealed that many of these variables\ndo not belong to the cluster. We employed the data from the aforementioned\nsurveys and our own data in the VI photometric system to estimate the periods,\nwhich along with the light curves morphology and position in a deferentially\ndereddened colour-magnitude diagram(CMD), help classifying the variable types.\nTwo new member variables were found; an eclipsing binary (V18) and a\nsemi-regular SR/L (V19). In the end we conclude that only 9 variables are\nlikely cluster members. Member variables were used to discuss the mean\nmetallicity and distance of the parental cluster and find the average values.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
