The purpose of this paper\nis to achieve two primary goals. Firstly, we show small data scattering for\n(gKdV) in the weighted Sobolev space, ensuring the initial and the asymptotic\nstates belong to the same class. Secondly, we introduce two equivalent\ncharacterizations of scattering in the weighted Sobolev space. In particular,\nthis involves the so-called conditional scattering in the weighted Sobolev\nspace. A key ingredient is incorporation of the scattering criterion for (gKdV)\nin the Fourier-Lebesgue space by the authors into the the scattering problem in\nthe weighted Sobolev space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6-8s5X8Oz4Moou0I6-pVNNe8G8mnwlwTlay7DW5TTiw","pdfSize":"305457"}
