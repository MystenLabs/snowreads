The approach, which relies on the Aedes-AI suite of\nneural networks, produces weekly point predictions with corresponding\nuncertainty estimates. Once calibrated on past trap and weather data, the model\nis designed to use weather forecasts to estimate future trap catches. We\ndemonstrate that when reliable input data are used, the resulting predictions\nhave high skill. This technique may therefore be used to supplement vector\nsurveillance efforts or identify periods of elevated risk for vector-borne\ndisease outbreaks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"obs7FtmO0KeogeXEHXw779mqyEhrRPXJgt_daYkvyks","pdfSize":"6095899"}
