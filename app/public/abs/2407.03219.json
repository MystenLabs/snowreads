We present guarantees on the quality of the\nlocalization, which are robust under mild assumptions on the density of the\nunknown/dynamic obstacles in the known environment. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in simulated experiments for different environments\nand varying dynamic-obstacle density.
