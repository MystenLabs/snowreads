Here, using an accurate, coupled full-dimensional diabatic potential\nthat includes five electronic states, we revisit the vibronic spectrum\nassociated with the electronic $\\tilde X ^2A_2'$ state. Using recently\ndeveloped tensor network state methods, we are able to compute more than 2500\nvibronic states, thereby increasing the number of computed full-dimensional\nstates by a factor of 50, compared to previous work. While we obtain good\nagreement with experiment for most of the assigned vibronic levels, for several\nothers, we observe striking disagreement. Further, for the antisymmetric\nbending motion we find remarkably large symmetry-induced level splittings that\nare larger than the zero-order reference. We discuss non-negligible\nnonadiabatic effects and show that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation leads to\nsignificant errors in the spectrum.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
