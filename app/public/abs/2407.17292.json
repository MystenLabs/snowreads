Strong gravitational\nlensing offers crucial insights into cosmology, but traditional Monte Carlo\nmethods for cosmological inference are computationally prohibitive and\ninadequate for processing the thousands of lenses anticipated from future\ncosmic surveys. New tools for inference, such as SBI using Neural Ratio\nEstimation (NRE), address this challenge effectively. By training a machine\nlearning model on simulated data of strong lenses, we can learn the\nlikelihood-to-evidence ratio for robust inference. Our scalable approach\nenables more constrained population-level inference of $w$ compared to\nindividual lens analysis, constraining $w$ to within $1\\sigma$. Our model can\nbe used to provide cosmological constraints from forthcoming strong lens\nsurveys, such as the 4MOST Strong Lensing Spectroscopic Legacy Survey (4SLSLS),\nwhich is expected to observe 10,000 strong lenses.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Nx5sB-3_hfR3p7TKePTtJZf-V0JDJFBfKewDAZogsfc","pdfSize":"748182"}
