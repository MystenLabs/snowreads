Recent work indicates that\nthe probability of particles found both in locally favored structures (LFS) and\nexcitations decreases significantly upon supercooling suggesting that there is\nan anti-correlation between them [Ortlieb et al, Nature Commun. 14, 2621\n(2023)]. However, the spatial relationship between excitations and LFS remains\nunclear. By employing state-of-the-art GPU computer simulations and colloid\nexperiments, we analyze this relationship between LFS and excitations in model\nglassformers. We demonstrate that there is a spatial separation between the two\nin deeply supercooled liquids. This may be due to the fact that LFS are\nwell-packed, thus they are relatively stable.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
