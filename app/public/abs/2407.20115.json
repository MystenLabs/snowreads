The main result enables one to solve a specific\nproblem by transferring it to another one for which a solution is known. The\nmain result is formulated in a rather surprising generality, involving\npreviously unknown cases, and it works even for some nonlinear operators such\nas the geometric or harmonic mean operators. Proofs use only elementary means.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
