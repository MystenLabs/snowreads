This propositional calculus is\nthen expanded with an infinitary rule to achieve strong completeness. These\nresults are derived from properties of monadic MValgebras: functional\nrepresentations of simple and finitely subdirectly irreducible algebras, as\nwell as the finite embeddability property. We also show similar completeness\ntheorems for the extension of the logic based on models with bounded universe.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
