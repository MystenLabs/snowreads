Within a\nquantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in\nterms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass)\nspectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently in the\nsaturated form when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$,\nwhere $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass\nspectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing\n$\\Delta A = \\alpha l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\\alpha = 4 \\ln 2$ for\nwhich the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units\ncoincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation\nfor other values of $\\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
