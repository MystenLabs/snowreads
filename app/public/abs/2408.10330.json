Meta-learning is used where model performance\nneeds to be maximized with minimum annotated samples, making it suitable for\nlow-sample audio processing. Although the field has made some significant\ncontributions, audio meta-learning still lacks the presence of comprehensive\nsurvey papers. We present a systematic review of meta-learning methodologies in\naudio processing. This includes audio-specific discussions on data\naugmentation, feature extraction, preprocessing techniques, meta-learners, task\nselection strategies and also presents important datasets in audio, together\nwith crucial real-world use cases. Through this extensive review, we aim to\nprovide valuable insights and identify future research directions in the\nintersection of meta-learning and audio processing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
