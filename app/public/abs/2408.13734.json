Detection of these musical onsets pose challenges in the\npresence of ornamentation such as vibrato, bending, and if the attack of the\nnote transient is slower. The legacy systems such as spectral difference or\nflux and complex domain functions suffer from the addition of false positives\ndue to ornamentation posing as viable onsets. We propose that this can be\nsolved by appropriately improving the resolution of the onset strength signal\n(OSS) and smoothening it to increase true positives and decrease false\npositives, respectively. An appropriate peak picking algorithm that works well\nin unison with the OSS generated is also desired. Since onset detection is a\nlow-level process upon which many other tasks are built, computational\ncomplexity must also be reduced. We propose an onset detection alogrithm that\nis a combination of short-time spectral average-based OSS estimation, chirp\ngroup delay-based smoothening, and valley-peak distance-based peak picking.\nThis algorithm performs on par with the state-of-the-art, superflux and\nconvolutional neural networks-based onset detection, with an average F1 score\nof 0.88, across three datasets. Subsets from the IDMT-SMT-Guitar, Guitarset,\nand Musicnet datasets that fit the scope of the work, are used for evaluation.\nIt is also found that the proposed algorithm is computationally 300\\% more\nefficient than superflux. The positive effects of smoothening an OSS, in\ndetermining the onset locations, is established by refining the OSS produced by\nlegacy algorithms, where consistent improvement in onset detection performance\nis observed. To provide insights into the performance of the proposed\nalgorithms when different ornamentation styles are present in the recording,\nthree levels of results are computed, by selecting different subsets of the\nIDMT dataset.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
