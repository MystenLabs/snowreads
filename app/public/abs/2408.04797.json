Due to the lack of penetration of GPS signals in buildings,\nsubterranean locales, and dense urban environments, indoor navigation solutions\ntypically make use of ubiquitous wireless signals (e.g., WiFi) and sensors in\nmobile embedded systems to perform tracking and localization. This article\nprovides an overview of the many challenges facing state-of-the-art indoor\nnavigation solutions, and then describes how AI algorithms deployed on mobile\nembedded systems can overcome these challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"O86YKGdwQa61jpLXf6B4ff51hVKvVzFkXvlRTKRAV9o","pdfSize":"219707"}
