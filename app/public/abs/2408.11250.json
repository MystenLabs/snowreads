This article presents a\nvision-based approach that utilizes deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nfor crack detection in AM surfaces. Traditional image processing techniques\nface challenges with diverse real-world scenarios and varying crack types. To\novercome these challenges, our proposed method leverages CNNs, eliminating the\nneed for extensive feature extraction. Annotation for CNN training is\nfacilitated by LabelImg without the requirement for additional IPTs. The\ntrained CNN, enhanced by OpenCV preprocessing techniques, achieves an\noutstanding 99.54% accuracy on a dataset of 14,982 annotated images with\nresolutions of 1536 x 1103 pixels. Evaluation metrics exceeding 96% precision,\n98% recall, and a 97% F1-score highlight the precision and effectiveness of the\nentire process.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
