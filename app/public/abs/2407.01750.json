Moreover, nanoconductors based on one- or\ntwo-dimensional carbon allotropes display a very high current-carrying capacity\nand ballistic transport. Here, we employ a recent, simple approach based on\ndensity functional theory to analyze the impact of strong current on the\nmechanical and magnetic properties of carbon nanoconductors. We find that the\ninfluence of the current itself on the bond-strength of carbon in general is\nremarkably low compared to e.g. typical metals. This is demonstrated for carbon\nchains, carbon nanotubes, graphene and polyacetylene. We can trace this to the\nstrong binding and electronic bandstructure. On the other hand, we find that\nthe current significanly change the magnetic properties. In particular, we find\nthat currents in graphene zig-zag edge states quench the magnetism.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
