Nevertheless, conventional\nmassive MU-MIMO BS transceiver designs rely on centralized linear precoding\nalgorithms, which entail high interconnect data rates and a prohibitive\ncomplexity at the centralized baseband processing unit. In this paper, we\nconsider an MU-MIMO system, where each user device is served with multiple\nindependent data streams in the downlink. To address the aforementioned\nchallenges, we propose a novel decentralized BS architecture, and develop a\nnovel decentralized precoding algorithm based on eigen-zero-forcing (EZF). Our\nproposed approach relies on parallelizing the baseband processing tasks across\nmultiple antenna clusters at the BS, while minimizing the interconnection\nrequirements between the clusters, and is shown to closely approach the\nperformance of centralized EZF.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Y8tQmQ5rExaRFoVUgiePDp0ic-35b7dX6Vf2x9VxgB4","pdfSize":"925510"}
