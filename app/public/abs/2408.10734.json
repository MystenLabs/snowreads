Curation and alignment is particularly infeasible for\nexternal open source information (OSINF), e.g., social media, which has become\nincreasingly valuable in understanding unfolding situations. Large language\nmodels (transformers) facilitate semantic data and metadata alignment but are\ninefficient in CJIIM settings characterised as denied, degraded, intermittent\nand low bandwidth (DDIL). Vector symbolic architectures (VSA) support semantic\ninformation processing using highly compact binary vectors, typically 1-10k\nbits, suitable in a DDIL setting. We demonstrate a novel integration of\ntransformer models with VSA, combining the power of the former for semantic\nmatching with the compactness and representational structure of the latter. The\napproach is illustrated via a proof-of-concept OSINF data discovery portal that\nallows partners in a CJIIM operation to share data sources with minimal\nmetadata curation and low communications bandwidth. This work was carried out\nas a bridge between previous low technology readiness level (TRL) research and\nfuture higher-TRL technology demonstration and deployment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
