The major remaining source of energy uncertainties in\nmonochromators, the periodic fluctuations produced by imperfect angular encoder\ncalibration, is addressed by a simultaneously running photoelectron\nspectroscopy measurement. This leads to an improved energy determination of 5\nparts per million, showing fair agreement with previous theories as well as\nwith our own, involving a complete treatment of the autoionizing states studied\nhere. Our experimental results translate to an uncertainty of only 1.6\\,km/s\nfor the oxygen line qr-blend used to determine the outflow velocities of active\ngalactic nuclei, ten times smaller than previously possible.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b4YwQwHWT-9XUduNGdhV5VeosKVECh8ZuVM0sNt3RWg","pdfSize":"2930883"}
