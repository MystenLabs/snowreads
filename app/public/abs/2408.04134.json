This paper studies ring theoretic\nproperties of the representation ring $T^\\Delta(B,B)$ of perfect\n$p$-permutation $(B,B)$-bimodules and properties of the $k$-algebra\n$k\\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} T^\\Delta(B,B)$, for a field $k$. We show that if the\nCartan matrix of $B$ has $1$ as an elementary divisor then $[B]$ is not\nprimitive in $T^\\Delta(B,B)$. If $B$ has cyclic defect groups we determine a\nprimitive decomposition of $[B]$ in $T^\\Delta(B,B)$. Moreover, if $k$ is a\nfield of characteristic different from $p$ and $B$ has cyclic defect groups of\norder $p^n$ we describe $k\\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} T^\\Delta(B,B)$ explicitly as a\ndirect product of a matrix algebra and $n$ group algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"HYqlKp8d1cMdiBmta5qVZKewaFoUcTIulnuF8O-lWrs","pdfSize":"278449"}
