In\n10.1017/fms.2024.14, the authors prove a combinatorial formula for the same\nsymmetric function, in terms of doubly labelled Dyck paths with the area\nstatistic. In this paper, we give an explicit bijection between the subsets of\nthe two families of objects when the relevant statistic is equal to $0$, thus\nproving the Symmetric Theta Tree Conjecture when $q=0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
