Based on its depth,\ncontinuous wavelength coverage from 1--5 microns, and medium spectral\nresolution (R~1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular\nemission lines spanning a broad range in rest wavelength. We investigate the\nlocations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams,\nincluding traditional \"BPT\" diagrams of [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha,\n[SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha, and the \"ionization-metallicity\" diagram of\n[OIII]/[OII] (O32) vs. ([OIII]+[OII])/Hbeta (R23). We also consider a bluer\nrest-frame \"ionization-metallicity\" diagram introduced recently to characterize\nz>10 galaxies: [NeIII]/[OII] vs. ([NeIII]+[OII])/Hdelta; as well as\nlonger-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR:\n[OIII]/Hbeta vs. [SIII]/[SII] (S32); and HeI/Pagamma and [SIII]/Pagamma vs.\n[FeII]/Pabeta. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise and large,\nrepresentative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA\nemission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture\nin which chemically-young, alpha-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the ISM in\ndistant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity\nthan in their z~0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution\nprior to z~2 in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram, which motivates deep\nNIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first\nstatistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in\nstar-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame\nnear-IR line ratios including [FeII], we must obtain better constraints on dust\ndepletion in the high-redshift ISM.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
