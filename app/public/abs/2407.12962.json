A finite,\npossibly large number if we consider the discrete aspect, i.e. on which surface\nwhich effectors are going to step and in what order. We introduce NAS, an\nalgorithm that considers both aspects simultaneously and computes all the\npossible solutions to such a contact planning problem, under standard\nassumptions. To our knowledge NAS is the first algorithm to produce a globally\noptimal policy, efficiently queried in real time for planning the next\nfootsteps of a humanoid robot.\n  Our empirical results (in simulation and on the Talos platform) demonstrate\nthat, despite the theoretical exponential complexity, optimisations reduce the\npractical complexity of NAS to a manageable bilinear form, maintaining\ncompleteness guarantees and enabling efficient GPU parallelisation. NAS is\ndemonstrated in a variety of scenarios for the Talos robot, both in simulation\nand on the hardware platform. Future work will focus on further reducing\ncomputation times and extending the algorithm's applicability beyond gaited\nlocomotion.
