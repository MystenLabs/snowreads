Based on the\npycefr tool, the tool incorporates JavaScript elements and the well-known\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and utilizes the\nofficial ECMAScript JavaScript documentation from the Mozilla Developer\nNetwork. jscefr categorizes JS code into six levels based on proficiency.\njscefr can detect and classify 138 different JavaScript code constructs. To\nevaluate, we apply our tool to three JavaScript projects of the NPM ecosystem,\nwith interesting results.\n  A video demonstrating the tool's availability and usage is available at\nhttps://youtu.be/Ehh-Prq59Pc.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
