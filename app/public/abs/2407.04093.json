Although this\nparadigm is efficient, it lacks the depth and fluidity of human interactions\nand does not appear natural. We introduce a novel \\textbf{Step}-by-Step\nDialogue Paradigm (Stephanie), designed to mimic the ongoing dynamic nature of\nhuman conversations. By employing a dual learning strategy and a further-split\npost-editing method, we generated and utilized a high-quality step-by-step\ndialogue dataset to fine-tune existing large language models, enabling them to\nperform step-by-step dialogues. We thoroughly present Stephanie. Tailored\nautomatic and human evaluations are conducted to assess its effectiveness\ncompared to the traditional single-step dialogue paradigm. We will release\ncode, Stephanie datasets, and Stephanie LLMs to facilitate the future of\nchatbot eras.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
