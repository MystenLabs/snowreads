We derive\nsimple flux models (we dub them RSTU-models) that admit a description in terms\nof gauged supergravities with half-maximal $\\,\\mathcal{N}=8\\,$ supersymmetry in\nthree dimensions. As a landscape appetizer, we present various multi-parametric\nfamilies of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric AdS$_{3}$ and Mkw$_{3}$\nvacua. Remarkably, negative masses turn out to be always absent in the spectrum\nof scalar fluctuations, thus making all the vacua perturbatively stable within\nhalf-maximal supergravity. We provide examples of non-supersymmetric type IIB\nAdS$_{3}$ flux vacua which feature parametrically-controlled scale separation\nand come along with integer-valued conformal dimensions of the would-be dual\nCFT$_{2}$ operators. We also comment on the implications of our results in\nlight of the Swampland Program.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1gnXYqsNDsfJFCm5dJaae1X7-dXa7wabOqxIPGW0h0o","pdfSize":"658367","txDigest":"GPjh9ERAwBBXczhJmfGcLTEVEfiF2UnAC1d8Q1SxoY4k","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
