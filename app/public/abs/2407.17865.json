In particular, we obtain that the class of\n$\\phi$-$w$-P-flat modules is covering. We also utilize the class of\n$\\phi$-$w$-P-flat modules to characterize $\\phi$-von Neumann regular rings,\nstrong $\\phi$-rings and $\\phi$-PvMRs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
