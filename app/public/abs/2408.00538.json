Storing and sharing those datasets becomes thus very costly,\nespecially if more than one camera is used for the datasets. It is thus\nessential to store this video data in a compressed format. This paper\ninvestigates the use of modern video encoders for robotic datasets. We provide\na software that can replay mp4 videos within ROS 1 and ROS 2 frameworks,\nsupporting the synchronized playback in simulated time. Furthermore, the paper\nevaluates different encoders and their settings to find optimal configurations\nin terms of resulting size, quality and encoding time. Through this work we\nshow that it is possible to store and share even highest quality video datasets\nwithin reasonable storage constraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
