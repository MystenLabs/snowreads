Both are instances of partial flag varieties. We\nexhibit embeddings of the corresponding cluster algebras into cluster algebras\nof sufficiently large Grassmannians and show how the former is obtained from\nthe latter by freezing certain cluster variables and specializing some cluster\nvariables to one.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
