Recently, the integration of contrastive learning with GNNs has\ndemonstrated remarkable performance in recommender systems to handle the issue\nof highly sparse user-item interaction data. Yet, some available graph\ncontrastive learning (GCL) techniques employ stochastic augmentation, i.e.,\nnodes or edges are randomly perturbed on the user-item bipartite graph to\nconstruct contrastive views. Such a stochastic augmentation strategy not only\nbrings noise perturbation but also cannot utilize global collaborative signals\neffectively. To address it, this study proposes a latent factor analysis (LFA)\nenhanced GCL approach, named LFA-GCL. Our model exclusively incorporates LFA to\nimplement the unconstrained structural refinement, thereby obtaining an\naugmented global collaborative graph accurately without introducing noise\nsignals. Experiments on four public datasets show that the proposed LFA-GCL\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
