These\napproaches include, for example, variational quantum eigensolvers and many-body\nquantum simulators and their realization with limited computational techniques\ncritically depends on the development of efficient optimization techniques. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new optimization strategy for dense quantum\ncircuits, leveraging tensor network optimization principles. Our approach\nfocuses on optimizing one gate at a time by fully characterizing the dependency\nof the cost function on the gate through environment tensor tomography,\nobtained via noisy measurements on a quantum device. We compute the minimal\nnumber of measurements needed to perform a full tensor tomography and relate\nthis number to unitary 2-design. We then describe a general framework for\nlandscape tomography based on linear regression and compare two different\nimplementations based on shadow tomography and Clifford tableaux, respectively.\nFinally, we compare our strategy with both gradient-free optimization and\ngradient-based optimization based on the parameter-shift rule, highlighting\npotential benefits of our algorithm for the development of quantum algorithms\nin noisy devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
