The algorithm\nof Lagarias and Odlyzko is a cornerstone result in cryptography. However, the\ntheoretical guarantee on the density of feasible instances has remained\nunimproved for almost 40 years.\n  In this paper, we propose an algorithm to solve ``almost all'' instances of\nSubset Sum with integers of size $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\Gamma_{\\text{LO}}})$ after a\nsingle call to the lattice reduction. Additionally, our argument allows us to\nsolve the Subset Sum problem for multiple targets while the previous approach\ncould only answer one target per call to lattice basis reduction. We introduce\na modular arithmetic approach to the Subset Sum problem. The idea is to use the\nlattice reduction to solve a linear system modulo a suitably large prime. We\nshow that density guarantees can be improved, by analysing the lengths of the\nLLL reduced basis vectors, of both the primal and the dual lattices\nsimultaneously.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"mwhr9m4Er8KjEq9D5yLRUM8g6esNLlWnts_r0wJR2oE","pdfSize":"925132"}
