We prove that the boundary\nspectrum free region is of size ${\\mathcal O}(h^{1-\\frac{1}{s}})$ where the\nresolvent is at most fractional exponentially large in $h$, as the\nsemiclassical parameter $h\\to 0^+$. This is a natural Gevrey analogue of a\nresult by N. Dencker, J. Sj{\\\"o}strand, and M. Zworski in the $C^{\\infty}$ and\nanalytic cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
