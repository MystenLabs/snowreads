We utilize spin chains with\nconstraints to study the physics of quantum avalanches by exact diagonalization\nof disordered systems coupled to a thermal bath. Single-spin observables are\nused to characterize localization and quantify the influence of the thermal\nbath on long disordered spin chains. In addition to the PXP model, we construct\nmodels by searching for constraints with a genetic algorithm to reach longer\nsystem sizes. We define quantities to measure the strength of avalanches and\nuse these to compare different models. Avalanches are more pronounced in models\nwith constraints compared to those without constraints. Exact diagonalization\nresults are compared with other studies using the master equation. We also\nidentify models that exhibit no thermal phases and find stable ergodicity\nbreaking.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
