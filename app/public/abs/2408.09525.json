Mathematically, this\nsystem is very interesting because it contains rich dynamics in it which is\ngenerated by only one bifurcation parameter b. Depending on the value of b, the\nsystem is undergo through a stable regime, limit cycles, infinite amount of\nbifurcations, a series growing to infinity of fixed points, and chaos\ncontaining multiple attractors. Another interesting behaviour of the system is\nin the limit of b goes to zero, which means that there is no dissipation term.\nThe system is then containing an infinite number of fixed points and behaves\nlike a Brownian motion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
