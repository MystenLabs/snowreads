The model replaces each collisional term of the Boltzmann equation\nwith a relaxation term, thereby describing separately the effects of the\nmechanical processes and the chemical reaction. Additionally, the model\nexhibits consistency properties. The correct entropy production is ensured when\nauxiliary temperatures in the chemical contributions share a common value. We\nassume isotropic distributions and perform numerical simulations for the\nmacroscopic fields to appraise how the dynamics push the mixture toward\nthermalization and chemical equilibrium. We show that the hypothesis on the\nequalization of fictitious species temperatures is justifiable to ensure the\nmonotonicity of the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional. Simulations show that,\nwhen initial temperatures are far from equilibrium, the relaxation towards\nequilibrium occurs at a later stage and the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional\nis not monotone during the initial transient.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
