It allows us to map the evolutionary stages of the\ninterconvertibility process between Lieb and kagome nanoribbons by means of\nonly one control parameter. Results for the energy spectra, the density of\nstates, and spatial probability density distributions are discussed for\nnanoribbons with three types of edges: straight, bearded, and asymmetric. We\nexplore for different nanoribbon terminations: (i) the semiconductor-metallic\ntransition due to the interconvertibility of the Lieb and kagome lattices, (ii)\nthe effect of both nanoribbon width and inclusion of the next-nearest-neighbor\nhopping term on the degeneracy of the quasi-flat states, (iii) the behavior of\nthe energy gap versus the nanoribbon width, (iv) the existence and evolution of\nedge states, and (v) the nodal spatial distributions of the total probability\ndensities of the non-dispersive states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
