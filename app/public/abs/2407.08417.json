BERTopic, consisting of sentence\nembedding, dimension reduction, clustering, and topic extraction, is the newest\nand currently the SOTA topic modeling method. However, current topic modeling\nmethods have room for improvement because, as unsupervised methods, they\nrequire careful tuning and selection of hyperparameters, e.g., for dimension\nreduction and clustering. This paper aims to analyse the technical application\nof BERTopic in practice. For this purpose, it compares and selects different\nmethods and hyperparameters for each stage of BERTopic through density based\nclustering validation and six different topic coherence measures. Moreover, it\nalso aims to analyse the results of topic modeling on real world data as a use\ncase. For this purpose, the German fake news dataset (GermanFakeNCovid) on\nCovid-19 was created by us and in order to experiment with topic modeling in a\nmultilingual (English and German) setting combined with the FakeCovid dataset.\nWith the final results, we were able to determine thematic similarities between\nthe United States and Germany. Whereas, distinguishing the topics of fake news\nfrom India proved to be more challenging.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"65yh39AcGlNzCYf5EIBIPMWksm6GBO6y2CLi5mIl2VM","pdfSize":"934327"}
