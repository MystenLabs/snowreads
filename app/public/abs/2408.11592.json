As in most supervised-learning tasks, a critical\naspect is the availability of a relevant dataset to train a model. However, in\na cellular network, the data-collection step may induce a high communication\noverhead. As a result, to reduce the required size of the dataset, it may be\ninteresting to carefully choose the positions to be labelled and to be used in\nthe training. We therefore propose an active learning approach for efficient\ndata collection. We first show that significant gains (both in terms of\npositioning accuracy and size of the required dataset) can be obtained for the\nconsidered positioning problem using a genie. This validates the interest of\nactive learning for positioning. We then propose a \\textcolor{blue}{practical}\nmethod to approximate this genie.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oXVM-jZWTXDLl4K1QNLTOTPi0A2yJtNHkFppp9_Pz8M","pdfSize":"269403"}
