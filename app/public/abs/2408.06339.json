We developed a\ncollisional plasma kinetic model using the Boltzmann equation and a simple BGK\ncollision operator which predicts a relatively simple relationship between the\nintensity of the background electric field and the resulting ion distribution\nfunction. To test the model, we perform 3-D plasma particle-in-cell simulations\nand compare the results to the model. The simulation applies an elastic\ncollision operator assuming a constant ion-neutral collision rate. These\nsimulations show less ion heating in the Pedersen direction than the analytic\nmodel but show similar overall heating. The model overestimates the heating in\nthe Pedersen direction because the simple BGK operator includes no angular\ncollisional scattering in the ion velocity space. On the other hand, the\nfully-kinetic particle-in-cell code is able to capture the physics of ion\nscattering in 3-D and therefore heats ions more isotropically. Although the\nsimple BGK analytic theory does not precisely model the non-Maxwellian ion\ndistribution function, it does capture the overall momentum and energy flows\nand therefore can provide the basis of further analysis of E-region wave\nevolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GebsHw0nqWw_JJNEUxySZMR1UJobZKbtjtF5O4ZMKkQ","pdfSize":"985249"}
