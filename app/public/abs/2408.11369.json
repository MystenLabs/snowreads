Herein, we present the\nsynthesis of 1T-OsCoTe$_2$ for the photoreduction upgrading of CO$_2$ to\ntricarbon alkane C$_3$H$_8$,by the integration of experimental work and theory\ncalculation. Experimental studies suggested a high electron based selectivity\nof 71.2% for C$_3$H$_8$ and an internal quantum efficiency of 54.6% at 380 nm.\nIn-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure\nspectroscopy demonstrated that Co and Os atoms coordinated with Te atoms enable\nan efficient Os-Te-Co electron transfer to activate the generation of\n*CH$_3$,*CHOCO and *CH$_2$OCOCO. Density functional theory calculations further\nconfirmed Os-Te-Co electron bridging on the improved CO$_2$ conversion\nkinetics. To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting the role of Os\natoms in accelerating the photocatalytic CO$_2$ conversion activity of the\ntopological semimetal 1T-OsCoTe$_2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
