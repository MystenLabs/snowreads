We find that the galaxy rotational support $\\lambda_{R_\\mathrm{e}}$\nvaries smoothly as a function of $\\Delta \\Sigma_1$ and $\\rm D_n4000$. $\\rm\nD_n4000$ vs. $\\Delta \\Sigma_1$ follows a \"J-shape\", with\n$\\lambda_{R_\\mathrm{e}}$ contributing to the scatters. In this \"J-shaped\"\npattern rotational support increases with central $\\rm D_n4000$ when $\\Delta\n\\Sigma_1$ is low but decreases with $\\Delta \\Sigma_1$ when $\\Delta \\Sigma_1$ is\nhigh. Restricting attention to low-$\\Delta \\Sigma_1$ (i.e, large-radius)\ngalaxies, we suggest that the trend of increasing rotational support with $\\rm\nD_n4000$ for these objects is produced by a mix of two different processes, a\nprimary trend characterized by growth in $\\lambda_{R_\\mathrm{e}}$ along with\nmass through gas accretion, on top of which disturbance episodes are overlaid,\nwhich reduce rotational support and trigger increased star formation. An\nadditional finding is that star forming galaxies with low $\\Delta \\Sigma_1$\nhave relatively larger radii than galaxies with higher $\\Delta \\Sigma_1$ at\nfixed stellar mass. Assuming that these relative radii rankings are preserved\nwhile galaxies are star forming then implies clear evolutionary paths in\ncentral $\\rm D_n4000$ vs. $\\Delta \\Sigma_1$. The paper closes with comments on\nthe implications that these paths have for the evolution of pseudo-bulges vs.\nclassical-bulges. The utility of using $\\rm D_n4000$-$\\Delta \\Sigma_1$ to study\n$\\lambda_{R_\\mathrm{e}}$ reinforces the notion that galaxy kinematics correlate\nboth with structure and with stellar-population state, and indicates the\nimportance of a multi-dimensional description for understanding bulge and\ngalaxy evolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
