The distinctive capabilities of event cameras\nhave ignited significant interest in the domain of event-based action\nrecognition, recognizing their vast potential for advancement. However, the\ndevelopment in this field is currently slowed by the lack of comprehensive,\nlarge-scale datasets, which are critical for developing robust recognition\nframeworks. To bridge this gap, we introduces DailyDVS-200, a meticulously\ncurated benchmark dataset tailored for the event-based action recognition\ncommunity. DailyDVS-200 is extensive, covering 200 action categories across\nreal-world scenarios, recorded by 47 participants, and comprises more than\n22,000 event sequences. This dataset is designed to reflect a broad spectrum of\naction types, scene complexities, and data acquisition diversity. Each sequence\nin the dataset is annotated with 14 attributes, ensuring a detailed\ncharacterization of the recorded actions. Moreover, DailyDVS-200 is structured\nto facilitate a wide range of research paths, offering a solid foundation for\nboth validating existing approaches and inspiring novel methodologies. By\nsetting a new benchmark in the field, we challenge the current limitations of\nneuromorphic data processing and invite a surge of new approaches in\nevent-based action recognition techniques, which paves the way for future\nexplorations in neuromorphic computing and beyond.
