This is achieved by lifting the vorticity blowup\nresult from [CCSV24] in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and utilizing the\naxisymmetry in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. At the time of the first singularity, both\nvorticity blowup and implosion occur on a sphere $S^{d-2}$. Additionally, the\nsolution exhibits a non-radial implosion, accompanied by a stable swirl\nvelocity that is sufficiently strong to initially dominate the non-radial\ncomponents and to generate the vorticity blowup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
