However, the existing systems (e.g. TEMPEH) are strictly\nrestricted to inference on the data captured by the same camera array used to\ncapture their training data. In this study, we aim to improve the\ngeneralization ability so that a trained model can be readily used for\ninference (i.e. capture new data) on a different camera array. To this end, we\npropose a more generalizable initialization module to extract the camera\narray-agnostic 3D feature, including a visual hull-based head localization and\na visibility-aware 3D feature aggregation module enabled by the visual hull. In\naddition, we propose an ``update-by-disagreement'' learning strategy to better\nhandle data noise (e.g. inaccurate registration, scan noise) by discarding\npotentially inaccurate supervision signals during training. The resultant\ngeneralizable and robust topologically consistent multi-view facial capture\nsystem (GRAPE) can be readily used to capture data on a different camera array,\nreducing great effort on data collection and processing. Experiments on the\nFaMoS and FaceScape datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
