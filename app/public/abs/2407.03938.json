They asked if the elements of order 4 are necessary,\nin the following strong sense: if $G$ is an abelian group having no elements of\norder 4, is it always the case there there is a countable colouring of $G$ for\nwhich there is not even a monochromatic sumset $X+X$ with $X$ of size 2? Our\naim in this short note is to show that this is indeed the case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ObarX_d1Bx4-7tg3oM9t-lrB81IVJrhH59rtB4umr1s","pdfSize":"94215"}
