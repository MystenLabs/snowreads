However, it\nremains unclear to what extent feedback loops in music recommendation influence\nthe dynamics of such imbalance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of\nrepresentation of local (i.e., country-specific) and US-produced music in user\nprofiles and recommendations. To this end, we conduct a feedback loop\nsimulation study using the standardized LFM-2b dataset. The results suggest\nthat most of the investigated recommendation models decrease the proportion of\nmusic from local artists in their recommendations. Furthermore, we find that\nmodels preserving average proportions of US and local music do not necessarily\nprovide country-calibrated recommendations. We also look into popularity\ncalibration and, surprisingly, find that the most popularity-calibrated model\nin our study (ItemKNN) provides the least country-calibrated recommendations.\nIn addition, users from less represented countries (e.g., Finland) are, in the\nlong term, most affected by the under-representation of their local music in\nrecommendations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
