The framework captures model\nuncertainty, with potential models penalized in function of their adapted\nWasserstein distance to a given reference model. Strength of the penalty is\ncontrolled using a real-valued parameter, which is simply the radius of the\nuncertainty ball in the special case of an indicator penalty. Our main results\nderive the first-order sensitivity of the value of causal DRO with respect to\nthe penalization parameter, i.e., we compute the sensitivity to model\nuncertainty. Moreover, we investigate the case where a martingale constraint is\nimposed on the underlying model, as is the case for pricing measures in\nmathematical finance. We introduce different scaling regimes, which allow us to\nobtain the continuous-time sensitivities as nontrivial limits of their\ndiscrete-time counterparts. We illustrate our results with examples.\n  Our proofs rely on novel methods. In particular, we introduce pathwise\nMalliavin derivative, which agree a.s. with its classical counterpart under the\nWiener measure, and we extend the adjoint operator, the Skorokhod integral, to\nregular martingale integrators and show it satisfies a stochastic Fubini\ntheorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
