Then, we constrain the parameters of the\n$w_{\\mathrm{bin}}$CDM model using datasets from DESI BAO data, Planck CMB power\nspectrum, ACT DR6 lensing power spectrum, and type Ia supernova\ndistance-redshift data of Pantheon Plus/DES Y5/Union3. The significances for\n$w_1>-1$ is $1.9\\sigma$, $2.6\\sigma$ and $3.3\\sigma$, and $w_2$ is consistent\nwith $-1$ within $1\\sigma$ level, while $1.6\\sigma$, $1.5\\sigma$ and\n$1.5\\sigma$ for $w_3<-1$ in these three data combinations with different\nchoices of type Ia supernova datasets, respectively. Additionally, to alleviate\n$H_0$ tension, we incorporate the early dark energy (EDE) model in the\nearly-time universe and add the SH0ES absolute magnitude $M_b$ prior (or $H_0$\nprior) to further constrain the $w_{\\mathrm{bin}}$EDE model. In the\n$w_{\\mathrm{bin}}$EDE model, we find a $w_{\\mathrm{bin}}(z)$ pattern similar to\nthat in the $w_{\\mathrm{bin}}$CDM model. The results of the three data\ncombinations exhibit $w_1>-1$ at $1.9\\sigma$, $1.7\\sigma$ and $2.9\\sigma$\nlevel, meanwhile $w_3<-1$ at $1.3\\sigma$, $1.3\\sigma$ and $1.3\\sigma$ level,\nrespectively. In all, our results indicate that the transition of dark energy\nfrom phantom at high redshifts to quintessence at low redshifts is not\nconclusive.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
