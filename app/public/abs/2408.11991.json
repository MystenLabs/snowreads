Real molecules, however, have\nanharmonic potential energy surfaces. To partially describe effects of\nanharmonicity on the spectra, we combine the Hagedorn approach to spectroscopy\nwith the local harmonic approximation of the potential. We compute the SVL\nspectra for several anharmonic Morse-type potentials in one, two, and twenty\ndimensions and compare them to the results of global harmonic approximations\nand, where possible, of exact quantum calculations. We show that the local\nharmonic approach yields more accurate results than global harmonic\napproximations, especially for the emission spectra from higher initial\nvibrational levels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
