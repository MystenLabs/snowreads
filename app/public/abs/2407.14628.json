Various\nself-supervision techniques such as rotation prediction, missing patch\nprediction, and corruption removal were implemented and assessed for their\nimpact on the convolutional neural network's performance. Preliminary results\nsuggest a positive influence of self-supervision methods on the model's\naccuracy. The study notably demonstrates the efficacy of the corruption removal\nmethod in enhancing model performance. Despite observable improvements, we\nconclude that the self-supervised models have considerable potential for\nfurther enhancement, achievable through training over more epochs or expanding\nthe dataset. We suggest exploring other self-supervision methods like Bootstrap\nYour Own Latent (BYOL) and contrastive learning in future research, emphasizing\nthe cost-benefit trade-off due to their resource-intensive nature. The findings\nunderline the promise of self-supervision in augmenting melanoma detection\ncapabilities of deep learning models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
