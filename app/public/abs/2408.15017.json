A potentially distinct signature is a\nlong-duration gravitational wave (GW) burst from BH central engines by their\nample energy reservoir $E_J$ in angular momentum, far more so than an NS can\nprovide. A natural catalyst for this radiation is surrounding high-density\nmatter in the form of a non-axisymmetric disk or torus. Here, we derive a\ndetailed outlook on LVK probes of core-collapse supernovae CC-SNe during the\npresent observational run O4 based on their event rate, an association with\nnormal long GRBs and mass-scaling of GW170817B/GRB170817A. For BH central\nengines of mass $M$, GW170817B predicts a descending GW-chirp of energy ${\\cal\nE}_{GW}\\simeq 3.5\\% M_\\odot c^2 \\left(M/M_0\\right)$ at frequency\n$f_{GW}\\lesssim 700\\,{\\rm Hz}\\left(M_0/M\\right)$, where $M_0\\simeq\n2.8\\,M_\\odot$. For a few tens of events per year well into the Local Universe\nwithin 50-100Mpc, probes at the detector-limited sensitivity are expected to\nbreak the degeneracy between their NS or BH central engines {by GW calorimetry.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
