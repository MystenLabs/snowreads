We then describe the construction of a modular tensor\ncategory (MTC) associated to rational LLCFTs. We explicitly construct the\nmodular data and braiding and fusing matrices for the MTC. As a concrete\nexample, we show that the LLCFT based on a certain even, self-dual Lorentzian\nlattice of signature $(m,n)$ with $m$ even realises the $D(m\\bmod 8)$ level 1\nKac-Moody MTC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R4rZ6MI-uzXg31jzzmeOTMlZT8SwP8-0Jw-fZ14ovO0","pdfSize":"344400"}
