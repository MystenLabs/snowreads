Inspired by membrane-mediated receptor dynamics on cell surfaces, we\nformulate a stochastic particle-based model for diffusion and pairwise\ninteraction of particles, leading to intriguing clustering phenomena. Employing\nnumerical simulation and cluster detection methods, we explore the\napproximation of the particle-based clustering dynamics through mean-field\napproaches. We find that SPDEs successfully reproduce spatiotemporal clustering\ndynamics, not only in the initial cluster formation period, but also on longer\ntime scales where the successive merging of clusters cannot be tracked by\ndeterministic mean-field models. The computational efficiency of the SPDE\napproach allows us to generate extensive statistical data for parameter\nestimation in a simpler model that uses a Markov jump process to capture the\ntemporal evolution of the cluster number.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
