Deep Neural Crossover leverages\nthe capabilities of deep reinforcement learning and an encoder-decoder\narchitecture to select offspring genes. BERT mutation masks multiple gp-tree\nnodes and then tries to replace these masks with nodes that will most likely\nimprove the individual's fitness. We show the efficacy of both operators\nthrough experimentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lvWqyz8OymCH51SfwOQpmW52_bAlsyQZWfkvz3TGYYA","pdfSize":"1035334"}
