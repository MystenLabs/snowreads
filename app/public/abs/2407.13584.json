To understand the\nessence of those issues, we thoroughly analyze current score distillation\nmethods by connecting theories of consistency distillation to score\ndistillation. Based on the insights acquired through analysis, we propose an\noptimization framework, Guided Consistency Sampling (GCS), integrated with 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) to alleviate those issues. Additionally, we have\nobserved the persistent oversaturation in the rendered views of generated 3D\nassets. From experiments, we find that it is caused by unwanted accumulated\nbrightness in 3DGS during optimization. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a\nBrightness-Equalized Generation (BEG) scheme in 3DGS rendering. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach generates 3D assets with more details and\nhigher fidelity than state-of-the-art methods.
