The particle is subjected to the action of a force\ncharacterized by the potential\n$V(\\theta)=2m\\omega_{1}^{2}R^{2}\\tan^{2}(\\theta/2)+2m\\omega_{2}^{2}R^{2}\\cot^{2}(\\theta/2)$,\nwhere $0\\leqslant\\theta\\leqslant\\pi$ is the hyperlatitude angular coordinate.\nIn the general case when $\\omega_{1}\\neq\\omega_{2}$, this is a model of a\nhyperspherical analogue of the P\\\"oschl-Teller anharmonic oscillator. Energy\neigenvalues and normalized eigenfunctions for this system are found in closed\nanalytical forms. For $N=2$, our results reproduce those obtained by Kazaryan\net al. [Physica E 52 (2013) 122]. For $N\\geqslant2$ arbitrary and for\n$\\omega_{2}=0$, the results of Mardoyan and Petrosyan [J. Contemp. Phys. 48\n(2013) 70] for their model of an isotropic hyperspherical harmonic oscillator\nare recovered. The Euclidean limit for the anharmonic oscillator in question is\nalso discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
