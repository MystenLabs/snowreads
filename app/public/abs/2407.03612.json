By tuning the next-nearest hopping\nstrength, we realize a first-order phase transition between the\nantiferromagnetic superradiant phase and the frustrated superradiant phase, as\nwell as a second-order phase transition between the normal and the superradiant\nphases. To understand the emergence of such phases, we show analytically that\nthe effect induced by next-nearest hopping is equivalent to that of an\nartificial gauge phase. Our findings suggest that the next-nearest-neighbor\nhopping can serve as an alternative for the gauge phase to realize quantum\ncontrol in applications of quantum simulation and quantum materials, and that\nour model represents a basic building block for the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$\nquantum spin model on square lattices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
