The gravidynamics predicted by such a theory could\nlead to important implications, and the comparisons with experimental results\nmay provide us opportunities to test such new approach of gravity based on the\nframework of the quantum field theory of gauge interactions. In this work, we\nstart with the effective field equation of the gravitational quantum field\ntheory, and then solve the perturbative gravigauge field order by order up to\nthe 1st post-Newtonian level under the assumption of a simplified\nenergy-momentum tensor of perfect fluids. Having the constraints on the related\npost-Newtonian parameters from the most up-to-date observational data, the new\nbound on the combined coupling in the gravitational quantum field theory\n$|\\gamma_G(\\alpha_G-\\alpha_W/2)| \\leq (2.4\\pm30)\\times10^{-6}$ is obtained.\nUnder such bound, we found that the new gravitational quantum field theory\nsuccessfully passed and found no conflict with the contemporary keynote Solar\nsystem experiments of gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
