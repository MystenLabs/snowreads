The main ingredients of our algorithm\nare: the embedding of $\\ell$-isogenies in smooth-degree isogenies in higher\ndimension, and the computation of $m$-th order deformations of isogenies. We\nprovide a proof-of-concept implementation of a heuristic version of the\nalgorithm demonstrating the practicality of our approach.\n  Our algorithm can also be used to compute the reduction of $\\Phi_{\\ell}$\nmodulo $p$ in quasi-linear time (with respect to $\\ell$) $\\tilde{O}(\\ell^2(\\log\np + \\log \\ell)^{\\mathfrak{O}})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
