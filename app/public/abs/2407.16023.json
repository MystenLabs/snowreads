We focus on the part of the nonlinear I-V characteristic\nthat is odd in the applied magnetic field, and quadratic in the applied bias\nvoltage. This part of the I-V characteristic corresponds to the resistance of\nthe sample being dependent on the relative orientation of the current and an\nexternal magnetic field, hence represents a type of edge magnetochiral\nanisotropy. We identify two mechanisms of the magnetochiral anisotropy. One is\nrelated to the Hubbard interaction on the midgap state, which leads to the\ndependence of the scattering characteristics on the current flowing on the\nedge, which results in bias-voltage-dependent resistance, or equivalently\nconductance, hence a nonlinear I-V. The other is related to the modification of\nthe edge dispersion by a magnetic field, and requires nonlinearity in the edge\ndispersion. We compare the developed theory to the experiments on monolayer\n$\\mathrm{WTe}_{2}$, and find good agreement with the developed theory.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
