With\nthis contribution we aim to broaden the discourse on Green AI by investigating\nthe current status of approaches to both environmental assessment and ecodesign\nof AI systems. We propose a life-cycle-based system thinking approach that\naccounts for the four key elements of these software-hardware-systems: model,\ndata, server, and cloud. We conduct an exemplary estimation of the carbon\nfootprint of relevant compute hardware and highlight the need to further\ninvestigate methods for Green AI and ways to facilitate wide-spread adoption of\nits principles. We envision that AI could be leveraged to mitigate its own\nenvironmental challenges, which we denote as AI4greenAI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
