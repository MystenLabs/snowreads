We utilize the\nlatest advancements in AI technology to identify crucial factors that influence\nthe success of crowdfunding campaigns and to improve their fundraising outcomes\nby strategically optimizing these factors. Our best-performing machine learning\nmodel accurately predicts the fundraising outcomes of 81.0% of campaigns,\nprimarily based on their textual descriptions. Interpreting the machine\nlearning model allows us to provide actionable suggestions on improving the\ntextual description before launching a campaign. We demonstrate that by\naugmenting just three aspects of the narrative using a large language model, a\ncampaign becomes more preferable to 83% human evaluators, and its likelihood of\nsecuring financial support increases by 11.9%. Our research uncovers the\neffective strategies for crafting descriptions for small business fundraising\ncampaigns and opens up a new realm in integrating large language models into\ncrowdfunding methodologies.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
