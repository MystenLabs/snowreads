A customized SResNet-18 network\nwas developed, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% on the test set, outperforming\nResNet-18, VGGNet-16, and AlexNet. The extracted feature vectors from\nSResNet-18 were evaluated using three metrics: cosine similarity, Euclidean\ndistance, and Manhattan distance. The analysis results were visually\nrepresented on an ethnic thematic map, highlighting the connections between\nethnic patterns and their regional distributions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
