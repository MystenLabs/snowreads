Hybrid querying using SQL offers an alternative by\nintegrating relational databases with large language models (LLMs) to answer\nbeyond-database questions. In this paper, we present the first cross-domain\nbenchmark, SWAN, containing 120 beyond-database questions over four real-world\ndatabases. To leverage state-of-the-art language models in addressing these\ncomplex questions in SWAN, we present, HQDL, a preliminary solution for hybrid\nquerying, and also discuss potential future directions. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that HQDL using GPT-4 Turbo with few-shot prompts, achieves 40.0\\%\nin execution accuracy and 48.2\\% in data factuality. These results highlights\nboth the potential and challenges for hybrid querying. We believe that our work\nwill inspire further research in creating more efficient and accurate data\nsystems that seamlessly integrate relational databases and large language\nmodels to address beyond-database questions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
