So the purpose of\nthis paper is to achieve manifold action instances localization in a lengthy\nuntrimmed query video using limited trimmed support videos. To address this\nchallenging problem effectively, we proposed a novel solution involving a\nspatial-channel relation transformer with probability learning and cluster\nrefinement. This method can accurately identify the start and end boundaries of\nactions in the query video, utilizing only a limited number of labeled videos.\nOur proposed method is adept at capturing both temporal and spatial contexts to\neffectively classify and precisely locate actions in videos, enabling a more\ncomprehensive utilization of these crucial details. The selective cosine\npenalization algorithm is designed to suppress temporal boundaries that do not\ninclude action scene switches. The probability learning combined with the label\ngeneration algorithm alleviates the problem of action duration diversity and\nenhances the model's ability to handle fuzzy action boundaries. The interval\ncluster can help us get the final results with multiple instances situations in\nfew-shot temporal action localization. Our model achieves competitive\nperformance through meticulous experimentation utilizing the benchmark datasets\nActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14.
