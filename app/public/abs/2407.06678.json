Our approach consists in solving a sequence of\noptimal control problems discretized with different levels of accuracy of the\nphysical and probability discretizations. The final approximation of the\ncontrol is then obtained in a postprocessing step, by suitably combining the\nadjoint variables computed on the different levels. We present a convergence\nanalysis for an unconstrained linear quadratic problem, and detail our\nframework for the specific case of a Multilevel Monte Carlo quadrature formula.\nNumerical experiments confirm the better computational complexity of our MLMC\napproach compared to a standard Monte Carlo sample average approximation, even\nbeyond the theoretical assumptions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
