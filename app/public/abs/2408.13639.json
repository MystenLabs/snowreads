This technique has been widely used in medical image\nsegmentation tasks to fasten network training. However, scribble supervision\nhas limitations in terms of annotation consistency across samples and the\navailability of comprehensive groundtruth information. Additionally, it often\ngrapples with the challenge of accommodating varying scale targets,\nparticularly in the context of medical images. In this paper, we propose three\nnovel methods to overcome these challenges, namely, 1) the cross-shape scribble\nannotation method; 2) the pseudo mask method based on cross shapes; and 3) the\nsize-aware multi-branch method. The parameter and structure design are\ninvestigated in depth. Experimental results show that the proposed methods have\nachieved significant improvement in mDice scores across multiple polyp\ndatasets. Notably, the combination of these methods outperforms the performance\nof state-of-the-art scribble supervision methods designed for medical image\nsegmentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
