Here I provide an iterable version of the surgery formula that, provided\nthe initial knot lattice space with flip map, produces a space isomorphic as a\ndoubly-filtered space to the corresponding knot lattice space for the dual knot\nwith the corresponding flip map. If we include the involutive data for the\noriginal knot and ambient three-manifold, we can also produce the corresponding\ninvolutive data on the new knot lattice space without assuming that the\noriginal three-manifold is an $L$-space. I construct $\\infty$-categories where\nthese operations are functorial. Finally, I use the surgery formula to compute\nsome examples of knot lattice spaces including for the regular fiber of\n$\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ and for a knot in a three-manifold that is not given by an\nalmost rational graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
