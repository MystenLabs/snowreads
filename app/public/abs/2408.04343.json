The simulation algorithm is based on a matrix-vector\nmultiplication, which is an operation efficiently implemented on parallel\ndevices. However, when the graph of a Spiking Neural P system is not fully\nconnected, the adjacency matrix is sparse and hence, lots of computing\nresources are wasted in both time and memory domains. For this reason, two\ncompression methods for the matrix representation were proposed in a previous\nwork, but they were not implemented nor parallelized on a simulator. In this\npaper, they are implemented and parallelized on GPUs as part of a new Spiking\nNeural P system with delays simulator. Extensive experiments are conducted on\nhigh-end GPUs (RTX2080 and A100 80GB), and it is concluded that they outperform\nother solutions based on state-of-the-art GPU libraries when simulating Spiking\nNeural P systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
