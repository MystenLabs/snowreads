As a precursor for effective stakeholder\nengagement in the health domain to understand the most effective way to\nimplement legislation in healthcare, we have analyzed 41 popular mobile apps\nand web portals. We found that 78% of the tested systems have third-party\ndomains receiving sensitive health data with minimal visibility to the\nconsumers. We discuss how this will create potential issues in preparing for\nthe new privacy legislation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
