This study examines\nthe behavior of these firms in Texas, focusing on how their consumption is\ninfluenced by cryptocurrency conversion rates, electricity prices, local\nweather, and other factors. We transform the skewed electricity consumption\ndata of these firms, perform correlation analysis, and apply a seasonal\nautoregressive moving average model for analysis. Our findings reveal that,\nsurprisingly, short-term mining electricity consumption is not correlated with\ncryptocurrency conversion rates. Instead, the primary influencers are the\ntemperature and electricity prices. These firms also respond to avoid\ntransmission and distribution network (T\\&D) charges -- famously known as four\nCoincident peak (4CP) charges -- during summer times. As the scale of these\nfirms is likely to surge in future years, the developed electricity consumption\nmodel can be used to generate public, synthetic datasets to understand the\noverall impact on power grid. The developed model could also lead to better\npricing mechanisms to effectively use the flexibility of these resources\ntowards improving power grid reliability.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
