The Ca and Sc abundances were found to correlate with effective\ntemperature Teff, the abundance growth with increasing Teff being higher in\nstars with surface gravity log g < 4 than in those with log g > 4. No\ncorrelation was found between Ca or Sc abundances and the iron abundance or the\nvelocity of axial rotation. Am stars exhibit on average the higher values of\n[Ca/H] than those of [Sc/H] as well as the abundance ratio [Ca/Sc] = 0.41 +/-\n0.30. However, at Teff > 9500 K there is an allusion to the systematic\ndifference between Am stars with surface gravity log g > 4 and log g < 4. The\niron excess is nearly the same in the range 7200 K <= Teff <= 10030 K.\nEvolution diffusion models computed with the code MESA for stars with masses\nfrom 1.5 to 2Msun show the surface abundances that are in good agreement with\nCa and Fe abundances observed in Am stars of the three open clusters with the\nage > 600 Myr. Additional mechanisms of chemical separation should be\nconsidered for explanation of the Am phenomenon in young stars of the Pleiades\ncluster. We tested the published diffusion stellar evolution models. The\ndiffusion models by Richer et al. (2000) and Hui-Bon-Hoa et al. (2022) are\nshown to agree with observations of Am stars in the open clusters at large\nvalues of the free turbulence parameter: omega=1000 for Ca and Fe, omega=500\nfor Sc. There is no model with the mass and age of the Am-type star Sirius that\ncould reproduce its surface abundances from He to Ni. The results presented in\nthe paper may be of importance for understanding the chemical peculiarity of Am\nstars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
