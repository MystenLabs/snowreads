In this\nregard, from a case of mobile crowdsensing (MCS), we aim at leveraging\nattention mechanisms in machine learning approaches to provide solutions for\nbuilding an effective, timely, and secure MCS. Specifically, we first evaluate\npotential combinations of attention mechanisms and MCS by introducing their\npreliminaries. Then, we present several emerging scenarios about how to\nintegrate attention into MCS, including task allocation, incentive design,\nterminal recruitment, privacy preservation, data collection, and data\ntransmission. Subsequently, we propose an attention-based framework to solve\nnetwork optimization problems with multiple performance indicators in\nlarge-scale MCS. The designed case study have evaluated the effectiveness of\nthe proposed framework. Finally, we outline important research directions for\nadvancing attention-enabled MCS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vGmG54jrFLlN_zH8gg_ntM-21e2dYIhNOp75LOzIZEo","pdfSize":"3688182","objectId":"0xd8deeed4225fd1ff4c9a33319e083cc3135b57da565074129dd1c7605160eef5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
