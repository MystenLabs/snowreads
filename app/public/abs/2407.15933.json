We elucidate the competing vacua and we submit the model to all\ntheoretical and current experimental constraints. We find unexplored regions of\nparameter space and investigate their experimental signatures. In particular,\nwe find regions where the two DM particles contribute equally to the relic DM\ndensity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
