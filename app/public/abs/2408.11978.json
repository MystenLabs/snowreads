A single hopping state estimator has been shown (Kang 2024), in which\ntwo vertical states (position, acceleration) are measured and only velocity is\nestimated using a moving horizon estimation and visual inertial odometry at 200\nHz. This technique requires complex sensors (IMU, lidar, depth camera, contact\nforce sensor), and computationally intensive calculations (12-core, 5 GHz\nprocessor), for a maximum hop height of $\\sim$0.6 m at 3.65 kg. Here we show a\ntrained Kalman filter based hopping vertical state estimator (HVSE), requiring\nonly vertical acceleration measurements. Our results show the HVSE can estimate\nmore states (position, velocity) with a mean-absolute-error in the hop apex\nratio (height error/ground truth) of 12.5\\%, running $\\sim$4.2x faster (840 Hz)\non a substantially less powerful processor (dual-core 240 MHz) with over\n$\\sim$6.7x the hopping height (4.02 m) at 20\\% of the mass (672 g). The\npresented general HVSE, and training procedure are broadly applicable to\njumping, hopping, and legged robots across a wide range of sizes and hopping\nheights.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
