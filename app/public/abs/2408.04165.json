Erd\\H{o}s and Rado conjectured in\n1960 that every family $\\mathcal{H}$ of $\\ell$-element sets of size at least\n$K(r)^\\ell$ contains an $r$-sunflower, where $K(r)$ is some function that\ndepends only on $r$. We prove that if $\\mathcal{H}$ is a family of\n$\\ell$-element sets of VC-dimension at most $d$ and $|\\mathcal{H}| > (C r (\\log\nd+\\log^\\ast \\ell))^\\ell$ for some absolute constant $C > 0$, then $\\mathcal{H}$\ncontains an $r$-sunflower. This improves a recent result of Fox, Pach, and Suk.\nWhen $d=1$, we obtain a sharp bound, namely that $|\\mathcal{H}| > (r-1)^\\ell$\nis sufficient. Along the way, we establish a strengthening of the Kahn-Kalai\nconjecture for set families of bounded VC-dimension, which is of independent\ninterest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
