In this study, we present a novel methodology that\nenhances the robot's interaction with different types of agents and obstacles\nbased on specific safety requirements. This approach uses information about the\nentity types, improving collision avoidance and ensuring safer navigation. We\nintroduce a new reward function that penalizes the robot for collisions with\ndifferent entities such as adults, bicyclists, children, and static obstacles,\nand additionally encourages the robot's proximity to the goal. It also\npenalizes the robot for being close to entities, and the safe distance also\ndepends on the entity type. Additionally, we propose an optimized algorithm for\ntraining and testing, which significantly accelerates train, validation, and\ntest steps and enables training in complex environments. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted using simulation demonstrate that our approach\nconsistently outperforms conventional navigation and collision avoidance\nmethods, including state-of-the-art techniques. To sum up, this work\ncontributes to enhancing the safety and efficiency of navigation systems for\nautonomous robots in dynamic, crowded environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
