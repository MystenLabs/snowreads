This\npioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET),\nwhich enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By\nleveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought,\nand Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts,\nresulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4%\nincrease) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges\nin complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate\nthe transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization\nprocesses without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a\nsignificant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future\ninnovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to\nbring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for\nenhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical\napplications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ovg1WsdeHjy-S8voluuipsQZ-FxBQGcRuu3bfo1HJFg","pdfSize":"504709"}
