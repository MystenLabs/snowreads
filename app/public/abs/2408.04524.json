This study explores the\ndetection of camera interference attacks (CIA) within an automotive\nethernet-driven environment using a novel GRU-based IDS. Leveraging a\nsliding-window data preprocessing technique, our IDS effectively analyzes\npacket length sequences to differentiate between normal and anomalous data\ntransmissions. Experimental evaluations conducted on a commercial car equipped\nwith H.264 encoding and fragmentation unit-A (FU-A) demonstrated high detection\naccuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.9982 and a true positive rate of 0.99 with a\nwindow size of 255.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"m-d6heTGWXGwcIRBkb1-Nj8-IRuSEnksFyFTx41RZ-0","pdfSize":"2939184"}
