In this work, we\npresent a taxonomy of brain-to-language decoding of both textual and speech\nformats. This work integrates two types of research: neuroscience focusing on\nlanguage understanding and deep learning-based brain decoding. Generating\ndiscernible language information from brain activity could not only help those\nwith limited articulation, especially amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\npatients but also open up a new way for the next generation's brain-computer\ninterface (BCI). This article will help brain scientists and deep-learning\nresearchers to gain a bird's eye view of fine-grained language perception, and\nthus facilitate their further investigation and research of neural process and\nlanguage decoding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
