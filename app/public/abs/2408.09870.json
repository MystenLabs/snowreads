We derive a\ndispersion relation for the 4-point correlation function of identical bosons\nand fermions, in terms of the double discontinuity. This extends the conformal\ndispersion relation of arXiv:1910.12123, which holds for CFTs in dimensions\n$d\\geq 2$, to the case of $d=1$. The dispersion relation is obtained by\ncombining the Lorentzian inversion formula with the operator product expansion\nof the 4-point correlator. We perform checks of the dispersion relation using\ncorrelators of generalised free fields and derive an integral relation between\nthe kernel of the dispersion relation and that of the Lorentzian inversion\nformula. Finally, for $1$-$d$ holographic conformal theories, we analytically\ncompute scalar Witten diagrams in $AdS_2$ at tree-level and $1$-loop.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VvLHhtROQGZDzCL2sEFlNvNHmG9mrKUnx1M-Yo0Y8y8","pdfSize":"730375"}
