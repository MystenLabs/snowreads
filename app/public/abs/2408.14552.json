Yet, due to\nconcerns about biased automated decision making or profiling, regulations\nmandate that final decisions are made by humans. Financial fraud investigators\nface the challenge of manually synthesizing vast amounts of unstructured\ninformation, including AI alerts, transaction histories, social media insights,\nand governmental laws. Current Visual Analytics (VA) systems primarily support\nisolated aspects of this process, such as explaining binary AI alerts and\nvisualizing transaction patterns, thus adding yet another layer of information\nto the overall complexity. In this work, we propose a framework where the VA\nsystem supports decision makers throughout all stages of financial fraud\ninvestigation, including data collection, information synthesis, and human\ncriteria iteration. We illustrate how VA can claim a central role in AI-aided\ndecision making, ensuring that human judgment remains in control while\nminimizing potential biases and labor-intensive tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
