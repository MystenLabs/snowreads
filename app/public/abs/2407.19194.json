Using\nAstroSat observations, coherent pulsations at ~17.36633 s (MJD 59239.082) were\ndetected in 0.7-7.0 keV SXT and 3.0-25.0 keV LAXPC data. The pulse profile was\ndual peaked at all energies, with the relative intensity of main peak\nincreasing with energy. The peaks in the SXT profiles were broad and comprised\nof several mini-structures. The LAXPC profiles were relatively smooth and had\nhigher pulsed fraction which increased with energy. The SXT+LAXPC simultaneous\nenergy spectrum is well described by an absorbed power-law with exponential\ncut-off, along with ~1.6 keV black body component and 6.47 keV emission line. A\nmodel comprising of an absorbed power law with high energy cutoff plus a\npartial covering absorber and Gaussian emission line also fits the spectrum\nquite well. These results have been compared with timing and spectral features\nduring the previous outbursts of this transient pulsar.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
