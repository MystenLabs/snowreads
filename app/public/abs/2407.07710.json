In this paper, we determine the differential spectrum of\nthe power function $F(x)=x^{2q+1}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. When the\ncharacteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ is $3$, we also determine the value\ndistribution of the Walsh spectrum of $F$, showing that it is $4$-valued, and\nuse the obtained result to determine the weight distribution of a $4$-weight\ncyclic code.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
