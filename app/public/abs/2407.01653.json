This research investigates the application of\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a deep reinforcement learning algorithm\n(DRL), to enhance dairy farming battery management. We evaluate the algorithm's\neffectiveness based on its ability to reduce reliance on the electricity grid,\nhighlighting the potential of DRL to enhance energy management in dairy\nfarming. Using real-world data our results demonstrate how the PPO approach\noutperforms Q-learning by 1.62% for reducing electricity import from the grid.\nThis significant improvement highlights the potential of the Deep Reinforcement\nLearning algorithm for improving energy efficiency and sustainability in dairy\nfarms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
