Here we discuss\ntheir non-equilibrium dynamics in the Rule 54 cellular automaton, a simple, yet\ninteracting, integrable model. Both quantities can be expressed in terms of the\nmore analytically tractable \"charged moments\", i.e. traces of powers of a\nsuitably deformed density matrix, via a replica trick. We express them in terms\nof a tensor network, which we contract in space using a system of local\nalgebraic relations. This gives the asymptotic form for the charged moments,\nvalid in the regime of large but finite time that is shorter than all the\nrelevant subsystem sizes. In this regime the charge moments decay exponentially\nwith the rate given by the leading solution to a cubic equation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
