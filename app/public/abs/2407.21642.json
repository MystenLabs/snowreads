In Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n(PINN) several proposals attempted to adapt the time sampling or time weighting\nto take into account the specifics of this special dimension. But these\nproposals are not principled and need guidance to be used. We explain here\ntheoretically why the Lyapunov exponents give actionable insights and propose a\nweighting scheme to automatically adapt to chaotic, periodic or stable\ndynamics. We characterize theoretically the best weighting scheme under\ncomputational constraints as a cumulative exponential integral of the local\nLyapunov exponent estimators and show that it performs well in practice under\nthe regimes mentioned above.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Qcoy-LvAwyHoQ1V4MnSbWdfJjkW0r4qdM3BzVT3wafs","pdfSize":"1046316","objectId":"0xd4bc18b75a9b90d3eca15c317c9635664c4620f433fc7e4a3c5705f7eae0b64e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
