We introduce goal-conditioned autoregressive models to generate crowd\nbehaviors, capturing intricate interactions among individuals. The model\nprocesses potential robot trajectory samples and predicts the reactions of\nsurrounding individuals, enabling proactive robotic navigation in complex\nscenarios. Extensive experiments show that this algorithm enables real-time\nnavigation, significantly reducing collision rates and path lengths, and\noutperforming selected baseline methods. The practical effectiveness of this\nalgorithm is validated on an actual robotic platform, demonstrating its\ncapability in dynamic settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
