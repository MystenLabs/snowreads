The band inversion results\nfrom symmetry breaking in the transverse direction, achievable through\ndeposition on specific substrates such as separated silicon carbide or\nhexagonal boron nitride sheets. Upon band inversion, ZGNRs exhibit electronic\nstructures characterized by valley degeneracy and band gap properties, which\ncan be modulated by transverse electric fields. To explore the impact of this\nlevel degeneracy on thermoelectric properties, we employ Green's function\ntechniques to calculate thermoelectric quantities in ZGNR segments with\nstaggered sublattice potentials and transverse electric fields. Two carrier\ntransport scenarios are considered: the chemical potential is positioned above\nand below the highest occupied molecular orbital. We analyze\nthermionic-assisted transport (TAT) and direct ballistic transport (DBT). Level\ndegeneracy enhances the electric power factors of ZGNRs by increasing\nelectrical conductance, while the Seebeck coefficient remains robust in the TAT\nscenario. Conversely, in DBT, the enhancement of the power factor primarily\nstems from improvements in the Seebeck coefficient at elevated temperatures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0vBVOZjt9Hvqv3e8cZLqpMJaAJwcLuWh35fZ6xO_Sk0","pdfSize":"1849107"}
