In particular, we (i) construct the associated\nmathematical formulation, (ii) prove its decisive lead for determining whether\nthe observed power-law is associated with kappa distributions; and (iii)\nprovide a validation of the technique using pseudo-observations of typical\ninput plasma parameters. Then, we apply this technique to a case-study by\ndetermining the thermodynamics of solar energetic particle (SEP) protons, for a\nSEP event observed on April 17, 2021, by the PSP/ISOIS instrument suite onboard\nPSP. The results show SEP temperatures and densities of the order of $\\sim 1$\nMeV and $ \\sim 5 \\cdot 10^{-7} $ cm$^{-3}$, respectively.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
