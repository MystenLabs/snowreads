In a monochromatic mass scenario with a\nsizable dimensionless spin, which may arise in a short matter dominated (MD)\nera, we analyze the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB)\nsignal. Its spectrum is approximately characterized by a rising $\\propto f^3$\nfollowed by a falling $\\propto f^{-1}$ where $f$ is the frequency. Then, we\ninvestigate the constraints and prospects of such a SGWB, and find that PGAs\nwith a core mass $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim {\\cal O}(10)~M_{\\odot}$ and a cloud of light\nscalar with mass $\\mu \\sim {\\cal O} (10^{-13})$ eV could yield constraints even\nstronger than those from bare PBHs. Future detectors such as LISA, Taiji and\nTianQin are able to explore PGAs over a narrow and elongated strap in the\n$(\\mu,M_{\\rm BH})$ plane, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude for the maximum\nspin, $10^{-8}~M_{\\odot}\\lesssim M_{\\rm BH}\\lesssim 10^4~M_{\\odot}$,\n$10^{-16}~{\\rm eV}\\lesssim \\mu\\lesssim 10^{-3}~\\rm eV$. If the PGA is dressed\nwith a vector cloud, the SGWB signal has a much better opportunity to be\nprobed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
