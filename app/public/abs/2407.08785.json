As an application, we address the\nboundary behavior of the kinetic Fokker-Planck equations in the half-space. Our\nmain result is the sharp regularity of the solution at the absorbing boundary\nand grazing set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
