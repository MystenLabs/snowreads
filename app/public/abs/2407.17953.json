However, old metal-poor stars within the\nGalaxy contain more $^{13}$C than is predicted, suggesting that further\nrefinements to the models are necessary. Gas at high redshift provides\nimportant supplementary information at metallicities $-2\\lesssim$ [Fe/H]\n$\\lesssim-1$, for which there are only a few measurements in the Galaxy. We\nobtained new, high-quality, VLT/ESPRESSO observations of the QSO B1331+170 and\nused them to measure $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in the damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ system\n(DLA) at $z_{abs}=1.776$, with [Fe/H]=-1.27. AI-VPFIT, an Artificial\nIntelligence tool based on genetic algorithms and guided by a spectroscopic\ninformation criterion, was used to explore different possible kinematic\nstructures of the carbon gas. Three hundred independent AI-VPFIT models of the\nabsorption system were produced using pre-set $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values, ranging\nfrom 4 to 500. Our results show that $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$=28.5^{+51.5}_{-10.4}$,\nsuggesting a possibility of $^{13}$C production at low metallicity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
