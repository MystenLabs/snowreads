In this paper, DFT calculations have been\ncarried out to study tetrahedrite doped with Li into structural voids,\nLixCu12Sb4S13 (0 <= x <= 3). Enthalpies of formation shows that introduction of\nLi into both 6b and 24g sites is energetically favorable. Dopants in those\npositions differently affect rattling Cu(12e) behaviour, as well as vary in\nmagnitude of induced local disorder. Topological analysis of charge density\nclassifies tetrahedrite as closed-shell, ionic system of interactions with some\ndegree of covalency. Addition of Li increases bond strain and decreases\nstructure stability. Electronic band structure shows that for x>2.0, material\nbecomes n-type, however results are not precisely conclusive on whether\nstructure will be synthesizable, which should be determined experimentally.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"3axIg_ygS8Z1sf87wCrNBjQpBaB4VRwwWTTsr6Xkql0","pdfSize":"39020364","txDigest":"G53GxDBx89bK8pq4PUmfU44EkXcfEUXirff1oJnGm14d","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
