Semiparametric models were adjusted\nfor the number of deaths from the two localizations of greatest mortality by\nsex: breast and cervix in women; prostate and lungs in men. Adjustments in\ndifferent semiparametric models were compared; which included making\nadjustments with different distributions and variable combinations in the\nparametric and non-parametric part, for localization as well as for scale.\nFinally, the semiparametric model with best adjustment was selected and\ncompared to traditional model; that is, to the generalized lineal model with\nPoisson response and logarithmic link. Best results for the four kinds of\ncancer were obtained for the selected semiparametric model by comparing it to\nthe traditional Poisson model based upon AIC, envelope correlation between\nestimated logarithm rate and real rate logarithm. In general, we observe that\nin estimation, rate increases with age; however, with respect to period, breast\ncancer and stomach cancer in men show a tendency to rise over time; on the\nother hand, for cervical cancer, it remains virtually constant, but for lung\ncancer in men, as of 2007, it tends to decrease.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
