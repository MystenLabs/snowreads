In presence of a magnetic field,\nthe speed of sound and isothermal compressibility become anisotropic with\nrespect to the direction of the background magnetic field, splitting into\nparallel and perpendicular directions with respect to the magnetic field.\nThough the qualitative nature of parallel and perpendicular components of\nsquared speed of sound appear similar, they differ in magnitude at lower values\nof temperature. The parallel and perpendicular components of isothermal\ncompressibility decrease with increasing temperature, indicating a trend\ntowards increased incompressible strongly interacting matter. On inclusion of\nthe AMM of quarks, the perpendicular component of isothermal compressibility\nbecomes greater than the parallel component. Additionally, we investigate the\nquark number susceptibility normalized by its value at zero magnetic field,\nwhich may indicate the presence of magnetic fields in the system.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
