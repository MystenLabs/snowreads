Within a constituent\nquark potential model, we employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the\nfour-body Schr\\\"odinger equation and the complex scaling method to identify\nresonant states. We obtain a series of resonant states and zero-width states in\nthe mass range of 2.7 to 3.3 GeV, with their widths ranging from less than 1\nMeV to about 50 MeV. Their rms radii strongly indicate that they are compact\ntetraquark states. Among these states, the $T_{4s,2^{++}}(2714)$ may be the\nmost likely one to be observed experimentally. We urge the experimental\nexploration of the $2^{++}$ $s s \\bar{s} \\bar{s}$ state around 2.7 GeV in the\n$\\phi\\phi$ channel. Since the lowest S-wave $s s \\bar{s} \\bar{s}$ state is\naround 2.7 GeV, the compact P-wave $s s \\bar{s} \\bar{s}$ states are expected to\nbe heavier. Hence, $\\phi(2170)$ and $X(2370)$ are unlikely to be compact\ntetraquark states.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
