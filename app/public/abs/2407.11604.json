In this work, we consider a wireless communication\nsystem with secret-key generation, in which the secret-key bits are added to\nand used from a pool of available key bits. We propose novel physical layer\nresilience metrics for the survivability of such systems. In addition, we\npropose multiple power allocation schemes and analyze their trade-off between\nresilience and power consumption. In particular, we investigate and compare\nconstant power allocation, an adaptive analytical algorithm, and a\nreinforcement learning-based solution. It is shown how the transmit power can\nbe minimized such that a specified resilience is guaranteed. These results can\nbe used directly by designers of such systems to optimize the system parameters\nfor the desired performance in terms of reliability, security, and resilience.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
