Besov-Lorentz spaces have multiple indices\nwhich can reflect complex changes of the set of the large value points. Hence\nwe consider some properties of Gauss flow, paraproduct flow and couple flow\nrelated to the Besov-Lorentz spaces. When dealing with Lorentz index, we use\nwavelets and maximum norm to describe the decay situation in the binary time\nring and to define time-frequency microlocal maximum norm space. We use maximum\noperator, $\\alpha$-triangle inequality and H\\\"older inequality etc to get\naccurate estimates. As an application, we get a global wellposedness result of\nthe Navier-Stokes equations where the solution can reflect how the size of the\nset of large value points changes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
