We show that the only first-order Goedel logics\nthat admit such prenex forms are those with finite truth value sets since they\nallow all quantifier-shift rules and the logic $G_\\uparrow$ with only one\naccumulation point at 1 in the infinite truth value set. In all the other\ncases, there are generally no logically equivalent prenex normal forms. We will\nalso see that $G_\\uparrow$ is the intersection of all finite first-order Goedel\nlogics.\n  The second part of this paper investigates the existence of effective\nequivalence between the validity of a formula and the validity of some prenex\nnormal form. The existence of such a normal form is obvious for finite valued\nGoedel logic and $G_\\uparrow$. Goedel logics with an uncountable truth value\nset admit the prenex normal forms if and only if every surrounding of 0 is\nuncountable or 0 is an isolated point. Otherwise, uncountable Goedel logics are\nnot recursively enumerable, however, the prenex fragment is always recursively\nenumerable. Therefore, there is no effective translation between the valid\nformula and the valid prenex normal form. However, the existence of effectively\nconstructible validity equivalent prenex forms for the countable case is still\nup for debate.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
