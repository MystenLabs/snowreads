In particular, the Averaged Feedback Learning Scheme (AFLS)\nand a data driven method are considered. Hypotheses for each method ensuring\nthe convergence of the evaluation of the objective function of the underlying\ncontrol problem at the obtained feedback-laws towards the optimal value\nfunction are provided. These hypotheses are connected to the regularity of the\nvalue function and the stability of the dynamics. In the case of AFLS these\nhypotheses only require H\\\"older continuity of the value function, whereas for\nthe data driven method the value function must be at least $C^2$. It is\ndemonstrated that these methods are connected via their optimality conditions.\nAdditionally, numerical experiments are provided by applying both methods to a\nfamily control problems, parameterized by a positive real number which controls\nthe regularity of the value function. For small parameters the value function\nis smooth and in contrast for large parameters it is non-differentiable, but\nsemi-concave. The results of the experiments indicate that both methods have a\nsimilar performance for the case that the value function is smooth. On the\nother hand, if the value function is not differentiable, AFLS has a better\nperformance which is consistent with the obtained convergence results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cidUDY-gA9-_WPkbUluQHoSYLYyecJ1PKVpIfZnKR7w","pdfSize":"1207904"}
