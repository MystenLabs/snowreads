Inspired by the recently proposed\nKAN architecture, this paper proposes physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetworks (PIKANs), a novel KAN-based physics-informed neural network (PINN)\ntailored to efficiently and accurately learn dynamics within power systems. The\nPIKANs present a promising alternative to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons\n(MLPs) based PINNs, achieving superior accuracy in predicting power system\ndynamics while employing a smaller network size. Simulation results on a\nsingle-machine infinite bus system and a 4-bus 2- generator system underscore\nthe accuracy of the PIKANs in predicting rotor angle and frequency with fewer\nlearnable parameters than conventional PINNs. Furthermore, the simulation\nresults demonstrate PIKANs capability to accurately identify uncertain inertia\nand damping coefficients. This work opens up a range of opportunities for the\napplication of KANs in power systems, enabling efficient determination of grid\ndynamics and precise parameter identification.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
