It is based on the modal decomposition of the current density and\nit is applicable even in presence of injected currents into the electrodes of a\nconducting domain. Using a theta-method integration algorithm, the performances\nof the the proposed approach are compared against those of a classical method\nbased on the Cholesky factorization, for a case of interest from eddy current\nnondestructive testing. For this large eddy current problem (number of unknowns\ngreater than 100k, number of time steps of interest equal to 100k) the proposed\nsolution method is shown to be much faster than those based on standard time\nintegration schemes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
