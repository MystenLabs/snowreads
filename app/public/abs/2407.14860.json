HANDY models the interactions between human population,\ndepletion, and consumption of natural resources. HANDY explains how endogenous\nhuman--nature interactions could lead to sustainability or collapse in past\nsocieties. We introduce a Gaussian random noise perturbation on the population\nchange to represent generic external perturbations. The robustness of the\nresults is investigated with statistical analysis based on probability\ndistributions of specific events. Our study shows that the results of the\nunperturbed HANDY model are robust under small perturbations of $\\lesssim$ 10\\%\nof the Human population. Our results confirm that endogenous dynamics drive the\nsocietal cycles. However, exogenous perturbations, such as floods, droughts,\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, infectious disease, epidemics, and wars, can\naccelerate or delay a collapse cycle.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xJH7v-cTmWAdm5_ub0Egdvsh2qTBaui12X2FmIX8bGY","pdfSize":"11955750"}
