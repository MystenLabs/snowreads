The uniqueness results assert that two solutions\nhave the same Cauchy data at $x=0$ over $(0,T)$ and the same initial value or\nthe final value which is positive on $[0,\\ell]$, then the zeroth-order\ncoefficient is uniquely determined on $[0,\\ell]$. The uniqueness for inverse\ncoefficient problem for a system of evolution equations without boundary\nconditions over the whole boundary is an open problem even in the one-dimension\nin the case where only initial value is given as spatial data. Moreover, in the\ncase of the zero initial condition, we prove the uniqueness in the half of the\nspatial interval.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LGCbIdgsefBW4p395TGx7UP5tR4PoIhOg4ZCWkkhD4Y","pdfSize":"222887"}
