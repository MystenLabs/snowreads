This paper\nexplores the use of LiDAR in channel estimation for wideband multi-user\nmultiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\nsystems and introduces a LiDAR-enhanced Channel State Information (CSI)\nlearning network (LE-CLN). By utilizing user positioning information, LE-CLN\nfirst calculates user-localized over-complete angular measurements. It then\ninvestigates the correlation between LiDAR and CSI, transforming raw LiDAR data\ninto a low-complexity format embedded with signal propagation characteristics.\nLE-CLN also adapts the use of LiDAR based on channel conditions through\nattention mechanisms. Thanks to the unique wireless features offered by LiDAR,\nLE-CLN achieves higher estimation accuracy and spectrum efficiency compared to\nbenchmarks, particularly in latency-sensitive applications where pilot\ntransmissions are expected to be reduced.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
