We are motivated by Tao's result that there exists such a square in\nthe case of Lipschitz constant less than $1$. In the case of Lipschitz constant\n$1$, we show that the Jordan curve inscribes rectangles of every similarity\nclass. Our approach involves analysing the change in the spectral invariants of\nthe Jordan Floer homology under perturbations of the Jordan curve.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
