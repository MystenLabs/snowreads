To address the issues of automation and efficiency in rail fault\ndetection, this study introduces a railway inspection system based on Field\nProgrammable Gate Array (FPGA). This edge AI system collects track images via\ncameras and uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to perform real-time\ndetection of track defects and automatically reports fault information. The\ninnovation of this system lies in its high level of automation and detection\nefficiency. The neural network approach employed by this system achieves a\ndetection accuracy of 88.9%, significantly enhancing the reliability and\nefficiency of detection. Experimental results demonstrate that this FPGA-based\nsystem is 1.39* and 4.67* better in energy efficiency than peer implementation\non the GPU and CPU platform, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
