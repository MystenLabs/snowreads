It is known that a deterministic approximation\nalgorithm for this problems must have at least $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ runtime. We\npropose such an algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching\nproblem with runtime $O(n\\log n)$ and show that it has approximation ratio\n$O(n^{0.2995})$. This improves the so far best known approximation ratio of\n$n/2$. We also develop an $O(n \\log n)$ algorithm for the Euclidean minimum\nweight perfect matching problem in higher dimensions and show it has\napproximation ratio $O(n^{0.599})$ in all fixed dimensions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
