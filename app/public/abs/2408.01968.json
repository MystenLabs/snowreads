A\n$5$$\\times$$5$$\\times$$5$~mm$^3$ glass vapor cell is used for the experiments.\nThe wave intensity is modulated at the frequency $\\Omega_m$. By scanning\n$\\Omega_m$ near the Larmor frequency $\\Omega_L$, a magnetic resonance (MR) can\nbe observed as a change in the ellipticity parameter of the wave polarization.\nThis method for observing MR allows to significantly improve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio compared to a classical Bell-Bloom scheme using a\ncircularly polarized wave. The sensitivity of the magnetic field sensor is\nestimated to be $\\approx\\,$$130$~fT/$\\surd$Hz in a $2$~kHz bandwidth,\nconfidently competing with widely used Faraday-rotation Bell-Bloom schemes. The\nresults can be used to develop a miniature all-optical magnetic field sensor\nfor medicine and geophysics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HGEeXxMJ_Z3SatSr_lR3esBCPNpizUSBkc8RFCmq0Ps","pdfSize":"510435","txDigest":"6mGKuAoQJqkeFrb2vSuDcK7m9BiHG5F8attFsyLXHYpJ","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
