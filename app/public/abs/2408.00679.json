In this\ncontext, we explore the utilization of current 5G new radio (NR) signals\naligned with 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards. Positioning\nreference signals (PRS) for sensing and physical downlink shared channel\n(PDSCH) for communication have been chosen to form an ISAC framework. However,\nPRS-based sensing suffers from Doppler ambiguity when the Doppler frequency\nshift is severe. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method within\nthe ISAC system that leverages the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) present\nin PDSCH to eliminate Doppler ambiguity. Furthermore, we formulate a resource\nallocation problem between PRS and PDSCH to achieve a Pareto optimal point\nbetween communication and sensing without Doppler ambiguity. Through\nsimulations and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod on joint DMRS-PRS exploitation in mitigating Doppler ambiguity and the\nefficiency of the resource allocation scheme in achieving Pareto optimality for\nISAC within a 5G NR framework.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
