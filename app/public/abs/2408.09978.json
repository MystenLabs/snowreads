However, the action of Clifford group\nelements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without\nresorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow\nan extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that\ncan be studied in this way.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
