Its potential in guiding and filtering\nclassical waves in the Ultra High Frequency regime, on the other hand, has not\nbeen explored. Here, we report the realization of acoustic Klein tunneling in a\nnanoelectromechanical metamaterial system operating at gigahertz frequencies.\nThe piezoelectric potential profiles are obtained by transmission-mode\nmicrowave impedance microscopy, from which reciprocal-space maps can be\nextracted. The transmission rate of normally incident elastic waves is near\nunity in the Klein tunneling regime and drops significantly outside this\nfrequency range, consistent with microwave network analysis. Strong angular\ndependent transmission is also observed by controlling the launching angle of\nthe emitter interdigital transducer. This work broadens the horizon in\nexploiting high-energy-physics phenomena for practical circuit applications in\nboth classical and quantum regimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s1HIomo68t9B00fwJULGs0piCer68WvCfVLoOUfCxWY","pdfSize":"2772897"}
