Various\narchitectures based on generative adversarial networks have been proposed in\nthe recent past. Especially, recent study shows that MaskCycleGAN, which is a\nmask guided, and cyclic consistency keeping, generative adversarial network,\nperforms really well for voice conversion from spectrogram representations. In\nthe current work we present a MaskCycleGAN approach for the conversion of\nwhispered speech to normal speech. We find that tuning the mask parameters, and\npre-processing the signal with a voice activity detector provides superior\nperformance when compared to the existing approach. The wTIMIT dataset is used\nfor evaluation. Objective metrics such as PESQ and G-Loss are used to evaluate\nthe converted speech, along with subjective evaluation using mean opinion\nscore. The results show that the proposed approach offers considerable\nbenefits.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d05-gYpYFe3CrWwCMz5u2_ouxSamffkMwyYswPSZY1U","pdfSize":"899790"}
