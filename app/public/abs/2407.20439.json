Using a robotic interface in a\nsimulated driving environment, we examined the impact of varying levels of such\nhaptic feedback on the driver's ability to follow the road while avoiding\nobstacles. The results of an experiment with 15 subjects indicate that haptic\nfeedback from the front car's motion can significantly improve driving control\n(i.e., reduce motion jerk and deviation from the road) and reduce mental load\n(evaluated via questionnaire). This suggests that haptic communication, as\nobserved between physically interacting humans, can be leveraged to improve\nsafety and efficiency in automated driving systems, warranting further testing\nin real driving scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
