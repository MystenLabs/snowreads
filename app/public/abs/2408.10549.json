This article examines the application of\nartificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance the efficiency of IVR\nsystems in call centers. A proposed approach is based on the integration of\nspeech-to-text conversion solutions, text query classification using large\nlanguage models (LLM), and speech synthesis. Special attention is given to\nadapting these technologies to work with the Kazakh language, including\nfine-tuning models on specialized datasets. The practical aspects of\nimplementing the developed system in a real call center for query\nclassification are described. The research results demonstrate that the\napplication of AI technologies in call center IVR systems reduces operator\nworkload, improves customer service quality, and increases the efficiency of\nquery processing. The proposed approach can be adapted for use in call centers\noperating with various languages.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pVZbntX_a3E3Pc2WoWFLFwUtTzxTdflD3Kf8yQgFP44","pdfSize":"547561"}
