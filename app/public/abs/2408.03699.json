We show how to solve the problem in\n$1.731^k\\operatorname{poly}(n)$ time, improving over the\n$2^k\\operatorname{poly}(n)$ time algorithm by [Fomin et al., TALG 2024], but\nnot the more recent $1.657^k\\operatorname{poly}(n)$ time algorithm by [Eiben,\nKoana, and Wahlstr\\\"om, SODA 2024]. When the graph is bipartite, we can solve\nthe problem in $2^{k/2}\\operatorname{poly}(n)$ time, matching the fastest known\nalgorithm for finding a cycle of length exactly $k$ in an undirected bipartite\ngraph [Bj\\\"orklund et al., JCSS 2017].\n  Our results follow the approach taken by [Fomin et al., TALG 2024], which\ndescribes an efficient algorithm for finding cycles using many colours in a\nvertex-coloured undirected graph. Our contribution is twofold. First, we\ndescribe a new algorithm and analysis for the central colourful cycle problem,\nwith the aim of providing a comparatively short and self-contained proof of\ncorrectness. Second, we give tighter reductions from $k,e$-Long Cycle to the\ncolourful cycle problem, which lead to our improved running times.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
