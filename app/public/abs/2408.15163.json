They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly,\ntriggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and\nnumerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its wave-kinetic equations.\nWe derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves\nand find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long acoustic\nregime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state\nreported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new\nexperimental settings.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
