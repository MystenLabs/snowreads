These two cycles are homologically trivial but\nare of infinite order in their corresponding Chow groups for a very general\ncurve over $\\mathbb{C}$. From the work of S-W Zhang, for a fixed curve these\ntwo cycles are non-torsion in their corresponding Chow groups if and only if\none of them is. In this paper, we prove that the Ceresa and Gross-Kudla-Schoen\ncycles associated to a modular curve $X$ are non-torsion in the corresponding\nChow groups when $X=\\Gamma \\backslash \\overline{\\mathbb{H}}$ for certain\ncongruence subgroups $\\Gamma\\subset {\\rm SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. We obtain the\nresult by studying a pullback formula for special divisors by the diagonal map\n$X \\hookrightarrow X \\times X$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
