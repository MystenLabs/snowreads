The machine learning approach uses time series clustering together\nwith an optimised actuation sequence generated by reinforcement learning to\nfacilitate distinguishing among different inertial parameter sets. The\nperformance of the proposed strategy is assessed against the case of a\nmulti-satellite deployment system showing that the algorithm is resilient\ntowards common disturbances in such kinds of operations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
