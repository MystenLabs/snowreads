In this paper, taking advantage of recent advances in generative\nArtificial Intelligence, we introduce the Network ConFiguration Generator\n(LLM-NetCFG) that employs Large Language Model and architects ZSM configuration\nagents by Large Language Models. LLM-NetCFG can automatically generate\nconfigurations, verify them, and configure network devices based on intents\nexpressed in natural language. We also show the automation and verification of\nnetwork configurations with minimum human intervention. Moreover, we explore\nthe opportunities and challenges of integrating LLM in functional areas of\nnetwork management to fully achieve ZSM.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
