The\nPTO is a simple and efficient approach assuming continuous polynomial phase\ndistribution and requiring optimization of only few parameters. The TPT is\nvalid mainly for radar applications, taking advantage of the fact that radars\ntypically transmit pulse trains for coherent integration. By varying the array\nelements' phases from pulse to pulse, the TPT achieves effective amplitude\ntapering, thus providing a method of beam shaping, occasionally with a simple\nanalytic form. The TPT also makes it possible to produce beam shaping with very\nlow side lobe levels in comparison to the PTO. As a preliminary step, the\ndimensionality of the radiation pattern characterization for all scan\ndirections is reduced from five to only two variables. This is crucial for\nefficient optimization of the radiation pattern which needs to be evaluated\nover a judiciously specified two-dimensional domain.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
