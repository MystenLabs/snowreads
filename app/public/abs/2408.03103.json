In this paper, a membrane actuator powered by internal combustion\nof hydrogen and oxygen in a chamber with a volume of 3.1 nanoliters is\ndemonstrated. The combustion in such a small volume is possible only for an\nextremely high surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio on the order of 10^7 1/m. The fuel\nwith this S/V is prepared electrochemically in a special regime that produces\nonly nanobubbles. A cloud of nanobubbles merges, forming a microbubble, which\nexplodes, increasing the volume 500 times in 10us. The actuator generates an\ninstantaneous force up to 0.5N and is able to move a body 11,000 times more\nmassive than itself. The natural response time of about 10ms is defined by the\nincubation time needed to produce an exploding bubble. The device demonstrates\nreliable cyclic actuation at a frequency of 1Hz restricted by the effect of\nelectrolyte aging. After 40,000 explosions, no significant wear in the chamber\nis observed. Due to record-breaking acceleration and standard microfabrication\ntechniques, the actuator can be used as a universal engine for various\nmicrodevices including micro-electro-mechanical systems, microfluidics,\nmicrorobotics, wearable and implantable devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
