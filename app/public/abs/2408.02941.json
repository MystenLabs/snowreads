The magnetometer's intrinsic offset was measured to be within 3 nT and\nstable over a period of one year. The response was shown to be within 2 percent\nof linearity in the zero-field regime, up to 2 nTpp, and then follows a smooth\ndispersion curve. Crosstalk effects induced by multisensor operation were\ndetermined to have a small effect, and inconsequential with a separation above\n6 cm. These results enable the QZFM for accurate measurement of DC fields,\nincrease the operational range of QZFM by a factor of more than an order of\nmagnitude, and allow for higher efficiency and flexibility by green-lighting\nsimultaneous operation of multiple QZFMs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zr5eCkjkxr6v3tYtisV6hioPmPNoJEP7i3GCrdVYzRI","pdfSize":"602520"}
