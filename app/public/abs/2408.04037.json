The first is called the quantum component and is given by the\nprobability distribution of an observable relative to the state. The second is\nthe classical component which is an uncertainty function that is applied to the\nfirst component. We characterize uncertainty functions in terms of four axioms.\nWe then study four examples called variance, entropy, geometric and sine\nuncertainty functions. The final section presents the general theory of state\nuncertainty.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
