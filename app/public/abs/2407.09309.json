The launch of Surface Water\nand Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite provides a prime opportunity to diagnose\nthe surface balanced and unbalanced motions on a global scale at an\nunprecedented spatial resolution. Here, we apply dynamic-mode decomposition\n(DMD), a linear-algebraic data-driven method, to a tidally-forced numerical\nsimulation and one-day-repeat SWOT observations of sea-surface height (SSH) in\nthe Gulf Stream extension. DMD is able to separate out the spatial modes\nassociated with sub-inertial periods from super-inertial periods. The\nsub-inertial modes of DMD can be used to extract geostrophically balanced\nmotions from SSH fields, which have an imprint of internal tides.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"qrqPedhcpHr9F8gekEM_4hGs1Ygml0kVXVRWIgOoVLo","pdfSize":"2011187"}
