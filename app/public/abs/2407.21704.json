When combined with known lower Dirac eigenvalue estimates, this has\na number of geometric consequences. Some are known and include Llarull's scalar\ncurvature rigidity of the standard metric on the sphere, Geroch's conjecture on\nthe impossibility of positive scalar curvature on tori and a mean curvature\nestimate for spin fill-ins with nonnegative scalar curvature due to Gromov,\nincluding its rigidity statement recently proved by Cecchini, Hirsch and\nZeidler. New applications provide a comparison of the hyperspherical radius\nwith the Yamabe constant and improved estimates of the hyperspherical radius\nfor K\\\"ahler manifolds, K\\\"ahler-Einstein manifolds, quaternionic K\\\"ahler\nmanifolds and manifolds with a harmonic 1-form of constant length.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
