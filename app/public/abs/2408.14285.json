Here, we use\ndensity-functional-theory calculations to predict the geometric and electronic\nstructures, as well as the topological and magnetic properties, of a series of\nMoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers formed by mirror-twin-boundary (MTB) loops. We\nanalyze ten MTB-loop configurations of varying sizes and arrangements to assess\ntheir impact on various properties. Within the intrinsic bandgap of MoTe$_{2}$,\nwe identify two sets of kagome bands, primarily originating from in-plane and\nout-of-plane Mo d-orbitals at MTB-loop edges and -vertices, respectively. Three\nconfigurations exhibit superior stability, while three others show comparable\nstability. Among these, four display bandgaps and potentially non-zero Z$_{2}$\ntopological invariants, suggesting possible topological phases, while the\nremaining two are metallic and feature Stoner magnetization. These findings\nguide the design of kagome-based two-dimensional materials with tunable\nelectronic, topological, and magnetic properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
