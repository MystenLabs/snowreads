This identification problem arises from\ntwo application backgrounds: actuator placement in PDE-constrained optimal\ncontrols and the regularized least-squares formulation of source\nidentifications. The optimization problem seeks both the source strength and\nits support. By eliminating the variable associated with the source strength,\nwe reduce the problem to a shape optimization problem for a coupled elliptic\nsystem, known as the first-order optimality system. As a model problem, we\nderive the shape derivative for the regularized least-squares formulation of\nthe inverse source problem and propose a gradient descent shape optimization\nalgorithm, implemented using the level-set method. Several numerical\nexperiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed\nalgorithms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
