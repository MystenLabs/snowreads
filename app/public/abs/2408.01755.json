Over the last two\ndecades it has been realized that, under some additional assumptions, similar\nclaims hold for more general series ratios as well as for unimodality in place\nof monotonicity. This paper continues this line of research: we consider ratios\nof general functional series and integral transforms and furnish natural\nsufficient conditions for preservation of unimodality by such ratios. Numerous\nseries and integral transforms appearing in applications satisfy our sufficient\nconditions, including Dirichlet, factorial and inverse factorial series,\nLaplace, Mellin and generalized Stieltjes transforms, among many others.\nFinally, we illustrate our general results by exhibiting certain statements on\nmonotonicity patterns for ratios of some special functions. The key role in our\nconsiderations is played by the notion of sign regularity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
