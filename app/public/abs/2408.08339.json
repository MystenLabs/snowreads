A local general relativity to\n  solve the \"zero active mass\" problem","authors":"Robert Monjo","authorsParsed":[["Monjo","Robert",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 11:41:54 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-19","timestamp":1723722114000,"abstract":"  Modern cosmology presents important challenges such as the \\textit{Hubble\ntension}, \\textit{El Gordo's collision} or the \\textit{impossible galaxies} ($z\n> 10$). Slight modifications to the standard model propose new parameters (e.g.\nthe early and dynamical dark energy). On the other hand, alternatives such as\nthe coasting universes (e.g. the \\textit{hyperconical model} and the spatially\nflat $R_h = ct$ universe) are statistically compatible with most of\nobservational tests, but still present theoretical problems in matching the\nobserved matter contents since they predict a ``zero active gravitational\nmass.'' To solve these open issues, we suggest that general relativity might be\nnot valid at cosmic scales, but it would be valid at local scales. This\nproposal is addressed from two main features of the embedding hyperconical\nmodel: 1) the background metric would be independent of the matter content, and\n2) the observed cosmic acceleration would be fictitious and because of a\ndistorted stereographic projection of coordinates that produce an apparent\nradial inhomogeneity from homogeneous manifolds. Finally, to support the\ndiscussion, standard observational tests were updated here, showing that the\nhyperconical model is adequately fitted to Type Ia Supernovae, quasars, galaxy\nclusters, BAO, and cosmic chronometer data sets.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
