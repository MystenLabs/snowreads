In the second part we are solving\nequation of the form $Lu=f,\\; L=\\sum_{j=1}^ka_jA_j^{h_j}+cE^{d}_y+bP(x,D_x),$\nwhere $f$ belongs to the tensor product of ultradistribution spaces over\ncompact manifolds without boundaries as well as ultradistribution spaces on\n$\\mathbb R^n_+$ and $\\mathbb R^m$; $A_j, j=1,...,k$, $E_y$ and $P(x,D_x)$ are\noperators whose eigenfunctions form orthonormal basis of corresponding\n$L^2-$space. The sequence space representation of solutions enable us to study\nthe solvability and the hypoellipticity in the specified spaces of\nultradistributions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
