We focus on\nparticles starting off on Sun-crossing orbits, corresponding to initial\nconditions of production inside the Sun, and investigate their evolution over\nthe age of the Solar System. A combination of analytic methods, secular\nperturbation theory, and direct numerical integration of orbits sheds light on\nthe long- and short-term evolution of a population of test particles orbiting\nthe Sun and perturbed by the planets. Our main results are that the effective\nlifetime of a solar basin at Earth's location is $\\tau_{\\rm eff} = 1.20\\pm 0.09\n\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}$, and that there is annual (semi-annual) modulation of the basin\ndensity with known phase and amplitude at the fractional level of 6.5% (2.2%).\nThese results have important implications for direct detection searches of\nsolar basin particles, and the strong temporal modulation signature yields a\nrobust discovery channel. Our simulations can also be interpreted in the\ncontext of gravitational capture of dark matter in the Solar System, with\nconsequences for any dark-matter phenomenon that may occur below the local\nescape velocity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qRkQCWgu8ClSSC714Vf2UQ63I7J_Uu_I4fhTMZP1fFM","pdfSize":"7161901"}
