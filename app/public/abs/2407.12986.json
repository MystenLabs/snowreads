It\nis shown that the leading exponent is given by a Puiseux polynomial which is a\nlinear combination of power functions in the central charge with fractional\npowers decreasing from $\\alpha$ to $0$ according to some pattern. Our analysis\nis limited by considering the first six explicit coefficients of the Virasoro\nblock function in the coordinate. For simplicity, external primary operators\nare chosen to be of equal conformal dimensions that, therefore, includes the\ncase of the vacuum conformal block. The consideration is also extended to the\n4-point ${\\cal W}_3$ conformal block of four semi-degenerate operators, in\nwhich case the exponentiation hypothesis works the same way. Here, only the\nfirst three block coefficients can be treated analytically.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
