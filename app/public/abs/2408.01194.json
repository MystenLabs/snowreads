Using recent results on the\nstability of Helmholtz transmission problems with piecewise constant\ncoefficients from [A. Moiola and E. A. Spence, Acoustic transmission problems:\nwavenumber-explicit bounds and resonance-free regions, Mathematical Models and\nMethods in Applied Sciences, 29 (2019), pp. 317-354] we obtain\nfrequency-explicit statements on the holomorphic dependence of the scattered\nfield and the far-field pattern on the stochastic shape parameters. This paves\nthe way for applying general results on the efficient construction of\nhigh-dimensional surrogate models. We also take into account the effect of\ndomain truncation by means of perfectly matched layers (PML). In addition,\nspatial regularity estimates which are explicit in terms of the wavenumber $k$\npermit us to quantify the impact of finite-element Galerkin discretization\nusing high-order Lagrangian finite-element spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
