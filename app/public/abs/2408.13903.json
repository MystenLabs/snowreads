The model is designed for glioblastoma (GBM)\nbrain tumors. The modeled species correspond to proliferative, infiltrative,\nand necrotic tumor cells. The model calibration is formulated as an inverse\nproblem and solved a PDE-constrained optimization method. The data that drives\nthe calibration is derived by a single multi-parametric MRI image. This a\ntypical clinical scenario for GBMs. The unknown parameters that need to be\ncalibrated from data include ten scalar parameters and the infinite dimensional\ninitial condition (IC) for proliferative tumor cells. This inverse problem is\nhighly ill-posed as we try to calibrate a nonlinear dynamical system from data\ntaken at a single time. To address this ill-posedness, we split the inversion\ninto two stages. First we regularize the IC reconstruction by solving a\nsingle-species compressed sensing problem. Then, using the IC reconstruction,\nwe invert for model parameters using a weighted regularization term. We\nconstruct the regularization term by using auxiliary 1D inverse problems. We\napply our proposed scheme to clinical data. We compare our algorithm with\nsingle-species reconstruction and unregularized reconstructions. Our scheme\nenables the stable estimation of non-observable species and quantification of\ninfiltrative tumor cells.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
