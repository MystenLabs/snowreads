These differing judgments derive\nfrom differences in mathematical methods. Later relativists employ geometrical\nstructures to correct anomalies in the coordinate systems used in analytic\nexpressions. Einstein took the analytic expressions to be primary and the\ngeometrical structures as mere heuristics that could be overruled if physical\nassumptions required it. Einstein's non-geometric methods had a firm base in\nthe history of mathematical methods. They continued the non-geometric\norientation of Christoffel, Ricci and LeviCivita. Einstein's insistence that\nsingularities must be eliminated marked a departure from earlier tolerance of\nsingularities. It was founded upon his longterm project of eliminating\narbitrariness from fundamental physical theories. However, Einstein was willing\nto theorize with singularities only temporarily if they were the least\narbitrary approach then available.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
