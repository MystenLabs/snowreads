Motivated by reported inconsistencies in slip\nresistance probed at different depths, we investigated (i) whether the average\nslip family activity is affected by the presence of a surface and (ii) how the\nkinematic nature of available slip families influences a potential surface\neffect. The slip family activity as a function of distance from the surface was\nextracted from full-field crystal plasticity simulations of random\npolycrystalline hexagonal close-packed (HCP) and body-centered cubic (BCC)\nmetals as examples of mixed in contrast to universally-high numbers of slip\nsystems per family. Under certain conditions, a deviation from bulk slip\nactivity is observed up to about two grains from the surface. For the easiest\n(least slip-resistant) family, a surface effect of decreasing activity with\ndepth emerges if the number of slip systems falls below about six. For harder\nfamilies, slip activity always increases with depth. These phenomena are\nexplained on the basis of varying constraints with depth in connection with the\nkinematic properties of slip families in the material.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
