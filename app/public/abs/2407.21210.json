We show that maps\nof group objects equipped with normality data, in Prasma's sense, are algebras\nfor a \"normal closure\" monad in a way which generalizes the standard\nloops-suspension monad. We generalize a result of Prasma by showing that\nmonoidal functors of $\\infty$-topoi preserve normal maps or, equivalently, that\nmonoidal functors of $\\infty$-topoi preserve the property of \"being a fiber\"\nfor morphisms between connected objects. We also formulate Noether's\nIsomorphism Theorems in this setting, prove the first of them, and provide\ncounterexamples to the other two. Accomplishing these goals requires us to\nspend substantial time synthesizing existing work of Lurie so that we may\nrigorously talk about group objects in $\\infty$-topoi in the \"usual way.\" One\nnice result of this labor is the formulation and proof of an Orbit-Stabilizer\nTheorem for group actions in $\\infty$-topoi.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
