The main technical contribution is a\nformula for the obstruction class measuring the failure of a Chern character to\nremain within the Hodge filtration as a cup product with a (derived)\nKodaira-Spencer class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
