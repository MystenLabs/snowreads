In this note, we derive a recursive formula to compute the\nbetweenness centralities of a graph from the betweenness centralities of its\n2-core.Furthermore, we analyze mathematically the significant impact of\nremoving degree-one nodes on the estimation of betweenness centrality within\nthe context of the popular pivot sampling scheme for Single-Source Shortest\nPath (SSSP) computations, as described in the Brandes-Pich approach and\nimplemented in widely used software such as NetworkX. We demonstrate both\ntheoretically and empirically that removing degree-1 nodes can reduce the\nsample complexity needed to achieve better accuracy, thereby decreasing the\noverall runtime.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"us7ud2zVfgpOld06Ru18CM9ayyzcnxVx44HkFVPU-Dk","pdfSize":"2234855"}
