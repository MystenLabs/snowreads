The state we consider\nis a quark dressed with a gluon, and we use the two-component framework in\nlight-front Hamiltonian QCD. We compare the results from different\ndecompositions available in the literature. We also present the angular\nmomentum distributions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
