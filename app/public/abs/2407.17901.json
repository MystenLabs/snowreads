A rotating Bose-Einstein condensate, when\nconfined in a double-well potential, not only gives rise to visible vortices\nbut also produces hidden vortices. We have empirically developed the Feynmans\nrule for the number of vortices versus angular momentum in Bose-Einstein\ncondensates in presence of the density dependent-gauge potentials. The\nvariation of the average angular momentum with the number of vortices is also\nsensitive to the nature of the nonlinear rotation due to the density-dependent\ngauge potentials. The empirical result agrees well with the numerical\nsimulations and the connection is verified by means of curve fitting analysis.\nThe modified Feynman rule is further confirmed for the BECs confined in\nharmonic and toroidal traps. In addition, we show the nucleation of vortices in\ndouble-well and toroidally confined Bose-Einstein condensates solely through\nnonlinear rotations (without any trap rotation) arising through the density\ndependent-gauge potential.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
