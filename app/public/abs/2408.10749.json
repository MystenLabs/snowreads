This materializes through an easy and fast method\nto calculate integrals or integral representations of different functions,\nexpressible by means of Meijer's G-, as well as hypergeometric generalized\nfunctions. The feedback starts from a fundamental integral that comes from the\ndecomposition of the unity operator in the language of coherent states from\nquantum mechanics. In this way, integrals and integral representations are\nobtained, some that do not appear in the literature, and others already known,\nwhich can be verified by orthodox methods. All calculations are made using the\nproperties of the diagonal operators ordering technique (DOOT), a relatively\nnew technique of normal ordering of the creation and annihilation operators in\nquantum mechanics. The paper contributes to increasing the number of solvable\nintegrals involving special functions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
