In this paper, we investigate if individuals exhibit racial\nhomophily when viewing visualizations, using mass shooting data in the United\nStates as the example topic. We conducted a crowdsourced experiment (N=450)\nwhere each participant was shown a visualization displaying the counts of mass\nshooting victims, highlighting the counts for one of three racial groups\n(White, Black, or Hispanic). Participants were assigned to view visualizations\nhighlighting their own race or a different race to assess the influence of\nracial concordance on changes in affect (emotion) and attitude towards gun\ncontrol. While we did not find evidence of homophily, the results showed a\nsignificant negative shift in affect across all visualization conditions.\nNotably, political ideology significantly impacted changes in affect, with more\nliberal views correlating with a more negative affect change. Our findings\nunderscore the complexity of reactions to mass shooting visualizations and\nsuggest that future research should consider various methodological\nimprovements to better assess homophily effects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
