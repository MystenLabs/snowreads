In particular, we derive a Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple, a Morgen theorem, an uncertainty principle for the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation and a version of H\\\"omanders theorem. Furthermore, we generalise the\nin the Euclidean case well-known Hausdorff-Young inequality for the Fourier\ntransform, to harmonic manifolds of rank one.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
