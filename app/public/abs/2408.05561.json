In\nparticular, we introduce the concept of monomial ideals of well-nearly normally\ntorsion-free type, and show that these ideals are normal. After that, we\npresent some results on the existence of embedded associated prime ideals in\nthe associated primes set of powers of monomial ideals. Further, we employ them\nin investigating the edge and cover ideals of cones of graphs. Next, we present\ncounterexamples to several questions concerning the relations between relevant\nalgebraic properties of the edge ideals of clutters and complement clutters. We\nconclude by providing counterexamples to questions on the possible connections\nbetween normally torsion-freeness and normality of monomial ideals under\npolarization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
