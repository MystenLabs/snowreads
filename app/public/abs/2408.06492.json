This\nMarkov chain arises when one studies the cokernel of a random matrix $M$, after\nconditioning on a submatrix of $M$. We show two surprising facts about this\nMarkov chain. Firstly, it is reversible. Hence, one may regard it is a random\nwalk on finite abelian $p$-groups. The proof of reversibility also explains the\nappearance of the Cohen-Lenstra distribution in the context of random matrices.\nSecondly, we can explicitly determine the spectrum of the infinite transition\nmatrix associated to this Markov chain.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XFq9wQq-j_cNxA_H2L52Pv80RP52BC7AtLiduVXdAgQ","pdfSize":"430695"}
