One significant advantage is enhancing the detection significance of\nseparate detectors by correlating their data and assuming a joint emission. We\nhave formulated an approach for updating the Bayesian posterior probability of\nan astrophysical origin, namely $p_{\\rm astro}$, relying on multi-messenger\ncoincidences. We demonstrated this with candidate coincident gravitational\nwaves and high-energy neutrinos. Applying our method to the public data of\ncandidate coincident high-energy neutrinos with subthreshold gravitational-wave\ntriggers, we found that in the case of highly energetic neutrino coincidences,\n$p_{\\rm astro}$ can increase from approximately $\\sim 0.1$ to $\\sim 0.9$. This\nmarked improvement makes subthreshold detections much more confident.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
