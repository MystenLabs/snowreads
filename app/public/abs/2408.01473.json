We use the correspondence scenario to find\nthe pilgrim and generalized ghost pilgrim dark energy $f(Q)$ gravity models for\na Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with pressureless matter and a power-law\nscale factor. The reconstructed models explain the observed rapid expansion of\nthe universe using astronomical observations. We also examine the physical\nproperties of the model, including its equation of state parameter,\n$(\\omega_{D}-\\omega^{\\prime}_{D})$ and $(r-s)$-planes and the squared speed of\nsound. It is found that our results are consistent with the interacting pilgrim\ndark energy model in the same gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
