We\nmainly focus on divergence-free drift, but allow for scaling-critical\nnon-divergence free perturbations. In the time-dependent divergence-free case\nwe roughly speaking prove weak well-posedness of energy solutions with initial\nlaw $\\mu \\ll \\text{Leb}$ for drift $b \\in L^p_T B^{-\\gamma}_{p, 1}$ with $p \\in\n(2, \\infty]$ and $p \\geqslant \\frac{2}{1 -\\gamma}$. For time-independent $b$ we\nshow weak well-posedness of energy solutions with initial law $\\mu \\ll\n\\text{Leb}$ under certain structural assumptions on $b$ which allow local\nsingularities such that $b \\notin B^{-1}_{2 d/(d-2), 2}$, meaning that for any\n$p > 2$ in sufficiently high dimension there exists $b \\notin B^{-1}_{p, 2}$\nsuch that weak well-posedness holds for energy solutions with drift $b$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
