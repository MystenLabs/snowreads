Existing approaches either\nadapt general video super-resolution networks to face datasets or apply\nestablished face image super-resolution models independently on individual\nvideo frames. These paradigms encounter challenges either in reconstructing\nfacial details or maintaining temporal consistency. To address these issues, we\nintroduce a novel framework called Kalman-inspired Feature Propagation (KEEP),\ndesigned to maintain a stable face prior over time. The Kalman filtering\nprinciples offer our method a recurrent ability to use the information from\npreviously restored frames to guide and regulate the restoration process of the\ncurrent frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod in capturing facial details consistently across video frames.
