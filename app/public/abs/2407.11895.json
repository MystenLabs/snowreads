Given the foundational role of\nmultimodal joint representation in understanding and generation pipelines,\nhigh-quality omni joint representations would be a step toward co-processing\nmore diverse multimodal information. In this work, we present OmniBind,\nlarge-scale multimodal joint representation models ranging in scale from 7\nbillion to 30 billion parameters, which support 3D, audio, image, and language\ninputs. Due to the scarcity of data pairs across all modalities, instead of\ntraining large models from scratch, we propose remapping and binding the spaces\nof various pre-trained specialist models together. This approach enables\n\"scaling up\" by indirectly increasing the model parameters and the amount of\nseen data. To effectively integrate various spaces, we dynamically assign\nweights to different spaces by learning routers with two objectives:\ncross-modal overall alignment and language representation decoupling. Notably,\nsince binding and routing spaces both only require lightweight networks,\nOmniBind is extremely training-efficient. Learning the largest 30B model\nrequires merely unpaired unimodal data and approximately 3 days on a single\n8-4090 node. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility and superiority\nof OmniBind as an omni representation model, highlighting its great potential\nfor diverse applications, such as any-query and composable multimodal\nunderstanding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F2Smu7NiGIiIwbVpkump-HrdmPUAos9gPG0evIg1boU","pdfSize":"18054105"}
