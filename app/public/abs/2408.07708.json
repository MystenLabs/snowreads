This new formulation may\nfacilitate the development of novel ways of finding approximate solutions of\nthe electronic problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
