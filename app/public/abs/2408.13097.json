Geometric\nconstructions are provided for previously open numerical cases by blowing up\ncertain curves on smooth Fano threefolds of Picard number one. This paper\nprovides updated tables in the Appendix and reduces the 14 remaining E1-E* open\ncases to four.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XdTXiLZSCtZd7KgqHiHxtMrK9U1LonZjKPfXUdYqtt4","pdfSize":"179182"}
