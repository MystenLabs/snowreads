These are Type IIA brane\nconfigurations that realize a large family of 2d worldvolume theories on probe\nD1-branes at toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. We show that brane brick models that are\nrelated by mass deformations associated to algebraic and combinatorial polytope\nmutations of Fano 3-folds have mesonic moduli spaces with the same number of\ngenerators. We show that mesonic flavor charges of these generators form convex\nreflexive lattice polytopes that are dual to the toric diagrams of the Fano\n3-folds. The generating function of mesonic gauge invariant operators, also\nknown as the Hilbert series of the mesonic moduli space, appears to be\nidentical for such brane brick models under a particular refinement originating\nfrom the U(1)_R charges in the brane brick model following the mass\ndeformation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
