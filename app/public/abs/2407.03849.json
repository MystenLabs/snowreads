Accessing the tensor $\\mathcal{A}$ exclusively through random\nsketches of the original data, the algorithm effectively leverages structures\nin $\\mathcal{A}$, such as low-rankness, and linear combinations. We present a\ndeterministic analysis of the algorithm and demonstrate its superior speed and\nefficiency in numerical experiments including an application in video\nprocessing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
