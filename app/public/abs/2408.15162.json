Here, we use data from food repositories and network analysis to\ncharacterize worldwide cuisines. In our framework, each cuisine is represented\nas a network, where nodes correspond to ingredient types and weighted links\ndescribe how frequently pairs of ingredient types appear together in recipes.\nThe networks of ingredient combinations reveal cuisine-specific patterns,\nhighlighting similarities and differences in gastronomic preferences across\ndifferent world regions. We find that popular ingredients, recurrent\ncombinations, and the way they are organized within the backbone of the network\nprovide a unique fingerprint for each cuisine. Hence, we demonstrate that\nnetworks of ingredient combinations are able to cluster global cuisines into\nmeaningful geo-cultural groups, and can also be used to train models to\nuniquely identify a cuisine from a subset of its recipes. Our study advances\nour understanding of food combinations and helps uncover the geography of\ntaste, paving the way for the creation of new and innovative recipes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
