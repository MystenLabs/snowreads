We show that the deformations are equivalent by two methods.\nFirst, we map directly the two models to each other and show that the\ndeformations are the same for $79$ \"Good\" models, but not for the $77$ \"Bad\"\nones. We then investigate the orbifold of the mirror pair by the maximal\nsymmetry group and show that the number of deformations is the same and that\nthey are almost the same, i.e., the first four exponents of the deformations\nare identical.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g9VTgBgeeZAs4KbyeTHKv-w8t5C4wsdPINCui1Zff48","pdfSize":"103674"}
