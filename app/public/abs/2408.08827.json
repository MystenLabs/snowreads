To address this issue, this\npaper presents a novel All-layer multimodal Interaction Network, named AINet,\nwhich performs efficient and effective feature interactions of all modalities\nand layers in a progressive fusion Mamba, for robust RGBT tracking. Even though\nmodality features in different layers are known to contain different cues, it\nis always challenging to build multimodal interactions in each layer due to\nstruggling in balancing interaction capabilities and efficiency. Meanwhile,\nconsidering that the feature discrepancy between RGB and thermal modalities\nreflects their complementary information to some extent, we design a\nDifference-based Fusion Mamba (DFM) to achieve enhanced fusion of different\nmodalities with linear complexity. When interacting with features from all\nlayers, a huge number of token sequences (3840 tokens in this work) are\ninvolved and the computational burden is thus large. To handle this problem, we\ndesign an Order-dynamic Fusion Mamba (OFM) to execute efficient and effective\nfeature interactions of all layers by dynamically adjusting the scan order of\ndifferent layers in Mamba. Extensive experiments on four public RGBT tracking\ndatasets show that AINet achieves leading performance against existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
