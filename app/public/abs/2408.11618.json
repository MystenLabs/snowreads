We\nfind new lower bounds for $r(K)$ using $\\det(K)$ and $\\Delta_K(t)$, and we\nprove that the set $\\mathfrak{R}_r~=~\\{\\Delta_K(t)~:~r(K)~\\leq~r\\}$ is finite\nand computable. We determine $\\mathfrak{R}_2$ and $\\mathfrak{R}_3$, applying\nour results to compute the ribbon numbers for all ribbon knots with 11 or fewer\ncrossings, with three exceptions. Finally, we find lower bounds for ribbon\nnumbers of links derived from their Jones polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
