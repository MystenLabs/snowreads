Second, randomized treatment assignment for some data realizations\ncan be optimal in both ex-ante and, perhaps more surprisingly, ex-post\nproblems. Therefore, it is usually with loss of generality to exclude\nrandomized rules from consideration, even when regret is evaluated ex-post.\n  We apply our results to a stylized problem where a policy maker uses\nexperimental data to choose whether to implement a new policy in a population\nof interest, but is concerned about the external validity of the experiment at\nhand (Stoye, 2012); and to the aggregation of data generated by multiple\nrandomized control trials in different sites to make a policy choice in a\npopulation for which no experimental data are available (Manski, 2020; Ishihara\nand Kitagawa, 2021).\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
