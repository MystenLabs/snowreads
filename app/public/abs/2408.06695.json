First, we introduce\nthree performance evaluation indices for such filtering problems,namely the\nstandard performance evaluation index, the nominal performance evaluation\nindex, and the estimation error covariance. We derive difference expressions\namong these indices and establish one-step relations among them under various\nmismatched noise covariance scenarios. We particularly reveal the effect of the\nconsensus fusion on these relations. Furthermore, the recursive relations are\nintroduced by extending the results of the one-step relations. Subsequently, we\ndemonstrate the convergence of these indices under the collective observability\ncondition, and show this convergence condition of the nominal performance\nevaluation index can guarantee the convergence of the estimation error\ncovariance. Additionally, we prove that the estimation error covariance of the\nconsensus-based distributed filter under mismatched noise covariances can be\nbounded by the Frobenius norms of the noise covariance deviations and the trace\nof the nominal performance evaluation index. Finally, the effectiveness of the\ntheoretical results is verified by numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
