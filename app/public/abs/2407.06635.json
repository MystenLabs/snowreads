Approaches based on generative models offer\ninterpretability by generating anomaly-free versions of test images, but are\ntypically unable to identify subtle anomalies. Alternatively, approaches using\nfeature modelling or self-supervised methods, such as the ones relying on\nsynthetically generated anomalies, do not provide out-of-the-box\ninterpretability. In this work, we present a novel method that combines the\nstrengths of both strategies: a generative cold-diffusion pipeline (i.e., a\ndiffusion-like pipeline which uses corruptions not based on noise) that is\ntrained with the objective of turning synthetically-corrupted images back to\ntheir normal, original appearance. To support our pipeline we introduce a novel\nsynthetic anomaly generation procedure, called DAG, and a novel anomaly score\nwhich ensembles restorations conditioned with different degrees of abnormality.\nOur method surpasses the prior state-of-the art for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection in three different Brain MRI datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
