Historically, Coulomb drag has been attributed to a\nfrictional force arising from momentum transfer whose direction is dictated by\nthe current flow. However recent findings in one-dimensional systems have also\nidentified a rectified contribution that is independent of the current flow\ndirection. In this work, we present Coulomb drag measurements between\nvertically coupled GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wires separated vertically by a hard\nbarrier only 15 nm wide where both momentum transfer and rectified Coulomb drag\nsignals are observed simultaneously, and whose relative magnitude are\ntemperature and gate tunable. Our study opens up the possibility of studying\nthe physical mechanisms behind the onset of both momentum transfer and charge\nrectification drag simultaneously in a single device, ultimately leading to a\nbetter understanding of Luttinger liquids in multi-channel wires and paving the\nway for the creation of energy harvesting devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SL9jdX44kY8FsuBOekSskmi0x3KOO4TGw9vH__SvZdg","pdfSize":"4498445"}
