Here we\nhave proposed another platform to generate Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which is\nconstructed by a single opened circular helix molecules (CHM) coupled with a\ns-wave superconductor (with magnetic field) or by an interlinked-CHMs chain\ncoupled with a phase-bias s-wave superconducting heterostructure (without any\nmagnetic field). The MZMs achieved here are tightly associated with the\nstructural chirality in CHMs. Importantly, the left and right handedness may\nresult in completely opposite Majorana polarization (MP), and the local MP is\nassociated to the chiraliy-induced spin polarization. These properties provides\nus multiple effective ways to detect and regulate the MZMs by using the\nchirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and the related spin-polarized\ncurrents in chiral materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
