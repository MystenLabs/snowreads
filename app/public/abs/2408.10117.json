Multiple equivalent definitions are procured, along\nwith a modal characterisation and a proof of its congruence property for a\nstandard process algebra with recursion. The last section presents a complete\naxiomatisation for guarded processes without infinite sequences of unobservable\nactions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
