Unfortunately, a lack of knowledge about\nthese DSLs, such as which security aspects are addressed and when, hinders\ntheir effective use and further research. This systematic literature review\nexamines 120 security-oriented DSLs based on six research questions concerning\nsecurity aspects and goals, language-specific characteristics, integration into\nthe software development lifecycle (SDLC), and effectiveness of the DSLs. We\nobserve a high degree of fragmentation, which leads to opportunities for\nintegration. We also need to improve the usability and evaluation of security\nDSLs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
