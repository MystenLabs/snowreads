The results show that the black hole's thermodynamic\nbehavior is similar to that of the Van der Waals system. Although the critical\nratios at the critical points differ among the three universes, they are all\nindependent of the quantum correction parameter. For chaos, time perturbations\nwill lead to chaotic behavior when their amplitude exceeds a critical value\nthat depends on the quantum correction parameter and the radius of the dust\nsphere in the FRW model. Based on this, we found that the chaotic behavior of\nthe black hole varies across different universes depending on the quantum\ncorrection parameter, but this parameter always makes chaos more likely. Using\nthe value of the quantum correction parameter determined by Meissner, chaos is\nalways more difficult to occur in an open universe compared to the other two\ntypes of universes. Which universe is most prone to chaos depends on the radius\nof the dust sphere. Finally, chaotic behavior is always present under spatial\nperturbations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
