The results show that syntactic complexity convergence can be\nstatistically confirmed in one of three selected German datasets that were\nanalysed. Given that the dataset which shows such convergence is much larger\nthan the other two selected datasets, the empirical results indicate a certain\ndegree of linguistic generality of syntactic complexity convergence in\nconversational interaction. We also found a different type of syntactic\ncomplexity convergence in one of the datasets while further investigation is\nstill necessary.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7PMI3UuD28xNyl2EUwPteBTcJSiUADIjBtG5TwFmW7w","pdfSize":"460690"}
