Existing work typically defines these worst-case shifts as ones\nthat most degrade the individual-level accuracy of the model. However, when\nmodels are used to make a downstream population-level decision like the\nallocation of a scarce resource, individual-level accuracy may be a poor proxy\nfor performance on the task at hand. We introduce a novel framework that\nemploys a hierarchical model structure to identify worst-case distribution\nshifts in predictive resource allocation settings by capturing shifts both\nwithin and across instances of the decision problem. This task is more\ndifficult than in standard distribution shift settings due to combinatorial\ninteractions, where decisions depend on the joint presence of individuals in\nthe allocation task. We show that the problem can be reformulated as a\nsubmodular optimization problem, enabling efficient approximations of\nworst-case loss. Applying our framework to real data, we find empirical\nevidence that worst-case shifts identified by one metric often significantly\ndiverge from worst-case distributions identified by other metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
