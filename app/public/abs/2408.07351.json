Two-dimensional square lattices with $p$ electrons\nare well-suited to the realization of CDW, due to the anisotropy of the $p$\norbitals and the resulting one dimensionality of the electronic structure. In\nspite of a long history of study of CDW in square-lattice systems, few reports\nhave recognized the existence and significance of a hidden orbital degree of\nfreedom. The degeneracy of $p_x$ and $p_y$ electrons inherent to a square\nlattice may give rise to nontrivial orbital patterns in real space that endow\nthe CDW with additional broken symmetries or unusual order parameters. Using\nscanning tunneling microscopy, we visualize signatures of $p$-orbital texture\nin the CDW state of the topological semimetal candidate CeSbTe, which contains\nSb square lattices with 5$p$ electrons. We image atomic-sized, anisotropic\nlobes of charge density with periodically modulating anisotropy, that\nultimately can be mapped onto a microscopic pattern of $p_x$ and $p_y$ bond\ndensity waves. Our results show that even delocalized $p$ orbitals can\nreorganize into unexpected and emergent electronic states of matter.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
