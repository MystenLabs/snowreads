The recent high statistic measurement in the $J/\\psi \\to\n\\gamma 3(\\pi^+\\pi^-)$ channel would provide a good opportunity to probe the\nnature of the peak structures around the $p\\bar{p}$ threshold in various\nprocesses. By constructing the $N\\bar{N}$ interaction respecting chiral\nsymmetry, we extract the pole positions by fitting the $p\\bar{p}$ and\n$3(\\pi^+\\pi^-)$ invariant mass distributions of the $J/\\psi \\to \\gamma p \\bar\np$ and $J/\\psi \\to \\gamma 3(\\pi^+\\pi^-)$ processes. The threshold enhancement\nin the $p\\bar{p}$ invariant mass distribution is from the pole on the third\nRiemann sheet, which more couples to the isospin triplet channel. The broader\nstructure in the $3(\\pi^+\\pi^-)$ invariant mass comes from the pole on the\nphysical Riemann sheet, which more couples to the isospin singlet channel.\nFurthermore, the large compositeness indicates that there should exit\n$p\\bar{p}$ resonance based on the current experimental data. In addition, we\nalso see a clear threshold enhancement in the $n\\bar{n}$ channel, but not as\nsignificant as that in $p\\bar{p}$ channel, which is useful and compared with\nfurther experimental measurement.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
