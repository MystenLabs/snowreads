Current approaches to the exciton dynamics\nrely on {\\em model} Hamiltonians that depend on already screened\nelectron-electron and electron-phonon couplings. In this work, we subject the\nstate-of-the-art methods to scrutiny using the {\\em ab initio} Hamiltonian for\nelectrons and phonons. We offer a rigorous and intuitive proof demonstrating\nthat the exciton dynamics governed by model Hamiltonians is affected by an\noverscreening of the electron-phonon interaction. The introduction of an\nauxiliary exciton species, termed the irreducible exciton, enables us to\nformulate a theory free from overscreening and derive the excitonic Bloch\nequations. These equations describe the time-evolution of coherent,\nirreducible, and incoherent excitons during and after the optical excitation.\nThey are applicable beyond the linear regime, and predict that the total number\nof excitons is preserved when the external fields are switched off.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
