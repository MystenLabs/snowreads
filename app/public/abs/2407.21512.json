A key challenge is developing intuitive\ninterfaces for easy communication. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) like\nGPT-4 has enhanced robot capabilities, allowing for real-time interaction and\ndecision-making. This integration improves robots' adaptability and\nfunctionality. This project focuses on merging LLMs with databases to improve\ndecision-making and enable knowledge acquisition for request interpretation\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MFdQUecAIqJ01Pce76DcS1OESNGPs1qgQM2aKmnLLII","pdfSize":"665485"}
