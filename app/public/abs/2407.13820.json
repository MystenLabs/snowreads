In this\narticle, we explore the consequences of such a proposal at early cosmological\ntimes. We find the stochastic evolution results in the spatial metric diffusing\naway from its deterministic value, generating phantom cold dark matter (CDM).\nIt is produced primarily at the end of the inflationary phase of the Universe's\nevolution, with a statistical distribution that depends on the specifics of the\nearly-times cosmological model. We find the energy density of this phantom cold\ndark matter is positive on average, a necessary condition to reproduce the\ncosmological phenomenology of CDM, although further work is required to\ncalculate its mean density and spatial distribution. If the density is\ncosmologically significant, phantom dark matter acts on the geometry in a way\nthat is indistinguishable from conventional CDM. As such, it has the potential\nto reproduce phenomenology such as structure formation, lensing, and galactic\nrotation curves. We conclude by discussing the possibility of testing hybrid\ntheories of gravity by combining measurements of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground with tabletop experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
