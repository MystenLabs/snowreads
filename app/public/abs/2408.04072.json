Therefore, understanding the\ncomposition and distribution of these datasets has become increasingly crucial.\nTo address the need for intuitive exploration of these datasets, we propose\nAEye, an extensible and scalable visualization tool tailored to image datasets.\nAEye utilizes a contrastively trained model to embed images into semantically\nmeaningful high-dimensional representations, facilitating data clustering and\norganization. To visualize the high-dimensional representations, we project\nthem onto a two-dimensional plane and arrange images in layers so users can\nseamlessly navigate and explore them interactively. AEye facilitates semantic\nsearch functionalities for both text and image queries, enabling users to\nsearch for content. We open-source the codebase for AEye, and provide a simple\nconfiguration to add datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qjmtnzR_QpJ5xpU8Yr1VEXdfthX4-PU9DaA7k6n5MbA","pdfSize":"10097237"}
