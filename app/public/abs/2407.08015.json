We derive the\nrelevant matrix elements and evaluate them using the method of regions. We\nbenchmark the accuracy of our approximations by carrying out numerical\ncomputations of the full expressions. We show that the first order radiative\ncorrections due to the exchange of a Coulomb photon between positron and\nproton-proton systems map onto the Sirlin function and the\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha)$ contribution from the Fermi function. We furthermore find\nthat the nuclear structure dependent radiative correction omitted in the\nprevious analysis by Kurylov {\\it et al} gives an up to 0.2~\\% correction to\nthe pp fusion S-factor with its size ultimately depending on a two-nucleon\ncounterterm that renormalizes the axial two-body current $L_{1A}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
