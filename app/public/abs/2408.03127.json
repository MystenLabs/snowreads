We explored the\ncapabilities of Mistral-7B, a generalist open-source Large Language Model\n(LLM). We developed a prompt for the NLI4CT task, and fine-tuned a quantized\nversion of the model using an augmented version of the training dataset. The\nexperimental results show that this approach can produce notable results in\nterms of the macro F1-score, while having limitations in terms of faithfulness\nand consistency.
