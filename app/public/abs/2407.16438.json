This method significantly reduces the\nsignal quality at eavesdroppers(Eves) while ensuring high-quality reception for\nlegitimate users, effectively enhancing communication security. At the\ntransmitter, this study employs multi-beam symbol-level directional modulation\nto ensure secure and reliable transmission in a mixed eavesdropping\nenvironment. Given the uncertainty about eavesdropper information, the\ntransmission beamforming vectors are specially designed to meet specific\nsymbol-level constraints, thereby ensuring effective reception for legitimate\nusers. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in improving secrecy performance, reducing transmission power, and\nenhancing energy efficiency, offering a practical solution to the security\nchallenges faced by future wireless networks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
