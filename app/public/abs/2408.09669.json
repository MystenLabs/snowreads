Adopting a novel\n$R^2$ decomposed connectedness approach, our empirical analysis reveals several\nkey findings. The overall TCI dynamics have been mainly dominated by\ncontemporaneous dynamics rather than the lagged dynamics. We also find climate\nchange has significant spillovers to other markets. Moreover, there are\nheterogeneous spillover effects among agricultural markets. Specially, corn is\nthe biggest risk contributor to this system, while barley is the major risk\nreceiver of shocks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
