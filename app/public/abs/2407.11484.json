Initially confined to simple persona consistency due to limited model\ncapabilities, role-playing tasks have now expanded to embrace complex character\nportrayals involving character consistency, behavioral alignment, and overall\nattractiveness. We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the critical components\nin designing these systems, including data, models and alignment, agent\narchitecture and evaluation. This survey not only outlines the current\nmethodologies and challenges, such as managing dynamic personal profiles and\nachieving high-level persona consistency but also suggests avenues for future\nresearch in improving the depth and realism of role-playing applications. The\ngoal is to guide future research by offering a structured overview of current\nmethodologies and identifying potential areas for improvement.
