Within the framework\nof deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we integrate the initial and the target\nstate information within the state preparation task together, so as to realize\nthe control trajectory design between two arbitrary quantum states. Utilizing a\nsemiconductor double quantum dots (DQDs) model, our results demonstrate that\nthe resulting control trajectories can effectively achieve arbitrary quantum\nstate preparation (AQSP) for both single-qubit and two-qubit systems, with\naverage fidelities of 0.9868 and 0.9556 for the test sets, respectively.\nFurthermore, we consider the noise around the system and the control\ntrajectories exhibit commendable robustness against charge and nuclear noise.\nOur study not only substantiates the efficacy of DRL in QSP, but also provides\na new solution for quantum control tasks of multi-initial and multi-objective\nstates, and is expected to be extended to a wider range of quantum control\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
