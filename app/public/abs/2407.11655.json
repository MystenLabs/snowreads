Despite their importance,\nthe properties of the territory covered by a $d$-dimensional fBm have remained\nelusive so far. Here, we study the visitation dynamics of the fBm by\nconsidering the time $\\tau_n$ required to visit a site, defined as a unit cell\nof a $d$-dimensional lattice, when $n$ sites have been visited. Relying on\nscaling arguments, we determine all temporal regimes of the probability\ndistribution function of $\\tau_n$. These results are confirmed by extensive\nnumerical simulations that employ large-deviation Monte Carlo algorithms.\nBesides these theoretical aspects, our results account for the tracking data of\ntelomeres in the nucleus of mammalian cells, microspheres in an agorose gel,\nand vacuoles in the amoeba, which are experimental realizations of fBm.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
