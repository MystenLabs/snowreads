However, many issues remain when capturing images in-the-wild under\nchallenging conditions, such as low light, high dynamic range, or rapid motion\nleading to smeared reconstructions with noticeable artifacts. In this work, we\nintroduce quanta radiance fields, a novel class of neural radiance fields that\nare trained at the granularity of individual photons using single-photon\ncameras (SPCs). We develop theory and practical computational techniques for\nbuilding radiance fields and estimating dense camera poses from unconventional,\nstochastic, and high-speed binary frame sequences captured by SPCs. We\ndemonstrate, both via simulations and a SPC hardware prototype, high-fidelity\nreconstructions under high-speed motion, in low light, and for extreme dynamic\nrange settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gIknQ91-G89OZ2sKaE_fuv_mHE_8jl_LJIsk-0Xv99Y","pdfSize":"22791189"}
