[2] has introduced Multi-Channel Factor\nAnalysis (MFA) as an extension of factor analysis to multi-channel data that\nallows for latent factors common to all channels as well as factors specific to\neach channel. This paper validates the MFA covariance model and analyzes the\nstatistical properties of the MFA estimators. In particular, a thorough\ninvestigation of model identifiability under varying latent factor structures\nis conducted, and sufficient conditions for generic global identifiability of\nMFA are obtained. The development of these identifiability conditions enables\nasymptotic analysis of estimators obtained by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood,\nwhich are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal even under\nmisspecification of the latent factor distribution.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GxWgXnephT-25LZFmMKWAM2iXnseqD9zyvjY5t12fL4","pdfSize":"639709"}
