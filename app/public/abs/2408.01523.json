In the special case of\nquaternion-valued functions of one quaternionic variable, this unified theory\ncomprises Fueter-regular functions, slice-regular functions and a\nrecently-discovered function class. In the special case of Clifford-valued\nfunctions of one paravector variable, it encompasses monogenic functions,\nslice-monogenic functions, generalized partial-slice monogenic functions, and a\nvariety of function classes not yet considered in literature. For $T$-regular\nfunctions over an associative $*$-algebra, this work provides integral\nformulas, series expansions, an Identity Principle, a Maximum Modulus Principle\nand a Representation Formula. It also proves some foundational results about\n$T$-regular functions over an alternative but nonassociative $*$-algebra, such\nas the real algebra of octonions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
