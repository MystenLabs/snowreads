We show that a free mirig on finitely many\ngenerators is finite and compute its size. This work was originally motivated\nby a collaborative effort on the decentralized social network Mastodon to\ncompute the size of the free mirig on two generators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
