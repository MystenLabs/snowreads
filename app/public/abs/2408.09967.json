By leveraging the strengths of both optimization techniques and machine\nlearning, this method introduces a robust framework for solving complex\noptimization problems where traditional methods may fall short. The proposed\napproach encapsulates the constraints and objectives of a linear programming\nproblem directly into the loss function, guiding the learning process to adhere\nto these constraints while optimizing the desired outcomes. This technique not\nonly preserves the interpretability of linear programming but also benefits\nfrom the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning, making it\nparticularly well-suited for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
