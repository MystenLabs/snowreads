The\nZWM interferometry shows the capability to generate interference effects\nbetween single signal photons via indistinguishability between the entangled\nidler photons. This paper extends the foundational principles of ZWM\ninterferometry by integrating cavity-enhanced SPDCs, aiming to narrow photon\nbandwidths for improved coherence and photon pair generation efficiency, which\nis critical for applications in quantum information technologies, quantum\nencryption, and quantum imaging. This work explores the theoretical implication\nof employing singly resonant optical parametric oscillators within the ZWM\ninterferometer to produce narrow-band single photons. By combining\ncavity-enhanced SPDCs with ZWM interferometry, this study fills a gap in\ncurrent theoretical proposals, offering significant advancements in quantum\ncryptography and network applications that require reliable, narrow-band single\nphotons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AG9hw-Pwk1Gk-zSG_TutsOVok7vIDqa9dlM_4BN5w5U","pdfSize":"475621"}
