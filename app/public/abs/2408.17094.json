This roadmap, defined during a\nbottom-up process by the community, outlines nine technology domains for HEP\ninstrumentation and pinpoints urgent R&D topics, known as Detector R&D Themes\n(DRDTs). Task forces were set for each domain, leading to Detector R&D\nCollaborations (DRDs), now hosted at CERN. After an intensive period over the\nlast months, seven DRD collaborations have been established, which are now\nstarting to set up their collaboration structures and begin to work. One is\nstill in the preparation phase. In this publication, I will give an overview of\nthe set-up process and the current status of all DRD collaborations covering\ndetector developments in the field of gaseous detectors, noble liquid detectors\nfor rare event searches, semiconductor detectors, photodetectors and concepts\nfor particle ID, quantum sensors, calorimetry, electronics for HEP\ninstrumentation and mechanical and integration aspects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
