In recent\nyears, the study of JT gravity and its deformations has helped us learn about\nthe different contributions of geometries in the gravitational path integral,\nthe quantum gravity Hilbert space, the space-time factorization problem, the\nrole of averaging in holography, the black hole information paradox, and the\nmatrix models. All this motivates the exploration of the JT gravity in\ndifferent setups, with and without matter. Here, we consider JT gravity\nconformally coupled to Liouville field theory and matter fields. This model\nadmits to be interpreted as a non-critical string theory on a linear dilaton\nbackground with a tachyonic Liouville potential along a null direction. The\nconstant curvature constraint of JT gravity results in a neutralization of the\nLiouville mode, which makes it possible to compute the four-point correlation\nfunction of the theory analytically. Here we give the explicit derivation of\nthe four-point function and briefly comment on its properties, such as\nmonodromy invariance, crossing symmetry, factorization, and limits.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
