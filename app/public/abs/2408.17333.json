The main ideas focus on performing the reverse\nsampling process conditioned on noisy measurements, using well-established\nnumerical solvers for gradient updates. Although diffusion-based sampling\nmethods can produce high-quality reconstructions, challenges persist in\nnonlinear PDE-based inverse problems and sampling speed. In this work, we\nexplore solving PDE-based travel-time tomography based on subspace diffusion\ngenerative models. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose a\nposterior sampling process for PDE-based inverse problems by solving the\nassociated adjoint-state equation. Second, we resorted to the subspace-based\ndimension reduction technique for conditional sampling acceleration, enabling\nsolving the PDE-based inverse problems from coarse to refined grids. Our\nnumerical experiments showed satisfactory advancements in improving the\ntravel-time imaging quality and reducing the sampling time for reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
