The utilization of TCR in atomic-layer\nmaterials and surfaces of bulk crystals leads to exotic quantum phases, as\nhighlighted by the control of topological phases, the emergence of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) superconductivity, and the realization of 2D\nferromagnetism. Advanced surface-sensitive spectroscopies such as\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (STM) are leading techniques to visualize the electronic structure\nof such exotic states and provide us a guide to further functionalize material\nproperties. In this review article, we summarize the recent progress in this\nfield, with particular emphasis on intriguing results obtained by combining\nspectroscopies and TCR in thin films.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
