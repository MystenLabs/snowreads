In\nthis work we show how this method can be used to establish the presence of a\nweak signal on top of an unknown background, to discard background events and\nto determine the signal properties. The key idea is to use SBI methods to\nidentify events that are similar to each other in the sense that they agree on\nthe inferred model parameters. We illustrate this method for the case of\naxion-like particles decaying to photons at beam-dump experiments. For poor\ndetector resolution the diphoton mass cannot be reliably reconstructed, so\nthere is no simple high-level observable that can be used to perform a bump\nhunt. Since the SBI methods do not require explicit high-level observables,\nthey offer a promising alternative to increase the sensitivity to new physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
