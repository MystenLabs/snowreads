First, we\ninvestigate the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for the considered\nsystem. Next, we determine the conditions necessary for the existence of\noptimal control pairs. Finally, we present an example to illustrate the\neffectiveness of our theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
