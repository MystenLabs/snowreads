{"id":"2408.07227","title":"Stablecoin Runs and Disclosure Policy in the Presence of Large Sales","authors":"Brian Zhu","authorsParsed":[["Zhu","Brian",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 19:37:02 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-15","timestamp":1721763422000,"abstract":"  Stablecoins have historically depegged due from par to large sales, possibly\nof speculative nature, or poor reserve asset quality. Using a global game which\naddresses both concerns, we show that the selling pressure on stablecoin\nholders increases in the presence of a large sale. While precise public\nknowledge reduces (increases) the probability of a run when fundamentals are\nstrong (weak), interestingly, more precise private signals increase (reduce)\nthe probability of a run when fundamentals are strong (weak), potentially\nexplaining the stability of opaque stablecoins. The total run probability can\nbe decomposed into components representing risks from large sales and poor\ncollateral. By analyzing how these risk components vary with respect to\ninformation uncertainty and fundamentals, we can split the fundamental space\ninto regions based on the type of risk a stablecoin issuer is more prone to. We\nsuggest testable implications and connect our model's implications to\nreal-world applications, including depegging events and the no-questions-asked\nproperty of money.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
