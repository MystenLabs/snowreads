Specifically, the power-concentrated region of the\nwavenumber-domain channels is related to the target position in a non-linear\nmanner. Based on this observation, a bi-directional convolutional neural\nnetwork (BiCNN)-based approach is proposed to capture such a relationship,\nthereby facilitating low-complexity target localization. This method enables\ndirect and gridless target localization using only a limited bandwidth and a\nsingle antenna array. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) during the\noffline training phase, the proposed BiCNN method can learn to localize the\ntarget with fewer trainable parameters compared to the naive neural network\narchitectures; and 2) during the online implementation phase, the BiCNN method\ncan spend 100x less time while maintaining comparable performance to the\nconventional two-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithms.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
