Developing protocols to\neffectively identify and understand QPTs thus represents a key but challenging\ntask for present quantum simulation experiments. Here, we establish a dynamical\nquench-interferometric framework to probe a zero-temperature QPT, which\nutilizes the evolved state by quenching the QPT Hamiltonian as input of a\nunitary interferometer. The metrological capability quantified by the quantum\nFisher information captivatingly shows an unique peak in the vicinity of the\nquantum critical point, allowing us to probe the QPT without cooling the system\nto its ground state. We show that the probing can be implemented by extracting\nquantum fluctuations of the interferometric generator as well as parameter\nestimation uncertainty of the interferometric phase, and subsequently allows\nidentifying the boundary of the phase diagram. Our results establish an\nimportant link between QPTs and quantum metrology, and enrich the toolbox of\nstudying non-equilibrium many-body physics in current quantum simulators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
