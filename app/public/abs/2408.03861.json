Haloscopes aim to\ndetect axions in the galactic halo by measuring the photon signal resulting\nfrom axions interacting with a strong magnetic field. Existing haloscopes are\nprimarily targeting axion masses which produce microwave-range photons and rely\non microwave resonators to enhance the signal power. Only a limited subset of\nresonator modes are useful for this process, and current cylindrical-style\ncavities suffer from mode mixing and crowding from other fundamental modes. The\nmajority of these modes can be eliminated by using photonic band gap (PBG)\nresonators. The band gap behavior of these structures allows for a resonator\nwith mode selectivity based on frequency. We present results from the first\ntunable PBG resonator, a proof-of-concept design with a footprint compatible\nwith axion haloscopes. We have thoroughly characterized the tuning range of two\nversions of the structure and report the successful confinement of the\noperating TM$_{010}$ mode and the elimination of all TE modes within the tuning\nrange.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
