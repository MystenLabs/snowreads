The first is based on\nan approach proposed originally by St\\\"{u}ckelberg and the latter is to\nrestrict spacetime geometry via the dynamical field equations and the second\nBianchi identity. Moreover, a third technique is introduced, which is novel and\nrelies on isometries of a gravitational system. Our conclusion is that an SME\nbackground field configuration compatible with Riemannian geometry is more\nlikely to be determined the more diffeomorphisms are isometries of the\nparticular system. This finding has the potential to provide an alternative\ntreatment of explicit spacetime symmetry violation in gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
