However, the location and the origin of\nthe newly discovered hot gas at `super-virial' temperatures of $\\approx 10^7$ K\nhave been puzzling. This hot gas has been detected in both absorption and\nemission; here we focus on the emitting gas only. We show that both the\n`virial' and the `super-virial' temperature gas as observed in \\emph{emission}\noccupy disk-like extraplanar regions, in addition to the diffuse virial\ntemperature gas filling the halo of the Milky Way. We perform idealized\nhydrodynamical simulations to show that the $\\approx 10^7$ K emitting gas is\nlikely to be produced by stellar feedback in and around the Galactic disk. We\nfurther show that the emitting gas at both super-virial and virial temperatures\nin the extraplanar regions is metal enriched and is not in hydrostatic\nequilibrium with the halo but is continuously evolving.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
