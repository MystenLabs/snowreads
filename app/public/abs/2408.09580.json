Our study reveals that binary metastable Co3Pb\nand Fe3Pb intermetallic compounds exhibit very attractive intrinsic magnetic\nproperties. We primarily focus on the magnetic anisotropic properties arising\nfrom the high spin-orbit coupling of the Pb atom. Decomposing the total\nanisotropy into intra- and interatomic contributions reveals a significant\ndeviation from single ion anisotropy model with strong symmetric anisotropic\npair interactions present. Furthermore, we consider magnetic properties of\nternary Pb-based 3d-intermetallics which recently have been reported as stable\nor metastable. Giant magnetic anisotropy is found on Pb atoms in these systems.\nThe origin of such strong anisotropy in La18Co28Pb3 appears from two sources:\nspin-orbit and interelectronic Breit couplings. The significance of Breit\ninteraction for magnetic anisotropy in bulk systems has not been reported\npreviously. It is expected that Breit coupling induced anisotropy is dominating\nin magnetic Pb-based magnets with lower dimensionality including thin films.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
