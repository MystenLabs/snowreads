We\nfocus on cubic polynomials, and analyze configurations of eigenpoints that\nadmit one or more alignments. We give a classification and explicit equations,\nin the coordinates of the points, of all configurations: this is accomplished\nby using both geometric techniques and by an extensive use of computer algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
