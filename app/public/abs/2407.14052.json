Here $K$ is a positively homogeneous\nof order $\\alpha - d$, possibly vector valued, kernel, $\\Phi$ is a\n$p$-homogeneous function, and $p=d/(d-\\alpha)$. The domain $\\Omega\\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^d$ is either bounded with $C^{1,\\beta}$ smooth boundary for some\n$\\beta > 0$ or a halfspace in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. As a corollary, we describe the\npositively homogeneous of order $d/(d-1)$ functions $\\Phi\\colon \\mathbb{R}^d\n\\to \\mathbb{R}$ that are suitable for the bound $$\\Big|\\int_\\Omega \\Phi(\\nabla\nu)\\Big|\\lesssim \\int_\\Omega |\\Delta u|.$$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
