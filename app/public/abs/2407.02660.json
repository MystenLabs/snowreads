We present them as automata over\nthe so-called Shuffling Monoid. These automata can be seen as either shufflers\nor splitters interchangeably. We prove that functionality is decidable for\nsplitters, and we also show that the equivalence between functional splitters\nis decidable. Moreover, in the deterministic case, the algorithm for\nequivalence is polynomial on the number of states of the splitter.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
