However, analyzing and controlling temporal hypergraphs poses\nsignificant challenges due to their inherent time-varying and nonlinear nature,\nwhile most existing methods predominantly target static hypergraphs. In this\narticle, we generalize the notions of controllability and observability to\ntemporal hypergraphs by leveraging tensor and nonlinear systems theory.\nSpecifically, we establish tensor-based rank conditions to determine the weak\ncontrollability and observability of temporal hypergraphs. The proposed\nframework is further demonstrated with synthetic and real-world examples.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LCULqe5RUZBEZrBp1MiEwPpsX23PlrpVlvVNKHWEDq0","pdfSize":"503032"}
