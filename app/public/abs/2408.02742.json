During exchange, coupling of the qubits to a\nsurrounding phonon bath may cause errors in the resulting gate. Here, the\nfidelities of exchange operations with semiconductor double quantum dot spin\nqubits in a Si-SiGe heterostructure coupled to a finite temperature phonon bath\nare considered. By employing a master equation approach, the isolated effect of\neach spin-phonon coupling term may be resolved, as well as leakage errors of\nencoded qubit operations. As the temperature is increased, a crossover is\nobserved from where the primary source of error is due to a phonon induced\nperturbation of the two electron spin states, to one where the phonon induced\ncoupling to an excited orbital state becomes the dominant error. Additionally,\nit is shown that a simple trade-off in pulse shape and length can improve\nrobustness to spin-phonon induced errors during gate operations by up to an\norder of magnitude. Our results suggest that for elevated temperatures within\n200-300 mK, exchange gate operations are not currently limited by bulk phonons.\nThis is consistent with recent experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y3VwnAaSmeF6eQjpAFmILNOeL62O_8xK-WsqtP-YcDQ","pdfSize":"3577379","txDigest":"CDGvdNb5TnDYPh3kE2JPTgBeyHM9njZsqcQPwrJcKZoD","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
