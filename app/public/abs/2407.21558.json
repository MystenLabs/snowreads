Upcoming LHC\nrunning stages will allow to measure these processes at unprecedented accuracy\nand for all possible final states, which requires to push theory predictions to\nstill unexplored frontiers. In this work we present the first calculation for\nthe process ${\\rm p}{\\rm p}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-{\\rm e}^+\\nu_{\\rm e}\\,{\\rm j}\\,{\\rm j}$\nat the LHC in a tri-boson phase space. We evaluate the three LO contributions,\nnamely the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^6)$, which contains the genuine tri-boson\nsignature, along with the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{\\rm s}\\alpha^5)$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{\\rm s}^2\\alpha^4)$, and the two $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^7)$\nand $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{\\rm s}\\alpha^6)$ NLO corrections. The calculation is\nbased on full Standard-Model matrix elements, including all resonant and\nnon-resonant terms, complete spin correlations and interference effects.\nIntegrated and differential cross sections are presented for a fiducial region\ninspired by High Luminosity LHC prospect studies. We find electroweak\ncorrections of $-14\\%$ for the fiducial cross section, almost twice as large as\nfor other tri-boson processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
