Despite being very flexible and invariant these geometrical objects\nare usually infinite-dimensional and are difficult to define explicitly, just\nlike standard infinitely-prolonged PDEs. We propose a notion of a weak gauge\nPDE where the nilpotency of the BRST differential is relaxed in a controllable\nway. In this approach a nontopological local gauge theory can be described in\nterms of a finite-dimensional geometrical object. Moreover, among such objects\none can find a minimal one which is unique in a certain sense. In the case of a\nLagrangian system, the respective weak gauge PDE naturally arise from its weak\npresymplectic formulation. We prove that any weak gauge PDE determines the\nstandard jet-bundle BV formulation of the underlying gauge theory, giving an\nunambiguous physical interpretation of these objects. The formalism is\nillustrated by a few examples including the non-Lagrangian self-dual Yang-Mills\ntheory. We also discuss possible applications of the approach to\ncharacterisation of those infinite-dimensional gauge PDEs which correspond to\nlocal theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Oqteaacq5YGj86Db8srxc8Hi1mUEqVbNayrfWnxDXN0","pdfSize":"275874"}
