While this representation is\napplicable for rigid core platforms, particles consisting of soft platforms\n(e.g. micelles, polymers, elastomers, lipids) inevitably deform upon\napplication of external stress. We introduce a generic model for flexible\nparticles which we call MetaParticles (MP). These particles have tunable\nproperties, can respond to applied tension and can deform. A metaparticle is\nrepresented as a collection of Lennard-Jones beads interconnected by\nspring-like potentials. We model a series of metaparticles of variable sizes\nand symmetries, which we subject to external stress followed by relaxation upon\nstress release. The positions and the orientations of the individual beads are\npropagated by Brownian dynamics. The simulations show that the mechanical\nproperties of the metaparticles vary with size, bead arrangement and area of\napplied stress, and share an elastomer-like response to applied stress.\nFurthermore, metaparticles deform following different mechanisms, i.e., small\nMPs change shape in one step, while larger ones follow a multi-step deformation\npathway, with internal rearrangements of the beads. This model is the first\nstep towards the development and understanding of particles with adaptable\nproperties with biomedical applications and in the design of bioinspired\nmetamaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
