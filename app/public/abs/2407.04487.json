The multiplicity spectra were analyzed within the\nframework of a Moving Source Disentangling Analysis (MSDA) to determine\ncontributions from different emission stages. The MSDA conclusively shows\n``Near Scission Emission (NSE)\" as an essential component in the multiplicity\nspectra. In contrast to NSE $\\alpha$ particles which emit mainly perpendicular\n(``equatorial emission\"), the NSE protons are observed to be emitted\nperpendicular as well as parallel (``polar emission\") to the fission axis with\nsimilar intensities ($\\sim$20\\% for each). Thus, around 40\\% of total\npre-scission protons are emitted near the scission stage, whereas the same\nfraction for $\\alpha$ particles is only around 10\\%. The inevitable presence of\n``polar\" and ``equatorial\" NSE protons in a heavy-ion induced fission has been\nobserved for the first time. Present results open up a new avenue to study the\nheavy-ion induced fission dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
