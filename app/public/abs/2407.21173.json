We moreover prove that the Hilbert scheme of\ntwo points on such a surface $X$ is an irreducible symplectic variety, at least\nin the case where the smooth locus of $X$ is simply connected.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
