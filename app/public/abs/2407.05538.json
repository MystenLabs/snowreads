In this paper, we provide a translation from Normal Logic\nPrograms (NLPs) to SETAFs and vice versa, from SETAFs to NLPs. We show that\nthere is pairwise equivalence between their semantics, including the\nequivalence between L-stable and semi-stable semantics. Furthermore, for a\nclass of NLPs called Redundancy-Free Atomic Logic Programs (RFALPs), there is\nalso a structural equivalence as these back-and-forth translations are each\nother's inverse. Then, we show that RFALPs are as expressive as NLPs by\ntransforming any NLP into an equivalent RFALP through a series of program\ntransformations already known in the literature. We also show that these\nprogram transformations are confluent, meaning that every NLP will be\ntransformed into a unique RFALP. The results presented in this paper enhance\nour understanding that NLPs and SETAFs are essentially the same formalism.\nUnder consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BHr2_gUU6pCEZvNJwO_ZKspCp2zATd6ZOM-0H_Blf8w","pdfSize":"532847"}
