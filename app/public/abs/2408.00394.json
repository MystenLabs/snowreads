Further, we have explored the evaluation\nof the CP violating parameter \\epsilon_k for the 9 possible unitarity ensured\nequivalent independent parametrizations of CKM matrix. Interestingly, we find\nthat not all of these reproduce the value of parameter \\epsilon_k, this being\npresumably due to the hierarchical nature of the CKM matrix elements. This\nsituation is echoing similar conclusions regarding the evaluation of Jarlskog's\nrephasing invariant parameter J through unitarity ensured equivalent\npossibilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IiiZ4CxDPlKSgM36K4ALJNtvGEeAohDoUJpYXTuXE1w","pdfSize":"145518","txDigest":"UrXzNHcsxZ1G2pYoWbVDucuqFV8qQEGmUcmDUSsu45S","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
