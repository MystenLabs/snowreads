The class of quasi-integrable models,\ndiscussed in the literature, inherits some of the integrable properties they\nare associated with. Our strategy, to investigate the problem through a\ndeformation of the so-called inverse scattering method, has proven to be useful\nin the discussion of generic nonlinear Klein-Gordon potentials, as well as in\nparticular cases presented here.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
