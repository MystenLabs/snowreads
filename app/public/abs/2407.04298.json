Furthermore, the paper examines the curvature in the context of\nfiberwise hermitian flat cases, families of Hermite-Einstein vector bundles,\nand applications to moduli spaces and Weil-Petersson metrics, providing some\ninsight into their geometric and analytical properties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
