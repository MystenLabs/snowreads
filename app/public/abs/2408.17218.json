Because of this trapping, the gap\nasymmetry can contribute to maintaining the quasiparticles out of equilibrium.\nHere we address the temperature evolution of the quasiparticle densities in the\ntwo sides of the junction. We show that four qualitatively different regimes\nare possible with increasing temperature: i) nonequilibrium, ii) local\nquasiequilibrium, iii) global quasiequilibrium, and iv) full equilibrium. We\nidentify shortcomings in assuming global quasiequilibrium when interpreting\nexperimental data, highlighting how measurements in the presence of magnetic\nfield can aid the accurate determination of the junction parameters, and hence\nthe identification of the nonequilibrium regimes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
