However, so far, no vdW crystal has exhibited\ntunable above-room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism in the 2D ultrathin\nregime. Here, we report the tunable above-room-temperature intrinsic\nferromagnetism in ultrathin vdW crystal Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$ ($x$ = 0 and 0.3).\nBy increasing the Fe content, the Curie temperature (TC) and room-temperature\nsaturation magnetization of bulk Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$ crystals are enhanced from\n354 to 376 K and 43.9 to 50.4 emu/g, respectively. Remarkably, the robust\nanomalous Hall effect in 3-nm Fe$_{3.3}$GaTe$_2$ indicate a record-high TC of\n340 K and a large room-temperature perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy of\n6.6 * 10^5 J/m$^3$, superior to other ultrathin vdW ferromagnets.\nFirst-principles calculations reveal the asymmetric density of states and an\nadditional large spin exchange interaction in ultrathin Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$\nresponsible for robust intrinsic ferromagnetism and higher Tc. This work opens\na window for above-room-temperature ultrathin 2D magnets in vdW-integrated\nspintronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"zE7NjNj7-17fLWHdG4-uBjRfDwr3SGiWLgoheSfmVV0","pdfSize":"1975872","txDigest":"7hbprKj1QtWzhkiub4kUM7b4q1h3fiM9gXHrCMWHsEpA","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
