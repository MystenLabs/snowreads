As passengers in these vehicles,\nhumans' sensory perception and decision-making can be integrated with\nautonomous systems to improve safety. This study explores neural mechanisms in\npassenger-vehicle interactions, leading to the development of a Passenger\nCognitive Model (PCM) and the Passenger EEG Decoding Strategy (PEDS). Central\nto PEDS is a novel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that captures\nspatial and temporal EEG data patterns. The CRNN, combined with stacking\nalgorithms, achieves an accuracy of $85.0\\% \\pm 3.18\\%$. Our findings highlight\nthe predictive power of pre-event EEG data, enhancing the detection of\nhazardous scenarios and offering a network-driven framework for safer\nautonomous vehicles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
