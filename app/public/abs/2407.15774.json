We relate this concept with the fractal structure\nof the phase space and the H\\\"older regularity of the map. Afterwards we\nimprove our general estimates in a family of interval maps by computing the\nmetric mean dimension in a way similar to the Misiurewicz formula for the\nentropy, which in particular shows that our bounds are sharp. Of independent\ninterest, we develop a dynamical analogue of Minkowski-Bouligand dimension for\nmaps acting on Ahlfors regular spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SCpHBYTiOAGTc7uq6f08xSXxECL8JW1MMd5IJcIM0q4","pdfSize":"496844"}
