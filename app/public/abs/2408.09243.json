Tachyonic instabilities are identified as\nthe driving mechanism for scalar cloud formation. Employing the spectral\nmethod, we numerically compute wave functions and parameter space existence\ndomains for both fundamental and excited scalar cloud modes. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that black hole spin imposes an upper limit on the existence of\nscalar clouds, with excited modes requiring stronger tachyonic instabilities\nfor their formation. These findings lay the groundwork for exploring the\nnonlinear dynamics and astrophysical implications of scalar clouds.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
