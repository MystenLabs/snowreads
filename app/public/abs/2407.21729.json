A representative local search solver for PBO is LSPBO. In this paper,\nfirstly, we improve LSPBO by a dynamic scoring mechanism, which dynamically\nstrikes a balance between score on hard constraints and score on the objective\nfunction.\n  Moreover, on top of this improved LSPBO , we develop the first parallel local\nsearch PBO solver. The main idea is to share good solutions among different\nthreads to guide the search, by maintaining a pool of feasible solutions. For\nevaluating solutions when updating the pool, we propose a function that\nconsiders both the solution quality and the diversity of the pool. Furthermore,\nwe calculate the polarity density in the pool to enhance the scoring function\nof local search. Our empirical experiments show clear benefits of the proposed\nparallel approach, making it competitive with the parallel version of the\nfamous commercial solver Gurobi.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
