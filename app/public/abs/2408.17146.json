Two sparse\naperture masks (SAM) will be included, consisting of opaque masks with a set of\nholes arranged in a non-redundant configuration. Pupil masking transforms a\nmonolithic telescope into an interferometer, with the aim of recovering spatial\ninformation down to the diffraction limit of the telescope and below, even in\nthe presence of residual aberrations, such as turbulent AO residuals, and non\ncommon path aberrations. On the ELT, SAM will enable the detection of features\ndown to 3.3mas in the J band, 12mas in the K band. Two designs have been chosen\nand will be reviewed, with complementarity in terms of sensitivity and spatial\nfrequency coverage for image reconstruction. In this contribution, the\ntechnical choices will be detailed, such as the hole diameter and arrangement,\ngiven the technical constraints such as spectral filter bandwidths, detector\ndimensions, sampling, read-out-noise and frame rate. We will also report on\nsimulations performed to assess the expected capabilities of this mode, with\napplication examples of close companion detection and contrast curves.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
