Utilizing the Nielsen approach, we\ndetermine the complexity of thermofield double states as functions of time,\ntemperature, and cyclotron frequency. We analyze both the complexity and the\namplitude of its oscillations across various parameter values, and reveal that\nthese results cannot be derived as a limit of the harmonic oscillator case.\nFinally, we calculate the rate of complexity and show that it obeys the Lloyd\nbound.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
