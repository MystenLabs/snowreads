The function mediating the relation is increasing and convex, and\ndepends on the switching time $\\tau$, driving strength\n$\\delta\\lambda/\\lambda_0$, and protocol $g(t)$. The result is corroborated by\nan example of an overdamped white noise Brownian motion subjected to a moving\nlaser harmonic trap. Observing also that the fluctuation-optimization theorem\nis an Euler-Lagrange equation, I conclude that the function minimizing $\\langle\nh(-\\beta W)\\rangle$ obeys the relation proposed. The optimal work can now be\ncalculated with numerical methods without knowing the optimal protocol, using\nonly a work distribution of an arbitrary protocol.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
