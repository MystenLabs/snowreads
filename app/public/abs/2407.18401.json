The role of a third\nparty is similar to industry associations, they supervise the leader's\nimplementation and impose penalties for the defection with the discount factor.\nThen we obtain different forms of discount factors in different models and\neffective conditions to prevent defection.These results are consistent and the\nthird party intervention is effective and maneuverable in practice.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
