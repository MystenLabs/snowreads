Let $y:= y(p)$ be the probability that the\nroot of an infinite $d$-regular tree belongs to an infinite cluster after\n$p$-bond-percolation. We show that for every constants $b,\\alpha>0$ and\n$1<\\lambda< d-1$, there exist constants $c,C>0$ such that the following holds.\nLet $G$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, satisfying that for every\n$U\\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|\\le \\frac{n}{2}$, $e(U,U^c)\\ge b|U|$ and for every\n$U\\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|\\le \\log^Cn$, $e(U)\\le (1+c)|U|$. Let\n$p=\\frac{\\lambda}{d-1}$. Then, with probability tending to one as $n$ tends to\ninfinity, the largest component $L_1$ in the random subgraph $G_p$ of $G$\nsatisfies $\\left|1-\\frac{|L_1|}{yn}\\right|\\le \\alpha$, and all the other\ncomponents in $G_p$ are of order $O\\left(\\frac{\\lambda\\log\nn}{(\\lambda-1)^2}\\right)$. This generalises (and improves upon) results for\nrandom $d$-regular graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
