The entries of the matrix relate to an\nexpected quantification of interaction between two objects: the higher the\nvalue, the closer the objects. A popular structured class for modelling such\nmatrices is the permuted Robinson class, namely the set of matrices whose\ncoefficients are decreasing away from its diagonal, up to a permutation of its\nlines and columns. We consider in this paper two submodels of Robinson\nmatrices: the T{\\oe}plitz model, and the latent position model. We provide a\ncomputational lower bound based on the low-degree paradigm, which hints that\nthere is a statistical-computational gap for seriation when measuring the error\nbased on the Frobenius norm. We also provide a simple and polynomial-time\nalgorithm that achives this lower bound. Along the way, we also characterize\nthe information-theory optimal risk thereby giving evidence for the extent of\nthe computation/information gap for this problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wJiPSVrVFmnuIsKyBiAhC5xUCJe2z09iOOL-wOSOSsQ","pdfSize":"778153"}
