We introduce a simplified class of\nlaminations called finite dynamical laminations (FDL). In order to count FDL,\nwe introduce sibling portraits, of which we provide a comprehensive counting\ntheorem. We introduce the pullback tree, and show that all FDL have a child in\nit. This gives a characterization of which periodic polygons appear in\ninvariant laminations. The base of the pullback tree is a set of laminations,\nand we show that those laminations have very nice properties. We define the\ngenerational FDL graph, and it provides a summary of the combinatorial\ninformation we provide about polynomial parameter space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
