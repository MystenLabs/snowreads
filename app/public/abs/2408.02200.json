Once turbulence is established, we characterize the progressive\nclustering of the vortices, showing that the cluster number follows a power law\ndecay with time, similar to decaying turbulence in other two-dimensional\nsystems. Numerical study of the system demonstrates good agreement of the\nexperimental data with a point vortex model that includes damping and noise.\nWith increasing vortex number in the computational model, we observe a\nconvergence of the power-law exponent to a fixed value.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
