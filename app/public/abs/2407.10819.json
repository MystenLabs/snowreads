The ATLAS trigger\nsystem selected roughly 1 kHz of these bunch crossings to be recorded to disk.\nOffline algorithms then identify one of the recorded collisions as the\ncollision of interest for subsequent data analysis, and the remaining\ncollisions are referred to as pile-up. Pile-up collisions represent a\ntrigger-unbiased dataset, which is evaluated to have an integrated luminosity\nof 1.33 pb$^{-1}$ in 2015-2018. This is small compared with the normal\ntrigger-based ATLAS dataset, but when combined with vertex-by-vertex jet\nreconstruction it provides up to 50 times more dijet events than the\nconventional single-jet-trigger-based approach, and does so without adding any\nadditional cost or requirements on the trigger system, readout, or storage. The\npile-up dataset is validated through comparisons with a special\ntrigger-unbiased dataset recorded by ATLAS, and its utility is demonstrated\nthrough a measurement of the jet energy resolution in dijet events, where the\nstatistical uncertainty is significantly reduced for jet transverse momenta\nbelow 65 GeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sGQ78VZxBEwtdtP-hXtNugMXynAwX4TEW4Y6GkySvYg","pdfSize":"3226318"}
