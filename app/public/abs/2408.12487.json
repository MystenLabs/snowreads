These notions are the two components of the definition of a\nharmonic map of finite uniton number, as stated by [2]. We finish this paper by\ncomparing these to notions and by stating a conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
