We describe the \"algebraic hull\" of a point in H^n\nand prove it is a product of spheres. Using this description we give a new\nproof to a conjecture of Gori, Sarfatti and Vlacci. We also show that the main\nresult of [2] does not extend to general division algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
