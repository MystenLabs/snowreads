Like recent vector retrieval approaches, Neurocache uses an\nefficient k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) algorithm to retrieve relevant past states\nand incorporate them into the attention process. Neurocache improves upon\nprevious methods by (1) storing compressed states, which reduces cache size;\n(2) performing a single retrieval operation per token which increases inference\nspeed; and (3) extending the retrieval window to neighboring states, which\nimproves both language modeling and downstream task accuracy. Our experiments\nshow the effectiveness of Neurocache both for models trained from scratch and\nfor pre-trained models such as Llama2-7B and Mistral-7B when enhanced with the\ncache mechanism. We also compare Neurocache with text retrieval methods and\nshow improvements in single-document question-answering and few-shot learning\ntasks.
