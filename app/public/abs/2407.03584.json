By employing various physical\nsituations of interest, we present results for the environment temperature and\nsystem-environment coupling strength. We consider the spin-spin model whereby a\nprobe (a small controllable quantum system) interacts with a bath of quantum\nspins and attains a thermal equilibrium state. A projective measurement is then\nperformed to prepare the initial state and allow it to evolve unitarily. The\nproperties of the environment are imprinted upon the dynamics of the probe. The\nreduced density matrix of the probe state contains a modified decoherence\nfactor and dissipation. This additional factor acts in such a way to improve\nthe estimation of the environment parameters, as quantified by the quantum\nFisher information (QFI). In the temperature estimation case, our results are\npromising as one can improve the precision of the estimates by orders of\nmagnitude by incorporating the effect of initial correlations. The precision\nincreases in the strong coupling regime even if the nearest neighbours'\ninteraction is taken into account. In the case of coupling strength,\ninterestingly the accuracy was found to be continuously increasing in both with\nand without correlations cases. More importantly, one can see the noticeable\nrole of correlations in improving precision, especially at low temperatures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
