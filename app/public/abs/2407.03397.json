These analyses assess the significance of the parity-odd four-point\ncorrelation function (4PCF) with a statistic called $\\chi^2$. This statistic is\nbiased if the parity-even eight-point correlation function (8PCF) of the data\ndiffers from the mock catalogs. We construct new statistics $\\chi^2_\\times$,\n$\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{null}}$ that separate the parity violation signal from the\n8PCF bias term, allowing them to be jointly constrained. Applying these\nstatistics to BOSS, we find that the parity violation signal ranges from $0$ to\n$2.5\\sigma$ depending on analysis choices, whereas the 8PCF bias term is $\\sim\n6\\sigma$. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for parity violation\nin BOSS. Our new statistics can be used to search for parity violation in\nfuture surveys, such as DESI, without 8PCF biases.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
