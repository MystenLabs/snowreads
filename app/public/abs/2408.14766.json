These researchers, as well as the data holders\nthemselves, may be ethically and perhaps legally obligated to protect the\nconfidentiality of study participants' data. It is now known that releasing any\nstatistics, including estimates of causal effects, computed with confidential\ndata leaks information about the underlying data values. Thus, analysts may\ndesire to use causal estimators that can provably bound this information\nleakage. Motivated by this goal, we develop algorithms for estimating weighted\naverage treatment effects with binary outcomes that satisfy the criterion of\ndifferential privacy. We present theoretical results on the accuracy of several\ndifferentially private estimators of weighted average treatment effects. We\nillustrate the empirical performance of these estimators using simulated data\nand a causal analysis using data on education and income.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WOUTD1COeLCi8QEwsv1nJFLQWDeGegrHpvXqUlRs_JA","pdfSize":"563409"}
