Quantum digital signatures (QDS) offer an\ninformation-theoretically secure solution for ensuring data integrity,\nauthenticity, and non-repudiation, rapidly growing from proof-of-concept to\nrobust demonstrations. However, previous QDS systems relied on expensive and\nbulky optical equipment, limiting large-scale deployment and reconfigurable\nnetworking construction. Here, we introduce and verify a chip-based QDS\nnetwork, placing the complicated and expensive measurement devices in the\ncentral relay while each user needs only a low-cost transmitter. We demonstrate\nthe network with a three-node setup using an integrated encoder chip and\ndecoder chip. By developing a 1-decoy-state one-time universal hash-QDS\nprotocol, we achieve a maximum signature rate of 0.0414 times per second for a\n1 Mbit file over fiber distances up to 200 km, surpassing all current\nstate-of-the-art QDS experiments. This study validates the feasibility of\nchip-based QDS, paving the way for large-scale deployment and integration with\nexisting fiber infrastructure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
