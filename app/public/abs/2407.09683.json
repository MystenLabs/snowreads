This situation is somewhat problematic, because the validity of the SETH\nis not universally believed and because in some senses the SETH seems to be\n\"too strong\" a hypothesis for the considered lower bounds. Motivated by this,\nwe consider a number of reasonable weakenings of the SETH that render it more\nplausible, with sources ranging from circuit complexity, to backdoors for\nSAT-solving, to graph width parameters, to weighted satisfiability problems.\nDespite the diversity of the different formulations, we are able to uncover\nseveral non-obvious connections using tools from classical complexity theory.\nThis leads us to a hierarchy of five main equivalence classes of hypotheses,\nwith some of the highlights being the following:\n  We show that beating brute force search for SAT parameterized by a modulator\nto a graph of bounded pathwidth, or bounded treewidth, or logarithmic\ntree-depth, is actually the same question, and is in fact equivalent to beating\nbrute force for circuits of depth $\\epsilon n$; we show that beating brute\nforce search for a strong 2-SAT backdoor is equivalent to beating brute force\nsearch for a modulator to logarithmic pathwidth; we show that beting brute\nforce search for a strong Horn backdoor is equivalent to beating brute force\nsearch for arbitrary circuit SAT.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
