{"id":"2407.14660","title":"More on the sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function","authors":"Claude Carlet and Xiang-dong Hou","authorsParsed":[["Carlet","Claude",""],["Hou","Xiang-dong",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 20:46:52 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-23","timestamp":1721422012000,"abstract":"  In two papers entitled ``Two generalizations of almost perfect nonlinearity\"\nand ``On the vector subspaces of $\\mathbb F_{2^n}$ over which the\nmultiplicative inverse function sums to zero\", the first author has introduced\nand studied the notion of sum-freedom of vectorial functions, which expresses\nthat a function sums to nonzero values over all affine subspaces of $\\Bbb\nF_{2^n}$ of a given dimension $k\\geq 2$, and he then focused on the $k$th order\nsum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $x\\in \\Bbb F_{2^n}\\mapsto\nx^{2^n-2}$. Some general results were given for this function (in particular,\nthe case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the\ncases of $k\\in \\{3,n-3\\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well\n(negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\\in [\\![\n4;n-4]\\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a\ncontinuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles,\nthe particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the\nFrobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small\nenough (approximately, $3\\le k\\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function\nis not $k$th order sum-free. Finally, we extend a result previously obtained in\nthe second paper mentioned above, and we deduce in particular that, for any\neven $n$ and every $2\\leq k\\leq n-2$, the multiplicative inverse function is\nnot $k$th order sum-free.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
