Examples of twistorial theories include\nself-dual Yang-Mills theory coupled to special massless matter content, and\ncertain form factors in these theories are equivalent to a subset of MHV\namplitudes in massless QCD, coupled to the same matter. In this paper, we\nextend the chiral algebra bootstrap to include scattering in the presence of\ncharged sources, using a self-dual dyon in a twistorial theory as our main\nexample. Self-dual theories in the presence of such sources lift to holomorphic\ngauge theories on non-Hausdorff twistor space, and we generalize the Koszul\nduality construction of Costello and Paquette to this setting. With this\napproach, we easily reproduce a recent formula of Adamo, Bogna, Mason, and\nSharma for $n$-point MHV scattering of gluons off the self-dual dyon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
