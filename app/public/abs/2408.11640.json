The coarse-graining is achieved by\ndiscarding wave numbers larger than a cutoff $\\sigma H$ and demanding that\n$\\sigma \\ll 1$. Similar results hold for quasi-dS space, where the equation of\nstate parameter $w$ is close to $-1$. Here we present exact expressions for the\nnoise amplitude of a free massless field on an inflationary background with\nconstant $w < -1/3$. We find that a classical stochastic behavior can emerge\nfor $-5/3 < w < -1/3$. Furthermore, as we move away from $w = -1$ and approach\n$w = -1/3$, the constraint $\\sigma \\ll 1$ is relaxed and larger cutoffs\n($\\sigma \\sim 1$) become feasible, too. However, in general the amplitude of\nthe noise depends on $\\sigma$, except in the quasi-dS regime $w \\approx -1$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
