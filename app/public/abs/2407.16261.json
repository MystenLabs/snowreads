The main theorem on the GFF generalizes previous results of similar\nflavour and the characterisation theorems on the FGFs are new. The proof\nstrategy is to link the resampling dynamics coming from a martingale-type of\ndecomposition property to the stationary dynamics of the desired field, i.e. to\nthe (fractional) stochastic heat equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
