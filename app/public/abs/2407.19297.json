Traditionally, distinguishing\nthese blends from single stars has been costly and resource-intensive,\ninvolving sophisticated equipment and extensive expert analysis. This is\nespecially problematic for analyzing the vast data volumes from surveys, such\nas Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),\nDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Legacy Imaging Survey and the\nZwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). To address these challenges, we apply\ndifferent normalizations and data embeddings on low resolution images of single\nstars and stellar blends, which are passed as inputs into machine learning\nmethods and to a computationally efficient Gaussian process model (MuyGPs).\nMuyGPs consistently outperforms the benchmarked models, particularly on limited\ntraining data. Moreover, MuyGPs with $r^\\text{th}$ root local min-max\nnormalization achieves 83.8% accuracy. Furthermore, MuyGPs' ability to produce\nconfidence bands ensures that predictions with low confidence can be redirected\nto a specialist for efficient human-assisted labeling.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mRsOq1QKeFeX05PHK4MKSkrobw2i_GpGpxbqGc_U7ng","pdfSize":"7212332"}
