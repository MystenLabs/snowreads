Among such quantum algorithms,\nanomaly detection represents an important problem crossing several disciplines\nfrom cybersecurity, to fraud detection to particle physics. We summarize the\nkey concepts involved in quantum computing, introducing the formal concept of\nquantum speed up. The survey provides a structured map of anomaly detection\nbased on quantum machine learning. We have grouped existing algorithms\naccording to the different learning methods, namely quantum supervised, quantum\nunsupervised and quantum reinforcement learning, respectively. We provide an\nestimate of the hardware resources to provide sufficient computational power in\nthe future. The survey provides a systematic and compact understanding of the\ntechniques belonging to each category. We eventually provide a discussion on\nthe computational complexity of the learning methods in real application\ndomains.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
