The\ngeoeffectiveness of a CME is primarily determined by the southward component of\nits magnetic fields (CME-$B_z$). Recent studies have shown that CMEs evolve\nsignificantly in the inner heliosphere ($\\sim20-90\\ R_\\odot$), and relying on\nextrapolations from low coronal heights can lead to wrong predictions of\nCME-$B_z$ in the vicinity of Earth. Hence, it is important to measure CME\nmagnetic fields at these heights to improve CME-$B_z$ prediction. A promising\nmethod to measure the CME-entrained magnetic field in the inner heliosphere is\nby measuring the changes in Faraday rotation (FR) of linearly polarized\nemission from background radio sources as their line-of-sight crosses the CME\nplasma. Here, we present the current preparation of new-generation ground-based\nradio telescopes for this purpose.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
