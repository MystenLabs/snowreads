No fitting to\nreference data is used, and the method is applicable to ground and excited\nstates. The formulas derived are rigorous when the physical interaction is\napproached. In this regime, the second-order expression provides a lower bound\nto the long-range full configuration interaction energy. A\nlong-range/short-range separation of the interaction between electrons at a\ndistance of the order of one atomic unit provides total energies within\nchemical accuracy, and, for the systems studied, provide better results than\nshort-range density functional approximations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
