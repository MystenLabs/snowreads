In the dilepton decay mode, multivariate analyses of\nspin and colour observables could provide evidence that an excess of events\npresent near the $t \\bar t$ threshold corresponds to a spin-zero colour\nsinglet. The semileptonic decay mode may also exhibit an excess near threshold,\nbut is not expected to play any role in the toponium characterisation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
