Probabilistic circuits (PCs)\noffer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be\nanalyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via\nnegative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially\nmore expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In\nthis paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the\nexpressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared\nPCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel\nclass of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive\nthan both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an\nexpressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate\ndifferent tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and\nother recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex\nparameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares\ncircuits in performing distribution estimation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ea4xRGIPrCE6iAe-prquiWAoQVFR2HnveisUQVANtsc","pdfSize":"1729651"}
