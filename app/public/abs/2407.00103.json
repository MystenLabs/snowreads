A domatic partition is a\npartition of the vertices of a graph $G$ into disjoint dominating sets. The\ndomatic number $d(G)$ is the maximum size of a domatic partition. Suppose that\n$dp(G,i)$ is the number of distinct domatic partition of $G$ with cardinality\n$i$. In this paper, we consider the generating function of $dp(G,i)$, i.e.,\n$DP(G,x)=\\sum_{i=1}^{d(G)}dp(G,i)x^i$ which we call it the domatic partition\npolynomial. We explore the domatic polynomial for trees, providing a quadratic\ntime algorithm for its computation based on weak 2-coloring numbers. Our\nresults include specific findings for paths and certain graph products,\ndemonstrating practical applications of our theoretical framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
