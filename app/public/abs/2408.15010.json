Some useful relations and\nproperties, concluding differential equation and generating function, are\npresented. Further, a new family of finite biorthogonal functions is obtained\nusing Fourier transform and Parseval identity. In addition, we compute the\nLaplace transform and fractional calculus operators for polynomials\n$M_{n}(p,q,\\upsilon;x)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
