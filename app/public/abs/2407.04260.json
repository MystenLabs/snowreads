Its formulation is nonconvex and it is faced with highly\ncorrupted measurements. Cycle consistency has been effective in addressing\nthese challenges. However, computationally efficient solutions are needed for\ncycles longer than three, especially in practical scenarios where 3-cycles are\nunavailable. To overcome this computational bottleneck, we propose an algorithm\nfor group synchronization that leverages information from cycles of lengths\nranging from three to six with a time complexity of order $O(n^3)$ (or\n$O(n^{2.373})$ when using a faster matrix multiplication algorithm). We\nestablish non-trivial theory for this and related methods that achieves\ncompetitive sample complexity, assuming the uniform corruption model. To\nadvocate the practical need for our method, we consider distributed group\nsynchronization, which requires at least 4-cycles, and we illustrate\nstate-of-the-art performance by our method in this context.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
