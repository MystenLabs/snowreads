Enabling real-time\ndecision-making for such systems is critical to respond to dynamic changes in\nthe environment. We focus on dynamic target tracking in open areas using a\nrobotic six-degree-of-freedom manipulator with a bird-eye view camera for\nvisual feedback, and by deploying the Neurodynamical Computational Framework\n(NeuCF). NeuCF is a recently developed bio-inspired model for target tracking\nbased on Dynamic Neural Fields (DNFs) and Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC)\ntheory. It has been trained for reaching actions on a planar surface toward\nlocalized visual beacons, and it can re-target or generate stop signals on the\nfly based on changes in the environment (e.g., a new target has emerged, or an\nexisting one has been removed). We evaluated our system over various\ntarget-reaching scenarios. In all experiments, NeuCF had high end-effector\npositional accuracy, generated smooth trajectories, and provided reduced path\nlengths compared with a baseline cubic polynomial trajectory generator. In all,\nthe developed system offers a robust and dynamic-aware robotic manipulation\napproach that affords real-time decision-making.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
