However, current VBTS designs, typically confined to the\nfingertips of robotic grippers, prove somewhat inadequate, as many grasping and\nmanipulation tasks require multiple contact points with the object. With an end\ngoal of enabling large-scale, multi-surface tactile sensing via VBTSs, our\nresearch (i) develops a synchronized image acquisition system with minimal\nlatency,(ii) proposes a modularized VBTS design for easy integration into\nfinger phalanges, and (iii) devises a zero-shot calibration approach to improve\ndata efficiency in the simultaneous calibration of multiple VBTSs. In\nvalidating the system within a miniature 3-fingered robotic gripper equipped\nwith 7 VBTSs we demonstrate improved tactile perception performance by covering\nthe contact surfaces of both gripper fingers and palm. Additionally, we show\nthat our VBTS design can be seamlessly integrated into various end-effector\nmorphologies significantly reducing the data requirements for calibration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
