As RLHF models become agent models aimed at interacting\nwith humans, they seem to lose their world modeling -- the ability to predict\nwhat comes next in arbitrary documents, which is the foundational training\nobjective of the Base LMs that RLHF adapts.\n  Besides empirically demonstrating this trade-off, we propose a potential\nexplanation: to perform coherent long-form generation, RLHF models restrict\nrandomness via implicit blueprints. In particular, RLHF models concentrate\nprobability on sets of anchor spans that co-occur across multiple generations\nfor the same prompt, serving as textual scaffolding but also limiting a model's\nability to generate documents that do not include these spans. We study this\ntrade-off on the most effective current agent models, those aligned with RLHF,\nwhile exploring why this may remain a fundamental trade-off between models that\nact and those that predict, even as alignment techniques improve.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
