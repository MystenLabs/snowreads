For any quantum channel acting for any finite time\nperiod, we propose measures of P-indivisibility and CP-indivisibility, where P\nand CP stand for positivity and complete positivity respectively. Subsequently,\nwe also propose two quantities to measure the resourcefulness - with respect to\nan arbitrary quantum resource - of any quantum channel within any finite time\ninterval. Moreover, we find a bridge between these two classes of metrics, viz.\nthose quantifying divisibilities of quantum channels and those gauging their\nresourcefulness, by identifying two separate relations between elements of one\nclass with those of the other. Lastly, we verify the two relations using\nquantum non-Markovianity as a channel resource.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
