Existing literature considers\ndistributed coordination among modules so that they collectively form a single\nMRS. In this paper, we consider distributed coordination for two MRSs. We first\npresent a rendezvous algorithm that makes the two MRSs gather so that each\nmodule can observe all the other modules. Then, we present a merge algorithm\nthat makes the two MRSs assemble and establish connectivity after rendezvous is\nfinished. These two algorithms assume that each MRS consists of five modules,\nthat do not have a common coordinate system. Finally, we show that five modules\nfor each MRS is necessary to solve the rendezvous problem. To the best of our\nknowledge, our result is the first result on distributed coordination of\nmultiple MRSs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
