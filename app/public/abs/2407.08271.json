We begin by illustrating that using a GP model with parameters\nselected by maximum likelihood often results in predictions that are not\noptimally calibrated. CP methods can adjust the prediction intervals, leading\nto better uncertainty quantification while maintaining the accuracy of the\nunderlying GP model. We compare different CP variants and introduce a novel\nvariant based on an asymmetric score. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CP methods in improving calibration without compromising\naccuracy. This work aims to facilitate the adoption of CP methods in the GP\ncommunity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
