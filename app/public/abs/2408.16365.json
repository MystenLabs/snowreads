Although their belief propagation (BP)\nperformance is proved to approach capacity in the asymptotic regime, there is\nno evidence indicating that their BP performance is as good as expected in the\nfinite-length regime. In this paper, we propose a protograph-based construction\nfor BNCs, referred to as protograph-based BNCs (P-BNCs), which significantly\ndiffers from existing BNCs in three aspects: 1) Unlike traditional\nconstructions where the degree of variable nodes is random, P-BNCs have a\nhighly structured Tanner graph with specified degree distributions for both\nvariable nodes and check nodes. 2) Traditional BNCs use a fixed degree\ndistribution to generate all batches, making their performance highly sensitive\nto channel conditions, but P-BNCs achieve good performance under varying\nchannel conditions due to their rate-compatible structures. 3) The construction\nof PBNCs takes into account joint BP decoding with a sparse precode, whereas\ntraditional constructions typically do not consider a precode, or assume the\npresence of a precode that can recover a certain fraction of erasures. Thanks\nto these three improvements, P-BNCs not only have higher achievable rates under\nvarying channel conditions, but more importantly, their finite-length BP\nperformance is significantly improved.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
