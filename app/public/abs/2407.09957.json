CPV arises from the new superpotential\ncouplings in the (s)neutrino sector, which can be complex and the mixing of\nCP-eigenstates induced by those couplings. CPV leads to asymmetries in so\ncalled T-odd observables, but we argue that such asymmetries also lead to a\nwider distribution of those observables. We look at a final state where a\nsneutrino decays to a lepton, two jets and missing transverse momentum at the\nFuture Circular Collider operating in hadron-hadron mode at $100$ TeV and with\na luminosity of 3~ab$^{-1}$. In order to exclude the CP conserving scenario we\nneed to improve traditional analysis by introducing boosted decision trees\nusing both standard kinematic variables and T-odd observables and we need\n$Z^{\\prime}$ boson not too much above current bounds as a portal to produce\nsneutrinos efficiently.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LzCtXhGuoXTKSqsEbf_wl2XQxYlZIhlxc4QYj77u0TI","pdfSize":"1046546"}
