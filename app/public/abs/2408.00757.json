Using three-dimensional Newtonian\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulations, we investigate the possibility of a\nmagnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity. Rather than solely\ncontinuously feeding the binary through spiral accretion streams, the accretion\nis regulated by the strong magnetic field inside the cavity. Transport of mass\nand angular momentum onto the binary then proceeds largely periodically in\nmagnetic flux eruption episodes. The ejected flux tubes carry angular momentum\noutwards and away from the binary, inject hot plasma into the disk and can\nlaunch flares. This likely intermittent scenario could have potential\nimplications for the emission signatures of supermassive black hole binaries,\nand shed light onto the role magnetic fields play in the binary's orbital\nevolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
