The\nMorse potential has been optimized by adjusting parameters using the\nVariational Monte Carlo (VMC) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) type Neural\nNetworks (NN). The inverse potentials obtained from VMC and NN show almost\nidentical parameters. In VMC, all three parameters of the Morse potential are\nvaried to obtain the phase shifts, while in NN, the 3D-parameter optimization\nproblem is converted to a 1D-parameter optimization problem, thus reducing\noptimization parameters, time, and computational cost.\n  Recently, the GRANADA group published a comprehensive partial wave analysis\nof scattering data, which includes 6713 \\( np \\) phase shift data points from\n1950 to 2013. Using the final experimental data points from GRANADA, we\nobtained the parameters for the Morse potential by minimizing the mean square\nerror (MSE) as the cost function. The MSE using VMC (NN) is found to be 0.65\n(2.5) for the \\( ^1S_0 \\) state and 0.16 (0.22) for the \\( ^3S_1 \\) state.\nVarious quantum functions, such as phase \\( \\delta(r) \\), amplitude \\( A(r) \\),\nand wave function \\( u(r) \\), are described up to 5 fm with energies \\( E_{\\ell\nab} = [1-350 \\text{ MeV}] \\).\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
