Using our methods, we obtain a new\ninfinite family of optimal rank-metric codes with rank-locality, i.e. every\ncode in our family achieves the information theoretical bound for rank-metric\ncodes with rank-locality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
