Classifying an arbitrary multipartite state as\nentangled or separable -- a task referred to as the separability problem --\nposes a significant challenge, since a state can be entangled with respect to\nmany different of its partitions. We develop a certification pipeline that\nfeeds the statistics of random local measurements into a non-linear\ndimensionality reduction algorithm, to determine with respect to which\npartitions a given quantum state is entangled. After training a model on\nrandomly generated quantum states, entangled in different partitions and of\nvarying purity, we verify the accuracy of its predictions on simulated test\ndata, and finally apply it to states prepared on IBM quantum computing\nhardware.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
