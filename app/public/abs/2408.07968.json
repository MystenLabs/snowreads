Apart from the\nantiferromagnetic phase, we find a magnetically ordered phase with\nleft-left-right-right order and a gapless phase with central charge value\n$c=1$, resolving the existing contradictory results in literature regarding\nthis parameter region. In particular, the origin of the left-left-right-right\nphase is clarified based on a perturbative Luttinger liquid analysis. Using a\ncoupled-chain method, we further show that the one-dimensional (1D)\nleft-left-right-right order is able to give a quasi-1D explanation for the 2D\nstripy order of the same model on the honeycomb lattice.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
