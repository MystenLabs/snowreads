We\nredefine Group Re-identification as a process which includes pedestrian\ndetection, feature extraction, graph model construction, and graph matching.\nGroup re-identification is very challenging since it is not only interfered by\nview-point and human pose variations in the traditional re-identification\ntasks, but also suffered from the challenges in group layout change and group\nmember variation. To address the above challenges, this paper introduces a\nnovel approach which leverages the multi-granularity information inside groups\nto facilitate group re-identification. We first introduce a multi-granularity\nRe-ID process, which derives features for multi-granularity objects\n(people/people-subgroups) in a group and iteratively evaluates their\nimportances during group Re-ID, so as to handle group-wise misalignments due to\nviewpoint change and group dynamics. We further introduce a multi-order\nmatching scheme. It adaptively selects representative people/people-subgroups\nin each group and integrates the multi-granularity information from these\npeople/people-subgroups to obtain group-wise matching, hence achieving a more\nreliable matching score between groups. Experimental results on various\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
