This amounts to\nthe evaluation of the electron-positron dressing together with the Weinberg\ncompositeness condition for the positronium and the triangle-shaped diagram\nwith virtual electrons circulating in it, leading to the two-photon final\nstate. An important role is played by the positronium-electron-positron vertex,\nwhich is linked to the wave function of the para-positronium. We show how\npossible choices for the vertex function affect the $\\gamma \\gamma$ decay rate.\nOutlooks to other decay channels and to other positronia are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fpcV39SjKO88SD56d9VH7jpwLH4Qz0zUPjEmCOF1aX8","pdfSize":"1058997","objectId":"0x510324b2eb311c019f38d37959cdeb1b12af38ea3218e5690697a2d23b22a2e4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
