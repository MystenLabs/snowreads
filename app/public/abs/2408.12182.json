This would not only open\nup new possibilities for artificial spin ice geometries but also enable novel\ncoupling methods for applications. Here we demonstrate a method to engineer the\nenergy landscape of artificial spin lattices with perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy. With this, we are able to realize for the first time\nmagnetostatically-coupled 2D lattices of out-of-plane Ising spins that\nspontaneously order at room temperature on timescales that can be precisely\nengineered. We show how this property, together with straightforward electrical\ninterfacing, make this system a promising platform for reservoir computing. Our\nresults open the way to investigate the thermodynamics of out-of-plane\nmagnetostatically coupled nanomagnet arrays with novel spin ice geometries, as\nwell as to exploit such nanomagnet arrays in unconventional computing, taking\nadvantage of the adjustable temporal dynamics and strong coupling between\nnanomagnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
