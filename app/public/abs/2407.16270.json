The peak position does not depend on the laser\nfrequency, but on the binding energy and the pulse duration. The effect\noriginates from the fact that bound-continuum dipole transitions are stronger\nthan continuum-continuum ones. To clearly observe this zero-energy\nphotoelectric effect, the spectral width of the laser pulse should be\ncomparable to the binding energy of the ionized orbital, and the second\nionization potential should be larger than the photon energy. This suggests\nnegative ions as ideal candidates for corresponding experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_MFjvd-If6CggpA7urxESiNreF1_043TLpN2JfVg_ac","pdfSize":"564246"}
