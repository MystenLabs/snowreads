The proof uses the internal structure of a strongly-pure\nweight that can possibly support cuspidal cohomology and the foundational work\nof Borel, Labesse, and Schwermer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
