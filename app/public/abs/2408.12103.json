In this paper, we propose an analysis technique to\nevaluate the user's experience with the assistive systems that bypasses\nrequired assumptions: we model the assistance as a dynamical system that can be\nanalyzed using control theory techniques. We analyze the shared autonomy\nassistance algorithm and make several observations: we identify a problem with\nrunaway goal confidence and propose a system adjustment to mitigate it, we\ndemonstrate that the system inherently limits the possible actions available to\nthe user, and we show that in a simplified setting, the effect of the\nassistance is to drive the system to the convex hull of the goals and, once\nthere, add a layer of indirection between the user control and the system\nbehavior. We conclude by discussing the possible uses of this analysis for the\nfield.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
