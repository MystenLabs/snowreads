In the\ncognitive science literature, (1) learning individual episodes and rules and\n(2) learning and remembering are often both conceptualized as competing\nprocesses that necessitate separate, complementary learning systems. Inspired\nby recent research in statistical learning, we challenge these trade-offs,\nhypothesizing that they arise from capacity limitations rather than from the\ninherent incompatibility of the underlying cognitive processes. Using an\nassociative learning task, we show that one system with excess representational\ncapacity can learn and remember both episodes and rules.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dsjCBLOeqStm31YhoqXsq1NizmpRNcXndqEXDRUgUq4","pdfSize":"552680"}
