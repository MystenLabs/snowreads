It provides an in-depth analysis\nof Liquid State Machines (LSMs) and explores the adaptation of LNN\narchitectures to neuromorphic systems, highlighting the theoretical foundations\nand practical applications. We introduce a pioneering approach to image\nclassification on the CIFAR-10 dataset by implementing Liquid Neural Networks\n(LNNs) on state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware platforms. Our Loihi-2\nASIC-based architecture demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a\nremarkable accuracy of 91.3% while consuming only 213 microJoules per frame.\nThese results underscore the substantial potential of LNNs for advancing\nneuromorphic computing and establish a new benchmark for the field in terms of\nboth efficiency and accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
