Jacod and A. Shiryaev: given a c{\\`a}dl{\\`a}g process S, there is an\nequivalence between the fact that S is a semimartingale with given\ncharacteristics (B^k , C, $\\nu$) and a It{\\^o} formula type expansion of F (S),\nwhere F is a bounded function of class C2. This result connects weak solutions\nof path-dependent SDEs and related martingale problems. We extend this to the\ncase when S is a weak Dirichlet process. A second aspect of the paper consists\nin discussing some untreated features of stochastic calculus for finite\nquadratic variation processes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
