We exploit the\nexpressiveness of the PL vocabulary to deliver a precise and flexible\nspecification of ETT regulation based on system requirements and properties.\nAdditionally, we present a modified ETT regulation mechanism that provides\nformal guarantees for satisfaction/violation detection of arbitrary PL\nproperties. To validate our proposed method, we consider a convoy of vehicles\nin an adaptive cruise control scenario. In this scenario, the PL operators are\nused to encode safety properties and the ETTs are regulated accordingly, e.g.,\nif our safety metric is high there can be a higher ETT threshold, while a\nsmaller threshold is used when the system is approaching unsafe conditions.\nUnder ideal ETT regulation conditions in this safety scenario, we show that\nreductions between 41.8 - 96.3% in the number of triggered events is possible\ncompared to using a constant ETT while maintaining similar safety conditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
