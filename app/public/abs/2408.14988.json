Precise control of such methods\nis imperative to exploit the full capabilities of these quantum sensors. One\nkey element is the mitigation of deleterious effects such as parasitic paths\ndeteriorating the interferometric signal. In this work, we present the\nexperimental realization of dichroic mirror pulses for atom interferometry\nspecifically designed for higher-order Bragg diffraction. Our approach\nselectively reflects resonant atom paths into the detected interferometer\noutput, ensuring that these contribute to the signal with intent.\nSimultaneously, parasitic paths are efficiently transmitted by the mirror and\nnot directed to the relevant interferometer outputs. This method effectively\nisolates the desired interferometric signal from noise induced by unwanted\npaths. It not only demonstrates enhanced control over the atomic trajectories\nbut also represents a significant step forward in optimizing the performance of\nlight-pulse atom interferometers for high-precision applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
