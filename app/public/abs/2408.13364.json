There are many existing frameworks in educational\nsettings that have shown to be verified using empirical studies, but at times\nwe find these theories make conflicting claims or recommendations for\ninstruction. In this study, we propose a new computational model of human\nlearning, Procedural ABICAP, that reconciles the ICAP,\nKnowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI), and cognitive load theory (CLT)\nframeworks for learning procedural knowledge. ICAP assumes that constructive\nlearning generally yields better learning outcomes, while theories such as KLI\nand CLT claim that this is not always true. We suppose that one reason for this\nmay be that ICAP is primarily used for conceptual learning and is\nunderspecified as a framework for thinking about procedural learning. We show\nhow our computational model, both by design and through simulations, can be\nused to reconcile different results in the literature. More generally, we\nposition our computational model as an executable theory of learning that can\nbe used to simulate various educational settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AyHXfcc3Dy5oOykkjR7sbbMCxIHa43irqh6Oo1S7Bh0","pdfSize":"915879"}
