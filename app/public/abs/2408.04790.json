Most prior\nstudies assume each piece of the normal form is invertible, as is generic from\nan abstract viewpoint, but in applied problems one piece of the map often has\ndegenerate range, corresponding to a zero determinant. This provides\nsimplification, yet even in two dimensions the dynamics can be incredibly rich.\nThe purpose of this paper is to determine broadly how the dynamics of the\ntwo-dimensional border-collision normal form with a zero determinant differs\nfor different values of its parameters. We identify parameter regions of\nperiod-adding, period-incrementing, mode-locking, and component doubling of\nchaotic attractors, and characterise the dominant bifurcation boundaries. The\nintention is for the results to enable border-collision bifurcations in\nmathematical models to be analysed more easily and effectively, and we\nillustrate this with a flu epidemic model and two stick-slip friction\noscillator models. We also describe three novel bifurcation structures that\nremain to be explored.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
