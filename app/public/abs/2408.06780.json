{"id":"2408.06780","title":"A Sympathetic Nervous System Theory of Migraine","authors":"Ari Rappoport","authorsParsed":[["Rappoport","Ari",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 10:06:03 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-14","timestamp":1723543563000,"abstract":"  Migraine (MGR) ranks first among diseases in terms of years of lost healthy\nlife in young adult and adult women. Currently, there is no theory of MGR. This\npaper presents a complete theory of migraine that explains its etiology,\nsymptoms, pathology, and treatment. Migraine involves partially saturated\n(usually chronically high) sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, mainly\ndue to higher sensitivity of the metabolic sensors that recruit it. MGR\nheadache occurs when SNS activity is desensitized or excessive, resulting in\nhyperexcitability of baroreceptors, oxidative stress, and activation of pain\npathways via TRPV1 channels and CGRP. The theory is supported by overwhelming\nevidence, and explains the properties of current MGR treatments.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
