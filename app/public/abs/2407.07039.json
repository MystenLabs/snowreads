This phenomenon is surprisingly robust,\ngeneralizing to arbitrary elliptic differential operators of second order, with\nthe cone replaced by the level set of a solution at a nondegenerate critical\nvalue. As long as the tangent cone to the level set at the critical point\nsatisfies a certain genericity condition, the space of solutions vanishing on\nthe level set is at most two-dimensional.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
