With parallel oracles, however, it is\npossible to search faster than this. We consider a many-body quantum system\nthat naturally effects parallel queries, and we show that its parameters can be\ntuned to search a database in constant time, assuming a sufficient number of\ninteracting particles. In particular, we consider Bose-Einstein condensates\nwith pairwise and three-body interactions in the mean-field limit, which\neffectively evolve by a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with cubic and quintic\nnonlinearities. We solve the unstructured search problem formulated as a\ncontinuous-time quantum walk searching the complete graph in constant time.\nDepending on the number of marked vertices, however, the success probability\ncan peak sharply, necessitating high precision time measurement to observe the\nsystem at this peak. Overcoming this, we prove that the relative coefficients\nof the cubic and quintic terms can be tuned to eliminate the need for high\ntime-measurement precision by widening the peak in success probability or\nhaving it plateau. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the number of atoms\nneeded for the many-body system to evolve by the effective nonlinearity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
