The sound field estimation\nproblem is formulated as a function interpolation problem in machine learning\nin a simplified scenario. However, high estimation performance cannot be\nexpected by simply applying general interpolation techniques that rely only on\ndata. The physical properties of sound fields are useful a priori information,\nand it is considered extremely important to incorporate them into the\nestimation. In this article, we introduce the fundamentals of physics-informed\nmachine learning (PIML) for sound field estimation and overview current\nPIML-based sound field estimation methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C0oruEMCW4WasNC55RDsSy1LgfqohhhPR-jgFGKqRrg","pdfSize":"5903353"}
