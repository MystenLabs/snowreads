Despite significant\nprogress, a complete and consistent theory remains elusive. However, in the\nweak field approximation -- where curvature effects are small -- we can explore\nsome expected properties of such a theory. Particularly relevant to this study\nis the quantum nature of gravitational waves, which are represented as small\nperturbations in flat spacetime. In this framework, a quantum description of\nthese perturbations, as a quantum field, is feasible, leading to the emergence\nof the graviton. Here we consider a non-relativistic quantum system interacting\nwith such a field. We employ the consistent histories approach to quantum\nmechanics, which allows us to frame classical questions in a quantum context,\nto define a fluctuation relation for this system. As a result, thermodynamic\nentropy must be produced in the system due to its unavoidable interaction with\nthe quantum fluctuations of spacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
