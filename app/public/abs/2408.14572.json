Our method addresses two critical challenges in LLM\nfine-tuning: mitigating catastrophic forgetting during continual learning and\nreducing the number of trainable parameters. We propose a unique modification\nto the CUR decomposition process, utilizing inverted probabilities for column\nand row selection which acts as an implicit regularization, and initializing\nthe $U$ matrix as a zero matrix, and only fine-tuning it. We demonstrate\nthrough experiments on multiple datasets that CURLoRA outperforms standard LoRA\nin mitigating catastrophic forgetting. It maintains model stability and\nperformance across tasks while significantly reducing the number of trainable\nparameters. Our results show that CURLoRA achieves very good and stable task\naccuracy while maintaining base model's perplexity scores fixed compared to\nLoRA upon continual fine-tuning, particularly in scenarios with limited data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
