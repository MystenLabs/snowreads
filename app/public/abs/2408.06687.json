The MIM task involves masking some information, e.g. pixels,\npatches, or even latent representations, and training a model, usually an\nautoencoder, to predicting the missing information by using the context\navailable in the visible part of the input. We identify and formalize two\ncategories of approaches on how to implement MIM as a pretext task, one based\non reconstruction and one based on contrastive learning. Then, we construct a\ntaxonomy and review the most prominent papers in recent years. We complement\nthe manually constructed taxonomy with a dendrogram obtained by applying a\nhierarchical clustering algorithm. We further identify relevant clusters via\nmanually inspecting the resulting dendrogram. Our review also includes datasets\nthat are commonly used in MIM research. We aggregate the performance results of\nvarious masked image modeling methods on the most popular datasets, to\nfacilitate the comparison of competing methods. Finally, we identify research\ngaps and propose several interesting directions of future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
