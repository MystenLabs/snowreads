Traditionally, such predictions relied on models\ndeveloped from retrospective patient data. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have gained attention for their ability to process and generate text\nbased on extensive learned knowledge. In this study, we evaluate the potential\nof GPT-4o mini and GPT-3.5 in predicting the prognosis of lung cancer patients.\nWe collected two prognosis datasets, i.e., survival and post-operative\ncomplication datasets, and designed multiple tasks to assess the models'\nperformance comprehensively. Logistic regression models were also developed as\nbaselines for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can\nachieve competitive, and in some tasks superior, performance in lung cancer\nprognosis prediction compared to data-driven logistic regression models despite\nnot using additional patient data. These findings suggest that LLMs can be\neffective tools for prognosis prediction in lung cancer, particularly when\npatient data is limited or unavailable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
