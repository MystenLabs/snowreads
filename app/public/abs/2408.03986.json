A quantum analogue of search-to-decision reductions would be to ask\nwhether a quantum algorithm with access to a $\\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle can\nconstruct $\\mathsf{QMA}$ witnesses as quantum states. By a result from Irani,\nNatarajan, Nirkhe, Rao, and Yuen (CCC '22), it is known that this does not hold\nrelative to a quantum oracle, unlike the cases of $\\mathsf{NP}$, $\\mathsf{MA}$,\nand $\\mathsf{QCMA}$ where search-to-decision relativizes. We prove that if one\nis not interested in the quantum witness as a quantum state but only in terms\nof its partial assignments, i.e. the reduced density matrices, then there\nexists a classical polynomial-time algorithm with access to a $\\mathsf{QMA}$\noracle that outputs approximations of the density matrices of a near-optimal\nquantum witness, for any desired constant locality and inverse polynomial\nerror. Our construction is based on a circuit-to-Hamiltonian mapping that\napproximately preserves near-optimal $\\mathsf{QMA}$ witnesses and a new\n$\\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problem, Low-energy Density Matrix Verification, which\nis called by the $\\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle to adaptively construct approximately\nconsistent density matrices of a low-energy state.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jy5eC5WfN0lU-EAj0adPc4N63EyEgOc6M5d0YGajcOw","pdfSize":"294833"}
