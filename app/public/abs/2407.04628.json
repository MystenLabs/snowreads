To probe light intensity deep inside soft scattering\nmedia such as biological tissues, internal guide-stars are required. Here, we\ngive an overview of the main principles and describe in depth the use of a\nphotoacoustic feedback signal for this purpose. We further present first\nprinciples calculations and simulations to estimate important experimental\nparameters, and detailed instructions on designing and conducting these\nexperiments. Finally, we provide guidance towards selecting suitable equipment\nfor building a typical experimental setup, paving the way for further\ninnovative biomedical imaging and therapy applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
