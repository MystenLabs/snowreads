While a narrower pulse can offer a higher temporal resolution, so\nfar the pulse width has not exceeded the limit of half an optical cycle. Here\nwe propose to break the half-cycle limit via inverse Compton scattering in a\nnano-slit optical mode, in which a deep-subwavelength-confined optical field\ncan be converted into a deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse by high-energy free\nelectrons flying through. Our calculations show that, with experimentally\nreachable conditions, a measurable deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse with a width\nnarrower than half an optical cycle can be generated. Quantitatively, using a\ndeep-subwavelength-confined 4.4-$\\mu$m-wavelength 100-fs pulsed optical driving\nfield and a 2-MeV 50-as 5-pC electron bunch, we can obtain an attosecond pulse\nwith a peak frequency of 2.55 PHz, a pulse width of 99 as ($\\sim$0.25 optical\ncycle), and a single-pulse photon number larger than 200 around the material\ndamage threshold. Such pulses may open opportunities for studying light-matter\ninteraction on the deep-sub-cycle level, and pave a way to unprecedented\noptical technology ranging from temporal super-resolution optical microscopy\nand spectroscopy to unconventional atom/molecule polarization and manipulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
