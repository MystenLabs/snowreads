Tabular data can be useful for testing various systems,\nsimulating real data, analyzing the data itself or building predictive models.\nUnfortunately, such data may not be available due to confidentiality issues.\nPrevious techniques, such as TVAE (Xu et al., 2019) or OCTGAN (Kim et al.,\n2021), are either unable to handle particularly complex datasets, or are\ncomplex in themselves, resulting in inferior run time performance. This paper\nintroduces PSVAE, a new simple model that is capable of producing high-quality\nsynthetic data in less run time. PSVAE incorporates two key ideas: loss\noptimization and post-selection. Along with these ideas, the proposed model\ncompensates for underrepresented categories and uses a modern activation\nfunction, Mish (Misra, 2019).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
