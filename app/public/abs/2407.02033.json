Can there be a ZF model $N$ so\nthat $V\\subset N \\subset V[G]$ yet $N$ is not equal to $V(A)$ for any set $A\\in\nV[G]$? The first such model was constructed by Karagila. This is the so-called\n\\emph{Bristol model}, an intermediate model between $L$ and $L[c]$ where $c$ is\na Cohen-generic real over $L$. Karagila further proves that the Kinna-Wager\ndegree is unbounded in this model.\n  We prove that such an intermediate extension can be found in a Cohen-generic\nextension of \\emph{any} ground model, fully resolving Grigorieff's question.\nThat is, let $V$ be \\emph{any} ZF model and $c$ a Cohen-generic real over $V$.\nWe prove that there is an intermediate ZF-model $V\\subset N \\subset V[c]$ so\nthat $N$ is not equal to $V(A)$ for any set $A\\in V[c]$, the Kinna-Wagner\ndegree of $N$ is unbounded and, in particular, no set forcing in $N$ forces the\naxiom of choice.\n  Therefore, there are class many different intermediate models of ZF between\n$V$ and $V[c]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wnavBp4caeGf5Za2O2dSw33aZMg7LN9AtFIJqVE2oq8","pdfSize":"446346"}
