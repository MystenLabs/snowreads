The scheme adds about 100\nancilla qubits into the connectivity graph, and one of the twelve logical\nqubits is sacrificed for gate synthesis. Logical measurements are combined with\nthe automorphism gates studied by Bravyi et al. (Nature 627, 778-782) to\nimplement 288 Pauli product measurements. We demonstrate the practicality of\nour scheme through circuit-level noise simulations, leveraging a novel modular\ndecoder that combines BPOSD with matching. The main technical contribution is a\nlower overhead logical measurement scheme based on gauge-fixing the\nconstruction by Cohen et al. (Sci. Adv. 8, eabn1717). Our techniques apply to\ngeneral CSS codes and leverage expansion properties of the Tanner graph to give\nrigorous guarantees on qubit count, code distance, fault distance, and decoding\ndistance of the modular decoder. In particular, we require $O(d/\\beta)$\nadditional qubits where $\\beta$ is the boundary Cheeger constant of the\nsubgraph supporting the logical operator being measured. By introducing $O(d)$\nadditional bridge qubits, we are also able to measure products of logical Pauli\noperators and logical $Y$ operators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
