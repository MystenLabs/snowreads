Two atomic gas clouds with conditions typical of the CNM were set\nto collide at the interface of reverse magnetic fields. The cloud-cloud\ncollision triggered magnetic reconnection and produced a giant 20pc filamentary\nstructure which was not seen in the control models without CMR. The cloud, with\nrich fiber-like sub-structures, developed a fully molecular spine at 5Myr.\nRadiative transfer modeling of dust emission at far infrared wavelengths showed\nthat the middle part of the filament contained dense cores over a span of 5pc.\nSome of the cores were actively forming stars and typically exhibited both\nconnecting fibers in dust emission and high-velocity gas in CO line emission,\nindicative of active accretion through streamers. Supersonic turbulence was\npresent in and around the CMR-filament due to inflowing gas moving at\nsupersonic velocities in the collision mid-plane. The shocked gas was condensed\nand transported to the main filament piece by piece by reconnected fields,\nmaking the filament and star formation a bottom-up process. Instead of forming\na gravitationally bounded cloud which then fragments hierarchically (top-down)\nand forms stars, the CMR process creates dense gas pieces and magnetically\ntransports them to the central axis to constitute the filament. Since no\nturbulence is manually driven, our results suggest that CMR is capable of\nself-generating turbulence. Finally, the resulting helical field should show\nfield-reversal on both sides of the filament from most viewing angles.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h5aWrCU_vGcDCmlfqOmGZ7lEMKuqBtWEOJP6v_49KA0","pdfSize":"6299475"}
