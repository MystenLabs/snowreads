{"id":"2408.07234","title":"Direction of Arrival Correction through Speech Quality Feedback","authors":"Caleb Rascon","authorsParsed":[["Rascon","Caleb",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 23:43:20 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-15","timestamp":1723592600000,"abstract":"  Real-time speech enhancement has began to rise in performance, and the Demucs\nDenoiser model has recently demonstrated strong performance in\nmultiple-speech-source scenarios when accompanied by a location-based speech\ntarget selection strategy. However, it has shown to be sensitive to errors in\nthe direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. In this work, a DOA correction\nscheme is proposed that uses the real-time estimated speech quality of its\nenhanced output as the observed variable in an Adam-based optimization feedback\nloop to find the correct DOA. In spite of the high variability of the speech\nquality estimation, the proposed system is able to correct in real-time an\nerror of up to 15$^o$ using only the speech quality as its guide. Several\ninsights are provided for future versions of the proposed system to speed up\nconvergence and further reduce the speech quality estimation variability.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
