However, previous research has primarily focused on\ncharacterizing the performance limits of various MA-assisted wireless\ncommunication systems, with less emphasis on their practical implementation. To\naddress this gap, in this article, we propose several general MA architectures\nthat extend existing designs by varying several key aspects to cater to\ndifferent application scenarios and tradeoffs between cost and performance.\nAdditionally, we draw from fields such as antenna design and mechanical control\nto provide an overview of candidate implementation methods for the proposed MA\narchitectures, utilizing either direct mechanical or equivalent electronic\ncontrol. Simulation results are finally presented to support our discussion.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
