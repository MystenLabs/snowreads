We first estimate the growth\nrate analytically and then confirm the analytical results by solving\nnumerically the dispersion equation, taking into account all exact particle\ntrajectories within the reconnecting layer. We found that the instability is\nsuppressed when the particle spectrum becomes harder.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
