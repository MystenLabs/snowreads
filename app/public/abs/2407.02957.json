Due to rapidly developing affective and artificial\nintelligence technologies, this field of research has undergone explosive\nexpansion and advancement in recent years. In order to develop a deeper\nunderstanding of recent advancements, we present a systematic review of the\npast 10 years of research in affective robotics for wellbeing. In this review,\nwe identify the domains of well-being that have been studied, the methods used\nto investigate affective robots for well-being, and how these have evolved over\ntime. We also examine the evolution of the multifaceted research topic from\nthree lenses: technical, design, and ethical. Finally, we discuss future\nopportunities for research based on the gaps we have identified in our review\n-- proposing pathways to take affective robotics from the past and present to\nthe future. The results of our review are of interest to human-robot\ninteraction and affective computing researchers, as well as clinicians and\nwell-being professionals who may wish to examine and incorporate affective\nrobotics in their practices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
