In particular, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to\nestimate the in-flight density errors relative to the atmospheric density used\nto generate the nominal guidance trajectory. This information is leveraged\nwithin a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to improve tracking\nperformance, reduce control effort, and increase robustness to actuator\nsaturation compared to the state-of-the-art approach. The estimation and\ncontrol framework is tested in a Monte Carlo simulation campaign with\nhistorical space weather data. These simulation efforts demonstrate that the\nproposed framework is able to stay within 100 km of the guidance trajectory at\nall points in time for 98.4% of cases. The remaining 1.6% of cases were pushed\naway from the guidance by large density errors, many due to significant solar\nstorms and flares, that could not physically be compensated for by the drag\ncontrol device. For the successful cases, the proposed framework was able to\nguide the spacecraft to the desired location at the entry interface altitude\nwith a mean error of 12.1 km and 99.7% of cases below 100 km.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
