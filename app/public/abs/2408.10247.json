Consequently, computational enzyme design is relatively\noverlooked within the broader protein domain and remains in its early stages.\nIn this work, we address these challenges by introducing MetaEnzyme, a staged\nand unified enzyme design framework. We begin by employing a cross-modal\nstructure-to-sequence transformation architecture, as the feature-driven\nstarting point to obtain initial robust protein representation. Subsequently,\nwe leverage domain adaptive techniques to generalize specific enzyme design\ntasks under low-resource conditions. MetaEnzyme focuses on three fundamental\nlow-resource enzyme redesign tasks: functional design (FuncDesign), mutation\ndesign (MutDesign), and sequence generation design (SeqDesign). Through novel\nunified paradigm and enhanced representation capabilities, MetaEnzyme\ndemonstrates adaptability to diverse enzyme design tasks, yielding outstanding\nresults. Wet lab experiments further validate these findings, reinforcing the\nefficacy of the redesign process.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
