Such alignment signals become important for controlling\nthe systematics of weak lensing surveys and for constraining galaxy formation\nand evolution scenarios. We measure the galaxy-ellipticity and\nellipticity-ellipticity correlation functions for blue star-forming galaxies at\n$z=1.19$ and $z=1.47$ that are selected by detecting [OII] emission lines in\nnarrow-band filters of the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. Assuming\nthat disk galaxies are thin and rotation-supported, we also measure the spin\ncorrelation function by estimating spin directions with ellipticities and\nposition angles. Above $1 \\; h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$, we do not find significant\nsignals for galaxy-ellipticity, ellipticity-ellipticity, or spin correlations\nat both redshifts. Below $1 \\; h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$, a weak deviation from zero is\nseen at $z=1.47$, implying weak spin-filament correlations, but it is not\nverified by the direct comparison between angles of spins and filaments. The\nlinear alignment model fit yields the amplitude parameter $A_{\\rm\nNLA}=1.38\\pm2.32$ at $z=1.19$ and $0.45\\pm2.09$ at $z=1.47$ ($95\\%$ confidence\nlevels). We discuss various observational and physical origins that affect the\nsearch for alignments of disk galaxies at high redshifts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
