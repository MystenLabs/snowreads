These\ninteractive cyber exercises are highly beneficial to assess and improve the\nsecurity posture of organizations, detect vulnerabilities, and train employees.\nUnfortunately, they are also time-consuming and expensive, which often limits\ntheir scale or prevents them entirely. To address this situation, adversary\nemulation tools partially automate attacker behavior and enable fast,\ncontinuous, and repeatable security testing even when involved personnel lacks\nred teaming experience. Currently, a wide range of tools designed for specific\nuse-cases and requirements exist. To obtain an overview of these solutions, we\nconduct a review and structured comparison of nine open-source adversary\nemulation tools. To this end, we assemble a questionnaire with 80 questions\naddressing relevant aspects, including setup, support, documentation,\nusability, and technical features. In addition, we conduct a user study with\ndomain experts to investigate the importance of these aspects for distinct user\nroles. Based on the evaluation and user feedback, we rank the tools and find\nMITRE Caldera, Metasploit, and Atomic Red Team on top.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"mOWdzxXkoUNFxjlB5-ruJUOnxhj0EVEWepVswGOjbt0","pdfSize":"1232104"}
