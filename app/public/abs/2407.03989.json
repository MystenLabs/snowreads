Apart from its singularities, these vector fields define\ncodimension one foliations with nice geometric features, which we call Montiel\nFoliations. We investigate conditions for which a foliation transverse to this\nstructure has totally geodesic leaves, as well as how the ambient space and the\ngeometry of the leaves forces a given foliation into a Montiel Foliation. Our\nmain results concern minimal leaves and constant mean curvature foliations,\nhaving compact or complete noncompact leaves. Finally, we characterize totally\ngeodesic foliations by means of its relation to a prior Montiel Foliation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
