This model upgrade removes constraints on the reserve buoyancy,\ndefined as the fraction of the particle volume above the ocean surface. The\nrefinement results in an equation that correctly describes both the neutrally\nbuoyant and fully buoyant particle scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
