One of the main causes of\nhardware failure is an uncorrected error in memory, which terminates the\ncurrent job and wastes all computation since the last checkpoint. This paper\npresents the first adaptive method for triggering uncorrected error mitigation.\nIt uses a prediction approach that considers the likelihood of an uncorrected\nerror and its current potential cost. The method is based on reinforcement\nlearning, and the only user-defined parameters are the mitigation cost and\nwhether the job can be restarted from a mitigation point. We evaluate our\nmethod using classical machine learning metrics together with a cost-benefit\nanalysis, which compares the cost of mitigation actions with the benefits from\nmitigating some of the errors. On two years of production logs from the\nMareNostrum supercomputer, our method reduces lost compute time by 54% compared\nwith no mitigation and is just 6% below the optimal Oracle method.
