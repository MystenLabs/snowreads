We show that the\nnon-determinism inherent in the communication medium between agents and the\nunderlying physical environment gives rise to environment evolution that is a\nprobabilistic function of agents' strategies. We name these emergent properties\nCyber Physical Games and study its properties. We present an algorithmic model\nthat determines the most likely system evolution, approximating Cyber Physical\nGames through Probabilistic Finite State Automata, and evaluate it on\ncollaborative and adversarial versions of the Iterated Boolean Game, comparing\ntheoretical results with simulated ones. Results support the validity of the\nproposed model, and suggest several required research directions to continue\nevolving our understanding of Cyber Physical System, as well as how to best\ndesign agents that must operate within such environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
