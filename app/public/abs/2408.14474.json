Rev. B\n106, L201106 (2022). The model has isotropic $XY$ couplings which have a\nuniform value and $ZZ$ couplings which have a dimerized form, with strengths\n$J_a$ and $J_b$ on alternate bonds. We find a rich phase diagram in the region\nof positive $J_a, ~J_b$. We provide a detailed understanding of the different\nphases and associated quantum phase transitions using a combination of\nmean-field theory, low-energy effective Hamiltonians, renormalization group\ncalculations employing the technique of bosonization, and numerical\ncalculations using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. The\nphase diagram consists of two Ising paramagnetic phases called IPM$_0$ and\nIPM$_\\pi$, and a phase with Ising Neel order called IN; all these phases are\ngapped. The phases IPM$_0$ and IPM$_\\pi$ are separated by a gapless phase\ntransition line given by $0 \\le J_a = J_b \\le 1$ which is described by a\nconformal field theory with central charge $c=1$. There are two gapless phase\ntransition lines separating IPM$_0$ from IN and IPM$_\\pi$ from IN; these are\ndescribed by conformal field theories with $c=\\frac{1}{2}$ corresponding to\nquantum Ising transitions. The $c=1$ line bifurcates into the two\n$c=\\frac{1}{2}$ lines at the point $J_a = J_b = 1$; the shape of the\nbifurcation is found analytically using RG calculations. A symmetry analysis\nshows that IPM$_0$ is a topologically trivial phase while IPM$_\\pi$ is a\ntime-reversal symmetry-protected topological phase (SPT) with\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ states at the two ends of an open system. The numerical\nresults obtained by the DMRG method are in good agreement with the analytical\nresults. Finally we propose experimental platforms for testing our results.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
