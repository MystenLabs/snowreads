They are quadratic approximations of Nichols algebras\nassociated with the conjugacy class of reflections and a (rack) 2-cocycle q^+\nwith values in {-1,1}. We prove that q^+ is twist-equivalent to the constant\ncocycle q^-=-1, generalising a result of Vendramin. As a consequence, the\nNichols algebras associated with the two different cocycles have the same\nHilbert series and one is quadratic if and only if the other is quadratic. We\nfurther apply a recent result of Heckenberger, Meir and Vendramin to classify\nthe finite-dimensional Nichols algebras of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the\ndihedral group or order 2n, where n=r or n=2r with r odd and not a power of 3.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
