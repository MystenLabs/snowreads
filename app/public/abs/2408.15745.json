In the Martian atmosphere thermal tides are known\nto be especially significant compared to any other known planet. Based on the\ndata set of pressure timeseries produced by the InSight lander, which is\nunprecedented in terms of accuracy and temporal coverage, we investigate\nthermal tides on Mars and we find harmonics even beyond the number 24, which\nexceeds significantly the number of harmonics previously reported by other\nworks. We explore comparatively the characteristics and seasonal evolution of\ntidal harmonics and find that even and odd harmonics exhibit some clearly\ndifferentiated trends that evolve seasonally and respond to dust events.\nHigh-order tidal harmonics with small amplitudes could transiently interfere\nconstructively to produce meteorologically relevant patterns.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
