It clearly describes how a treatment\neffect in a clinical question should be precisely defined and estimated,\nthrough attributes including treatments, endpoints and intercurrent events.\nHowever, ideas around the estimand framework are commonly in text, and\ndifferent interpretations on this framework may exist. This article aims to\ninterpret the estimand framework through its underlying theories, the causal\ninference framework based on potential outcomes. The statistical origin and\nformula of an estimand is given through the causal inference framework, with\nall attributes translated into statistical terms. How five strategies proposed\nby ICH to analyze intercurrent events are incorporated in the statistical\nformula of an estimand is described, and a new strategy to analyze intercurrent\nevents is also suggested. The roles of target populations and analysis sets in\nthe estimand framework are compared and discussed based on the statistical\nformula of an estimand. This article recommends continuing study of causal\ninference theories behind the estimand framework and improving the estimand\nframework with greater methodological comprehensibility and availability.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OLsRnrFXkGVs1VjuIMy4zAFe1Vl5I00S8Kl6jk_ryzk","pdfSize":"284206","objectId":"0x36981e449f5f691d9331408110bf9aadb5c4927a6854213be70bfd59e36e63a4","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
