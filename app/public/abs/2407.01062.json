The main\ndifficulty is to obtain bounded Palais-Smale sequences. This is achieved by\nadding a parameter in the problem and using a version of the \"monotonicity\ntrick\" introduced by M. Struwe in 1988.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
