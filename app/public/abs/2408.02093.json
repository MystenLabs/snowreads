Here, we\ntheoretically investigate Floquet engineering topological phase transitions in\nthe quantum spin Hall $\\alpha$-$T_{3}$ system driven by an off-resonant\ncircularly polarized light. In addition to the quantum spin (anomalous) Hall\ninsulator phase with multiple helical (chiral) edge states, spin-polarized\ntopological metallic phases are observed, where the bulk topological band gap\nof one spin sub-band overlaps with the other gapless spin sub-band. Moreover,\nwith a staggered potential, the topological invariants of the system depend on\nwhether the middle band is occupied because of the breaking of particle-hole\nsymmetry. Our work highlights the significance of Floquet engineering in\nrealizing new topological phases in $\\alpha$-$T_{3}$ lattices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
