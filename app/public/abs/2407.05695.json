In this paper, we provide a method of\nconstructing self-orthogonal and LCD subspace codes from a set of matrices\nunder certain conditions. In particular, we give constructions of\nself-orthogonal and LCD subspace codes from mutually quasi-unbiased weighing\nmatrices, linked systems of symmetric designs, and linked systems of symmetric\ngroup divisible designs, Deza graphs and their equitable partitions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
