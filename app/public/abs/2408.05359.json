Theoretical investigations of quantum models with\nSU($N$) symmetry have provided important insights into many-body phenomena.\nHowever, these models have generally remained a theoretical idealization, since\nit is very difficult to exactly realize the SU($N$) symmetry in conventional\nquantum materials for large $N$. Intriguingly however, in recent years,\nultracold alkaline-earth-atom (AEA) quantum simulators have paved the path to\nrealize SU($N$)-symmetric many-body models, where $N$ is tunable and can be as\nlarge as 10. This symmetry emerges due to the closed shell structure of AEAs,\nthereby leading to a perfect decoupling of the electronic degrees of freedom\nfrom the nuclear spin. In this work, we provide a systematic review of recent\ntheoretical and experimental work on the many-body physics of these systems. We\nfirst discuss the thermodynamic properties and collective modes of trapped\nFermi gases, highlighting the enhanced interaction effects that appear as $N$\nincreases. We then discuss the properties of the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model,\nfocusing on some of the major experimental achievements in this area. We\nconclude with a compendium highlighting some of the significant theoretical\nprogress on SU($N$) lattice models and a discussion of some exciting directions\nfor future research.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
