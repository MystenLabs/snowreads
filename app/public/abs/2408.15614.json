We prove that semisimple Lie algebras are far from being flexibly\n$\\mathbb{C}$-stable, and that semisimple Lie groups and lattices in semisimple\nLie groups of higher rank are not strictly $\\mathbb{C}$-stable. Furthermore, we\nprove that free groups are not uniformly flexibly $F$-stable over any field\n$F$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
