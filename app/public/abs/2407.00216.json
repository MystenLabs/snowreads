We show that these\nproblems can be embedded into a more general, discrete-time framework. A\nconditioning and mixing argument then yields alternative expressions for these\nwell-known rate functionals, formulated in terms of Markov bridges.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
