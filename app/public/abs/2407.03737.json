We consider a Chern insulator whose topological phase is tuned via a\nsecond-order hopping. We perform time-dynamics simulations of the\nout-of-equilibrium laser-driven electron motion that enables us to model a\nrealistic attosecond spectroscopy scheme. In particular, we use an ultrafast\nscheme with a circularly polarized IR pump pulse and an attosecond x-ray probe\npulse. A laser-induced dichroism-type spectrum shows a clear signature of the\ntopological phase transition. We are able to connect these signatures with the\nBerry structure of the system. This work extend the applications of attosecond\nabsorption spectroscopy to systems presenting a non-trivial topological phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
