Applying the $t-W$ method, we\nderive the homogeneous zero roots Bethe ansatz equations and the corresponding\nzero root patterns of the Izergin-Korepin model with generic integrable\nboundaries. Based on these results, we analytically compute the surface\nenergies and boundary excitations in different regimes of boundary parameters\nof the model. It is shown that in some regimes, correlation effect appears\nbetween two boundary fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
