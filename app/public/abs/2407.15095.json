Math.\n158 (1993); On a non-linear equation related to the geometry of the\ndiffeomorphism group, Pacific J. Math. 158 (1993)]. It is known [The Bao--Ratiu\nequations on surfaces, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 449 (1995)] that asymptotic\ndirections cannot exist globally on any $\\Sigma$ with positive curvature. To\ncomplement this result, we prove that asymptotic directions always exist\nlocally about a point $x_0 \\in \\Sigma$ in either of the following cases (where\n$K$ is the Gaussian curvature on $\\Sigma$): (a), $K(x_0)>0$; (b) $K(x_0)<0$; or\n(c), $K$ changes sign cleanly at $x_0$, i.e., $K(x_0)=0$ and $\\nabla K(x_0)\n\\neq 0$. The key ingredient of the proof is the analysis following Han [On the\nisometric embedding of surfaces with Gauss curvature changing sign cleanly,\nComm. Pure Appl. Math. 58 (2005)] of a degenerate Monge--Amp\\`{e}re equation --\nwhich is of the elliptic, hyperbolic, and mixed types in cases (a), (b), and\n(c), respectively -- locally equivalent to the Bao--Ratiu equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
