We developed a DT framework that leverages the heterogeneity of\nnetwork access technologies as a resource for enhanced network performance and\nmanagement, enabling smart data handling in the physical network. Tested in a\nCampus Area Network environment, our framework integrates diverse data sources\nto provide real-time, holistic insights into network performance and\nenvironmental sensing. We also envision that traditional analytics will evolve\nto rely on emerging AI models, such as Generative AI (GenAI), while leveraging\ncurrent analytics capabilities. This capacity can simplify analytics processes\nthrough advanced ML models, enabling descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and\nprescriptive analytics in a unified fashion. Finally, we present specific\nresearch opportunities concerning interoperability aspects and envision\naligning advancements in DT technology with evolved AI integration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
