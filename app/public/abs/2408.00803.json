Prompt\nidentification and resolution of disruptive problems are crucial to ensure\nrapid recovery and maintain system stability. Numerous methodologies have\nemerged to address this challenge, primarily focusing on diagnosing failures\nthrough symptomatic data. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive,\nstructured review of root cause analysis (RCA) techniques within microservices,\nexploring methodologies that include metrics, traces, logs, and multi-model\ndata. It delves deeper into the methodologies, challenges, and future trends\nwithin microservices architectures. Positioned at the forefront of AI and\nautomation advancements, it offers guidance for future research directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hyeGXBtydnhrspDzafwtKgVrxbQGhE3E1M_YzWMPySE","pdfSize":"2053723","txDigest":"48h9o4dSAY2TSUUNADL7zwxCCBPK9KSP1NnRtNoB66uA","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
