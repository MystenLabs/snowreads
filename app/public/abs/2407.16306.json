Traditional machine learning algorithms struggle\nwith catastrophic forgetting, which is detrimental to the diverse and\ngeneralized abilities required for robotic deployment. This paper investigates\nthe Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) framework, known for its advanced\ncapabilities in efficient and effective sequence modeling, and its integration\nwith the decision transformer and experience replay architectures. It focuses\non potential performance enhancements in sequence decision-making and lifelong\nrobotic learning tasks. We introduce the Decision-RWKV (DRWKV) model and\nconduct extensive experiments using the D4RL database within the OpenAI Gym\nenvironment and on the D'Claw platform to assess the DRWKV model's performance\nin single-task tests and lifelong learning scenarios, showcasing its ability to\nhandle multiple subtasks efficiently.
