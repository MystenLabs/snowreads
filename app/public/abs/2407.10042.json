This method leverages the\nVariational Autoencoder (VAE) integrated with dynamic thresholding and\ncorrelation-based feature clustering. This framework enhances the VAE's ability\nto identify localized dependencies and learn the temporal relationships in\nclimate data, thereby improving the detection of anomalies as demonstrated by\nits higher F1-score on benchmark datasets. The study's main contributions\ninclude the development of a robust anomaly detection method, improving feature\nrepresentation within VAEs through clustering, and creating a dynamic threshold\nalgorithm for localized anomaly detection. This method offers explainability of\nclimate anomalies across different regions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
