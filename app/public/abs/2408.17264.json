While this technique is\nwidely used and has demonstrated its usefulness numerous times, little is known\nabout the actual transport properties of the doped graphene leads. Here, we\npresent an experiment probing those properties in the quantum Hall regime at\nlow temperature and high magnetic field, showing that electronic phase\ncoherence and transport chirality are preserved, despite the significant charge\nequilibration occurring at the edges of the leads. Our work yields a finer\nunderstanding of the properties of the doped graphene leads, allowing for\nimprovements of the contact quality that can be applied to other\ntwo-dimensional materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"864hpoHR0HRRn5kyYjdDHBMJ5s4o_25OAzKqddLAN6I","pdfSize":"3654304"}
