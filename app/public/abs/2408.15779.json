However, most ML\npotentials are still much slower than classical interatomic potentials and are\nusually trained with near equilibrium simulations in mind. In this work, we\ndevelop ML potentials for Cu, Al and Ni using the Gaussian approximation\npotential (GAP) method. Specifically, we create the low-dimensional tabulated\nversions (tabGAP) of the potentials, which allow for two orders of magnitude\nhigher computational efficiency than the GAPs, enabling simulations of large\nmulti-million atomic systems. The ML potentials are trained using diverse\ncurated databases of structures and include fixed external repulsive potentials\nfor short-range interactions. The potentials are extensively validated and used\nto simulate a wide range of fundamental materials properties, such as stacking\nfaults and threshold displacement energies. Furthermore, we use the potentials\nto simulate single-crystal uniaxial compressive loading in different crystal\norientations with both pristine simulation cells and cells containing\npre-existing defects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
