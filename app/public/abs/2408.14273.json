Through analysis of OSS projects, we have identified common issues\nin outdated or unmaintained dependencies, including pointer dereferences and\narray bounds violations, that pose significant security risks. We have also\nexamined developer responses to formal verifier reports, noting a tendency to\ndismiss potential issues as false positives, which can lead to overlooked\nvulnerabilities. Our results suggest that reducing the number of direct\ndependencies and prioritizing well-established libraries with strong security\nrecords are effective strategies for enhancing the software security landscape.\nNotably, four vulnerabilities were fixed as a result of this study,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our mitigation strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ohg5FJH7aGLLFVcA61mTBnlc3jYFVjElwFZJefqNxio","pdfSize":"448293"}
