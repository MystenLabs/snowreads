However, most existing studies of hierarchical summarization\nonly work on \\emph{one single tree} by selecting $k$ representative nodes,\nwhich neglects an important problem of comparative summarization on two trees.\nIn this paper, given two trees with the same topology structure and different\nnode weights, we aim at finding $k$ representative nodes, where $k_1$ nodes\nsummarize the common relationship between them and $k_2$ nodes highlight\nsignificantly different sub-trees meanwhile satisfying $k_1+k_2=k$. To optimize\nsummarization results, we introduce a scaling coefficient for balancing the\nsummary view between two sub-trees in terms of similarity and difference.\nAdditionally, we propose a novel definition based on the Hellinger distance to\nquantify the node distribution difference between the sub-trees. We present a\ngreedy algorithm SVDT to find high-quality results with approximation\nguaranteed in an efficient way. Furthermore, we explore an extension of our\ncomparative summarization to handle two trees with different structures.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our SVDT\nalgorithm against existing summarization competitors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
