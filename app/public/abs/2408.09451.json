However, they are intractable\nand thus unable to answer even the most basic probabilistic inference queries\nwithout resorting to approximations. Therefore, we propose graph sum-product\nnetworks (GraphSPNs), a tractable deep generative model which provides exact\nand efficient inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. We investigate\ndifferent principles to make SPNs permutation invariant. We demonstrate that\nGraphSPNs are able to (conditionally) generate novel and chemically valid\nmolecular graphs, being competitive to, and sometimes even better than,\nexisting intractable models. We find out that (Graph)SPNs benefit from ensuring\nthe permutation invariance via canonical ordering.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S9Whft78_bonBAbX3b-yPG_1v1r56H9nOZxGbhM80dE","pdfSize":"594780"}
