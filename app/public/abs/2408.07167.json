We investigate the parameter space\nof the dissipative asymmetric kicked rotor map and show that, in the regime of\nstrong dissipation, the shrimp-shaped domains repeat themselves as the\nnonlinearity parameter increases while maintaining the same period. We analyze\nthe dependence of the length of each periodic domain with the nonlinearity\nparameter, revealing that it follows a power law with the same exponent\nregardless of the dissipation parameter. Additionally, we find that the\ndistance between adjacent shrimp-shaped domains is scaling invariant with\nrespect to the dissipation parameter. Furthermore, we show that for weaker\ndissipation, a multistable scenario emerges within the periodic domains. We\nfind that as the dissipation gets weaker, the ratio of multistable parameters\nfor each periodic domain increases, and the area of the periodic basin\ndecreases as the nonlinearity parameter increases.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Vr7bdEY-pxw1RYLRDuOwsK2pJY8t5QACnPHNneKHKOk","pdfSize":"6014483"}
