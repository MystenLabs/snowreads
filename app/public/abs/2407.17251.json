This paper delves into the realm of eigenvalue\ncomputation and related problems specific to dual quaternion Hermitian\nmatrices. We establish the connection between dual quaternion matrices and\ntheir dual complex adjoint matrices, concerning eigenvalue problems and matrix\nrank-k approximations. By integrating the dual complex adjoint matrix, we\nrefine the power method for eigenvalue computation for dual quaternion\nHermitian matrices, achieving greater numerical efficiency. Furthermore,\nleveraging the eigen-decomposition of dual complex adjoint matrices, we\nintroduce a novel approach for calculating all eigenpairs of dual quaternion\nHermitian matrices. This method surpasses the power method in terms of accuracy\nand speed and addresses its limitations, as exemplified by its application to\nthe eigenvalue computation of Laplacian matrices, where our algorithm\ndemonstrates significant advantages. Additionally, we apply the improved power\nmethod and optimal rank-k approximations to pose graph optimization problem,\nenhancing efficiency and success rates, especially under low observation\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
