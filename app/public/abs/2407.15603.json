In this\nstudy, we develop an anomaly detection model for BSC systems. Our proposed\nmodel can detect cyber-attacks at various levels, including the network layer,\nconsensus layer, and beyond, by analyzing only the traffic data at the network\nlayer. To do this, we first build a BSC system at our laboratory to perform\nexperiments and collect datasets. We then propose a novel semi-supervised\nDAE-MLP (Deep AutoEncoder-Multilayer Perceptron) that combines the advantages\nof supervised and unsupervised learning to detect anomalies in BSC systems. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for anomaly\ndetection within BSCs, achieving a detection accuracy of 96.5%. Moreover,\nDAE-MLP can effectively detect new attacks by improving the F1-score up to\n33.1% after updating the MLP component.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
