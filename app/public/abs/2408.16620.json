Through the use of hyperdimensional\nvector computing (HVC) algebras and Tsetlin machine clause structures, we\ndemonstrate that the combination of both inherits the generality of data\nencoding and decoding of HVC with the fast interpretable nature of Tsetlin\nmachines to yield a powerful machine learning model. We apply the approach in\ntwo areas, namely in forecasting, generating new sequences, and classification.\nFor the latter, we derive results for the entire UCR Time Series Archive and\ncompare with the standard benchmarks to see how well the method competes in\ntime series classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lXCz1CZeGNnVpXenwfeEmi0_5d3bbPTEd3piCHL9wNY","pdfSize":"5018613"}
