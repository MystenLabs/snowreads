We present a method for\nobtaining a canonical set of root functions and Jordan chains of $L(z)$ through\nelementary transformations of the matrix $L(z)$ alone. This method provides a\nnew and simple approach to deriving a general solution of the system of\nordinary linear differential equations $L\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\right)u=0$ using\nonly elementary transformations of the corresponding matrix polynomial $L(z)$.\n  In the second part of the paper, given a matrix generalized Nevanlinna\nfunction $Q\\in N_{\\kappa }^{n \\times n}$ and a canonical set of root functions\nof $\\hat{Q}(z) := -Q(z)^{-1}$, we provide an algorithm to determine a specific\nPontryagin space $(\\mathcal{K}, [.,.])$, a specific self-adjoint operator\n$A:\\mathcal{K}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{K}$ and an operator $\\Gamma:\n\\mathbb{C}^{n}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{K}$ that represent the function $Q$ in a\nKrein-Langer type representation. We demonstrate the main results through\nexamples of linear systems of ODEs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
