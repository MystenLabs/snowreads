Although humans\nare often resistant to technological innovation, especially in workplaces,\nthere is a general trend towards increasing automation, and more recently, AI.\nAI is now capable of carrying out, or assisting with, many tasks that used to\nbe regarded as exclusively requiring human expertise. In this paper we consider\nthe case of tasks that could be performed either by human experts or by AI and\nlocate them on a continuum running from exclusively human task performance at\none end to AI autonomy on the other, with a variety of forms of human-AI\ninteraction between those extremes. Implementation of AI is constrained by the\ncontext of the systems and workflows that it will be embedded within. There is\nan urgent need for methods to determine how AI should be used in different\nsituations and to develop appropriate methods of human-AI interaction so that\nhumans and AI can work together effectively to perform tasks. In response to\nthe evolving landscape of AI progress and increasing mastery, we introduce an\nAI Mastery Lifecycle framework and discuss its implications for human-AI\ninteraction. The framework provides guidance on human-AI task allocation and\nhow human-AI interfaces need to adapt to improvements in AI task performance\nover time. Within the framework we identify a zone of uncertainty where the\nissues of human-AI task allocation and user interface design are likely to be\nmost challenging.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
