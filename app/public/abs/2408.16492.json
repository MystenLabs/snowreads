Meanwhile,\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers detailed investigations with\nsub-atomic resolution, but often inflicts significant radiation damage. Here we\nexploit synergies and report on an integration of ESR spectroscopy in a TEM.\nOur miniaturized ESR setup on a standard TEM sample holder leverages the strong\nmagnetic field of the TEM polepiece to align and energetically separate spin\nstates. This integration will facilitate in-situ studies of spin systems and\ntheir dynamics, quantum materials, radicals, electrochemical reactions, and\nradiation damage - properties previously mainly invisible to electron\nmicroscopic tools. Moreover, this development marks a significant technological\nadvancement toward microwave-controlled quantum spin studies with a highly\ncontrolled electron probe at the nanoscale.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
