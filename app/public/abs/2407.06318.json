The voter model captures\nthe evolution of opinions over time on a graph where each vertex represents an\nindividual holding a binary opinion. Our primary interest lies in the density\nof discordant edges, defined as the fraction of edges connecting vertices with\ndifferent opinions, and its asymptotic behavior as the graph size grows to\ninfinity. This analysis provides valuable insights, not only into the consensus\ntime behavior but also into how the process approaches this absorption time on\nshorter time scales. Our analysis is based on the study of certain annealed\nrandom walk processes evolving on out-directed, marked Galton-Watson trees,\nwhich describe the locally tree-like nature of the considered random graph\nmodel. Additionally, we employ innovative coupling techniques that exploit the\nclassical stochastic dual process of coalescing random walks. We extend\nexisting results on random regular graphs to the more general setting of\nheterogeneous and directed configurations, highlighting the role of graph\ntopology in the opinion dynamics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U8lvOMpeadIfRjjVfQRZs8Tx4rmbV8EsbtJYizqiqiI","pdfSize":"719957"}
