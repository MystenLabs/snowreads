This\nframework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose\nregression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders\nhigh-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of\n2D-3D correspondences. GSLoc obviates the need for training feature extractors\nor descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D vision\nfoundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of\nour model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an\nexposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GSLoc enables\nefficient pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose\nestimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization\nmethods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual\nlocalization benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor\ndatasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
