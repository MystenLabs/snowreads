These biases follow from inequalities for residue-weighted\npartition functions for the respective sets of partitions. We also establish\nasymptotic formulas for the numbers of partitions of size $n$ that belong to\nthese sets of partitions and have a symmetric residue bias (i.e., for $1\\le\na<m/2$ and $b=m-a$), as $n$ tends to infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
