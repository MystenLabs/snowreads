We compute the derivative of this\nmap, and provide a simple description of the locus where it is injective,\nrecovering in the process several previously obtained results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
