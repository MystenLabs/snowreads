Its optical and infrared occultation depths show\ntemporal variability, in addition to a phase curve variability observed in the\noptical. We wish to explore the possibility that the variability originates\nfrom the planet being in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, thus showing different\nsides during occultations. We proposed and were awarded Cycle 1 time at the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to test this hypothesis. JWST/NIRCam observed\nfive occultations (secondary eclipses), of which four were observed within a\nweek, of the planet simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.5 {\\mu}m. While the former\ngives band-integrated photometry, the latter provides a spectrum between\n3.9-5.0 {\\mu}m. We find that the occultation depths in both bandpasses are\nhighly variable and change between a non-detection (-5 +/- 6 ppm and 7 +/- 9\nppm) to 96 +/- 8 ppm and 119 (+34) (-19) ppm at 2.1 {\\mu}m and 4.5 {\\mu}m,\nrespectively. Interestingly, the variations in both bandpasses are not\ncorrelated and do not support the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance explanation. The\nmeasured brightness temperature at 4.5 {\\mu}m varies between 873-2256 K and is\nlower than the expected dayside temperature of bare rock with no heat\nre-distribution (2500 K) which is indicative of an atmosphere. Our atmospheric\nretrieval analysis of occultation depth spectra at 4.5 {\\mu}m finds that\ndifferent visits statistically favour various atmospheric scenarios including a\nthin outgassed CO/CO2 atmosphere and a silicate rock vapour atmosphere. Some\nvisits even support a flat line model. The observed variability could be\nexplained by stochastic outgassing of CO/CO2, which is also hinted by\nretrievals. Alternatively, the variability, observed at both 2.1 and 4.5\n{\\mu}m, could be the result of a circumstellar patchy dust torus generated by\nvolcanism on the planet.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GQ81tC3C1OcEs4aCgGG45vT4UwgRfeHa8LpbEh59fnI","pdfSize":"8694824"}
