At the Pierre Auger Observatory,\nit is also used by the current generation of FRAM robotic telescopes, but --\ndue to their limited field of view -- only for a small number of selected\nshowers. Thanks to the recent development in astronomical CMOS cameras, we are\nable to propose a new type of device, specifically tailored to the field of\nview of the fluorescence detectors (FD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The\nsub-second readout times available with CMOS cameras allows the efficient use\nof short exposures, and so the field of view of one FD can be covered within\nhalf a minute with a resolution and reach sufficient to detect small clouds\nwith a setup that is significantly smaller, simpler and cheaper than the\ncurrent FRAMs. The FRAM Next Generation (framNG) device will be able not only\nto detect clouds, but also to assess their optical thickness, provide\ninformation on aerosol extinction, sky brightness and possibly even record\natmospheric phenomena and astrophysical transients. The main challenge lies in\nthe large data volume produced which necessitates reliable real-time data\nprocessing.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
