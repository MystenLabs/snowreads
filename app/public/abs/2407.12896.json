The present study addresses this gap through a\nnationally representative survey (n = 8,369) on scam exposure, victimization,\ntypes, vectors, and reporting in 12 countries: Belgium, Egypt, France, Hungary,\nIndonesia, Mexico, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, and\nthe United Kingdom. We analyze 6 survey questions to build a detailed\nquantitative picture of the scams landscape in each country, and compare across\ncountries to identify global patterns. We find, first, that residents of less\naffluent countries suffer financial loss from scams more often. Second, we find\nthat the internet plays a key role in scams across the globe, and that GNI\nper-capita is strongly associated with specific scam types and contact vectors.\nThird, we find widespread under-reporting, with residents of less affluent\ncountries being less likely to know how to report a scam. Our findings\ncontribute valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers\nin the online fraud and scam prevention space.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dtcM9wKQcPFoFD1fWnwI2i4GXOHwa4FxTiV-_RFnMPE","pdfSize":"6753042"}
