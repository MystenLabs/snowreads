Berg and Purcell famously investigated how well a small sensor\nin an infinite ligand bath can determine the ligand concentration, and a number\nof subsequent analyses have refined and built upon their classical estimates.\nNot all concentration sensing problems, however, occur in such an infinite\ngeometry. At different scales, subcellular sensors and cells in tissues are\nboth often confronted with signals whose diffusion is affected by confining\nboundaries. It is thus valuable to understand how basic limits on\nchemosensation depend on the sensor's size and on its position in the domain in\nwhich ligand diffuses. Here we compute how sensor size and proximity to\nreflecting boundaries affect the diffusion-limited precision of chemosensation\nfor various geometries in one and three dimensions. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the sensing limit in these geometries. Among our conclusions is\nthe surprising result that, in certain circumstances, smaller sensors can be\nmore effective than larger sensors. This effect arises from a trade-off between\nspatial averaging and time averaging that we analyze in detail. We also find\nthat proximity to confining boundaries can degrade a sensor's precision\nsignificantly compared to the precision of the same sensor far from any\nboundaries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
