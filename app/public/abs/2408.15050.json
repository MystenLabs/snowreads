Unfortunately,\nmost of prior work can hardly model semantic scopes of words and topics by\nholding the Euclidean embedding space assumption. What's worse, they infer\nasymmetric hierarchical relations by symmetric distances between topic\nembeddings. As a result, existing methods suffer from problems of low-quality\ntopics at high abstraction levels and inaccurate hierarchical relations. To\nalleviate these problems, this paper develops a Box embedding-based Topic Model\n(BoxTM) that maps words and topics into the box embedding space, where the\nasymmetric metric is defined to properly infer hierarchical relations among\ntopics. Additionally, our BoxTM explicitly infers upper-level topics based on\ncorrelation between specific topics through recursive clustering on topic\nboxes. Finally, extensive experiments validate high-quality of the topic\ntaxonomy learned by BoxTM.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
