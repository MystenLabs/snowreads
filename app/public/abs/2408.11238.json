However, the vast number of active binding\nsites in HEAs, as opposed to conventional alloys, presents a significant\ncomputational challenge in catalytic applications. To tackle this challenge,\nrobust methods must be developed to efficiently explore the configurational\nspace of HEA catalysts. Here, we introduce a novel approach that combines\nalchemical perturbation density functional theory (APDFT) with a graph-based\ncorrection scheme to explore the binding energy landscape HEAs. Our results\ndemonstrate that APDFT can accurately predict binding energies for\nisoelectronic permutations in HEAs at minimal computational cost, significantly\naccelerating configurational space sampling. However, APDFT errors increase\nsubstantially when permutations occur near binding sites. To address this\nissue, we developed a graph-based Gaussian process regression model to correct\ndiscrepancies between APDFT and conventional density functional theory values.\nOur approach enables the prediction of binding energies for hundreds of\nthousands of configurations with a mean average error of 30 meV, requiring a\nhandful of ab initio simulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8OQvU7eMUeSsIUDCG3DLE5-6BuJ27r9cq1MaChWQlag","pdfSize":"17039077"}
