Existing approaches struggle with CQA due to two main challenges:\n(1) precisely identifying conditions and their logical relationship, and (2)\nverifying and solving the conditions. To address these challenges, we propose\nChain of Condition, a novel prompting approach by firstly identifying all\nconditions and constructing their logical relationships explicitly according to\nthe document, then verifying whether these conditions are satisfied, finally\nsolving the logical expression by tools to indicate any missing conditions and\ngenerating the answer based on the resolved conditions. The experiments on two\nbenchmark conditional question answering datasets shows chain of condition\noutperforms existing prompting baselines, establishing a new state-of-the-art.\nFurthermore, with backbone models like GPT-3.5-Turbo or GPT-4, it surpasses all\nsupervised baselines with only few-shot settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dxNwn5gVBQbeSavCToUBwSd342-Wkju_BfiOsxuvXd0","pdfSize":"851485"}
