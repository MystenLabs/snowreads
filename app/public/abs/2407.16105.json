We\ninvestigate the possibility of constraining temperature directly from these SZ\nmeasurements but find that only weak constraints are possible for the most\nsignificant detections; for most clusters, an external temperature measurement\nis required to correctly measure integrated Compton-$y$. We also investigate\nthe impact of profile shape assumptions and find that these have a small but\nnon-negligible impact on measured Compton-$y$, at the $\\approx$5% level.\n  Informed by the results of these investigations, we recalibrate the Planck SZ\nobservable-mass scaling relation, using the updated NPIPE data release and a\nlarger sample of X-ray mass estimates. Along with the expected change in the\nhigh-mass end of the scaling relation, which does not impact Planck mass\nestimation, we also find hints of a low-mass deviation but this requires better\nunderstanding of the selection function in order to confirm.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jLlBbUNW19LKwOFq24G5E0JHN8OFbUwHym_G9Zz69kE","pdfSize":"3149383"}
