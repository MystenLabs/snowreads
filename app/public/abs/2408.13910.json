To this aim we study algebraically isomonodromic extensions of\nlocal systems and we relate them to variations of Hodge structures, for example\nwe show that the Mumford-Tate group at a generic point stays constant in an\nalgebraically isomonodromic extension of a variation of Hodge structure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
