In particular, we\nconsider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of\nthe sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a\nhead, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of\ndependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e.,\nplacing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing\nthe head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that\npostponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability\nwhile bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the\npredictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of\nmaximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of\ndependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by\nreal languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
