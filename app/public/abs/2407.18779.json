Consequently, these models can be used and fine-tuned for various\npurposes. Naturally, studying such models' use in the context of digital twins\nfor cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a relevant area of investigation. To this\nend, we provide perspectives on various aspects within the context of\ndeveloping digital twins for CPSs, where foundation models can be used to\nincrease the efficiency of creating digital twins, improve the effectiveness of\nthe capabilities they provide, and used as specialized fine-tuned foundation\nmodels acting as digital twins themselves. We also discuss challenges in using\nfoundation models in a more generic context. We use the case of an autonomous\ndriving system as a representative CPS to give examples. Finally, we provide\ndiscussions and open research directions that we believe are valuable for the\ndigital twin community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
