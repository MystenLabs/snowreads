Our\nobjective is to establish a comprehensive AutoML pipeline for clustering\nproblems and provide recommendations for selecting the most suitable\nalgorithms, thus opening up a new area of AutoML beyond the traditional\nsupervised learning settings. We compare our results against multiple\nclustering baselines and find that it outperforms all of them, hence\ndemonstrating the utility of similarity-based automated model selection for\nsolving clustering applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
