These\nmethods are inadequate in measuring the actual quality of empathy in\nconversations. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional empathy evaluation\nframework with three new methods for measuring empathy at (i) structural level\nusing three empathy-related dimensions, (ii) behavioral level using empathy\nbehavioral types, and (iii) overall level using an empathy lexicon, thereby\nfortifying the evaluation process. Experiments were conducted with the\nstate-of-the-art ECS models and large language models (LLMs) to show the\nframework's usefulness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Wemldx-wNni5A3Ru4eYENplrdYsqi4J2Jx8wpqeo7Z4","pdfSize":"404217"}
