The tunneling of this excess of quasiparticles across\nJosephson junctions is recognized as one of the main loss and decoherence\nmechanisms in superconducting qubits. Here we propose an additional loss\nmechanism arising from nonequilibrium quasiparticle densities: Ohmic loss due\nto quasiparticles residing in superconducting wires away from the junctions.\nOur theory leverages the recent experimental demonstration that the excess\nquasiparticles are in quasiequilibrium [T. Connolly et al.,\n$\\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.217001}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf\n132}, 217001 (2024)}$] and uses a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem\nto predict the amount of charge and flux noise generated by them. We show that\nthe resulting charge noise can be larger than dielectric loss due to amorphous\ntwo-level systems at frequencies in the MHz range, and find a\nlogarithmic-in-frequency ``nearly white\" contribution to flux noise that is\ncomparable to the flux noise observed in experiments. This shows that\nwire-resident quasiparticles are a universal source of loss and decoherence\neven when the quasiparticles are far away from Josephson junctions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
