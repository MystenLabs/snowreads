However, it remains a\nsignificant challenge to design a broadband achromatic metalens that maintains\nhigh efficiency under arbitrary polarization incidence. In this work, we design\na broadband achromatic metalens that achieves polarization-independent,\nhigh-efficiency focusing by effectively utilizing both co-polarization and\ncross-polarization components of the transmitted light. Using a minimalist\nanisotropic nanofin library, we optimize the phase distribution of the metalens\nat each designed wavelength with the particle swarm algorithm. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate a stable focal length with a deviation of less than\n4$\\%$ and an average focusing efficiency of 80.5$\\%$ in the visible wavelength\nrange of 450 to 650 nm. Moreover, we design a multi-wavelength off-axis\nbi-focal metalens to demonstrate the flexible control of output light phase and\ndispersion achieved by this method. The generality of this design enables its\nimplementation in various metasurface devices, accelerating applications in\nbroadband imaging and virtual/augmented reality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
