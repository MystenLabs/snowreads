To induce a\nspatially uniform rupturing process on foam boundaries, an additional plate is\nheated and placed on top of the unheated plates. For 30 separate foam samples,\nwe record network statistics related to cell side numbers and areas as the foam\ncoarsens over a half-minute. We find that the Aboav law and a quadratic Lewis\nLaw, two commonly used relations between network topology and geometry, hold\nwell for preheated foams. To track how well these laws are maintained as the\nfoam ages, we introduce metrics for measuring a foam's disorder over time and\nbuild simple autonomous models for these metrics. While the quadratic Lewis Law\nis found to hold well throughout the rupture process, the Aboav law breaks down\nrapidly when the Gini coefficient, used for measuring disparity of cell areas,\nis approximately .8.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_eVkzzSHuA6Kiwf3pcz7ZNvWThsYBd6WrHQU_x2OjJk","pdfSize":"896533"}
