We covered the $3.97$-h orbital\ncycle with 44 spectra taken between $2020$ and $2022$ and two epochs of\nphotometry observed in 2021 March and May. One of the light curves was\nsimultaneously obtained with spectroscopy to better account for the effects of\nirradiation of the donor star and the presence of accretion light. From the\nspectroscopy, we derived the radial velocity curve of the donor star metallic\nabsorption lines, constrained its spectral type to M0.5$-$M3.5 with no\nmeasurable changes in the effective temperature between the irradiated and\nnon-irradiated hemispheres of the star, and measured its projected rotational\nvelocity $v_\\mathrm{rot} \\sin i = 103 \\pm 2 \\, \\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThrough simultaneous modelling of the radial velocity and light curves, we\nderived values for the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star, $K_2 =\n188^{+1}_{-2} \\, \\mathrm{km} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the donor to white dwarf mass\nratio, $q=M_2/M_1 = 0.62 \\pm 0.02$, and the orbital inclination,\n$i={42^{\\circ}}^{+2^{\\circ}}_{-1^{\\circ}}$. These binary parameters yield\ndynamical masses of $M_{1} = 0.99^{+0.10}_{-0.09} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and\n$M_2 = 0.62^{+0.07}_{-0.06} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ ($68$ per cent confidence\nlevel). As found for the intermediate polars GK Per and XY Ari, the white dwarf\ndynamical mass in YY Dra significantly differs from several estimates obtained\nby modelling the X-ray spectral continuum.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
