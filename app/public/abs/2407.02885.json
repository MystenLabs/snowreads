Current LLM design\noften lacks this integration, leading to systems that may not fully align with\nhuman cognitive capabilities and limitations. Insufficient focus on\nincorporating cognitive science methods exacerbates biases in LLM outputs,\nwhile inconsistent application of user-centered design principles results in\nsub-optimal user experiences. To address these challenges, our position paper\nexplores the critical integration of cognitive ergonomics principles into LLM\ndesign, aiming to provide a comprehensive framework and practical guidelines\nfor ethical LLM development. Through our contributions, we seek to advance\nunderstanding and practice in integrating cognitive ergonomics into LLM\nsystems, fostering safer, more reliable, and ethically sound human-AI\ninteractions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Hn9nS7dlof-rQSi5sWExiSxUVcYc4HsEFOIpdi1AN_M","pdfSize":"305701"}
