A high level of\nrealism in lip movements is also required for the game and film production\nindustries. 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have been widely used for facial\nanalysis and animation. However, factors that could influence their use in\nfacial animation, such as the differences in facial features between recorded\nreal faces and animated synthetic faces, have not been given adequate\nattention. This paper investigates the mapping between real speakers and\nsimilar and non-similar 3DMMs and the impact on the resulting 3D lip motion.\nMouth height and mouth width are used to determine face similarity. The results\nshow that mapping 2D videos of real speakers with low mouth heights to 3D heads\nthat correspond to real speakers with high mouth heights, or vice versa,\ngenerates less good 3D lip motion. It is thus important that such a mismatch is\nconsidered when using a 2D recording of a real actor's lip movements to control\na 3D synthetic character.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
