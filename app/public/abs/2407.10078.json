We propose a novel approach that fine-tune Large Language Model (LLM)\nand use it impute missing data for recommendation systems. LLM which is trained\non vast amounts of text, is able to understand complex relationship among data\nand intelligently fill in missing information. This enriched data is then used\nby the recommendation system to generate more accurate and personalized\nsuggestions, ultimately enhancing the user experience. We evaluate our\nLLM-based imputation method across various tasks within the recommendation\nsystem domain, including single classification, multi-classification, and\nregression compared to traditional data imputation methods. By demonstrating\nthe superiority of LLM imputation over traditional methods, we establish its\npotential for improving recommendation system performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lnIHEOk0On09zvv4fixwqoDgdovzQfIexy6JE6pIY7E","pdfSize":"541130"}
