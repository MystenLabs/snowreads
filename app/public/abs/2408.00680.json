Good agreement with the early obtained results is a fairly\nstrong argument in favor of the point of view that the gas of string-like\ntopological excitations can indeed be considered as a additional kind of\nquasi-particles having the inner structure at high temperatures, especially\nnear the phase transition. The application of the developed formalism to the\ntheory of quantum turbulence is briefly discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
