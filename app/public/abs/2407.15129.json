Polymer is confined in two dimensions and is\nmodeled as a bead-spring chain immersed in a fluid described by the Brownian\nmultiparticle collision dynamics. At high strain, the polymer is stretched\nalong the flow direction following the applied flow, then recoils at flow\ninversion before flipping and elongate again. When strain is reduced, it may\nhappen that the chain recoils without flipping when the applied shear changes\nsign. Conformations are analyzed and compared to stiff polymers revealing more\ncompact patterns at low strains and less stretched configurations at high\nstrain. The dynamics is investigated by looking at the center-of-mass motion\nwhich shows a frequency doubling along the direction normal to the external\nflow. The center-of-mass correlation function is characterized by smaller\namplitudes when reducing bending rigidity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
