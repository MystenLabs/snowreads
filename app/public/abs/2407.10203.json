The ''Lagrangian'' expression of this projector\ndepends on the velocity and electric fields of the branes, but not on the\ncorresponding conserved charges. One can also construct the projector in a\n''Hamiltonian'' approach, by multiplying the conserved string, brane and\nmomentum charges with the corresponding gamma matrix involutions, adding them\nto the mass of the brane multiplied by the unit matrix, and normalizing the\nresulting expression. We show that these two procedures are equivalent.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
