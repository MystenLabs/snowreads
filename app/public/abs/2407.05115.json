We find that, rather\ncounter-intuitively, a single, properly timed, biphasic pulse can be more\neffective in defibrillating the tissue than low energy antitachycardia pacing\n(LEAP) which employs a sequence of such pulses, succeeding where the latter\napproach fails. Furthermore, we show that, with the help of adjoint\noptimization, it is possible to reduce the energy required for defibrillation\neven further, making it three orders of magnitude lower than that required by\nLEAP. Finally, we establish that this dramatic reduction is achieved through\nexploiting the sensitivity of the dynamics in vulnerable windows to promote\nannihilation of pairs of nearby phase singularities.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rIlqYnLXuj6NlAitNxLsBec1gopBChWT3X_fkNeEUAs","pdfSize":"3185906"}
