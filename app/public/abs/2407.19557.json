Numerical experiments on\nvarious SVEs, like the disturbed pendulum equation, the generalized\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck process and the rough Heston model are presented, comparing\nthe performance of neural SVEs, neural SDEs and Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONets).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
