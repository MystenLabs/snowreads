We address this question within the problem of a system\nof currently experimental interest, namely $^7$Li$-^{87}$Rb$_2$. We compare the\nEfimov scale parameter as well as the wave functions obtained using the BO\napproximation with those obtained using the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
