The well-studied \\emph{trace\nreconstruction} problem asks how many traces are required to reconstruct an\nunknown binary sequence with high probability. In this paper, we study the\nmultivariate version of this problem for matrices and hypermatrices, where a\ntrace is generated by deleting each row/column of the matrix or each slice of\nthe hypermatrix independently with a constant probability. Previously,\nKrishnamurthy et al. showed that $\\exp(\\widetilde{O}(n^{d/(d+2)}))$ traces\nsuffice to reconstruct any unknown $n\\times n$ matrix (for $d=2$) and any\nunknown $n^{\\times d}$ hypermatrix. By developing a dimension reduction\nprocedure and establishing a multivariate version of the Littlewood-type\nresult, we improve this upper bound by showing that\n$\\exp(\\widetilde{O}(n^{3/7}))$ traces suffice to reconstruct any unknown\n$n\\times n$ matrix, and $\\exp(\\widetilde{O}(n^{3/5}))$ traces suffice to\nreconstruct any unknown $n^{\\times d}$ hypermatrix. This breaks the tendency to\ntrivial $\\exp(O(n))$ as the dimension $d$ grows.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
