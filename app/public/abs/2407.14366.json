The interplay between altermagnetism and topological physics becomes\nan important topic in the condensed matter physics. In this letter, we propose\nthat the altermagnets Ce4X3 (X = As, Sb, Bi) hosts Dirac fermions in their\nelectronic structure through first-principles calculations and tight-binding\nmodel analysis. When subjected to external magnetic field, the altermagnets\nCe4X3 (X = As, Sb, Bi) change from altermagnetic state to ferromagnetic state.\nAccompanied with magnetic order transition, the four-fold degenerate Dirac\npoints is transited into sixtuple degenerate points. Especially, spin-orbital\ncoupling effect has little influence about the Dirac fermions. The topological\nphases in the altermagnetic state hold the exotic spin-splitter torque and\nremarkable nonlinear transport effect. Our work paves the way for exploring the\ninterplay between altermagnetism and non-trivial topological phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vR0qr15wVExbRlBzIM1-HoBY28G8SU36KYnsh5iqp_k","pdfSize":"20597583"}
