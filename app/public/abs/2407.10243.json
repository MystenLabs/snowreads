We show that a power-law convergence rate of an\ninterface to an SLE curve can be derived from a power-law convergence rate for\nan appropriate martingale observable provided the discrete curve satisfies a\nspecific bound on crossing events, the Kempannien-Smirnov condition, along with\nan estimate on the growth of the derivative of the SLE curve. We apply our\nframework to show that the exploration process for critical site percolation on\nhexagonal lattice converges to the SLE$_6$ curve with a power-law convergence\nrate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
