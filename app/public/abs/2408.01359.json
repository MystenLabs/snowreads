Let $\\mathcal C$ be a\nfunctorially finite exact subcategory of $\\Lambda$-mod with enough projective\nand injective objects and $\\mathcal S (\\mathcal C)$ be its monomorphism\ncategory. It turns out that the category $\\mathcal S (\\mathcal C)$ has almost\nsplit sequences. We show an explicit formula for the Auslander-Reiten\ntranslation in $\\mathcal S (\\mathcal C)$. Furthermore, if $\\mathcal C$ is a\nstably $d$-Calabi-Yau Frobenius category, we calculate objects under powers of\nAuslander-Reiten translation in the triangulated category $\\overline{\\mathcal\nS(\\mathcal C)}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
