Using a high-level set of assumptions, we show that existence of a\nstationary path for such models is almost automatic and does not require\nparameter restrictions when the noise term is not compactly supported. We then\nstudy in details statistical inference in a dynamic version of a multivariate\nprobit type model, as a particular case of our general construction. To avoid a\ncomplex likelihood optimization, we combine pseudo-likelihood and pairwise\nlikelihood methods for which asymptotic results are obtained for a single path\nanalysis and also for panel data, using ergodic theorems for multi-indexed\npartial sums. The latter scenario is particularly important for analyzing\nabsence-presence of species in Ecology, a field where data are often collected\nfrom surveys at various locations. Our results also give a theoretical\nbackground for such models which are often used by the practitioners but\nwithout a probabilistic framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
