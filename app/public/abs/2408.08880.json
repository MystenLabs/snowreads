{"id":"2408.08880","title":"The Distribution of Vaccine among Countries in the Case of a Pandemic","authors":"B\\'ela Vizv\\'ari, Gergely Kov\\'acs","authorsParsed":[["Vizvári","Béla",""],["Kovács","Gergely",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2024 17:03:38 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-20","timestamp":1722704618000,"abstract":"  Purpose: Only few companies were able to produce vaccine again COVID-19.\nThus, one producer supplied it to many countries. The distribution was not\neffective. Some countries overstocked the vaccine while other countries were\nnot able to buy enough. The purpose of the present paper is to provide with a\nframe such that one producer distributes the vaccine to a set of countries in a\nway that the shortage is minimized. Methodology: The consumption of the\ncountries are approximated by regression functions taking into account the\nsaturation of the process. The distribution of the vaccine is determined by MIP\nmodels of operations research. Findings: Effective distribution of vaccine can\nbe obtained for even a large number of countries. Both the level of the\nshortage and the number of the consecutive shortage days in a country can be\ncontrolled. Practical implications: A group of countries can act as a single\npartner of a pharmaceutical company. They can get a steady supply. The company\ngets a well-organized delivery plan. Social implications: More people can be\nsaved because of the steady supply of the vaccine. Originality: The paper\ndevelops a new concept for the fair distribution of vaccines between countries.\nThis concept and the method derived from it can be applied in the event of\nfuture pandemics on a global scale.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oDvAi0JxruoNdgs7neK4U7qUdSR9ZZ5kc419x36i9fA","pdfSize":"650972"}
