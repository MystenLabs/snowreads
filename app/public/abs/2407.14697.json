The experimental data covering charge changes of $\\Delta\nZ$ = 1-4 are reproduced well by the isospin-dependent quantum molecular\ndynamics (IQMD) coupled with the evaporation GEMINI (IQMD+GEMINI) model. We\nfurther explore the mechanisms underlying the single-proton removal reaction in\nthis model framework. We conclude that the cross sections from direct proton\nknockout exhibit a overall weak dependence on the mass number of $\\mathrm{Si}$\nprojectiles. The proton evaporation induced after the projectile excitation\nsignificantly affects the cross sections for neutron-deficient $\\mathrm{Si}$\nisotopes, while neutron evaporation plays a crucial role in the reactions of\nneutron-rich $\\mathrm{Si}$ isotopes. It is presented that the relative\nmagnitude of one-proton and one-neutron separation energies is an essential\nfactor that influences evaporation processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"17BaO1CaqFKTWufDJmrjRGPS36zDv_h9LuIGhTomzGo","pdfSize":"240582"}
