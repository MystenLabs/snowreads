While most experimental proposals\nso far focused on quantum simulations of ensembles of two-level systems, the\npossibility of tuning the current-phase relation beyond the sinusoidal regime\npaves the way for studying statistical physics models with larger local Hilbert\nspaces. Here, we investigate a particular JJA architecture that can be mapped\ninto a $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model. Through matrix-product-states simulations\nand bosonization analysis, we show that few experimentally accessible control\nparameters allow for the exploration of the rich phase diagrams of the\nassociated low-energy field theories. Our results expand the horizon for analog\nquantum simulations with JJAs towards models that can not be efficiently\ncaptured with qubit architectures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
