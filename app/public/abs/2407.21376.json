It involves extensive dynamic interactions among\nnumerous nodes. Most existing approaches explore the intricate temporal\npatterns hidden in a DWDG from the purely data-driven perspective, which\nsuffers from accuracy loss when a DWDG exhibits strong fluctuations over time.\nTo address this issue, this study proposes a novel\nExtended-Kalman-Filter-Incorporated Latent Feature (EKLF) model to represent a\nDWDG from the model-driven perspective. Its main idea is divided into the\nfollowing two-fold ideas: a) adopting a control model, i.e., the Extended\nKalman Filter (EKF), to track the complex temporal patterns precisely with its\nnonlinear state-transition and observation functions; and b) introducing an\nalternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to train the latent features (LFs)\nalternatively for precisely representing a DWDG. Empirical studies on DWDG\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed EKLF model outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for missing edge\nweights of a DWDG. It unveils the potential for precisely representing a DWDG\nby incorporating a control model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
