This work explores how diffusion\nmodels can generate images from prompts requiring artistic creativity or\nspecialized knowledge. We introduce the Realistic-Fantasy Benchmark (RFBench),\na novel evaluation framework blending realistic and fantastical scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, we propose the Realistic-Fantasy Network (RFNet), a\ntraining-free approach integrating diffusion models with LLMs. Extensive human\nevaluations and GPT-based compositional assessments demonstrate our approach's\nsuperiority over state-of-the-art methods.
