In this paper we detail a new method of\ncalculating plasma microfields using configuration-resolved pseudoatom\nmolecular dynamics. This approach accounts for both quantum atomic structure\nand N-body effects, similar to density functional theory molecular dynamics,\nbut with less computational cost. We present pseudoatom microfields at\nconditions relevant for recent laboratory experiments. Compared to established\nmicrofield codes we find moderate deviations at solid density conditions and\nstrong agreement at lower plasma densities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
