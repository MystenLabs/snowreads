The initial data is compactly supported in the space variable and has\na polynomial tail in the microscopic velocity. We show that the solution can be\ndecomposed into a particle-like part (polynomial tail) and a fluid-like part\n(Gaussian tail). The particle-like part decays exponentially in both space and\ntime, while the fluid-like part corresponds to the behavior of the compressible\nNavier-Stokes equation, which dominates the long time behavior and exhibits\nrich wave motion. The nonlinear wave interactions in the fluid-like part are\nprecisely characterized and therefore we are able to distinguish the linear and\nnonlinear wave of the solution. It is notable that although the solution has\npolynomial tail in the velocity initially, the transition process from the\npolynomial to the Gaussian tail can be quantitatively revealed due to the\ncollision with the background global Maxwellian.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
