Thereby,\nevaporation takes place under strong confinement, i.e., we consider a drop that\nspreads on one of two parallel plates that form a narrow gap. Our gradient\ndynamics model describes the coupled dynamics of the vertically averaged vapor\ndensity profile, the drop height profile, and the vertically averaged\nsaturation profile in the porous layer. The underlying free energy incorporates\nsaturation-dependent wettability, capillarity of the drop and within the porous\nlayer, air and vapor entropy, and an entropic contribution relevant close to\ncomplete filling of the porous layer. After developing the model we discuss the\nresulting sorption isotherm and illustrate typical drop spreading and\nimbibition behavior including the formation of a saturation halo within the\nporous substrate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
