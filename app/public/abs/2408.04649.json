Unlike existing\nLLM-based approaches that focus solely on fine-tuning with large-scale\ndatasets, we propose a new prompting method, called \\textit{Chain of Stance}\n(CoS). In particular, it positions LLMs as expert stance detectors by\ndecomposing the stance detection process into a series of intermediate,\nstance-related assertions that culminate in the final judgment. This approach\nleads to significant improvements in classification performance. We conducted\nextensive experiments using four SOTA LLMs on the SemEval 2016 dataset,\ncovering the zero-shot and few-shot learning setups. The results indicate that\nthe proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with an F1 score of 79.84\nin the few-shot setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
