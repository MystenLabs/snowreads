However, traditional methods are not\nideal for multi-building and multi-floor environments due to the scalability\nissues. Therefore, more and more researchers have employed deep learning\ntechniques to enable scalable indoor localization. This paper introduces a\nnovel semi-supervised learning framework for neural networks based on wireless\naccess point selection, noise injection, and Mean Teacher model, which\nleverages unlabeled fingerprints to enhance localization performance. The\nproposed framework can manage hybrid in/outsourcing and voluntarily contributed\ndatabases and continually expand the fingerprint database with newly submitted\nunlabeled fingerprints during service. The viability of the proposed framework\nwas examined using two established deep-learning models with the UJIIndoorLoc\ndatabase. The experimental results suggest that the proposed framework\nsignificantly improves localization performance compared to the supervised\nlearning-based approach in terms of floor-level coordinate estimation using\nEvAAL metric. It shows enhancements up to 10.99% and 8.98% in the former\nscenario and 4.25% and 9.35% in the latter, respectively with additional\nstudies highlight the importance of the essential components of the proposed\nframework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
