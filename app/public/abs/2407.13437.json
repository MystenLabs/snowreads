To address this challenging task in practical\nscenarios where labeled normal condition images are not accessible in training,\nwe propose FREST, a novel feature restoration framework for source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) of semantic segmentation to adverse conditions. FREST\nalternates two steps: (1) learning the condition embedding space that only\nseparates the condition information from the features and (2) restoring\nfeatures of adverse condition images on the learned condition embedding space.\nBy alternating these two steps, FREST gradually restores features where the\neffect of adverse conditions is reduced. FREST achieved a state of the art on\ntwo public benchmarks (i.e., ACDC and RobotCar) for SFDA to adverse conditions.\nMoreover, it shows superior generalization ability on unseen datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
