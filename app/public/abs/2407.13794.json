When such a ring is placed on a rough rod and\nreleased with some angular velocity, it may continue to vertically spin around\nthe rod for some time instead of falling down immediately. It was observed that\ntwo different kinds of motion for the rod exist, which are referred to as\nsingle point and double point contact motion, based on the number of contact\npoints of the ring that are in contact with the rod. Single point contact\nmotion was observed for rings and double point contact motion was observed in\nthe case of a washer. We investigated the characteristics of the single point\ncontact motion. An explanation is provided for the single point contact motion\nof the ring and an analysis of the forces on the ring is made. We observe a\nhyperbolic decay in the angular velocity of the ring. An explicit solution is\ndetermined for the single point contact motion of the ring and the obtained\nsolutions match the observed motion of the ring.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dkYgPTvq6n4l8R6EZtr0On3lXEnM8ByecJ6mu2jBkuA","pdfSize":"556631"}
