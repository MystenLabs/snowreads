In an orthogonal direction, we present a simple yet\neffective method to expand the training data by interpolating between\ninstance-level feature statistics across labeled and unlabeled sets. Our\nmethod, dubbed Targeted Style Adversary (TSA), is motivated by two\nobservations: (i) the input domain is reflected in feature statistics, and (ii)\nface recognition model performance is influenced by style information. Shifting\ntowards an unlabeled style implicitly synthesizes challenging training\ninstances. We devise a recognizability metric to constraint our framework to\npreserve the inherent identity-related information of labeled instances. The\nefficacy of our method is demonstrated through evaluations on unconstrained\nbenchmarks, outperforming or being on par with its competitors while offering\nnearly a 70\\% improvement in training speed and 40\\% less memory consumption.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
