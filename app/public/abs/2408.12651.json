We explore operators with large\nR-charge. We identify Penrose limits in the holographic duals with geometry\n$\\rm AdS_4\\times S^2\\times S^2\\times\\Sigma$, which describe, for each theory, a\nspectrum of `seed' operators which each give rise to a BMN-like sector\ndescribed by a pp-wave. We relate the number of BMN-like sectors to the flavor\nsymmetry of the CFT. For a sample of theories including the Janus interface,\nD3/D5 BCFTs and BCFTs with 3d SCFTs on the boundary, we determine the spectra\nof nearby operators and discuss the field theory realization of the seed\noperators. We further identify families of Penrose limits which give rise to\nmore general pp-wave sectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
