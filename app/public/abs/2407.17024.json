Quantum computing serves as a prime example facing this issue, due to\nthe hype surrounding it. Alleviating high workloads for teachers, often\naccompanied with individual teaching, is crucial for continuous high quality\neducation. Therefore, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to\ngenerate educational content can be valuable. We conducted two complementary\nstudies exploring the feasibility of using GPT-4 to automatically generate tips\nfor students. In the first one students (N=46) solved four multiple-choice\nquantum computing questions with either the help of expert-created or\nLLM-generated tips. To correct for possible biases towards LLMs, we introduced\ntwo additional conditions, making some participants believe that they were\ngiven expert-created tips, when they were given LLM-generated tips and vice\nversa. Our second study (N=23) aimed to directly compare the LLM-generated and\nexpert-created tips, evaluating their quality, correctness and helpfulness,\nwith both experienced educators and students participating. Participants in our\nsecond study found that the LLM-generated tips were significantly more helpful\nand pointed better towards relevant concepts than the expert-created tips,\nwhile being more prone to be giving away the answer. While participants in the\nfirst study performed significantly better in answering the quantum computing\nquestions when given tips labeled as LLM-generated, even if they were created\nby an expert. This phenomenon could be a placebo effect induced by the\nparticipants' biases for LLM-generated content. Ultimately, we find that\nLLM-generated tips are good enough to be used instead of expert tips in the\ncontext of quantum computing basics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vJP0iNJfIJm3pZ03t1NGYD5YahrGipGWaXQiT67wLcc","pdfSize":"1223654","objectId":"0xf6d6e72b1ab20d6c74ef125510cfdcb5067460942f6644c0a782954884e26ac0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
