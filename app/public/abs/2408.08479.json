One important\nconjecture in this vein is that a consistent quantum gravity theory may not\npossess a global symmetry, but rather only local gauge symmetries, a conjecture\nwhich has recently been extended to generalized global symmetries.\nHistorically, this conjecture arose from a heuristic argument using black hole\nthermodynamics and was recently proven to hold in AdS/CFT. In Horava-Lifshitz\ngravity, a presumed consistent theory of quantum gravity for which there is\nstrong evidence for both black hole thermodynamics and a holographic\nconstruction, spacetime is endowed with a preferred dynamical spacelike\nfoliation. The theory has a leaf reparameterization symmetry that is neither\nglobal nor local gauge, hyperbolic and elliptic equations of motion, a lack of\nsplittability, and universal horizon black hole solutions. The\nreparameterization symmetry is \"mixed\": it is a local symmetry in one\ncoordinate that remains global on each leaf. More broadly it is an example of\nboth unfree and projectable gauge symmetries. We show how the corresponding\ncharge, which has previously not been considered thermodynamically, coupled\nwith the other features above, resolves some outstanding tensions. Hence this\nmixed symmetry is not precluded by horizon thermodynamics, but is instead an\nintegral feature. This expands the types of symmetries in quantum gravity\ncompatible with black hole thermodynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
