However, for neural\nsynapses, classical molecular communication is described by the formation of\nligand-receptor complexes, which leads to the opening of ion channels.\nMoreover, there are some conditions that need to be fulfilled before the\nopening of the ion channel. In this study, we will consider the gut-brain axis,\nwhere neurotransmitters diffuse through the synaptic cleft, considering\nmolecular communication. On the vagus nerve (VN) membrane, i.e., the\npost-synaptic membrane of the synapse, it undergoes a quantum communication\n(QC), which initiates the opening of the ion channel, thus initiating the\ncommunication signal from the gut to the brain. It evolves a new paradigm of\ncommunication approach, Molecular Quantum (MolQ) communication. Based on the QC\nmodel, we theoretically analyzes the output states, and QC is simulated\nconsidering the incoming neurotransmitter's concentration and validated by\nanalyzing the entropy and the mutual information of the input, i.e.,\nneurotransmitter's concentration, and output, i.e., ion channel opening.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
