Robust\nPhase Estimation (RPE) has emerged as a practical and effective calibration\ntechnique aimed at tackling this challenge. It combines a provably efficient\nnumber of control pulses with a classical post-processing algorithm to estimate\nthe phase accumulated by a quantum gate. We introduce Bayesian Robust Phase\nEstimation (BRPE), an innovative approach that integrates Bayesian parameter\nestimation into the classical post-processing phase to reduce the sampling\noverhead. Our numerical analysis shows that BRPE markedly reduces phase\nestimation errors, requiring approximately $50\\%$ fewer samples than standard\nRPE. Specifically, in an ideal, noise-free setting, it achieves up to a $96\\%$\nreduction in average absolute estimation error for a fixed sample cost of $88$\nshots when compared to RPE. Under a depolarizing noise model, it attains up to\na $47\\%$ reduction for a fixed cost of $176$ shots. Additionally, we adapt BRPE\nfor Ramsey spectroscopy applications and successfully implement it\nexperimentally in a trapped ion system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
