Motivated by the known nontrivial\nphase-space topography of the energy functional of the corresponding\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, we explore Husimi densities of quantum energy\neigenstates in the classical phase space of the Schroedinger field. With\ninteractions turned off, the energy levels are highly degenerate and the Husimi\ndensities do not manifest any particular localization properties. With\ninteractions turned on, the degeneracy is lifted, and a selection of energy\nlevels emerges whose Husimi densities are localized around low-dimensional\nsurfaces in the phase space.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
