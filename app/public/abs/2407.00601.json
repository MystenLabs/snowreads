Within this framework, nerve\nimpulses can be represented as nonlinear excitations of low amplitude depicted\nby the damped nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation and their adiabatic evolution\ncan be analyzed using direct perturbative methods. Based on the foregoing, we\ncarry out the current study using the quasi-stationary approach to obtain the\nadiabatic evolution of solitons embedded in lipid bilayers under the influence\nof a viscous elastic fluid. This analysis encompasses liquid-to-gel transition\nof the lipid bilayers, for whose dark and bright solitons arise, respectively.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
