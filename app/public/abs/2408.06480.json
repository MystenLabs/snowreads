The equivalent consists of a generator with series\nimpedance and a parallel load (generalized Ward equivalent), integrating\ncontrol systems such as the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) and the Speed\nRegulator (GOV) in a test system known as PST-16. The main objective is to\nidentify the parameters of the control systems and other parameters inherent to\nthe generator so that the response of the equivalent system is similar to the\nresponse of the complete system.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sVssPuVSfqkUi_KAhZQTsKyasOonKssL6Edeha9Q4KY","pdfSize":"1232672"}
