Meanwhile,\nautomated accounts, known as social bots, contribute more to the misinformation\ndissemination. In this paper, we explore the interplay between social bots and\nmisinformation on the Sina Weibo platform. We propose a comprehensive and\nlarge-scale misinformation dataset, containing 11,393 misinformation and 16,416\nunbiased real information with multiple modality information, with 952,955\nrelated users. We propose a scalable weak-surprised method to annotate social\nbots, obtaining 68,040 social bots and 411,635 genuine accounts. To the best of\nour knowledge, this dataset is the largest dataset containing misinformation\nand social bots. We conduct comprehensive experiments and analysis on this\ndataset. Results show that social bots play a central role in misinformation\ndissemination, participating in news discussions to amplify echo chambers,\nmanipulate public sentiment, and reverse public stances.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uTAuERg8UymwDQLr99Ugf5aEoUk5bsSNKDIYWXeiZaA","pdfSize":"1028576"}
