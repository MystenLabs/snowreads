In this design, the camera lens is replaced by another optical\nelement that interferes with the incoming light. The image is recovered from\nthe raw sensor measurements using a reconstruction algorithm. Yet, the quality\nof the reconstructed images is not satisfactory. To mitigate this, we propose\nutilizing a pre-trained diffusion model with a control network and a learned\nseparable transformation for reconstruction. This allows us to build a\nprototype flat camera with high-quality imaging, presenting state-of-the-art\nresults in both terms of quality and perceptuality. We demonstrate its ability\nto leverage also textual descriptions of the captured scene to further enhance\nreconstruction. Our reconstruction method which leverages the strong\ncapabilities of a pre-trained diffusion model can be used in other imaging\nsystems for improved reconstruction results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
