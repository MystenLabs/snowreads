The\ntraditional bead-pull method, while effective, involves mechanical complexities\nand is prone to errors from wire perturbations. The innovative method reported\nhere leverages the simplicity and accuracy of free-falling beads to mitigate\nthese issues. This technique eliminates the need for a wire-pulley system,\nthereby simplifying the experimental setup and reducing potential mechanical\nerrors. We detail the development and operational principles of this new\nmethod, including the design of a compact, portable measurement device that\nintegrates a bead/droplet release system and a bead detection system linked to\na Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The device has been tested with a three-gap\nbuncher cavity and a scaled Alvarez-type cavity, demonstrating its ability to\nperform rapid, reliable field measurements under various challenging\nconditions, including low signal-to-noise ratios and environmental vibrations.\nThe results confirm the method's superiority in precision and operational\nefficiency, potentially setting a new standard for RF cavity diagnostics and\ntuning.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"KuwQlDZHMn7yHiQ3ZtBA3JNEwj1T5SumOTVq6X2mEP4","pdfSize":"7036925"}
