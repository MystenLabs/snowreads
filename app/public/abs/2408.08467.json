Our idea consists of using two control terms\nbased on state feedback, one composed of a convex combination of linear gains\nweighted by the normalized membership grade, as in traditional PDC, and the\nother composed of linear gains weighted by the time-derivatives of the\nmembership functions. We present the design conditions as Linear Matrix\nInequalities, solvable through numerical optimization tools. Numerical examples\nare given to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach, which contains\nthe the traditional PDC as a special case.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
