Although researchers proposed\nvarious MR-HD approaches, the research community holds two main issues. The\nfirst is a lack of comprehensive and reproducible experiments across various\nmethods, datasets, and video-text features. This is because no unified training\nand evaluation codebase covers multiple settings. The second is user-unfriendly\ndesign. Because previous works use different libraries, researchers set up\nindividual environments. In addition, most works release only the training\ncodes, requiring users to implement the whole inference process of MR-HD.\nLighthouse addresses these issues by implementing a unified reproducible\ncodebase that includes six models, three features, and five datasets. In\naddition, it provides an inference API and web demo to make these methods\neasily accessible for researchers and developers. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat Lighthouse generally reproduces the reported scores in the reference\npapers. The code is available at https://github.com/line/lighthouse.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
