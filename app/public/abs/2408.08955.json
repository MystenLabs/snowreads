We find the conditions for fault-tolerance can be\nachieved with local two-qubit Rydberg gate and non-local Bell pair errors below\n1% and 10%, respectively, without requiring distillation or space-time\noverheads. Realizing the interconnects with a lens, a single optical cavity, or\nan array of cavities enables a Bell pair generation rate in the 1-50 MHz range.\nWhen directly interfacing logical qubits, this rate translates to\nerror-correction cycles in the 25-2000 kHz range, satisfying all requirements\nfor fault tolerance and in the upper range fast enough for 100 kHz logical\nclock cycles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
