The dual nature of these systems\ninfluences both users and creators: users' preferences are affected by the\nitems they are recommended, while creators are incentivized to alter their\ncontents such that it is recommended more frequently. We define a model, called\nuser-creator feature dynamics, to capture the dual influences of recommender\nsystems. We prove that a recommender system with dual influence is guaranteed\nto polarize, causing diversity loss in the system. We then investigate, both\ntheoretically and empirically, approaches for mitigating polarization and\npromoting diversity in recommender systems. Unexpectedly, we find that common\ndiversity-promoting approaches do not work in the presence of dual influence,\nwhile relevancy-optimizing methods like top-$k$ recommendation can prevent\npolarization and improve diversity of the system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
