Here we present an alternative, more direct proof of this inequality.\nOur proof uses only the strong subadditivity property of the von Neumann\nentropy together with a few physical assumptions about the ground state density\noperator. Our derivation naturally generalizes to a variety of systems,\nincluding spatially inhomogeneous systems with defects and boundaries, higher\ndimensional systems, and mixed states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
