To better quantify how our prompting strategy affects\nanthropomorphic features like humor, authenticity, and favorability we present\nCrowd Vote - an adaptation of Crowd Score that allows for judges to elect a\nlarge language model (LLM) candidate over competitors answering the same or\nsimilar prompts. To visualize the responses of our LLM, and the effectiveness\nof our prompting strategy we propose an end-to-end framework for creating\nhigh-fidelity artificial intelligence (AI) driven digital avatars. This\npipeline effectively captures an individual's essence for interaction and our\nstreaming algorithm delivers a high-quality digital avatar with real-time\naudio-video streaming from server to mobile device. Both our visualization\ntool, and our Crowd Vote metrics demonstrate our AI driven digital avatars have\nstate-of-the-art humor, authenticity, and favorability outperforming all\ncompetitors and baselines. In the case of our Donald Trump and Joe Biden\navatars, their authenticity and favorability are rated higher than even their\nreal-world equivalents.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
