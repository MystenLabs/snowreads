Here we\npresent a detailed deconstruction of one of the 'real-time' models that was key\ncontributor to this response, focussing on the model adaptations required over\nthree pandemic years characterised by the imposition of lockdowns, mass\nvaccination campaigns and the emergence of new pandemic strains. The Bayesian\nmodel integrates an array of surveillance and other data sources including a\nnovel approach to incorporating prevalence estimates from an unprecedented\nlarge-scale household survey. We present a full range of estimates of the\nepidemic history and the changing severity of the infection, quantify the\nimpact of the vaccination programme and deconstruct contributing factors to the\nreproduction number. We further investigate the sensitivity of model-derived\ninsights to the availability and timeliness of prevalence data, identifying its\nimportance to the production of robust estimates.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iSyaKZQ0lFq88r4w6L-3ECPqMEyo8t_G_0CdWApMcds","pdfSize":"6653896"}
