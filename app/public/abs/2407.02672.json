The proposed zero-bit\nself-adaptation approach differs from classical forward and backward adaptation\napproaches in that the de-emphasis coefficient is estimated at the receiver,\nfrom the decoded pre-emphasized signal. This eliminates the need to transmit\ninformation that arises from forward adaptation as well as the signal-filter\nlag that is inherent in backward adaptation. Evaluation results show that the\nde-emphasis coefficient can be estimated accurately from the decoded\npre-emphasized signal and that the proposed zero-bit self-adaptation approach\nprovides comparable subjective improvement to forward adaptation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
