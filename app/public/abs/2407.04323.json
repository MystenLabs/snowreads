A hair-thin multimode fiber stands out as a very\nattractive platform for minimally invasive imaging. Here we propose and\nexperimentally demonstrate a non-interferometric non-iterative approach for\nhigh-speed high-resolution label-free quantitative phase imaging via a\nmultimode fiber, unlocking multiple applications in life science and\nbioimaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
