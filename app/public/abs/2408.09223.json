Reservoir computing, a\ntype of recurrent neural network with fixed nonlinear units, is one such\nprediction method and is valued for its ease of training. Organic\nelectrochemical transistors (OECTs) are physical devices with nonlinear\ntransient properties that can be used as the nonlinear units of a reservoir\ncomputer. We present a theoretical framework for simulating reservoir computers\nusing OECTs as the non-linear units as a test bed for designing physical\nreservoir computers. We present a proof of concept demonstrating that such an\nimplementation can accurately predict the Lorenz attractor with comparable\nperformance to standard reservoir computer implementations. We explore the\neffect of operating parameters and find that the prediction performance\nstrongly depends on the pinch-off voltage of the OECTs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
