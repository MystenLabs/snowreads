This overlooks the inherent characteristic\nof time-series data containing both time and frequency features. In this work,\nwe present Spectral eXplanation (SpectralX), an XAI framework that provides\ntime-frequency explanations for time-series black-box classifiers. This easily\nadaptable framework enables users to \"plug-in\" various perturbation-based XAI\nmethods for any pre-trained time-series classification models to assess their\nimpact on the explanation quality without having to modify the framework\narchitecture. Additionally, we introduce Feature Importance Approximations\n(FIA), a new perturbation-based XAI method. These methods consist of feature\ninsertion, deletion, and combination techniques to enhance computational\nefficiency and class-specific explanations in time-series classification tasks.\nWe conduct extensive experiments in the generated synthetic dataset and various\nUCR Time-Series datasets to first compare the explanation performance of FIA\nand other existing perturbation-based XAI methods in both time-domain and\ntime-frequency domain, and then show the superiority of our FIA in the\ntime-frequency domain with the SpectralX framework. Finally, we conduct a user\nstudy to confirm the practicality of our FIA in SpectralX framework for\nclass-specific time-frequency based time-series explanations.
