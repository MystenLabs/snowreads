Unlike traditional methods that\nrely on topological edge and corner modes, our strategy leverages the robust\nchiral propagation of bulk modes. By introducing nonlinearity into the system,\nwe find a stable bulk soliton, akin to the topological valley Hall effects. The\nchiral bulk soliton exhibits remarkable stability; the energy does not decay\neven after a long-distance propagation; and the corresponding Fourier spectrum\nconfirms the absence of inter-valley scattering indicating a valley-locking\nproperty. Our findings not only contribute to the fundamental understanding of\nnonlinear photonic systems but also hold significant practical implications for\nthe design and optimization of photonic devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ppOejd4mr_xVvuLXypgp6YTKwoNBG8hBTfkXk7JXlxo","pdfSize":"1900022"}
