We investigate the use of neural\nnetworks for lifelong graph summarization. Assuming we observe the web graph at\na certain time, we train the networks to summarize graph vertices. We apply\nthis trained network to summarize the vertices of the changed graph at the next\npoint in time. Subsequently, we continue training and evaluating the network to\nperform lifelong graph summarization. We use the GNNs Graph-MLP and GraphSAINT,\nas well as an MLP baseline, to summarize the temporal graphs. We compare\n$1$-hop and $2$-hop summaries. We investigate the impact of reusing parameters\nfrom a previous snapshot by measuring the backward and forward transfer and the\nforgetting rate of the neural networks. Our extensive experiments on ten weekly\nsnapshots of a web graph with over $100$M edges, sampled in 2012 and 2022, show\nthat all networks predominantly use $1$-hop information to determine the\nsummary, even when performing $2$-hop summarization. Due to the heterogeneity\nof web graphs, in some snapshots, the $2$-hop summary produces over ten times\nmore vertex summaries than the $1$-hop summary. When using the network trained\non the last snapshot from 2012 and applying it to the first snapshot of 2022,\nwe observe a strong drop in accuracy. We attribute this drop over the ten-year\ntime warp to the strongly increased heterogeneity of the web graph in 2022.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
