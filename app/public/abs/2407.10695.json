While NeRF\nhas shown impressive results in controlled settings, it struggles with\ntransient objects commonly found in dynamic and time-varying scenes. Our\nframework called \\textit{Inpainting Enhanced NeRF}, or \\ours, enhances the\nconventional NeRF by drawing inspiration from the technique of image\ninpainting. Specifically, our approach extends the Multi-Layer Perceptrons\n(MLP) of NeRF, enabling it to simultaneously generate intrinsic properties\n(static color, density) and extrinsic transient masks. We introduce an\ninpainting module that leverages the transient masks to effectively exclude\nocclusions, resulting in improved volume rendering quality. Additionally, we\npropose a new training strategy with frequency regularization to address the\nsparsity issue of low-frequency transient components. We evaluate our approach\non internet photo collections of landmarks, demonstrating its ability to\ngenerate high-quality novel views and achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
