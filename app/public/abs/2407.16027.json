This work details the hardware and software modi-fications implemented\nto deliver 10 MeV UHDR electron beams with a Linear Accelerator Elekta SL 18 MV\nand the beam characteristics obtained. GafChromic EBT XD films and an Advanced\nMarkus chamber were used for the dosimetry characterization, while a silicon\nsensor assessed the machine's beam pulses stability and repeatability. Dose per\npulse, average dose rate and instantaneous dose rate in the pulse were\nevaluated for four experimental settings, varying the source-to-surface\ndis-tance and the beam collimation, i.e. with and without the use of a\ncylindrical applicator. Results showed dose per pulse from 0.6 Gy to a few tens\nof Gy and average dose rate up to 300 Gy/s. The obtained results demonstrate\nthe possibility to perform in-vitro radiobiology experiments and test of new\ntechnologies for beam monitoring and dosimetry at the upgraded LINAC, thus\ncontributing to the electron UHDR research field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
