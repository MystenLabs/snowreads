The\nso-called double ramification (DR) cycles provide a natural framework embracing\nmost of these classes. They are both fundamental in recent developments in\nenumerative geometry and central in algebraic geometry, because they express\nthe loci where line bundles on a family of curves are trivial along the fibres.\nThe aim of this paper is to show that the above $r$th root method can be\nregarded as a technique to remove excess intersection occurring in the presence\nof an unwanted subcurve which we call the parasitic curve. To this end, we\nreinterpret the DR cycle as a distinguished component of the degeneracy class\nof a map of vector bundles. When applied to moduli of $r$th roots and combined\nwith a Riemann--Roch computation, this point of view yields a proof of the\nHodge-DR Conjecture, along with new proofs of many known formulae for DR cycles\nand logarithmic DR cycles. Our proofs are valid in arbitrary characteristic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
