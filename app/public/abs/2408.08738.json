We establish that the\nsample average approximation of this problem is asymptotically consistent; that\nis, we prove that the objective value of the sample average approximation\nconverges almost surely to the objective value of the stochastic problem as the\nnumber of samples tends to infinity under mild technical assumptions. This\nconsistency guarantee thus shows that incorporating strategic consumer behavior\ninto a data-driven pricing problem can, in addition to making the pricing\nproblem more realistic, also help prevent overfitting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ERg1B4bRVLxH52d-cH8eJejzBkjVILjuZQ2uXbbECc4","pdfSize":"973983"}
