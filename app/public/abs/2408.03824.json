At the\npoint of straitening, the curvature of the boundary suffers a jump. The\nparabolic equation method is developed in the problem, and asymptotic formulas\nare presented for all waves arising in the vicinity of the non-smoothness point\nof the boundary. The ``ray skeleton'' of the wavefield is investigated in\ndetail.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
