We note that textual\ninversion has been underexplored using alternatives to the UNet, and experiment\nwith textual inversion with a vision transformer. We also seek to optimize\ntextual inversion using a strategy that does not require explicit use of the\nUNet and its idiosyncratic layers, so we add bonus tokens and enforce\northogonality. We find the use of the bonus token improves adherence to the\nsource images and the use of the vision transformer improves adherence to the\nprompt.
