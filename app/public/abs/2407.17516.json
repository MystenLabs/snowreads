{"id":"2407.17516","title":"Amplifying the Kinematics of Origami Mechanisms With Spring Joints","authors":"Malcolm Smith","authorsParsed":[["Smith","Malcolm",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2024 07:38:25 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-26","timestamp":1720597105000,"abstract":"  Due to its rigid foldability and predictable kinematics, the reverse fold is\nthe fundamental mechanism behind some of the most well known origami kinematic\nstructures, including the Miura Ori, Yoshimura, and waterbomb patterns.\nHowever, the reverse fold only has one parameter to control its behavior: the\nstarting fold angle. In this paper I introduce an alternative to the\ntraditional reverse fold, based on the spring into action pattern, called the\nspring joint. This novel rigidly foldable mechanism is able to couple multiple\nreverse folds into a compact space to amplify the kinematic output of a\ntraditional reverse fold by up to ten times, and to add one parameter for each\nreverse fold, giving more programmatic control of origami structures. Methods\nof parameterizing both the starting angle, the path of travel, and the axis of\nmotion are also introduced. Unfortunately, this versatility comes at the cost\nof a large buildup of layers, making the spring joint impractical for thick\norigami mechanisms. To solve this problem, I also introduce a modular\nalternative to the spring joint that has no additional layers, with the same\nkinematic properties. Both of these mechanisms are tested as replacements for\nthe reverse fold in both traditional and custom origami structures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"z7CrpABHm-wzfHLHpN5mbnJanrh_dUK9tCI-eB6iVU0","pdfSize":"8009730"}
