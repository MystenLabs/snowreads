The superconducting\ntransition temperature $T_C = 3.2$ K was almost twice as high as $T_C = 1.6$ K\nin 1T-PdTe$_2$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements showed\nhomogeneously mixed Se and Te atoms in the chalcogen layers, consistent with\nthe CdI$_2$-type crystal structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nmeasurements and density functional theory calculations indicated the existence\nof the topological surface states, and the overall band structures were similar\nto those of 1T-PdTe$_2$. These results suggest that CdI$_2$-type lattice\nsymmetry dictates the band dispersion, regardless of atomic disorder in the\nchalcogen layers. As the electronic band dispersion and the local structures\nwere persistent upon substitution, the enhancement of $T_C$ is likely\nassociated with the chemical pressure. Our results provide insight into the\neffects of the solid solution on the surface and bulk electronic states as well\nas the superconducting transition temperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tGoki3xfDCbtpC1lb5bbo_xqf6f7sYwRzE4P8c_8eSw","pdfSize":"25514719"}
