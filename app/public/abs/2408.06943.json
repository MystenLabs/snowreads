Medical\npractitioners integrate these diverse data types daily to make informed and\naccurate decisions. With recent advancements in language models capable of\nhandling multimodal data, it is a logical progression to apply these models to\nthe healthcare sector. In this work, we introduce a framework that connects\nsmall language models to multiple data sources, aiming to predict the risk of\nvarious diseases simultaneously. Our experiments encompass 12 different tasks\nwithin a multitask learning setup. Although our approach does not surpass\nstate-of-the-art methods specialized for single tasks, it demonstrates\ncompetitive performance and underscores the potential of small language models\nfor multimodal reasoning in healthcare.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KA1BbUllfiU7DRfTxPQrOl60vJyzuKVKVSOu_Z3gonU","pdfSize":"570545"}
