To meet the Net Zero Representative Concentration Pathways\n(RCP) $4.5$ scenario in the DACH countries, increased renewable energy\nproduction, energy storage, and reduced commercial building consumption are\nneeded. This scenario's success depends on hydroelectric capacity and climatic\nfactors. Informed decisions require quantifying uncertainty in forecasts. This\nstudy explores a non-parametric method based on \\emph{reproducing kernel\nHilbert spaces (RKHS)}, known as kernel quantile regression, for energy\nprediction. Our experiments demonstrate its reliability and sharpness, and we\nbenchmark it against state-of-the-art methods in load and price forecasting for\nthe DACH region. We offer our implementation in conjunction with additional\nscripts to ensure the reproducibility of our research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jAHyjvUOIEiR9KLm0_bU17D3v6pEEyuRGIxxEwdOMOM","pdfSize":"2945944"}
