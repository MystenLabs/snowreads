Our approach relies on the order preservation properties of STOs\nthat can be established via the study of their differential. We focus on the\nstudy of STOs arising from strongly coupled maps both deterministic and noisy.\nOur approach allows for explicit estimates that we use to give examples of STOs\nwith multiple stable fixed points some of which are shown to be far from the\nasymptotic behaviour of the corresponding system of finite coupled maps and\ngive information only on long transients for the finite dimensional system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
