The right Perron\neigenvector (RP) was traditionally used, though several other options have\nemerged. We consider some alternatives, mostly new, namely the entry-wise\nreciprocal of the left Perron vector (LP), the left singular vector (LS), the\nentry-wise reciprocal of the right singular vector (RS), the arithmetic and\ngeometric means of RP and LP (AP and GP), and of LS and RS (AS and GS). (The\nranking vector AS was proposed by Gass and Rapcs\\'ak (2004)). All 8 of these\nvectors produce the natural vector in the consistent case. We compare them\nempirically, in terms of efficiency, for random matrices, as a function of the\nnumber of alternatives. It turns out that the vector GP is universily\nefficient, and this fact is proven. The vector GS performs better that the\nremaining 6 vectors. We show that, for reciprocal matrices obtained from\nconsistent matrices by modifying one column and the corresponding row, all 8\nvectors are efficient. Moreover, the cone generated by the columns is\nefficient.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
