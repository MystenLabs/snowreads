In\nthis paper, we determine the automorphism group of a monomial algebra B, under\nthe assumption that B is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of\ncharacteristic zero. We achieve this by providing an explicit classification of\nthe homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations of B. The main body of the paper\naddresses the more general case of semigroup algebras, with the polynomial ring\nbeing a particular case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
