The incorporation of machine learning algorithms can efficiently\nelevate the possibility of accurately detecting atrophic gastritis.\nNevertheless, when the trained model is applied in real-life circumstances, its\noutput is often not consistently reliable. In this paper, we propose Adaptify,\nan adaptation scheme in which the model assimilates knowledge from its own\nclassification decisions. Our proposed approach includes keeping the primary\nmodel constant, while simultaneously running and updating the auxiliary model.\nBy integrating the knowledge gleaned by the auxiliary model into the primary\nmodel and merging their outputs, we have observed a notable improvement in\noutput stability and consistency compared to relying solely on either the main\nmodel or the auxiliary model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
