This requires the precise knowledge of the\nposition resolution of beam tracks reconstructed at the Device Under Test\n(DUT). A method is proposed which achieves this using a segmented silicon\ndetector with readout with charge digitization. It is found that the DUT\nspatial resolution for particles with normal incidence is less than 1 $\\mu$m\nfor events where clusters consist of two pixels (or strips). Given this\naccuracy, the residual of the beam track-position at the DUT and the position\nreconstructed in the DUT provides the beam track-position resolution\ndistribution. The method is developed using simulated events, which are also\nused to study how to deal with cross-talk, electronics noise, energetic $\\delta\n$-electrons, and incident beams with a few degrees off the normal to the sensor\nplane. To validate the method, the position resolution of beam tracks\nreconstructed by the EUDET beam telescope of the DESY II Test Beam Facility is\ndetermined using a CMS Phase-2 prototype pixel sensor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
