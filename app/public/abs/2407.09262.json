A\nkey prediction is that the GW luminosity distance will vary with redshift,\ndiffering from the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance due to varying\neffective Planck mass. We introduce a model-independent, data-driven approach\nto explore these deviations using multi-messenger observations of dark standard\nsirens (Binary Black Holes, BBH). By combining GW luminosity distance\nmeasurements from dark sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)\nmeasurements, BBH redshifts inferred from cross-correlation with spectroscopic\nor photometric galaxy surveys, and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB), we can make a data-driven test of GR (jointly with\nthe Hubble constant) as a function of redshift. Using the multi-messenger\ntechnique with the spectroscopic DESI galaxy survey, we achieve precise\nmeasurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with\nredshift. For the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (CEET), the best\nprecision is approximately 3.6\\%, and for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), it is 7.4\\%\nat a redshift of $\\rm{z = 0.425}$. Additionally, we can measure the Hubble\nconstant with a precision of about 1.1\\% from CEET and 7\\% from LVK over five\nyears of observation with a 75\\% duty cycle. We also explore the potential of\ncross-correlation with photometric galaxy surveys from the Rubin Observatory,\nextending measurements up to a redshift of $\\rm{z \\sim 2.5}$. This approach can\nreveal potential deviations from models affecting GW propagation using numerous\ndark standard sirens in synergy with DESI and the Rubin Observatory.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fYYzoCSBOrwZJKTmcsLrSgt8OEvNGPJqFs3oJa9cxsE","pdfSize":"3371718","objectId":"0xfa7ef80ac45fce8340714fc475497e15d68f7c065ed2065e24e0c9cf5df9d6b6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
