First, we establish the well-posedness of\ngeneralized quasilinear Schr\\\"odinger equations and give a new proof of the\nglobal well-posedness of semilinear Schr\\\"odinger equations. Then we provide\nexplicit expressions of higher order derivatives of the solution map and prove\nthe analytic dependence between solution and initial data. At the end, we show\nthe existence of wave operator and prove the asymptotic completeness in low\ndimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
