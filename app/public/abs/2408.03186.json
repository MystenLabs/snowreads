From\nthe resulting images we compute synthetic interferometric observables. We first\ninvestigate how individual parameter variations in a pure magnetospheric\naccretion model and a pure parameteric disk wind model translate to changes in\nthese derived quantities. Then we attempt to reproduce the RU Lup GRAVITY data\nwith different parameter variants of magnetospheric accretion models, disk wind\nmodels, and combined hybrid models.\n  Results: We demonstrate that magnetospheric accretion models and disk wind\nmodels on their own can emulate certain individual characteristics from the\nobservational results, but individually fail to comprehensively reproduce the\nobservational trends. Disk wind plus accretion hybrid models are in principle\ncapable of explaining the variation in characteristic radii across the line and\nthe corresponding flux ratios. While the model parameters of the hybrid models\nare mostly in good agreement with the known attributes of RU Lup, we find that\nour best-fitting models deviate in terms of rotational period and the size of\nthe magnetosphere. The best-fitting hybrid model does not respect the\nco-rotation criterion, as the magnetospheric truncation radius is about 50%\nlarger than the co-rotation radius.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LIYkzPjIHXuh99LBopTg3GPiTDjQ808o0wHxF1vHUzI","pdfSize":"4353559"}
