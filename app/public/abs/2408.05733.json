Establishing precise lower and upper bounds for these\ncapacities has proven to be difficult, making it essential to at least identify\nconditions under which the quantum capacity of a channel vanishes. In this\npaper, we prove that the quantum capacity of any quantum channel $\\Lambda$,\nwhen contaminated by white noise, as described by $\\Lambda_x\n(\\rho):=(1-x)\\Lambda(\\rho)+\\frac{x}{d}I_d$ becomes zero when $x\\geq\n\\frac{1}{2}$. To prove this, we first show that the depolarizing channel with\n$x\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ is anti-degradable, and we provide the exact form of the\nchannel that connects it to its complement. The zero-capacity region we\nestablish for this channel is significantly larger than the previously known\nentanglement-binding threshold, which depends on dimension and is given by\n$x\\geq \\frac{d}{d+1}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
