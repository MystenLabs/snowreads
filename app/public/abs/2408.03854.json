We give\ncriteria for the existence of conjugate points along steady and nonsteady\ngeodesics, using different strategies in each case. We consider both general\nLie groups and quadratic Lie groups, where the metric in the Lie algebra\n$g(u,v)=\\langle u,\\Lambda v\\rangle$ is defined from a bi-invariant bilinear\nform and a symmetric positive definite operator $\\Lambda$. By way of\nillustration, we apply our criteria to $SO(n)$ equipped with a generalized\nversion of the rigid body metric, and to Lie groups arising from Cheeger's\ndeformation technique, which include Zeitlin's $SU(3)$ model of hydrodynamics\non the $2$-sphere. Along the way we obtain formulas for the Ricci curvatures in\nthese examples, showing that conjugate points occur even in the presence of\nsome negative curvature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a_QlZ9gw5irO9VIqAt46DZzEfMq9HUpJEb0Y0kx5h4o","pdfSize":"397921"}
