We consider the brane-world scenario\ndescribed by the Randall-Sundrum model and determine the black hole shadow\nradius correction owing to the higher dimension. From data of the shadow radius\nin units of BH mass determined by KECK- and VLTI-based estimates, we imposed\nrestrictions on the deviation obtained, and one sets an upper limit to the\ncurvature radius of Anti-de Sitter ($\\mathrm{AdS_{5}}$) spacetime\n$\\ell\\lesssim4.3\\times10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{AU}$ (at $95\\%$ confidence level).\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
