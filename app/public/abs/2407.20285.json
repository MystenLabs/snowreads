Bayesian\n(probabilistic) Machine Learning is used to learn the constraints on the free\nparameters of the models, with the learning being based on the generated\nexpansion rate, $H(z)$. Taking advantage of the method, the constraints for\nthree redshift ranges are learned. Namely, for the two redshift ranges: $z\\in\n[0,2]$~(cosmic chronometers) and $z\\in [0,2.5]$~(cosmic chronometers + BAO),\ncovering already available $H(z)$ data, to validate the learned results; and\nfor a third redshift interval, $z\\in[0,5]$, for forecasting purposes. It is\nlearned that the $3\\alpha H_{0}$ term in the creation rate provides options\nthat have the potential to solve the $H_{0}$ tension problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2BfVG4hvXiMbnv5IJ3dav80LMTfuX2iFyA8ktl47PSw","pdfSize":"1690592","objectId":"0xc4b1a6876606e06f34b869bf2d575762b6e89e2208e6dddb886cfb5a72ccebef","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
