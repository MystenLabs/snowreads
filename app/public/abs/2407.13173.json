However, the existing methods for\ngenerating ultra-violet pulses face difficulties in fulfilling the twofold\nrequirements of high energy and wavelength tunability simultaneously. Here, we\ntheoretically demonstrate the generation of high-energy and wavelength tunable\nultraviolet pulses in preformed air-plasma channels via the leaky wave\nemission. The output ultraviolet pulse has a tunable wavelength ranging from\n250 nm to 430 nm and an energy level up to sub-mJ. An octave-spanning\nultraviolet supercontinuum with a flatness better than 3 dB can also be\nobtained via longitudinally modulated dispersion. Such a high-energy tunable\nultraviolet light source may provide promising opportunities for\ncharacterization of ultrafast phenomena such as molecular breakup, and also an\nimportant driving source for the generation of high-energy attosecond pulses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
