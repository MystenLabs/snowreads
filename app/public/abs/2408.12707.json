In this work, using a highly simplified description of\nthe prototypical FeAs superconducting layer, we show how external optical\nexcitation of the As 4p-5s splitting can lead to a significant modulation of\nthe polarization-mediated effective interactions between carriers. Our results\nsuggest that even perturbative external fields, approximately two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the internal field generated by charge carriers, might\nenable the exploration of the role of the anion's polarizability in determining\nthe correlated physics, although more detailed modeling is needed to decide\noptimal ways to achieve this.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
