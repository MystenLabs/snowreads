A dichotomy into two classes\nof universal counterexamples to a Koml\\'os-type theorem is established,\nmirroring a result of M\\'emin. As an application of this classification, we\nobtain a remarkable Koml\\'os-type theorem for semimartingales, with convergence\nin a $\\sigma$-localized$\\unicode{x2014}$in the sense of\nKallsen$\\unicode{x2014}$version of the \\'Emery topology. This provides the\nfirst general convex compactness principle for semimartingales in the\nliterature for which the limit $X$ is necessarily a semimartingale, solving a\nserious gap in previous results that limited the possible wealth processes\nvis-\\`a-vis $X$ to those arising from predictable finite variation integrands,\na severe restriction in applications to mathematical finance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JOeebuD6BYhRJ13kB0Syi89sjP_IVnX8WmrQu1I0TdQ","pdfSize":"272429"}
