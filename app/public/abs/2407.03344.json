Weniger's\ntransformation, in particular, is able to accomplish spectacular results when\nused to overcome resummation problems, often outperforming better known\nresummation techniques, the most known being Pad\\'e approximants. However, our\nunderstanding of its theoretical features is still far from being satisfactory\nand particularly bad as far as the decoding of factorially divergent series is\nconcerned.\n  Stieltjes series represent a class of power series of fundamental interest in\nmathematical physics. In the present paper, it is shown how the Stieltjes\nseries converging factor of any order is expressible as an inverse factorial\nseries, whose terms can be analytically retrieved through a simple recursive\nalgorithm. A few examples of applications of our algorithm are presented, in\norder to show its effectiveness and implementation ease. We believe the results\npresented here could constitute an important, preliminary step for the\ndevelopment of a general convergence theory of Weniger's transformation on\nStieltjes series. A rather ambitious project, but worthy of being pursued in\nthe future.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
