Previous related work has mainly focused on the worst$-$case or\naverage$-$case scenarios. In this work, we consider the simulation error under\na fixed observable. Under a fixed observable, errors that commute with this\nobservable become less important. To illustrate this point, we define the\nobservation error as the expectation under the observable and provide a\ncommutativity$-$based upper bound using the Baker$-$Campbell$-$Hausdorff\nformula. For highly commuting observables, the simulation error indicated by\nthis upper bound can be significantly compressed. In the experiment with the\nHeisenberg model, the observation bound compresses the Trotter number by nearly\nhalf compared to recent commutator bounds. Additionally, we found that the\nevolution sequence significantly affects the observation error. By utilizing a\nsimulated annealing algorithm, we designed a sequence optimization algorithm,\nachieving further compression of the Trotter number. The experiment on the\nhydrogen molecule Hamiltonian demonstrates that optimizing the sequence can\nlead to nearly half the reduction in the Trotter number.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
