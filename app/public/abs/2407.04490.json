The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task involves identifying\nthe category and locating the start and end times of micro-gestures in video\nclips. Compared to the typical Temporal Action Detection task, the\nMicro-gesture Online Recognition task focuses more on distinguishing between\nmicro-gestures and pinpointing the start and end times of actions. Our solution\nranks 2nd in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
