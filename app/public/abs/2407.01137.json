The task of\nProduct Attribute and Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying both\nattributes and their values from product information. In this paper, we\nformulate PAVI as a generation task and provide, to the best of our knowledge,\nthe most comprehensive evaluation of PAVI so far. We compare three different\nattribute-value generation (AVG) strategies based on fine-tuning\nencoder-decoder models on three datasets. Experiments show that end-to-end AVG\napproach, which is computationally efficient, outperforms other strategies.\nHowever, there are differences depending on model sizes and the underlying\nlanguage model.
