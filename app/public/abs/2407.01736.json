This paper explores the\nuncertainties associated with measuring the fine-structure constant ($\\alpha$)\nand the proton-to-electron mass ratio ($\\mu$) using observed fast radio bursts\n(FRBs). We select 50 localized FRBs to quantify the effects of varying this\nfundamental coupling on the relation between dispersion measure and redshift.\nBy leveraging independent measurements of dispersion measures and redshifts of\nthese FRBs, we constrain the uncertainties in $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ approximately\nto $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha=1.99\\times 10^{-5}$ and $\\Delta\\mu/\\mu=-1.00\\times\n10^{-5}$ within the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework. Remarkably,\nthese constraints improve nearly an order-of-magnitude when considering a\ndynamical dark energy model. This investigation not only yields one of the most\nstringent constraints on $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ to date but also emphasizes the\ncriticality of accounting for the energy scale of the system when formulating\nconstraints on fundamental parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
