Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the\neffectiveness of defensive mechanisms such as Root Origin Validation (ROV),\nAutonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA), and PeerROV across distinct AS\ndeployment types. Our findings reveal critical insights into the strengths and\nlimitations of current BGP security measures, providing guidance for future\npolicy development and implementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
