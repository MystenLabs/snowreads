In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient\ncriterion for $\\nu$ to preserve the global sections of a derived stack. Even\nwhen these conditions are not satisfied, our framework still yields synthetic\nspectra that implement the descent spectral sequence for the structure sheaf,\nthus placing descent spectral sequences on good footing in the\n$\\infty$-category of synthetic spectra. As an example, we introduce a new\n$\\mathrm{MU}$-synthetic spectrum $\\mathrm{Smf}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"N2CDZdcsd14KL305OccczmxWjnX8L1XNiiDN2h9hK8M","pdfSize":"895012","objectId":"0xd155359519f12c1bb87b61931ae7dbbdb3c17c7f6f12804aaf38c255cdbe5e12","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
