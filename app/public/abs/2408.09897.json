The system consists of two\nequations for $(u,\\sigma)$, where, u is the velocity and $\\sigma$ is the stress\nand is strictly hyperbolic and nonconservative. Study of interaction of waves\nis one of the most important steps in the construction of global solution with\ninitial data in the space of functions of bounded variation using approximation\nprocedure like the Glimm's scheme. This amounts to constructing a solution with\ninitial data consisting of three states $(u_L, \\sigma_L), (u_m, \\sigma_m),$ and\n$(u_R, \\sigma_R)$. Usually this analysis is done for the states which are in a\nsmall neighbourhood of a fixed state. Here we get explicit formula for the\nsolution of the system when the data lies in the level sets of Riemann\ninvariants. The speciality of the work is that we donot assume smallness\nconditions on the initial data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ysR2_nT_xwqWHMWllQf_p-rE5iOojmSYImdF35I8wRQ","pdfSize":"549847"}
