Such systems often display the remote\nenvironment through 3D reconstructions or 360-degree videos. While 360-degree\ncameras stream an environment in higher quality, they lack spatial information,\nmaking them less interactable. We present VirtualNexus, an AR/VR collaboration\nsystem that enhances 360-degree video AR/VR collaboration with environment\ncutouts and virtual replicas. VR users can define cutouts of the remote\nenvironment to interact with as a world-in-miniature, and their interactions\nare synchronized to the local AR perspective. Furthermore, AR users can rapidly\nscan and share 3D virtual replicas of physical objects using neural rendering.\nWe demonstrated our system's utility through 3 example applications and\nevaluated our system in a dyadic usability test. VirtualNexus extends the\ninteraction space of 360-degree telepresence systems, offering improved\nphysical presence, versatility, and clarity in interactions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
