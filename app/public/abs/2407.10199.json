A\nnucleon separation energy dependent correction factor has been introduced to\nthe Glauber model calculation for extracting the nuclear charge radii from the\nexperimental CCCSs. The charge radii of $^{11}$C, $^{13,16}$N and $^{15}$O thus\nwere determined for the first time. With the new radii, we studied the\nexperimental mirror-difference charge radii ($\\Delta R_{\\text {ch}}^{\\text\n{mirror}}$) of $^{11}$B-$^{11}$C, $^{13}$C-$^{13}$N, $^{15}$N-$^{15}$O,\n$^{17}$N-$^{17}$Ne pairs for the first time. We find that the $\\Delta R_{\\text\n{ch}}^{\\text {mirror}}$, including both bound and weakly bound proton-rich\nmirror partners, are reproduced by the empirical relation to the isospin\nasymmetry predicted by the $ab$ $initio$ calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"770k7bOs3qb-1-Ii45TnDDW-hgg0DmFYbRZbdYE87GQ","pdfSize":"371904"}
