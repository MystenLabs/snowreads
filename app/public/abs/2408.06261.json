For this\nreason, we introduce open-source infrastructure for easily building generative\nmolecular models into the widely used DeepChem [Ramsundar et al., 2019] library\nwith the aim of creating a robust and reusable molecular generation pipeline.\nIn particular, we add high quality PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019]\nimplementations of the Molecular Generative Adversarial Networks (MolGAN) [Cao\nand Kipf, 2022] and Normalizing Flows [Papamakarios et al., 2021]. Our\nimplementations show strong performance comparable with past work [Kuznetsov\nand Polykovskiy, 2021, Cao and Kipf, 2022].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
