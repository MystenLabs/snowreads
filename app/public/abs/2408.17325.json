Our analysis reveals a statistically significant improvement in the\nEnglish quality of abstracts written by non-native English speakers.\nImportantly, this improvement remains robust even after accounting for other\npotential factors, confirming that it can be attributed to the release of\nChatGPT. This indicates widespread adoption of the tool. Following the release\nof ChatGPT, there is a significant increase in the use of unique words, while\nthe frequency of rare words decreases. Across language families, the changes in\nwriting style are significant for authors from the Latin and Ural-Altaic\ngroups, but not for those from the Germanic or other Indo-European groups.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
