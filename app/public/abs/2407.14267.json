To bring the model to the real data, a novel\ndiscretization technique over time and space is introduced. This technique\neffectively disentangles spatial effects into pure topography, agglomeration,\nrepulsion, and diffusion forces, which is crucial for developing robust\neconometric methods in spatial economics. Our empirical analysis of personal\nincome across Italian municipalities from 2008 to 2019 validates the model's\nprimary predictions and demonstrates superior performance compared to the most\ncommon spatial econometric models in the literature.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
