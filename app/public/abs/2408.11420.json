Improved coherence and sensitivity as well as discovering new\nphysical phenomena motivate pursuing ever lower electron temperatures,\naccessible using on-chip cooling techniques. Here we show that a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), manipulated using gate voltages, works as\nan on-chip heat sink only limited by a fundamental phonon heat-leak. A\nsingle-shot 2DEG cooler can reduce the electron temperature by a factor of two\nwith a hold time up to a second. Integrating an array of such coolers to obtain\ncontinuous cooldown in will allow reaching down to microkelvin device\ntemperatures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oTUpgP1-f7QQKQ7HcMUYJHeq3n5FFP3PhVZSF_c4GfU","pdfSize":"485288"}
