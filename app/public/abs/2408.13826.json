Their mass spectra, root mean square(r.m.s.) radii\nand radial density distributions are investigated within the framework of\nrelativized quark model. By comparing numerical results with experimental data,\nsome potential candidates for hidden-charm tetraquark states are suggested. For\nthe $qc\\bar{q}\\bar{c}$($q$=$u/d$) system, theoretical predictions support\nassigning $Z_{c}(3900)$ and $Z(4430)$ as the ground and the first radially\nexcited states with their quantum numbers to be $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$. Besides, the\nbroad structure $Z_{c}(4200)$ may be also a partner of $Z_{c}(3900)$, and arise\nfrom the higher state with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$. Theoretical predictions also\nindicate that the possible assignments for $X(3930)$, $X(4050)$ and $X(4250)$\nare low lying $0^{++}$ states. As for the $sc\\bar{s}\\bar{c}$ system, $X(4140)$\nand $X(4274)$ structures can be interpreted as this type of tetraquark states\nwith $J^{PC}=1^{++}$. In addition, $X(4350)$ can also be described as a\n$sc\\bar{s}\\bar{c}$ tetraquark with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$. With regard to\n$qc\\bar{s}\\bar{c}$($q$=$u/d$) system, we find two potential candidates for this\ntype of tetraquark, which are $Z_{cs}(4000)$ and $Z_{cs}(4220)$ structures. The\nmasses of these two structures are in agreement with theoretical predictions of\nthe $1^{+}$ state.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DIYYue0byepnYW-4nY6BwAsCrerBlxRTc8yUn56y7Jk","pdfSize":"532804"}
