Our analysis encompasses both sequential\nprocesses, involving intermediate states belonging to symmetric flavor sextet\n$\\boldsymbol{6}_F$ such as $\\Sigma_Q(1S)$ and $\\Xi_Q^\\prime(1S)$ respectively\nwith $J^P=1/2^+,3/2^+$, derived from the chiral quark model, and direct process\ncrucial for comparison with experimental data, whose coupling constants\nestimated using the chiral-partner scheme. We also incorporate the convolution\nof the parent particle's mass for the Dalitz plot, enabling a more realistic\ncomparison with experimental data. We scrutinize the Dalitz plots of these\nnegative parity states in light of recent Belle measurements for\n$\\Lambda_c(2625)^+$. Our findings support the assignment of $\\Lambda_c(2625)^+$\nas the $\\lambda$-mode excitation with $J^P=3/2^-$ in the quark model, deduced\nfrom the the ${\\Lambda_c\\pi}$ invariant mass distribution, and we then give\npredictions for other cases, including the $\\Xi_Q^*$ decays. The observed\nasymmetry in the ${\\pi\\pi}$ invariant mass distribution underscores the\nimportant role of the direct process, reflecting the chiral-partner structure\nin the heavy baryon sector. It is evident that the presence of the direct\nprocess is not significant in the three-body decays unless the $S$-wave\nresonance contribution is suppressed. We suggest further experimental\nverification to test our predictions and get more insights into the structure\nof heavy baryons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WHExYRi2nGtyXE9Er4vC2Ew54GHrvwAU6LtvtRtteK8","pdfSize":"8764920"}
