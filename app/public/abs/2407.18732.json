However, achieving superior spatial\nresolution requires arrays with numerous capsules, consequently leading to\nexpensive devices. To address this issue, we present a method for spatially\nupsampling spherical microphone arrays with a limited number of capsules. Our\napproach exploits a physics-informed neural network with Rowdy activation\nfunctions, leveraging physical constraints to provide high-order microphone\narray signals, starting from low-order devices. Results show that, within its\ndomain of application, our approach outperforms a state of the art method based\non signal processing for spherical microphone arrays upsampling.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
