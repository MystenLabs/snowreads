This work proposes a framework for analyzing understanding based on the\nnotion of composability. Given any subject (e.g., a person or an AI), we\nsuggest characterizing its understanding of an object in terms of its ability\nto process (compose) relevant inputs into satisfactory outputs from the\nperspective of a verifier. This highly universal framework can readily apply to\nnon-human subjects, such as AIs, non-human animals, and institutions. Further,\nwe propose methods for analyzing the inputs that enhance output quality in\ncompositions, which we call catalysts. We show how the structure of a subject\ncan be revealed by analyzing its components that act as catalysts and argue\nthat a subject's learning ability can be regarded as its ability to compose\ninputs into its inner catalysts. Finally we examine the importance of learning\nability for AIs to attain general intelligence. Our analysis indicates that\nmodels capable of generating outputs that can function as their own catalysts,\nsuch as language models, establish a foundation for potentially overcoming\nexisting limitations in AI understanding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"kBIxeRgjsRGlsNHocEfCh2jLCSzBBD-zkeqNbeyoyN8","pdfSize":"910583"}
