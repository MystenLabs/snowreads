At the same time more complex\nlocalized non-coplanar magnetic states as for instance skyrmions are in the\nfocus of applications due to their intriguing properties such as the\ntopological Hall effect. Recently a conceptual shift has occurred to envision\nthe use of such magnetic defects not only in one-dimensional race track devices\nbut to exploit their unique properties in two-dimensional networks. Here we use\nlocal strain in a collinear antiferromagnet to induce non-coplanar domain wall\njunctions, which connect in a very specific way to form extended networks. We\ncombine spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy with density functional\ntheory to characterize the different building blocks of the network, and\nunravel the origin of the handedness of triple-junctions and the size of the\narising topological orbital moments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
