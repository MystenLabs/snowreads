A standard solution method for these problems\nis to consider the infinite population limit as an approximation and use\nsymmetric solutions of the limit problem to achieve near optimality. The\ncontrol policies, and in particular the dynamics, depend on the population\ndistribution in the finite population setting, or the marginal distribution of\nthe state variable of a representative agent for the infinite population\nsetting. Hence, learning and planning for these control problems generally\nrequire estimating the reaction of the system to all possible state\ndistributions of the agents. To overcome this issue, we consider linear\nfunction approximation for the control problem and provide several coordinated\nand independent learning methods. We rigorously establish error upper bounds\nfor the performance of learned solutions. The performance gap stems from (i)\nthe mismatch due to estimating the true model with a linear one, and (ii) using\nthe infinite population solution in the finite population problem as an\napproximate control. The provided upper bounds quantify the impact of these\nerror sources on the overall performance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
