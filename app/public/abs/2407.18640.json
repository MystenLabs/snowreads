Anti-inversion\nsymmetry in the corresponding magnetic crystal classes dictate the makeup of\nmagnetic Bragg diffraction patterns. Copper axial and polar magnetic multipoles\ncontribute to resonant x-ray and magnetic neutron amplitudes in a symmetry\ninformed analysis of monoclinic Cu$_2$(MoO$_4$)(SeO$_3$) presented with a view\nto steering future diffraction experiments. The compound might be viewed as a\nlow-dimensional quantum magnet on account of its crystal structure and extreme\nCu spin (S = 1/2).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2tE5xocifNitXHa03ape2jlHzsK-5cQtLvqzL65TvSw","pdfSize":"616527"}
