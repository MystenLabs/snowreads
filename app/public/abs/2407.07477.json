We experimentally verify this double-sided form of\nquantumness and its independence from the polarization basis, contrasting other\nnotions of coherence that are highly basis-dependent. Our findings show how\nnonclassical polarization turns out to be equally resourceful for quantum\nprotocols as entanglement, emphasizing its importance in practical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
