For tensors lying on the\ntangential variety of any Segre variety, but not on the variety itself, we show\nthat the decomposition locus consists of all rank-one tensors except the\ntangency point only. We also explicitly compute decomposition loci of all\ntensors belonging to tensor spaces with finitely many orbits with respect to\nthe action of product of general linear groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
