The cone of curves of these surfaces is\nfinite polyhedral and minimally generated. We also introduce the\n$\\delta$-semigroup of a surface at infinity and consider the set $\\mathcal{S}$\nof surfaces at infinity having the same $\\delta$-semigroup. We study how the\ngenerators of the cone of curves of surfaces in $\\mathcal{S}$ behave.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
