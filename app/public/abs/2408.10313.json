Specifically, we demonstrate how the entropy functional arises\nfrom the asymptotics of 't Hooft and Wilson line operators in a 3d\n$\\mathcal{N}= 4$ gauge theory. The gauge-Bethe correspondence allows us to\ninterpret this calculation in terms of the enumerative geometry of the Hilbert\nscheme and thereby conjecture that the entropy is saturated by expectation\nvalues of certain natural operators in the quantum $K$-theory ring acting on\nthe localised $K$-theory of the Hilbert scheme. We give numerical evidence that\nthe large $N$ limit is saturated by contributions from a certain vacuum/fixed\npoint on the Hilbert scheme, associated to a particular triangular-shaped Young\ndiagram, by evolving solutions to the Bethe equations numerically at finite\n(but large) $N$ towards the classical limit. We thus conjecture a concrete\ngeometric holographic dual of the so-called gravitational/Cardy block.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
