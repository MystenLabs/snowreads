To demonstrate this, we present the Versatile Voice\nDataset (VVD), a collection of three speakers modifying their voices along\ngendered axes. The VVD illustrates that current approaches in speaker modeling,\nbased on categorical notions of gender and a static understanding of vocal\ntexture, fail to account for the flexibility of the vocal tract. Utilizing\npublicly-available speaker embeddings, we demonstrate that gender\nclassification systems are highly sensitive to voice modification, and speaker\nverification systems fail to identify voices as coming from the same speaker as\nvoice modification becomes more drastic. As one path towards moving beyond\ncategorical and static notions of speaker identity, we propose modeling\nindividual qualities of vocal texture such as pitch, resonance, and weight.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
