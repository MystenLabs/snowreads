Its\nexistence was controversial until recent theoretical work demonstrated its\npresence and strength, which was subsequently confirmed by observations.\nAlthough there have been some new observations recently, the main progress\nstill comes from theoretical studies. These studies investigate the effects of\ndifferent magnetic fields and black hole spins on the wind, providing insights\ninto properties such as mass flux and wind velocity. Wind is typically produced\nlocally within the Bondi radius, and even wind generated on a small scale can\npropagate far beyond this radius. The situation with super-Eddington wind is\nsimilar, despite some recent observations, the main advances rely on\ntheoretical studies. Recent research comparing the momentum and energy of wind\nand jets suggests that wind plays a more crucial role in active galactic nuclei\nfeedback than jets, whether the wind originates from hot accretion flows or\nsuper-Eddington accretion flows.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"knNeJNIHZxRLUvM7-t_focrl3R4YXyK5CmMCsnIg1KE","pdfSize":"655021"}
