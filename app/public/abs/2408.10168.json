The energy\nspectra are obtained from a spectral model for the inertial subrange that\nconsiders the anomalous behavior of turbulence. This spectrum is expressed as a\nfunction of the Hausdorff fractal dimension. The diffusivity eddies are\nemployed in a classical Eulerian dispersion model, where the derivatives are of\ninteger order and in fractional dispersion model, where the derivatives are of\nfractional order. The eddy diffusivity proposed considers the anomalous nature\nof geophysical turbulent flow. The results obtained with the fractional and\nclassic dispersion models using the eddy diffusivity proposed is satisfactory\nwhen compared with the experimental data of the Prairie Grass and Hanford\nexperiments in a stable regime, and the Copenhagen experiment in a convective\nregime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
