While\nspectral assumptions analogous to the ones used in the regular HEOM are imposed\nto compute output bath observables, they are not required to model input\nstates, leading to time-dependent contributions to the equations. For a given\ndesired input state and output observable, the range of the indexes extending\nthe regular HEOM is, by construction, bounded. Overall, the aim of this\nformalism is to take advantage of the efficiency of the HEOM framework to model\nnon-Gaussian input states and the dynamics of environmental observables in\nbosonic, non-Markovian open quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
