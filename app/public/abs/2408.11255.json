We\ndemonstrate that Execution Tickets extract all MEV when all buyers are\nhomogeneous, risk neutral and face no capital costs. We also show that MEV\ncapture decreases with risk aversion and capital costs. Moreover, when buyers\nare heterogeneous, MEV capture can be especially low and a single dominant\nbuyer can extract much of the MEV. This adverse effect can be partially\nmitigated by the presence of a Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) mechanism,\nwhich gives ET buyers access to a market of specialized builders, but in\npractice centralization vectors still persist. With PBS, ETs are concentrated\namong those with the highest ex-ante MEV extraction ability and lowest cost of\ncapital. We show how it is possible that large investors that are not builders\nbut have substantial advantage in capital cost can come to dominate the ET\nmarket.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
