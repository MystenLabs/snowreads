For the particular case of\ncircular densities, we address the problem of testing if, given an observed\nsample of a random angle, the underlying circular distribution model is\nmultimodal. Our work is motivated by the analysis of migration patterns of\nbirds and the methodological proposal follows a novel approach based on\nlikelihood ratio ideas, combined with critical bandwidths. Theoretical results\nsupport the behaviour of the test, whereas simulation examples show its finite\nsample performance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZZAUUTRwCqPg83aJfTTc6rrxxTcedeqJuhzK0EtWAiY","pdfSize":"7016799"}
