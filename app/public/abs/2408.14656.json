The theory is still\ninvariant both under generalised diffeomorphisms and a local supersymmetry and\nin many aspects is structurally similar to the original supergravity, which\nmakes it a convenient playground for understanding more subtle aspects of the\nfull physical setup. In particular, the simplicity and the geometric nature of\nthe dilatonic theory allow us to build a full BV extension to all orders in the\nfermionic variables.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
