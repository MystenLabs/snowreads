Demonstrated with dual wavelength tweezer arrays of\n$^{88}$Sr atoms, our approach achieves a 96$\\%$ loading rate after four reload\ncycles. This method can significantly enhance existing tweezer rearrangement\nprotocols, potentially reducing iteration time and optical power consumption,\nthereby enabling a larger number of atoms in a quantum logic device.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jS1laEwG7MUeoTfgCFtV2NDMtjYmxMUG36rcqrfMWEs","pdfSize":"4592103"}
