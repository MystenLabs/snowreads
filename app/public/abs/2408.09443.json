The bottleneck\npath problem, for given an edge-capacitated graph, a source, and a target, is\nto find the $\\max$-$\\min$ value of edge capacities on paths between the source\nand the target. For this problem and a network with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges,\nthere is known the Ramaswamy-Orlin-Chakravarty's algorithm to compute all\ntolerances in $O(m+n\\log n)$ time. In this paper, for any in advance given\nsample of the problem with pairwise distinct edge capacities, we present a\nconstant-time algorithm for computing both tolerances of an arbitrary edge with\na preprocessing time $O\\big(m \\alpha(m,n)\\big)$, where $\\alpha(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is\nthe inverse Ackermann function. For given $k$ source-target pairs, our solution\nyields an $O\\big((\\alpha(m,n)+k)m\\big)$-time algorithm to find tolerances of\nall edges with respect to optimal paths between the sources and targets, while\nthe known algorithm takes $O\\big(k(m+n\\log n)\\big)$ time to find them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
