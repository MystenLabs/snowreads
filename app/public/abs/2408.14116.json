The massive data is conventionally transferred to\nthe cloud server for centralized artificial intelligence (AI) models training,\nraising huge communication overhead and privacy concerns. To address this, we\npropose a hierarchical learning and computing framework, which leverages the\nlowlatency characteristic of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and the global\ncoverage of geostationary-earth-orbit (GEO) satellites, to provide global\naggregation services for locally trained models on ground IoT devices. Due to\nthe time-varying nature of satellite network topology and the energy\nconstraints of LEO satellites, efficiently aggregating the received local\nmodels from ground devices on LEO satellites is highly challenging. By\nleveraging the predictability of inter-satellite connectivity, modeling the\nspace network as a directed graph, we formulate a network energy minimization\nproblem for model aggregation, which turns out to be a Directed Steiner Tree\n(DST) problem. We propose a topologyaware energy-efficient routing (TAEER)\nalgorithm to solve the DST problem by finding a minimum spanning arborescence\non a substitute directed graph. Extensive simulations under realworld\nspace-ground integrated network settings demonstrate that the proposed TAEER\nalgorithm significantly reduces energy consumption and outperforms benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
