These include zero-cost regions (0-regions) with a weight of $0$ and\nobstacles with a weight of $\\infty$, all embedded in a plane with a weight of\n$1$. The data structure $B$ can be constructed in expected time $O(N +\n(n/\\varepsilon^3)(\\log(n/\\varepsilon) + \\log N))$, where $n$ is the total\nnumber of regions, $N$ represents the total complexity of the regions, and $1 +\n\\varepsilon$ is the approximation factor, for any $0 < \\varepsilon < 1$. Using\n$B$, one can compute an approximate weighted shortest path from any point $s$\nto any point $t$ in $O(N + n/\\varepsilon^3 + (n/\\varepsilon^2)\n\\log(n/\\varepsilon) + (\\log N)/\\varepsilon)$ time. In the special case where\nthe 0-regions and obstacles are polygons (not necessarily convex), $B$ contains\na $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-spanner of the input vertices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zkL7GwfSH-nXl1wlq6xjFDVIDAocwrt37eqSA4we8a8","pdfSize":"1424911"}
