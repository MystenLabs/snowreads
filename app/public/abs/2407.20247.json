However extensive research\nconducted on EEG classification focuses on designing model architectures\nwithout tackling the underlying issues. Otherwise, there has been a notable gap\nin addressing data preprocessing for EEG, leading to considerable computational\noverhead in Deep Learning (DL) processes. In light of these issues, we propose\na simple yet effective approach for EEG data pre-processing. Our method first\ntransforms the EEG data into an encoded image by an Inverted Channel-wise\nMagnitude Homogenization (ICWMH) to mitigate inter-channel biases. Next, we\napply the edge detection technique on the EEG-encoded image combined with skip\nconnection to emphasize the most significant transitions in the data while\npreserving structural and invariant information. By doing so, we can improve\nthe EEG learning process efficiently without using a huge DL network. Our\nexperimental evaluations reveal that we can significantly improve (i.e., from\n2% to 5%) over current baselines.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
