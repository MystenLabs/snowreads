That there are over\n300,000 breast cancers newly diagnosed each year suggests that only a fraction\nof the cancers result in mortality. Thus, most of the women undergo seemingly\ncurative treatment for localized cancers, but a significant later succumb to\nmetastatic disease for which current treatments are only temporizing for the\nvast majority. The current prognostic metrics are of little actionable value\nfor 4 of the 5 women seemingly cured after local treatment, and many women are\nexposed to morbid and even mortal adjuvant therapies unnecessarily, with these\nadjuvant therapies reducing metastatic recurrence by only a third. Thus, there\nis a need for better prognostics to target aggressive treatment at those who\nare likely to relapse and spare those who were actually cured. While there is a\nplethora of molecular and tumor-marker assays in use and under-development to\ndetect recurrence early, these are time consuming, expensive and still often\nun-validated as to actionable prognostic utility. A different approach would\nuse large data techniques to determine clinical and histopathological\nparameters that would provide accurate prognostics using existing data. Herein,\nwe report on machine learning, together with grid search and Bayesian Networks\nto develop algorithms that present a AUC of up to 0.9 in ROC analyses, using\nonly extant data. Such algorithms could be rapidly translated to clinical\nmanagement as they do not require testing beyond routine tumor evaluations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"3iIq4qTfcp7ttDuc1PNuoHSl_gticeZ4uLnfyX49FZY","pdfSize":"2337082"}
