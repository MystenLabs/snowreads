To explore the potential of these characteristics, we\ntake the perspective effect in pedestrian datasets as an example and propose\nthe mean height aided suppression for post-processing. This method rejects\npredictions that fall at levels with a low possibility of containing any\npedestrians or that have an abnormal height compared to the average. To achieve\nthis, the existence score and mean height generators are proposed.\nComprehensive experiments on various datasets and detectors are performed; the\nchoice of hyper-parameters is discussed in depth. The proposed method is easy\nto implement and is plug-and-play. Results show that the proposed methods\nsignificantly improve detection accuracy when applied to different existing\npedestrian detectors and datasets. The combination of mean height aided\nsuppression with particular detectors outperforms state-of-the-art pedestrian\ndetectors on Caltech and Citypersons datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
