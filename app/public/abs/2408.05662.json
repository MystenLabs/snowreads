The set $\\{1,2,3,\\cdots\\}$ constitutes an irreducible class and $0$ is\nan absorbing state. For the single death process with three kinds of killing\nterm, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of the quasi-stationary\ndistribution. Moreover, we derive the conditions for exponential convergence to\nthe quasi-stationary distribution in the total variation norm. Our main\napproach is based on the Doob's $h$-transform, potential theory and\nprobabilistic methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
