In this\nletter, we investigate the joint communication, computation, and the AIGC\nresource allocation problem in an MEGC system. A latency minimization problem\nis first formulated to enhance the quality of service for mobile users. Due to\nthe strong coupling of the optimization variables, we propose a new deep\nreinforcement learning-based algorithm to solve it efficiently. Numerical\nresults demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve lower latency than\ntwo baseline algorithms.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
