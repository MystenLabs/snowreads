The fact\nthat radiation losses occur primarily in the high-energy tail, where the\nradiation itself has a substantial impact on the electron distribution,\nnecessitates a self-consistent approach to modeling the diffusion and drag\ninduced by synchrotron absorption and emission. Furthermore, an accurate model\nmust account for the fact that the radiation emission spectrum is\nmomentum-dependent, and the plasma opacity is frequency-dependent. Here, we\npresent a simple Fokker-Planck operator, built on a newly-solved-for blackbody\nsynchrotron diffusion operator, which captures all relevant features of the\nsynchrotron radiation. Focusing on magnetic mirror fusion plasmas, we show that\nsignificant suppression of the electron distribution occurs for relativistic\nvalues of the perpendicular electron momentum, which therefore emit much less\nradiation than predicted under the assumption of a Maxwell-Juttner\ndistribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
