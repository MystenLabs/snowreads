The method combines a previously developed\nmethod for guidance and control using adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR)\ncollocation and a previously developed approach for desensitized optimal\ncontrol. Guidance updates are performed such that the desensitized optimal\ncontrol problem is re-solved on the remaining horizon at the start of each\nguidance cycle. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on a simple\nexample using Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that the method reduces\nvariations in the terminal state as compared to either desensitized optimal\ncontrol without guidance updates or a previously developed method for optimal\nguidance and control.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
