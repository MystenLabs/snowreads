Training these models is classically a data-fitting\ntask, but knowledge of the expression of the differential equation can be used\nto supplement the training objective, leading to the development of\nphysics-informed scientific machine learning. In this article, we focus on one\nclass of models called nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) to solve ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs). Motivated by connections to numerical\nintegration and physics-informed neural networks, we explicitly derive the\nphysics-informed NVAR (piNVAR) which enforces the right-hand side of the\nunderlying differential equation regardless of NVAR construction. Because NVAR\nand piNVAR completely share their learned parameters, we propose an augmented\nprocedure to jointly train the two models. Then, using both data-driven and\nODE-driven metrics, we evaluate the ability of the piNVAR model to predict\nsolutions to various ODE systems, such as the undamped spring, a Lotka-Volterra\npredator-prey nonlinear model, and the chaotic Lorenz system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
