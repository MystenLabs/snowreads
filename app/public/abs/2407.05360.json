The popularity of the POI over time is one of the primary deciding\nfactors for choosing the next POI to visit. The majority of research in recent\ntimes has paid more attention to the number of check-ins to define the\npopularity of a point of interest, disregarding the temporal impact or number\nof people checking in for a particular POI. In this paper, we propose a\nrecency-oriented definition of popularity that takes into account the temporal\neffect on POI's popularity, the number of check-ins, as well as the number of\npeople who registered those check-ins. Thus, recent check-ins get prioritized\nwith more weight compared to the older ones. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat performance is better with recency-aware popularity definitions for POIs\nthan with solely check-in count-based popularity definitions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
