The resulting Hamiltonian is\nbilinear in particle operators and splits up into two separate chains composed,\nrespectively, of the standard and time reversal parafermions. It has been\ndemonstrated that each subsystem inherits its own $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ component from\nthe symmetry, which corresponds to the parity of all constituent particles. For\nthe open chain, the four invariant parafermions, generating zero-energy modes,\nare identified. They are located at the edges of each chain. For the closed\nsystem with the translational invariance, the boundaries are twisted by the\ntotal parafermion parity operator. The structure of edge modes and the\nspace-time symmetry of the system, which depend on the chain length and\nboundary conditions, are studied in detail.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
