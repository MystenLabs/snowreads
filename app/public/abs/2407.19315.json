J Comput Phys, 2020] is\nan efficient algorithm for simulating interacting particle systems. In this\npaper, we investigate the Random Batch Method with replacement (RBM-r), which\nis the same as the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method for the pairwise\ninteracting particle system of size $N$. In the RBM-r algorithm, one randomly\npicks a small batch of size $p \\ll N$, and only the particles in the picked\nbatch interact among each other within the batch for a short time, where the\nweak interaction (of strength $\\frac{1}{N-1}$) in the original system is\nreplaced by a strong interaction (of strength $\\frac{1}{p-1}$). Then one\nrepeats this pick-interact process. This KMC algorithm dramatically reduces the\ncomputational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step, and provides an\nunbiased approximation of the original force/velocity field of the interacting\nparticle system. In this paper, We give a rigorous proof of this approximation\nwith an explicit convergence rate. An improved rate is also obtained when there\nis no diffusion in the system. Notably, the techniques in our analysis can\npotentially be applied to study KMC for other systems, including the stochastic\nIsing spin system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
