(2021) due to an error in the\nO3N2 based metallicity calibrations presented in that work. Conclusions are\nunchanged, but metallicity values shift by $\\sim$0.03 dex, with polynomials for\naffected conversions shifted by the same amount. We present updated materials\nhere.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
