While existing approaches rely solely on the semantic alignment of\nqueries and arguments, this first shared task on perspective argument retrieval\nincorporates perspectives during retrieval, accounting for latent influences in\nargumentation. We present a novel multilingual dataset covering demographic and\nsocio-cultural (socio) variables, such as age, gender, and political attitude,\nrepresenting minority and majority groups in society. We distinguish between\nthree scenarios to explore how retrieval systems consider explicitly (in both\nquery and corpus) and implicitly (only in query) formulated perspectives. This\npaper provides an overview of this shared task and summarizes the results of\nthe six submitted systems. We find substantial challenges in incorporating\nperspectivism, especially when aiming for personalization based solely on the\ntext of arguments without explicitly providing socio profiles. Moreover,\nretrieval systems tend to be biased towards the majority group but partially\nmitigate bias for the female gender. While we bootstrap perspective argument\nretrieval, further research is essential to optimize retrieval systems to\nfacilitate personalization and reduce polarization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"B00a9OPGSWhvqCFcALlARzuy9fjRbOe78Vufnix6jSY","pdfSize":"6959354"}
