Starting from an ab-initio electronic structure theory comprising the\natomic carbon $p_z$-orbitals, momentum locality of the Fermi surface pockets\naround $K,K'$ is circumvented by backfolding the $\\pi$-bands to the concomitant\nmini-Brillouin zone of the supercell, reminiscent of their (twisted) moir\\'e\ncounterparts. The supercell Wannier functions reproduce the spectral weight and\nBerry curvature of the microscopic model and offer an intuitive real-space\npicture of the emergent physics at low electronic densities being shaped by\nflavor-polarized wave packets with mesoscopic extent. By projecting an\norbital-resolved, dual-gated Coulomb interaction to the effective Wannier\nbasis, we find that the low-energy physics of Bernal bilayer graphene is\ngoverned by weak electron-electron interactions. Our study bridges between\nexisting continuum theories and ab-initio studies of small Fermi pocket systems\nlike rhombohedral graphene stacks by providing a symmetric lattice description\nof their low-energy physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
