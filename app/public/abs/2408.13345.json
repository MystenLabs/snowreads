Here, we accelerate quantum simulation using digital multi-qubit\ngates that entangle primary system qubits with the ancillary qubits. The\npractical benefits originate from tuning the ancillary gauge degrees of freedom\nto enhance the quantum algorithm's original functionality in the system\nsubspace. For simple but nontrivial short-ranged, infinite long-ranged\ntransverse-field Ising models, and the hydrogen molecule model after qubit\nencoding, we show improvement in the time to solution by one hundred percent\nbut with higher accuracy through exact state-vector numerical simulation in a\ndigital-analog setting. The findings are further supported by time-averaged\nHamiltonian theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zm4nWrKkNHMj0ViSCUb9lj3ln8sQeDH2b42DY7zNKi0","pdfSize":"699223"}
