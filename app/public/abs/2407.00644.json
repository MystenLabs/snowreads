However, as the number of variables grows,\ninterpretation becomes increasingly difficult, and estimation uncertainty\nincreases due to the large number of parameters relative to the number of\nobservations. To address these challenges, we introduce the Clusterpath\nestimator of the Gaussian Graphical Model (CGGM) that encourages variable\nclustering in the graphical model in a data-driven way. Through the use of a\nclusterpath penalty, we group variables together, which in turn results in a\nblock-structured precision matrix whose block structure remains preserved in\nthe covariance matrix. We present a computationally efficient implementation of\nthe CGGM estimator by using a cyclic block coordinate descent algorithm. In\nsimulations, we show that CGGM not only matches, but oftentimes outperforms\nother state-of-the-art methods for variable clustering in graphical models. We\nalso demonstrate CGGM's practical advantages and versatility on a diverse\ncollection of empirical applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
