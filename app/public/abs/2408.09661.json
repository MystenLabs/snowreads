Traditional gradient-based methods are effective for unconstrained\nbilevel programs with unique lower level solutions, but struggle with\nconstrained bilevel problems due to the nonsmoothness of lower level solution\nmappings. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces the Enhanced\nBarrier-Smoothing Algorithm (EBSA), a novel approach that integrates\ngradient-based techniques with an augmented Lagrangian framework. EBSA utilizes\ninnovative smoothing functions to approximate the primal-dual solution mapping\nof the lower level problem, and then transforms the bilevel problem into a\nsequence of smooth single-level problems. This approach not only addresses the\nnonsmoothness but also enhances convergence properties. Theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates its superiority in achieving Clarke and, under certain conditions,\nBouligand stationary points for bilevel problems. Both theoretical analysis and\npreliminary numerical experiments confirm the robustness and efficiency of\nEBSA.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
