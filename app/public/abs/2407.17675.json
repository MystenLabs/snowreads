The geometric principles\ndiscussed here result in strikingly simple interfaces for graphics functions\nthat can draw (approximate) circles, ellipses, and arcs of circles and\nellipses. C++ source code listings are included for these functions. Their code\nsize can be relatively small because they are designed to be used with a\ngraphics library or platform that draws B\\'ezier curves, and the library or\nplatform is tasked with the actual rendering of the curves.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"akfFgNR-W7qr-J52IZGmPFln2bmF9k0b1MXHbZEi4fc","pdfSize":"866703"}
