The quantum and classical evolution of such systems are described\nby the Lindblad and the Fokker-Planck equation respectively. We show that when\nsuch a system is given by an at most quadratically growing Hamiltonian and at\nmost linearly growing real jump functions, the quantum and classical evolutions\nremain close on time scales much longer than Ehrenfest time. In particular, we\nshow that the evolution of a density matrix by the Lindblad equation is close\nin trace norm to the quantization of the corresponding evolution by the\nFokker-Planck equation. Such agreement improves upon recent results\n[arXiv:2403.09345, arXiv:2306.13717, arXiv:2307.05326], which proved long time\nagreement in weaker norms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
