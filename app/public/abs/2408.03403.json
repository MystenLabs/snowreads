The complexity function of every aperiodic function is\nnon-decreasing, submultiplicative and grows at least linearly. We prove that\nconversely, every function satisfying these conditions is asymptotically\nequivalent to the complexity function of a recurrent subshift, equivalently, a\nrecurrent infinite word. Our construction is explicit, algorithmic in nature\nand is philosophically based on constructing certain 'Cantor sets of integers',\nwhose 'gaps' correspond to blocks of zeros. We also prove that every\nnon-decreasing submultiplicative function is asymptotically equivalent, up a\nlinear error term, to the complexity function of a minimal subshift.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
