Assuming basic knowledge of ring theory, group theory and\nlinear algebra, the notes lay out the theory of field extensions and their\nGalois groups, up to and including the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.\nAlso included are a section on ruler and compass constructions, a proof that\nsolvable polynomials have solvable Galois groups, and the classification of\nfinite fields.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
