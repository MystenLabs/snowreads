In\norder to address biases in machine learning models, this research paper\ninvestigates advanced bias mitigation techniques, with a particular focus on\ncounterfactual fairness in conjunction with data augmentation. The study looks\ninto how these integrated approaches can lessen gender bias in the financial\nindustry, specifically in loan approval procedures. We show that these\napproaches are effective in achieving more equitable results through thorough\ntesting and assessment on a skewed financial dataset. The findings emphasize\nhow crucial it is to use fairness-aware techniques when creating machine\nlearning models in order to guarantee morally righteous and impartial\ndecision-making.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6rkU2WZmNROYCiL4qAgcH2YdXNADrSZ-0m-0CXwF3WY","pdfSize":"504161"}
