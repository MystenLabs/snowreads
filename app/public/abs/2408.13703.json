Previous models show large\ndiscrepancy with experiments in studying the spin-orbit torque switching of\nperpendicular magnet. In this work, we find that the trajectory of\nmagnetization shows a smooth transition during the switching. This contradicts\nthe key assumption in previous models that magnetization needs to align to the\nspin polarization (\\sigma) before the switching occurs. We demonstrate that\naligning magnetization to \\sigma requires a very large current, resulting in\nthe unsatisfactory fitting between the previous models and experiments. In\ncontrast, the smooth transition permits a lower switching current that is\ncomparable to experiments. Guided by this refined physical picture, we pinpoint\nthe reversal of precession chirality as a pivotal factor for achieving\ndeterministic switching. This insight leads to the formulation of a new\nanalytical model that demonstrates remarkable agreement with experimental data.\nOur work resolves an important issue confronting the experiment and theory. We\nprovide a clear physical picture of the current-induced magnetization\nswitching, which is invaluable in the development of spin-orbit torque magnetic\nrandom-access memory.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
