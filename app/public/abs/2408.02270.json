The choice $a_N=N^{-2/d}$ is the semi-classical setting and was\nanalysed in great detail in a special, interacting case in Deuchert and\nSeiringer (2021). Using a version of the well-known Feynman--Kac representation\nand a further representation in terms of a Poisson point process, we derive\nprecise asymptotics for the reduced one-particle density matrix, implying\noff-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO, a well-known criterion for Bose--Einstein\ncondensation) for $a_N$ above a certain threshold and non-occurrence of ODLRO\nfor $a_N$ below that threshold. In particular, we relate the condensate and its\ntotal mass to the amount of particles in long loops in the Feynman--Kac\nformula, the order parameter that Feynman suggested in Feynman (1953). For\n$a_N\\ll N^{-2/d}$, we prove that all loops have the minimal length one, and for\n$a_N\\gg N^{-2/d}$ we prove 100 percent condensation and identify the\ndistribution of the long-loop lengths as the Poisson--Dirichlet distribution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
