In this paper, we investigate the flavor Nernst\neffect (FNE) in quantum paramagnets, focusing on the Hall-type thermal spin\ntransport of crystal electric field (CEF) excitations with spin-orbit\ncouplings. As a proof of principle, we investigate the quantum paramagnetic\nground state in an effective spin-1 Hamiltonian with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions and a large hard-axis anisotropy. We employ linear flavor-wave\ntheory to analyze the low-energy excitations, and obtain the flavor Nernst\ncoefficients from the linear response theory. We demonstrate the FNE in a 2D\npyrochlore thin film with an all-in-all-out Ising axis configuration, and\ninvestigate their dependence on temperature, anisotropy, DM interaction, and\nexternal fields. Our results reveal the connection between the FNE and the\nBerry curvature of the CEF excitations, suggesting potential applications in\nmanipulating thermal spin currents and exploring topological spin transport\nphenomena in quantum paramagnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
