Using a spin-polarized tip, we\nobserve magnetic field induced changes in the peak heights of the Anderson\nimpurity states as well as in the magnetic field-split Kondo resonance.\nQuantitative comparison with numerical renormalization group calculations\nprovides evidence of the notable spin polarization of the spin-resolved\nimpurity spectral function under the influence of a magnetic field. Moreover,\nwe extract the field and temperature dependence of the impurity magnetization\nfrom the differential conductance measurements and demonstrate that this\nexhibits the universality and asymptotic freedom of the $S=1/2$ Kondo effect.\nThis work shows that mirror twin boundaries can be used as a testing ground for\ntheoretical predictions on quantum impurity models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
