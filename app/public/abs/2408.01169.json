Here, we show that\nthis symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) circuits defined on a\nspherical two-dimensional electron gas. We demonstrate that this is a\nconsequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the\nsphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the\nparallel transport condition as an offset. We discuss triangular circuits\ndefined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to\nregular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
