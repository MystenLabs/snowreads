Contrarily to the former bias, the latter is not\nunderstood within the Press-Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) formalisms of\nstructure formation, where protohalos are fully characterised by their height\nand scale. As halos in different backgrounds undergo mergers at different\nrates, the secondary bias was suggested not to be innate but to arise from the\ndistinct assembly history of halos. However, it has recently been proven that\nmergers leave no imprint in halo properties. But, in the peak model of\nstructure formation, the secondary bias could still be innate and arise from\nthe different typical curvature of peaks lying in different backgrounds. Here\nwe show that this is the case, indeed. Using the CUSP formalism, we find that\npeaks lying in different backgrounds with different typical curvatures evolve\nin halos with different density profiles which in turn lead to many other\ndistinct properties. The dependence we find of halo bias with those properties\nreproduces the results of simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eYlM_FAMp3PvAUOs27TcWStC_5qdLAowd5CLQ-MVWMU","pdfSize":"657248"}
