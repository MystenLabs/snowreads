As probabilities are in general more difficult to calculate, we\nare interested here in the reconstruction of distributions from their first\nmoments. For this, we explore two approaches. The first one relies on a\ngeneralization of the 2-forked branching correlation (quadratic) approximation\nused in the PMZBB and Poisson radical distributions, the second one is based on\nthe expansion of the distribution on a basis of Meixner discrete orthogonal\npolynomials.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
