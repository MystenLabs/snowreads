Traditional\nassessment methods often rely on extrinsic variables, such as performance in\ndownstream tasks, which can introduce confounding factors and mask the true\nquality of embeddings. This paper introduces the Intrinsic Distance\nPreservation Evaluation (IDPE) method, a novel approach for assessing embedding\nquality based on the preservation of Mahalanobis distances between data points\nin the original and embedded spaces. We demonstrate the limitations of\nextrinsic evaluation methods through a simple example, highlighting how they\ncan lead to misleading conclusions about embedding quality. IDPE addresses\nthese issues by providing a task-independent measure of how well embeddings\npreserve the intrinsic structure of the original data. Our method leverages\nefficient similarity search techniques to make it applicable to large-scale\ndatasets. We compare IDPE with established intrinsic metrics like\ntrustworthiness and continuity, as well as extrinsic metrics such as Average\nRank and Mean Reciprocal Rank. Our results show that IDPE offers a more\ncomprehensive and reliable assessment of embedding quality across various\nscenarios. We evaluate PCA and t-SNE embeddings using IDPE, revealing insights\ninto their performance that are not captured by traditional metrics. This work\ncontributes to the field by providing a robust, efficient, and interpretable\nmethod for embedding evaluation. IDPE's focus on intrinsic properties offers a\nvaluable tool for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop and assess\nhigh-quality embeddings for diverse machine learning applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0D5KQ9e1hCXciXrSIwFpy5CcHIweM6ROwLeIDTQlMPc","pdfSize":"918600"}
