However, in many applications it is necessary to compute an arbitrary\nnumber of them, k. Even though the problem has raised a lot of interest from\ndifferent research communities and many applications of it are known, it has\nnot been addressed to the same extent as the single shortest path problem. The\nbest algorithm known for efficiently solving this task has a time complexity of\nO (|E| + |V|log{|V|}+k|V|)$ when computing paths in explicit form, and is based\non best-first search. This paper introduces a new search algorithm with the\nsame time complexity, which results from a natural evolution of A* thus, it\npreserves all its interesting properties, making it widely applicable to many\ndifferent domains. Experiments in various testbeds show a significant\nimprovement in performance over the state of the art, often by one or two\norders of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
