When the\ninteraction between them is short-ranged, the long-time behavior of the driven\nparticle is remarkably universal -- the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and the\ntypical position of the driven particle exhibits the same qualitative behaviors\nindependent of the specific form of the potential. In particular, the MSD grows\nas $t^{1/2}$ in one dimension and $\\log t$ in two spatial dimensions. We\ncompute the exact scaling functions for the position distribution in $d=1$ and\n$d=2$. These functions are universal when the interaction is short-ranged. For\nlong-ranged interactions, the MSD of the driven particle grows as $t^{\\phi}$\nwith exponent $\\phi$ depending on the tail of the potential.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
