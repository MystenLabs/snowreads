Clusters are identified using various techniques, generally\ndeterministic and based on spatio-temporal windowing. Conversely, the leading\nrail in short-term earthquake forecasting has a probabilistic view of\nclustering, usually based on the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS)\nmodels. In this study we compare seismic clusters, identified by two different\ndeterministic window-based techniques, with the ETAS probabilities associated\nwith any event in the clusters, thus investigating the consistency between\ndeterministic and probabilistic approaches. The comparison is performed by\nconsidering, for each event in an identified cluster, the corresponding\nprobability of being independent and the expected number of triggered events\naccording to ETAS. Results show no substantial differences between the cluster\nidentification procedures, and an overall consistency between the identified\nclusters and the relative events' ETAS probabilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2VsVKXitZ9rNSQeFvTn9orxWM5Agm_m0ib0TD6wOdt4","pdfSize":"39494864"}
