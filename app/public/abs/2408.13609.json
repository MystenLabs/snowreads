In addition to these previous works, our\nalgorithm GNN leverages the advantages of graph neural networks and large\nlanguage models to understand text type values that cannot be understood by\nPLOD and MOD, thus making the task of predicting outcomes more reliable. GNN\ncould be seen as an extension of PLOD in terms of understanding the text type\nvalue and the user's preferences, not only numerical values but also text\nvalues, making the promise of data science and analytics purposes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8Can3wM3LDjFTTPtJPg1Sc2soLmFZ1YXQYnXT9UxVU8","pdfSize":"471408"}
