The second-named author and Ntalampekos recently\nfound a method to bi-Lipschitz embed an arbitrary metric triangle in the\nEuclidean plane with uniformly bounded distortion, which we call here the\ntripodal embedding. In this paper, we prove the sharp distortion bound\n$4\\sqrt{7/3}$ for the tripodal embedding. We also give a detailed analysis of\nfour representative examples of metric triangles: the intrinsic circle, the\nthree-petal rose, tripods and the twisted heart. In particular, our examples\nshow the sharpness of the tripodal embedding distortion bound and give a lower\nbound for the optimal distortion bound in general. Finally, we show the\ntriangle embedding theorem does not generalize to metric quadrilaterals by\ngiving a family of examples of metric quadrilaterals that are not bi-Lipschitz\nembeddable in the plane with uniform distortion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
