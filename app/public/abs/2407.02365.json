Building upon the\nfoundational insights of Xu and Zhao, who adeptly evaluate these integrals\nusing rational linear combinations of Lambert-type series and derive\nclosed-form expressions involving products of $\\Gamma^4(1/4)$ and $\\pi^{-1}$,\nwe uncover direct evaluations of the Barnes-zeta function. Moreover, our\ninquiry leads us to establish connections between Berndt-type integrals and\nJacobi elliptic functions, as well as moment polynomials investigated by Lomont\nand Brillhart, a relationship elucidated through the seminal contributions of\nKuznetsov. In this manner, we extend and integrate these diverse mathematical\nthreads, unveiling deeper insights into the intrinsic connections and broader\nimplications of Berndt-type integrals in special function and integration\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
