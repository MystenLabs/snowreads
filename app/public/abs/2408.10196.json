Over fields of characteristic two,\nthere are many quadratic forms associated to a given bilinear form and\nquadratic geometries are structures that encode a vector space over a field of\ncharacteristic 2 with a non-degenerate bilinear form together with a space of\nassociated quadratic forms. These structures over finite fields of\ncharacteristic 2 form an important part of the basic geometries that appear in\nthe Lie coordinatizable structures of Cherlin and Hrushovski. We (a) describe\nthe respective model companions of the theory of orthogonal spaces and the\ntheory of quadratic geometries and (b) classify the pseudo-finite completions\nof these theories. We also (c) give a neostability-theoretic classification of\nthe model companions and these pseudo-finite completions. This is a small step\ntowards understanding the analogue of the Cherlin-Hrushovski theory of Lie\ncoordinatizable structures in a setting where the involved fields may be\npseudo-finite.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
