We find that they have several beautiful infinite\nproduct $q$-series expressions in terms of Ramanujan's general theta function.\nFor the theories with fundamental chiral multiplets, the pairs of the Neumann\nhalf-indices and one-point functions of the fundamental Wilson lines form a\nbasis for the line defect indices in terms of the Rogers-Ramanujan type\nfunctions. Furthermore, the theories with an adjoint chiral admit the\nexpressions as the eta-products. In particular, for the $SU(N)_{-2N}$ CS\ntheory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the BPS boundary local\noperators and the $N$-core partitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
