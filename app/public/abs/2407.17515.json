While current\nbenchmarks have led to the development of powerful QD methods, we argue that\nnew paradigms must be developed to facilitate open-ended search and\ngeneralizability. In particular, many methods focus on learning diverse agents\nthat each move to a different xy position in MAP-Elites-style bounded archives.\nHere, we show that such tasks can be accomplished with a single,\ngoal-conditioned policy paired with a classical planner, achieving O(1) space\ncomplexity w.r.t. the number of policies and generalization to task variants.\nWe hypothesize that this approach is successful because it extracts\ntask-invariant structural knowledge by modeling a relational graph between\nadjacent cells in the archive. We motivate this view with emerging evidence\nfrom computational neuroscience and explore connections between QD and models\nof cognitive maps in human and other animal brains. We conclude with a\ndiscussion exploring the relationships between QD and cognitive maps, and\npropose future research directions inspired by cognitive maps towards future\ngeneralizable algorithms capable of truly open-ended search.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
