Kaczorowski, A. Perelli and M. Radziejewski [Acta\nArith. 210 (2023), 1-21], that cannot be conductors of L-functions of degree 2\nfrom the extended Selberg class. We show that the set of forbidden q is dense\nin the interval (0,4), solving a problem posed in [Acta Arith. 210 (2023),\n1-21]. We also find positive points of accumulation of rational forbidden q.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
