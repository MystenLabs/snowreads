The publication does not really support the claim, but a reader could\nbelieve it thanks to the use of logical fallacies. Here, we aim to detect and\nto highlight such fallacies, which requires carefully assessing the exact\ncontent of the misrepresented publications. To achieve this, we introduce\nMissciPlus, an extension of the fallacy detection dataset Missci. MissciPlus\nbuilds on Missci by grounding the applied fallacies in real-world passages from\nmisrepresented studies. This creates a realistic test-bed for detecting and\nverbalizing these fallacies under real-world input conditions, and enables\nnovel passage-retrieval tasks. MissciPlus is the first logical fallacy dataset\nwhich pairs the real-world misrepresented evidence with incorrect claims,\nidentical to the input to evidence-based fact-checking models. With MissciPlus,\nwe i) benchmark retrieval models in identifying passages that support claims\nonly when fallacies are applied, ii) evaluate how well LLMs articulate\nfallacious reasoning from misrepresented scientific passages, and iii) assess\nthe effectiveness of fact-checking models in refuting claims that misrepresent\nbiomedical research. Our findings show that current fact-checking models\nstruggle to use relevant passages from misrepresented publications to refute\nmisinformation. Moreover, these passages can mislead LLMs into accepting false\nclaims as true.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
