In Wi-Fi, high delays are often caused by waiting for the\nchannel to become idle. This problem can be solved with Parameterized Spatial\nReuse (PSR), which allows a station (STA) to transmit its frame with reduced\npower simultaneously with a triggered uplink transmission in an overlapping\nnetwork. The PSR opportunity depends on the pathloss between involved STAs, so\nthe same transmission may allow PSR for one STA but not for another one. Thus,\nto satisfy tight delay constraints in dense overlapping networks, access points\n(APs) in the same area shall often allow PSR for every STA with RTA traffic.\nThis letter proposes a fast scheduler enabling frequent PSR transmissions for\nRTA traffic. The scheduler uses Multi-AP coordination, the feature of upcoming\nWi-Fi 8. With simulations, we show that it almost halves the delay for RTA\ntraffic and does not deteriorate the quality of service for other traffic\ncompared with an airtime fairness scheduler.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
