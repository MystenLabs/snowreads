Our discussion emphasizes two prominent cases from which\nmuch insight into the general picture may be gleaned: idempotent varieties and\ntheir generalizations ($n$-potent varieties, knotted varieties), and\ncancellative varieties and their relatives (MV-algebras, BL-algebras). Along\nthe way, we illustrate how general-purpose tools developed to study\namalgamation can be brought to bear in these contexts and solve some of the\nremaining open questions concerning amalgamation in semilinear varieties. Among\nother things, we show that the variety of commutative semilinear residuated\nlattices does not have the amalgamation property. Taken as a whole, we see that\namalgamation is well understood in most interesting varieties of semilinear\nresiduated lattices, with the last few outstanding open questions remaining\nprincipally in the cancellative setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
