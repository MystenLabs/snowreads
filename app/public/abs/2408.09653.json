We demonstrate that the six-dimensional self-dual\nstructures governed by the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations can be elegantly\norganized using these generalized 't Hooft symbols. We also present a\nsystematic method for constructing Hermitian Yang-Mills instantons from spin\nconnections on six-dimensional manifolds using the generalized 't Hooft\nsymbols. We provide a thorough analysis of the topological invariants such as\ninstanton and Euler numbers.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
