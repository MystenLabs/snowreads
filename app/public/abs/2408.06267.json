The new equation encompasses several well-known examples of\ncanonical Hermitian metrics on vector bundles, including the usual\nHermite--Einstein metrics, K\\\"ahler--Ricci solitons, and transversally\nHermite--Einstein metrics on certain Sasaki manifolds. We prove that the\nequation arises naturally as a moment map, that solutions to the equation are\nunique up to scaling, and demonstrate a weighted Kobayashi--L\\\"ubke inequality\nsatisfied by vector bundles admitting a weighted Hermite--Einstein metric. As\nan application of our techniques, we extend a bound of Tian on the Ricci\ncurvature to a bound on a modified Ricci curvature, related to the existence of\nK\\\"ahler--Ricci solitons. Along the way, we introduce a new weighted vortex\nequation, as well as a weighted analogue of Gieseker stability. A key technical\npoint is the application of a new extension of Inoue's equivariant intersection\nnumbers to arbitrary weight functions on the moment polytope of a K\\\"ahler\nmanifold with Hamiltonian torus action.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CrFtVBh0LbtbMMGi8-QEA1EKYb_1OJJhXRrqIVLeNFY","pdfSize":"634442"}
