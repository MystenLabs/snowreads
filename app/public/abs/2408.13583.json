The peak electric field obtained at 4 THz is 1.5 MV/cm.\nWe generate the mid-IR light using a difference-frequency generation (DFG)\nprocess with two phase-locked, chirped IR pulses. The obtained mid-IR electric\nfield waveform is characterized using electro-optic sampling. We compare our\nexperimental results with the predictions of numerical simulations. The results\nindicate the potential for efficient driving of vibrational modes into a\nstrongly anharmomic regime, in cases where using Fourier-transform-limited\npulses to achieve similar vibrational amplitudes would lead to dielectric\nbreakdown.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
