We explored potential efficiencies from an\nartificial intelligence software in the generation of ED discharge letters and\nthe attitudes of doctors toward this technology. The evaluated system leverages\nadvanced techniques to fine-tune a model to generate discharge summaries from\nshort-hand inputs, including voice, text, and electronic health record data.\nNineteen physicians with emergency medicine experience evaluated the system\ntext and voice-to-text interfaces against manual typing. The results showed\nsignificant time savings with MedWrite LLM interfaces compared to manual\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
