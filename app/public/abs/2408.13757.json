The set R(X,Y) is regarded as a topological\nsubspace of the space C(X,Y) of all continuous maps from X to Y endowed with\nthe compact-open topology. We prove, in a much more general setting than\npreviously considered, that each path component of C(X,Y) contains at most one\npath component of R(X,Y), and for every positive integer k the inclusion map\nR(X,Y)-->C(X,Y) induces an isomorphism between the kth homotopy groups of the\ncorresponding path components. We also identify several cases where this\ninclusion map is a weak homotopy equivalence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
