Here, we report a group of new planar dual-phase mixed\nionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) OTMs consisting of\nCO$_2$$_{0.85}$Nd$_{0.1}$Cu$_{0.05}$O$_2$ (CNCO) and\nNd$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$Fe$_{1-y}$Cu$_y$O$_3$(NSFCO; $x = 0.4, 0.6$; $y = 0.05, 0.1$)\nphases, showing excellent oxygen permeability while comparable CO$_2$-resistant\nstability. The substitution of Cu as a bifunctional additive decreases the\nsintering temperature and enhances bulk diffusion and oxygen permeability with\nthe co-doping of Nd.The oxygen permeation fluxes reached 2.62 and 1.52 mL\nmin$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ at 1000$^\\circ$C through the optimal\n60wt%Ce0.85Nd0.1Cu0.05O2-40wt%Nd0.4Sr0.6Fe0.9Cu0.1O3 (CNCO-NSFCO41) composition\nwith He and CO$_2$ sweeping, respectively, higher than all reported dense\ndual-phase OTMs. Such excellent CO$_2$-tolerant permeability meets the needs of\npotential industrial applications. Analysis with Zhu's oxygen permeation model\nshows lower bulk diffusion resistance of CNCO-NSFCO41 than that of reported\n60wt%Ce0.85Pr0.1Cu0.05O2-40wt%Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.9Cu0.1O3(CPCO-PSFCO41)and more\nlimitation by the interfacial exchange at high temperature. All the prepared\nOTMs also show good long-term stability over 100 hours in both atmospheres. Our\nresults confirm the excellent oxygen permeability and stability under a\nhigh-concentration CO2 atmosphere, providing a material candidate for CO2\ncapture in oxyfuel combustion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
