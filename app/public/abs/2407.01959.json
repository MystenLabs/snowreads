Traditional motion-based approaches achieve\ntarget tracking by estimating the relative movement of target between two\nconsecutive frames. However, they usually overlook local motion information of\nthe target and fail to exploit historical frame information effectively. To\novercome the above limitations, we propose a point-level flow method with\nmulti-frame information for 3D SOT task, called FlowTrack. Specifically, by\nestimating the flow for each point in the target, our method could capture the\nlocal motion details of target, thereby improving the tracking performance. At\nthe same time, to handle scenes with sparse points, we present a learnable\ntarget feature as the bridge to efficiently integrate target information from\npast frames. Moreover, we design a novel Instance Flow Head to transform dense\npoint-level flow into instance-level motion, effectively aggregating local\nmotion information to obtain global target motion. Finally, our method achieves\ncompetitive performance with improvements of 5.9% on the KITTI dataset and 2.9%\non NuScenes. The code will be made publicly available soon.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YwKWYPQGK9qNIa-Ynf7Lt55xTXGTJaC9833T8YqIedA","pdfSize":"1671544"}
