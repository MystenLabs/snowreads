Given that ST data consists of non-stationary and\ncomplex time events, interpreting and predicting such trends is comparatively\ncomplicated. Representation of ST data in modes helps us infer behavior and\nassess the impact of noise on prediction applications. We propose a framework\nthat decomposes ST data into modes using the variational mode decomposition\n(VMD) method, which is then fed into the neural network for forecasting future\nstates. This hybrid approach is known as a variational mode graph convolutional\nnetwork (VMGCN). Instead of exhaustively searching for the number of modes,\nthey are determined using the reconstruction loss from the real-time\napplication data. We also study the significance of each mode and the impact of\nbandwidth constraints on different horizon predictions in traffic flow data. We\nevaluate the performance of our proposed network on the LargeST dataset for\nboth short and long-term predictions. Our framework yields better results\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q_Yp7B30p55bEq2IF0Nj2Emm8d5FGr7iPfPaZiMyIZA","pdfSize":"10901655"}
