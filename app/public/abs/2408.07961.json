The near-field and far-field scrambling\ncharacteristics have a profound impact on the line spread function (LSF) of the\nspectra. Focal ratio degradation (FRD) influences the output beam size, thereby\naffecting the throughput, as well as the size of the collimator and dispersion\nelements. While previous research has indicated that these properties depend on\nthe shape of the fiber core and showed that non-circular core fibers can yield\nuniform near-field scrambling, the result remains inconclusive for far-field.\nIn this study, we investigate the near-field and far-field scrambling\nproperties, along with the FRD, of 50-micron core fibers with different core\ngeometries. We find that in addition to excellent near-field scrambling,\noctagonal-core fibers can also produce more uniform far-field output when\ncompared to circular-core fibers. They also have less FRD effect when being fed\nwith a f/3 beam.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
