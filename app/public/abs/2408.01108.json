It will be a detector with three truly cylindrical layers based on\nthin wafer scale MAPS, reaching less than 0.07% X/X0 per layer and with the\ninnermost layer located as close as 19 mm to the interaction point. This\ncontribution will describe the global detector integration concept, focusing\non: the sensor bending procedure, the sensor electrical interconnection, the\nchoice of the best carbon foam for light mechanical supporting structures, the\nstudies of cooling by air flow, and the global structures mechanical\ncharacterization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
