However, people have heterogeneous spatial demand patterns and\nwillingness (or ability) to pay tolls, and so pricing may have substantial\nequity implications. We develop a data-driven approach to design congestion\npricing given policymakers' equity and efficiency objectives. First,\nalgorithmically, we extend the Markovian traffic equilibrium setting introduced\nby Baillon & Cominetti (2008) to model heterogeneous populations and\nincorporate prices and outside options such as public transit. Second, we\nempirically evaluate various pricing schemes using data collected by an\nindustry partner in the city of Bogota, one of the most congested cities in the\nworld. We find that pricing personalized to each economic stratum can be\nsubstantially more efficient and equitable than uniform pricing; however,\nnon-personalized but area-based pricing can recover much of the gap.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
