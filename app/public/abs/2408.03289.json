Since the spin effect is more pronounced for longer\nwavelengths and gravitational waves sourced by binaries have a long wavelength,\nit may become an important effect in addition to the wave effect. We study the\npropagation of gravitational waves lensed by a Kerr black hole by numerically\nsolving the Teukolsky equation with a source term of the equal-mass circular\nbinary, taking into account both spin effect and wave effect. We find\nhelicity-dependent small-period oscillation in the power spectrum of the\namplification factor in the forward direction and the oscillation is enhanced\nas spin of a prograde Kerr black hole increases.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
