First, key challenges in China's\nenergy transition, industry decarbonziation and regional sustainable\ndevelopment are explored. The coal-dominated energy consumption has placed\ngreat obstacles in achieving energy transition and led to massive CO2 emission\nsince the large-scale industrialization. The high dependency on oil and gas\nimport has threatened the energy security. A DEA model is applied for obtaining\ngreen total factor productivities of China's six administrative regions, with\nwhich, imbalanced and unsustainable regional development is identified. Second,\nthe role of green ammonia in meeting the sustainability challenges is analysed.\nAmmonia is examined to be a flexible and economic option for large-scale\nhydrogen transport and storage. Co-firing ammonia in coal power generation at\n3% rate is evaluated as an option for achieving low-carbon transition by 2030.\nThe adoption of a green ammonia economy in China is discussed from energy,\nenvironmental and economic aspects. The practice can decline fossil energy\nconsumption, enhance energy security, and facilitate renewable energy delivery\nand storage, industry decarbonization, and regional development. We assume the\nfindings and results contribute to addressing sustainability challenges and\nrealizing a hydrogen economy in China.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
