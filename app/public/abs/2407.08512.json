We use\ntechniques from embedded contact homology to determine quantitative critera for\nwhen anchored symplectic embeddings exist, for many examples of toric domains.\nIn particular we find examples where ordinarily symplectic embeddings exist,\nbut they cannot be upgraded to anchored symplectic embeddings unless one\nenlarges the target domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
