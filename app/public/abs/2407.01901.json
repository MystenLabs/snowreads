We study the\nmulti-solvability of the stationary systems on general domains, which is\nclosely related with the Cauchy-Riemann systems and critical points of harmonic\nfunctions on the domain. Then based on the structure of Green's functions, the\ncommutator estimates are obtained on the circular domains and extended to\ngeneral domains with the help of conformal mappings. Moreover, we will utilize\nthese assertions to discuss the global well-posedness and large time behaviours\nof the non-stationary systems on general domains with large initial values\ncontaining vacuum.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
