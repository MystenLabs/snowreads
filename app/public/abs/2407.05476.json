This sequel contains,\nfor certain special forms, an independent and elementary proof of this result.\nWhen combined with other results of \\cite{Du}, this proof also leads to a\nrefinement of an asymptotic result of \\cite{Du} and some corollaries for these\nspecial forms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
