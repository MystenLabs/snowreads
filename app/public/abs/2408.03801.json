However, learning the simulated Hamiltonian, a\nprerequisite for any applications of a quantum simulator, remains an\noutstanding challenge due to the fast increasing time cost with the qubit\nnumber and the lack of high-fidelity universal gate operations in the noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum era. Here we demonstrate the Hamiltonian learning of\na two-dimensional ion trap quantum simulator with 300 qubits. We employ global\nmanipulations and single-qubit-resolved state detection to efficiently learn\nthe all-to-all-coupled Ising model Hamiltonian, with the required quantum\nresources scaling at most linearly with the qubit number. Our work paves the\nway for wide applications of large-scale ion trap quantum simulators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
