A crucial aspect\nof a successfully deployed multi-sensor system is the calibration with a known\nobject typically named fiducial. In this work, we propose a novel fiducial\nsystem for millimeter wave radars, termed as CalTag. CalTag addresses the\nlimitations of traditional corner reflector-based calibration methods in\nextremely cluttered environments. CalTag leverages millimeter wave backscatter\ntechnology to achieve more reliable calibration than corner reflectors,\nenhancing the overall performance of multi-sensor perception systems. We\ncompare the performance in several real-world environments and show the\nimprovement achieved by using CalTag as the radar fiducial over a corner\nreflector.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
