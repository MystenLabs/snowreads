To address these challenges, we investigate\nwhether gamification of testing directly in the Integrated Development\nEnvironment (IDE) can guide exploratory testing. We therefore show challenges\nand quests generated by the Gamekins gamification system to make testing more\nengaging and seamlessly blend it with regular coding tasks. In a 60-minute\nexperiment, we evaluated Gamekins' impact on test suite quality and bug\ndetection. The results show that participants actively interacted with the\ntool, achieving nearly 90% line coverage and detecting 11 out of 14 bugs.\nAdditionally, participants reported enjoying the experience, indicating that\ngamification can enhance developer participation in testing and improve\nsoftware quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1WSVIPFfeYFQ8iURWZwRh4qZS_AgiqQANNS6Cu8q_Uo","pdfSize":"839680"}
