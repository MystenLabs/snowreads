Potential-field-based methods are widely used for autonomous\nexploration because of their high efficiency and low travel cost. However,\nexploration speed and collaboration ability are still challenging topics.\nTherefore, we propose a Distributed Multi-Robot Potential-Field-Based\nExploration (DMPF-Explore). In particular, we first present a Distributed\nSubmap-Based Multi-Robot Collaborative Mapping Method (DSMC-Map), which can\nefficiently estimate the robot trajectories and construct the global map by\nmerging the local maps from each robot. Second, we introduce a\nPotential-Field-Based Exploration Strategy Augmented with Modified Wave-Front\nDistance and Colored Noises (MWF-CN), in which the accessible frontier\nneighborhood is extended, and the colored noise provokes the enhancement of\nexploration performance. The proposed exploration method is deployed for\nsimulation and real-world scenarios. The results show that our approach\noutperforms the existing ones regarding exploration speed and collaboration\nability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
