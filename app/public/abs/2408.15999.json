Existing MRS quantification\nmethods face difficulties in balancing model complexity and reproducibility\nduring spectral modeling, often falling into the trap of either\noversimplification or over-parameterization. To address these limitations, this\nstudy introduces a deep learning (DL) framework that employs transfer learning,\nin which the model is pre-trained on simulated datasets before it undergoes\nfine-tuning on in vivo data. The proposed framework showed promising\nperformance when applied to the Philips dataset from the BIG GABA repository\nand represents an exciting advancement in MRS data analysis.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"b8DgLyMTXQ3gAgEYkKriWERLmvCIO6NkbyMDJOaIO7o","pdfSize":"11805058"}
