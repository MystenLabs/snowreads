We incorporate all relevant scales associated with\nthree-body $DD\\pi$ dynamics and the left-hand cut induced by the one-pion\nexchange for pion masses higher than the physical one, as required by\nanalyticity and unitarity. By adjusting the contact interactions to match\nexperimental data at the physical pion mass and lattice finite-volume energy\nlevels at $m_{\\pi} = 280$ MeV, we predict the trajectory of the $T_{cc}$ pole\nas a function of the pion mass, finding it consistent with the\nhadronic-molecule scenario. In particular, we find that the explicit treatment\nof the one-pion exchange has a pronounced effect on the pole trajectory for\n$m_\\pi \\gtrsim 230$ MeV by pushing it into the complex energy plane.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
