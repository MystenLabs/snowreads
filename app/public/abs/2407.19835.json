With a broad consensus on\nthe importance of translating these literatures to enrich knowledge\ndissemination across communities, the advent of large language models (LLMs)\nand translation systems offers promising tools to facilitate this goal.\nHowever, we have identified a scarcity of translation datasets in Classical\nArabic, which are often limited in scope and topics, hindering the development\nof high-quality translation systems. In response, we present the ATHAR dataset,\ncomprising 66,000 high-quality Classical Arabic to English translation samples\nthat cover a wide array of subjects including science, culture, and philosophy.\nFurthermore, we assess the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs under\nvarious settings, concluding that there is a need for such datasets in current\nsystems. Our findings highlight how models can benefit from fine-tuning or\nincorporating this dataset into their pretraining pipelines.
