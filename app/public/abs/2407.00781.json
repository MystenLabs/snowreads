While some degree of SRO is\nexpected at equilibrium, predicting the kinetics of its formation is\nchallenging. We present a simplified isothermal concentration-wave (CW) model\nto estimate an effective relaxation time of SRO formation. Estimates from the\nCW model agree to within a factor of five with relaxation times obtained from\nkinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations when above the highest ordering\ninstability temperature. The advantage of the CW model is that it only requires\nmobility and thermodynamic parameters, which are readily obtained from alloy\nmobility databases and Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. The\nsimple parameterization of the CW model and its analytical nature make it an\nattractive tool for the design of processing conditions to promote or suppress\nSRO in multicomponent alloys.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ikq51eEX6ZnCZ6NEYW40NHgftsAI5Q3FIG5AeuYaHrY","pdfSize":"4161621","objectId":"0xaa24f85e67f37c7f8151bed7eb9c404ac283f5e0a953f075711167d9f2b933f8","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
