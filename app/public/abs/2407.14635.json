{"id":"2407.14635","title":"Predicting the Distribution of Treatment Effects: A Covariate-Adjustment\n  Approach","authors":"Bruno Fava","authorsParsed":[["Fava","Bruno",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 19:12:11 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-23","timestamp":1721416331000,"abstract":"  Important questions for impact evaluation require knowledge not only of\naverage effects, but of the distribution of treatment effects. What proportion\nof people are harmed? Does a policy help many by a little? Or a few by a lot?\nThe inability to observe individual counterfactuals makes these empirical\nquestions challenging. I propose an approach to inference on points of the\ndistribution of treatment effects by incorporating predicted counterfactuals\nthrough covariate adjustment. I show that finite-sample inference is valid\nunder weak assumptions, for example when data come from a Randomized Controlled\nTrial (RCT), and that large-sample inference is asymptotically exact under\nsuitable conditions. Finally, I revisit five RCTs in microcredit where average\neffects are not statistically significant and find evidence of both positive\nand negative treatment effects in household income. On average across studies,\nat least 13.6% of households benefited and 12.5% were negatively affected.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
