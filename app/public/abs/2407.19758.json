In network coding, a flag code is a set of flags, all of\nthem with the same sequence of dimensions, the type vector. In this paper, we\ninvestigate quasi-optimum distance flag codes, i.e., those attaining the second\nbest possible distance value. We characterize them and present upper bounds for\ntheir cardinality. Moreover, we propose a systematic construction for every\nchoice of the type vector by using partial spreads and sunflowers. For flag\ncodes with lower minimum distance, we adapt the previous construction and\nprovide some results towards their characterization, especially in the case of\nthe third best possible distance value.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KSINusGC4q182q5Hz38EiXJhQdckkiFU_RZrkRNPfbA","pdfSize":"349886"}
