Matache (J. Operator Theory 73(1):243--264, 2015) raised an open problem\nabout characterizing composition operators $C_{\\phi}$ on the Hardy space $H^2$\nand nonzero singular measures $\\mu_1$, $\\mu_2$ on the unit circle such that\n$C_{\\phi}({S_{\\mu_1}} H^2)\\subseteq {S_{\\mu_2}} H^2,$ where $S_{\\mu_i}$ denotes\nthe singular inner function corresponding to the measure $\\mu_i,i=1,2$. In this\narticle, we consider this problem in a more general setting. We characterize\nholomorphic self maps $\\phi$ of the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ and inner functions\n$\\theta_1, \\theta_2$ such that $C_{\\phi}(\\theta_1 H^p)\\subseteq \\theta_2 H^p,$\nfor $p>0$. Emphasis is given to Blaschke products and singular inner functions\nas a special case.\n  We also give an another measure-theoretic characterization to above question\nwhen $\\phi$ is an elliptic automorphism. For a given Blaschke product $\\theta$,\nwe discuss about finding all self maps $\\phi$ such that $\\theta H^p$ is\ninvariant under $C_\\phi$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zpsen_Y7-ikf3BsveNPOHkmgFndAUaInVLcMUI4v_50","pdfSize":"229935"}
