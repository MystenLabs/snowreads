The extended $\\gamma$-ray source was detected with a significance of\n${\\sim}16\\,\\sigma$ by KM2A and ${\\sim}17\\,\\sigma$ by WCDA, respectively. The\nangular extension of this $\\gamma$-ray source is about 0.5 degrees,\ncorresponding to a physical size of about 50 pc. We discuss the origin of the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission and possible cosmic ray acceleration in the W43 region\nusing multi-wavelength data. Our findings suggest that W43 is likely another\nyoung star cluster capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to at least\nseveral hundred TeV.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
