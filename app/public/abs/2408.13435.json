The system generates\nartificial noise (AN) in both transmission directions and uses a telephone\nhybrid circuit to effectively suppress the AN for the purpose of secure\ncommunication. Furthermore, we analyze the secrecy capacity of the system and\nevaluate its performance through theoretical analysis and practical\nexperiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed system can significantly\nenhance communication security while preserving the integrity of legitimate\nsignals. The results also validate that the proposed system is a robust and\neffective solution for securing wire-line telephone communications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A_kZPN6JABdPjSI1XTlL_OMkcLy26IyMOao0_CzSpTw","pdfSize":"495629"}
