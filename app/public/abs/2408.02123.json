Furthermore, we show the alignment between the explanation map\nproduced by FovEx and human gaze patterns (+14\\% in NSS compared to RISE,\n+203\\% in NSS compared to gradCAM), enhancing our confidence in FovEx's ability\nto close the interpretation gap between humans and machines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"qbG04bKZwhjfIfaCsQfS36RSIhJyqDJQ11bsnO6Q30g","pdfSize":"1719710"}
