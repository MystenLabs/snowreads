The synchronous comparison of\na clock transition in two independent atomic ensembles using a single\nultrastable laser has allowed us to eliminate fluctuations of the laser\nfrequency from the measured frequency difference and to reach a relative\nmeasurement error of $10^{-16}$ after 500-s averaging, which corresponds to a\nrelative instability of $2\\times10^{-15}/\\sqrt{\\tau}$. The successful\ndemonstration of the long-term operation of two systems using the synchronous\ncomparison of clock transitions opens the possibility of studying systematic\nshifts in thulium optical clocks with an uncertainty of $10^{-17}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
