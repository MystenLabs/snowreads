These platforms are, therefore, critical components of\nreal-world IoT deployments, making their security essential to ensure the\nresilience and reliability of these 'systems of systems'. In this paper, we\ntake the first steps toward systematically and comprehensively addressing the\nsecurity of IoT context-sharing platforms. We propose a framework for threat\nmodelling and security analysis of a generic IoT context-sharing solution,\nemploying the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Through an evaluation of various\nindustry-funded projects and academic research, we identify significant\nsecurity challenges in the design of IoT context-sharing platforms. Our threat\nmodelling provides an in-depth analysis of the techniques and sub-techniques\nadversaries may use to exploit these systems, offering valuable insights for\nfuture research aimed at developing resilient solutions. Additionally, we have\ndeveloped an open-source threat analysis tool that incorporates our detailed\nthreat modelling, which can be used to evaluate and enhance the security of\nexisting context-sharing platforms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
