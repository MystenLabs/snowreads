By leveraging intermediate measurements and feedforward\noperations, FQSVTs reclaim quantum information typically discarded in\nconventional QSVT, enabling more efficient transformations. Our results show\nthat FQSVTs can exponentially accelerate the projection of quantum states onto\nenergy subspaces, outperforming probabilistic projection and adiabatic\nalgorithms with superior efficiency and a drastic reduction in query\ncomplexity. In the context of superconducting qubits, FQSVTs offer a powerful\ntool for managing energy subspaces, improving efficiency for state preparation\nand leakage detection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"w6bWQwREQgX3GUNlW8sek6ipeq0DMhsF0li9H_bFQFc","pdfSize":"3319950"}
