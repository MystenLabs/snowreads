Intriguingly, these mSPT phases cannot\nbe realized as the ground states of a gapped Hamiltonian under thermal\nequilibrium. The microscopic form of the density matrix characterizing these\nintrinsic mixed-state SPT ensembles is constructed using solvable coupled-wire\nmodels that incorporate quenched disorder or quantum channels. A detailed\ncomparison of the hierarchical structure of boundary anomalies in both pure and\nmixed states is presented, utilizing flux insertion and Laughlin's charge\npumping arguments. Finally, we explore the salient features of boundary\nanomalies in the mixed-state ensemble, which can be detected through the\nRenyi-N correlation function of charged observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
