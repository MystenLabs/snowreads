The protocol is especially useful in the low-field regime and for\nhigh-frequency sensing applications. It constitutes an extension to the NV-ERC\ntechnique, which has demonstrated efficient initialization and readout of the\ndouble quantum transition with no leakage to any third level thanks to an\neffective Raman coupling. Here we derive a full theoretical framework of the\nscheme, identifying the complete unitary associated to the approach, and more\nspecifically the relevant basis change for each of two characteristic pulse\ndurations. Based on this insight, we propose a scheme to perform fast qubit\ntransformations in the double quantum transition. We study its robustness with\nrespect to pulse-timing errors resulting from faulty identification of system\nparameters or phase-control limitations. We finally demonstrate that the\ntechnique can also be implemented in the presence of unknown electric or strain\nfields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
