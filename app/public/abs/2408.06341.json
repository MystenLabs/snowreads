This trend is supported by the fact that a\nsignificant majority of American travelers utilize SNs during their trips.\nHowever, the abundance of information available on these platforms presents a\nchallenge in identifying the best options. To address this issue, Recommender\nSystems (RS) are commonly employed to suggest POIs based on user history, with\nthe integration of contextual information enhancing the quality of\nrecommendations. Notably, incorporating user travel purpose, which is often\noverlooked but holds potential in characterizing travelers' behavior, can lead\nto more tailored recommendations. In this study, we propose a model to predict\nwhether a trip is leisure or work-related, utilizing state-of-the-art Automatic\nText Classification (ATC) models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and BART to enhance the\nunderstanding of user travel purposes and improve recommendation accuracy in\nspecific travel scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yqzh0PF3zfNh8O4Ktb6XcoxfkJz4ZA-THABIiJpXqIE","pdfSize":"363291"}
