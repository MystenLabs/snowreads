For a high-quality graph, both topology\nconnectivity and spatial continuity of centerline segments are critical.\nHowever, most of existing approaches pay more attention to connectivity while\nneglect the continuity. Such kind of centerline graph usually cause problem to\nplanning of autonomous driving. To overcome this problem, we present an\nend-to-end network, CGNet, with three key modules: 1)Junction Aware Query\nEnhancement module, which provides positional prior to accurately predict\njunction points; 2)B\\'ezier Space Connection module, which enforces continuity\nconstraints on any two topologically connected segments in a B\\'ezier space; 3)\nIterative Topology Refinement module, which is a graph-based network with\nmemory to iteratively refine the predicted topological connectivity. CGNet\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
