For constant coefficients, this follows immediately from\nformulas of Harer-Zagier and Harder. Our proof is different and in the case of\nabelian varieties uses log Dubson-Kashiwara plus the fact that Hodge bundles\nare nef. For curves, we require an additional inequality established using\nBeilinson's gluing construction. The first main result is shown to be false in\npositive characteristic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
