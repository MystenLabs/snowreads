Current systems for cooperative adaptive cruise\ncontrol and lane changing are inadequate in responding to real-world emergency\nsituations, limiting the potential of autonomous vehicle platooning technology.\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Twin-World\nSafety-Enhanced Data-Model-Knowledge Hybrid-Driven autonomous vehicle\nplatooning Cooperative Control Framework. Within this framework, a deep\nreinforcement learning formation decision model integrating traffic priors is\ndesigned, and a twin-world deduction model based on safety priority judgment is\nproposed. Subsequently, an optimal control-based multi-scenario\ndecision-control right adaptive switching mechanism is designed to achieve\nadaptive switching between data-driven and model-driven methods. Through\nsimulation experiments and hardware-in-loop tests, our algorithm has\ndemonstrated excellent performance in terms of safety, robustness, and\nflexibility. A detailed account of the validation results for the model can be\nfound in \\url{https://perfectxu88.github.io/towardssafeandrobust.github.io/}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
