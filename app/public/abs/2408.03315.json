We numerically simulated\nvarious \"conveyor-belt\" shuttling scenarios for simple Si/SiO2 devices,\nexplicitly modelling the electron's wave function using grid-based\nsplit-operator methods and a time-dependent 2D potential (obtained from a\nPoisson solver). This allowed us to fully characterise the electron loss\nprobability and excitation fraction. Remarkably, with as few as three\nindependent electrodes the process can remain near-perfectly adiabatic even in\nthe presence of pulse imperfection, nearby charge defects, and Johnson-Nyquist\nnoise. Only a substantial density of charge defects, or defects at\n'adversarial' locations, can catastrophically disrupt the charge shuttling.\nWhile we do not explicitly model the spin or valley degrees of freedom, our\nresults from this charge propagation study support the conclusion that\nconveyor-belt shuttling is an excellent candidate for providing connectivity in\nsemiconductor quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
