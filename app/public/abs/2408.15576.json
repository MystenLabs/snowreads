Here we introduce a generalized loss model for assemblage tomography\nthat uses conical optimization techniques combined with maximum likelihood\nestimation. Using an evidence-based framework based on Akaike's Information\nCriterion, we demonstrate that our approach excels in the accuracy of\nreconstructions while accounting for model complexity. In comparison, standard\ntomographic methods fall short when applied to experimentally relevant data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
