While previous works have focused on ensuring grasp stability,\nthey often do not consider human intention conveyed through natural language,\nhindering effective collaboration between robots and users in complex 3D\nenvironments. In this paper, we present a new approach for language-driven\n6-DoF grasp detection in cluttered point clouds. We first introduce\nGrasp-Anything-6D, a large-scale dataset for the language-driven 6-DoF grasp\ndetection task with 1M point cloud scenes and more than 200M\nlanguage-associated 3D grasp poses. We further introduce a novel diffusion\nmodel that incorporates a new negative prompt guidance learning strategy. The\nproposed negative prompt strategy directs the detection process toward the\ndesired object while steering away from unwanted ones given the language input.\nOur method enables an end-to-end framework where humans can command the robot\nto grasp desired objects in a cluttered scene using natural language. Intensive\nexperimental results show the effectiveness of our method in both benchmarking\nexperiments and real-world scenarios, surpassing other baselines. In addition,\nwe demonstrate the practicality of our approach in real-world robotic\napplications.
