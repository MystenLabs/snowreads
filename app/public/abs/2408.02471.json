We also prove the linear asymptotic\nexponential stability of the steady state making constructive a recent estimate\nof Xu'an Dou et al. (2023). Both results are based in a fundamental way on some\nultracontractivity property of theflow associated to the linear (possibly time\ndependent) Voltage-Conductance kinetic equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
