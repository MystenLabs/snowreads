It is applied to the symmetric Cayley\ngraphs of some Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding\nslightly tighter lower bounds of the diameters than those for random\n$k$-regular graphs proposed by Bollob\\'{a}s and de la Vega. They range from 60%\nto 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
