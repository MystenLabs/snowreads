However, it is challenging to apply them to practical\nsituations, especially when using the trained propagation-based models to\ndetect news with no propagation data. Towards this scenario, we study a new\ntask named cold-start fake news detection, which aims to detect content-only\nsamples with missing propagation. To achieve the task, we design a simple but\neffective Structure Adversarial Net (SAN) framework to learn transferable\nfeatures from available propagation to boost the detection of content-only\nsamples. SAN introduces a structure discriminator to estimate dissimilarities\namong learned features with and without propagation, and further learns\nstructure-invariant features to enhance the generalization of existing\npropagation-based methods for content-only samples. We conduct qualitative and\nquantitative experiments on three datasets. Results show the challenge of the\nnew task and the effectiveness of our SAN framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
