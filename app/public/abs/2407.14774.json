It can make the text more attractive and better\nconvey its expression, thus enjoying a wide range of application scenarios such\nas social media display, consumer electronics, fashion, and graphic design.\nArtistic text generation includes artistic text stylization and semantic\ntypography. Artistic text stylization concentrates on the text effect overlaid\nupon the text, such as shadows, outlines, colors, glows, and textures. By\ncomparison, semantic typography focuses on the deformation of the characters to\nstrengthen their visual representation by mimicking the semantic understanding\nwithin the text. This overview paper provides an introduction to both artistic\ntext stylization and semantic typography, including the taxonomy, the key ideas\nof representative methods, and the applications in static and dynamic artistic\ntext generation. Furthermore, the dataset and evaluation metrics are\nintroduced, and the future directions of artistic text generation are\ndiscussed.
