This is particularly true in a Vehicular Adhoc Network\n(VANET) where vehicles frequently download and upload High-definition (HD) map\ndata which requires constant updates. This implies that latency and throughput\nrequirements must be guaranteed by the wireless system. To achieve this,\nadjustable contention windows (CW) allocation strategies in the standard\nIEEE802.11p have been explored by numerous researchers. Nevertheless, their\nimplementations demand alterations to the existing standard which is not always\ndesirable. To address this issue, we proposed a Q-Learning algorithm that\noperates at the application layer. Moreover, it could be deployed in any\nwireless network thereby mitigating the compatibility issues. The solution has\ndemonstrated a better network performance with relatively fewer optimization\nrequirements as compared to the Deep Q Network (DQN) and Actor-Critic\nalgorithms. The same is observed while evaluating the model in a multi-agent\nsetup showing higher performance compared to the single-agent setup.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
