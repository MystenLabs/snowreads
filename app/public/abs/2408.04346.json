First, we show\nSudakov-type concentration results and local semicircular laws for weighted\nrandom matrices. A further branch addresses higher order concentration (i.\\,e.,\nconcentration for non-Lipschitz functions which have bounded derivatives of\nhigher order) for $\\ell_p^n$-spheres. This is based on a type of generalized\nlog-Sobolev inqualities referred to as $\\mathrm{LS}_q$-inequalities. More\ngenerally, we prove higher order concentration bounds for probability measures\non $\\mathbb{R}^n$ which satisfy an $\\mathrm{LS}_q$-inequality. Finally, we\nderive concentration bounds for sequences of smooth symmetric functions on the\nEuclidean sphere which are closely related to Edgeworth-type expansions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T4yY-QODtRpS0kE7S7fxns2PLDoccvHL4KrwTbQ96HY","pdfSize":"492510"}
