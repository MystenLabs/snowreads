This strengthens Zhou's fixed point theorem. For chain-complete posets\nthat are not necessarily lattices, we generalize the Abian-Brown and the\nMarkowsky fixed point theorems from single-valued maps to multivalued\ncorrespondences. We provide an application in game theory.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
