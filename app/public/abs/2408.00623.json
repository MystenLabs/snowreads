Although, in principle, their detection mechanism offers broadband\noperation, their wavelength range has to be optimized by the optical cavity\nparameters for a specific task. We present a study of the optical absorption of\na superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) with an optical\ncavity. The optical properties of the niobium nitride films, measured by\nspectroscopic ellipsometry, were modelled using the Drude-Lorentz model with\nquantum corrections. The numerical simulations of the optical response of the\ndetectors show that the wavelength range of the detector is not solely\ndetermined by its geometry, but the optical conductivity of the disordered thin\nmetallic films contributes considerably. This contribution can be conveniently\nexpressed by the ratio of imaginary and real parts of the optical conductivity.\nThis knowledge can be utilized in detector design.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FgUdkEoS0185CU_SgT4qaltKSkbV3KscLf_rs6v0XX8","pdfSize":"569064","txDigest":"7Gbrssj2Ttwab7mut68CSFX2xRBRiZ8C4UoLRNgaPyi1","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
