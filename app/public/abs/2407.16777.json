The\ndataset comprises 21 videos of BLV individuals navigating outdoor spaces, and a\ntaxonomy of 90 objects crucial for BLV navigation, refined through a focus\ngroup study. We also provide object labeling for the 90 objects across 31 video\nsegments created from the 21 videos. A deeper analysis reveals that most\ncontemporary datasets used in training computer vision models contain only a\nsmall subset of the taxonomy in our dataset. Preliminary evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art computer vision models on our dataset highlights shortcomings\nin accurately detecting key objects relevant to BLV navigation, emphasizing the\nneed for specialized datasets. We make our dataset publicly available, offering\nvaluable resources for developing more inclusive navigation systems for BLV\nindividuals.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
