Existing methods to identify such attacks often rely on thematic\nsimilarities or network-based approaches, overlooking the intricate causal\nrelationships that underlie coordinated actions. This work introduces a novel\napproach for detecting coordinated attacks using Convergent Cross Mapping\n(CCM), a technique that infers causality from temporal relationships between\nuser activity. We build on the theoretical framework of CCM by incorporating\ntopic modelling as a basis for further optimizing its performance. We apply CCM\nto real-world data from the infamous IRA attack on US elections, achieving F1\nscores up to 75.3% in identifying coordinated accounts. Furthermore, we analyse\nthe output of our model to identify the most influential users in a community.\nWe apply our model to a case study involving COVID-19 anti-vax related\ndiscussions on Twitter. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model\nin uncovering causal structures of coordinated behaviour, offering a promising\navenue for mitigating the threat of malicious campaigns on social media\nplatforms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
