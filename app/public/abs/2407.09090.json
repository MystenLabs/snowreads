This provides\nnovel characterizations of $\\omega$-Corson and $NY$ compact spaces. We give an\nexample of a uniform Eberlein compact space that does not embed into a product\nof compact metric spaces in such a way that the $\\sigma$-product is dense in\nthe image. In particular, this answers a question of Kubi\\'s and Leiderman. We\nalso show that for a compact space $K$ the property of being $NY$ compact is\ndetermined by the topological structure of the space $C_p(K)$ of continuous\nreal-valued functions of $K$ equipped with the pointwise convergence topology.\nThis refines a recent result of Zakrzewski.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
