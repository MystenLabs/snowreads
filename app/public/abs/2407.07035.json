The\nremarkable achievements of foundation models have shaped the challenges and\nproposed methods for VLN research. In this survey, we provide a top-down review\nthat adopts a principled framework for embodied planning and reasoning, and\nemphasizes the current methods and future opportunities leveraging foundation\nmodels to address VLN challenges. We hope our in-depth discussions could\nprovide valuable resources and insights: on one hand, to milestone the progress\nand explore opportunities and potential roles for foundation models in this\nfield, and on the other, to organize different challenges and solutions in VLN\nto foundation model researchers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
