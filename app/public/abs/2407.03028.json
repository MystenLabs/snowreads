As the synthesis of such structures remains\nchallenging, diatom frustules offer a promissing alternative to conventional\nporous particles in micro-/nano-engineering. In particular, for applications in\ndrag deliverly systems, biosensors, and filters, an understanding of particle\nmotion inside diatoms is of great impotance. In this study, we investigated\nnanoparticle (NP) motions inside diatom frustules using the single particle\ntracking (SPT) method. For these measruements, the diameter of the NP was about\none-tenth smaller than that of the frustule. Inside the frustule, the diffusion\nmotions of the NPs were suppressed, but this suppression was weakened near the\nexit of the frustule. Moreover, diffusion anisotropy between the axial and\nradial directions of the frustule was observed. This anisotropy is difficult to\ndetect with ensemble methods; thus, the SPT method is a powerful approach for\ninvestigating NP motions in frustules.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
