Existing research\nmainly explores the unreliability of RAG in white-box and closed-domain QA\ntasks. In this paper, we aim to reveal the vulnerabilities of\nRetrieval-Enhanced Generative (RAG) models when faced with black-box attacks\nfor opinion manipulation. We explore the impact of such attacks on user\ncognition and decision-making, providing new insight to enhance the reliability\nand security of RAG models. We manipulate the ranking results of the retrieval\nmodel in RAG with instruction and use these results as data to train a\nsurrogate model. By employing adversarial retrieval attack methods to the\nsurrogate model, black-box transfer attacks on RAG are further realized.\nExperiments conducted on opinion datasets across multiple topics show that the\nproposed attack strategy can significantly alter the opinion polarity of the\ncontent generated by RAG. This demonstrates the model's vulnerability and, more\nimportantly, reveals the potential negative impact on user cognition and\ndecision-making, making it easier to mislead users into accepting incorrect or\nbiased information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
