While the standard\nabelian QFT is well-studied, important variants corresponding to\n\\emph{nonabelian} groups of interest have seen less development. In particular,\nfast nonabelian Fourier transformations are important components for both\nquantum simulations of field theories as well as approaches to the nonabelian\nhidden subgroup problem. In this work, we present fast quantum Fourier\ntransformations for a number of nonabelian groups of interest for high energy\nphysics, $\\mathbb{BT}$, $\\mathbb{BO}$, $\\Delta(27)$, $\\Delta(54)$, and\n$\\Sigma(36\\times3)$. For each group, we derive explicit quantum circuits and\nestimate resource scaling for fault-tolerant implementations. Our work shows\nthat the development of a fast Fourier transformation can substantively reduce\nsimulation costs by up to three orders of magnitude for the finite groups that\nwe have investigated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
