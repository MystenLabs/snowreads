This\nframework can be used to perturbatively calculate in a quantum field theory\nwith both kinds of charge. Here we re-examine the running of the magnetic\ncharge, where the calculations of Schwinger and Coleman sharply disagree. We\ncalculate the running of both electric and magnetic couplings and show that the\ndisagreement between Schwinger and Coleman is due to an incomplete summation of\ntopological terms in the perturbation series. We present a momentum space\nprescription for calculating the loop corrections in which the topological\nterms can be systematically separated for resummation. Somewhat in the spirit\nof modern amplitude methods we avoid using a vector potential and use the field\nstrength itself, thereby trading gauge redundancy for the geometric redundancy\nof Stokes surfaces. The resulting running of the couplings demonstrates that\nDirac charge quantization is independent of renormalization scale, as Coleman\npredicted. As a simple application we also bound the parameter space of\nmagnetically charged states through the experimental measurement of the running\nof electromagnetic coupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
