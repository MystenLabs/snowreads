However, given the complex nature of the source and hence\nthe data represented by light curves, processing could be time-consuming. In\nsome cases, accuracy is not good enough for further analysis. In an attempt to\nupgrade QNPy, we examine the effect of the prepossessing quasar light curves\nvia the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm on modeling a large number of\nquasar light curves. After applying SOM on SWIFT/BAT data and modeling curves\nfrom several clusters, results show the Conditional Neural Process performs\nbetter after SOM classification. We conclude that SOM classification of quasar\nlight curves could be a beneficial prepossessing method for QNPy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
