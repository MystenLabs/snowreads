In order to address this problem, in this work, we evaluate\nfour neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks and\ntransformers, in different sizes, in the task of fish larvae counting. For the\nevaluation, we present a new annotated image dataset with less data collection\nrequirements than preceding works, with images of spotted sorubim and dourado\nlarvae. By using image tiling techniques, we achieve a MAPE of 4.46% ($\\pm\n4.70$) with an extra large real time detection transformer, and 4.71% ($\\pm\n4.98$) with a medium-sized YOLOv8.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
