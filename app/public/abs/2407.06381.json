The search of conditional symmetries of this system\nleads to a system of five coupled Burgers-like equations. Iterating the\nprocedure, an infinite hierarchy of systems made of an odd number of coupled\nBurgers-like equations is obtained. Moreover, starting from a pair of\nBurgers-like equations, a similar hierarchy of systems made of an even number\nof coupled Burgers-like equations arises; it is also proved that the two\nhierarchies may be unified. Writing a generic element of this hierarchy as a\nmatrix Burgers' equation, the existence of the matrix Hopf-Cole transformation\nallows for its linearization and the determination of its solution. Finally, it\nis shown that each element of the hierarchy possesses a five-dimensional Lie\nalgebra of classical point symmetries. Though these Lie algebras are realized\nin manifolds with different dimensionality, they are all isomorphic.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
