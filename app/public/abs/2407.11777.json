Nishiguchi,\nElectron.\\ J. Qual.\\ Theory Differ.\\ Equ.\\ \\textbf{2023}, No.~32, 1--77] for\nthe purpose of defining fundamental matrix solutions and obtaining a variation\nof constants formula for the RFDEs. This notion gives a straightforward\ndefinition of solutions to the RFDEs under discontinuous history functions\ncompared with previous studies in the literature. For a given autonomous linear\nRFDE, it holds that the fundamental matrix solutions are locally Lipschitz\ncontinuous on the interval $[0, \\infty)$. However, it is not apparent whether a\nsimilar property is true for the mild solutions. Here we obtain a result which\nshows the regularity of mild solutions on $[0, \\infty)$ for autonomous linear\nRFDEs. The result makes clear a connection between the mild solutions and\nsolution concepts in previous studies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
