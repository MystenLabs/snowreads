Their main value is the ability to compute gradients of physical\nprocesses, which allows differentiable simulators to be readily integrated into\ncommonly employed gradient-based optimization schemes. To achieve this, a\nnumber of design decisions need to be considered representing trade-offs in\nversatility, computational speed, and accuracy of the gradients obtained. This\npaper presents an in-depth review of the evolving landscape of differentiable\nphysics simulators. We introduce the foundations and core components of\ndifferentiable simulators alongside common design choices. This is followed by\na practical guide and overview of open-source differentiable simulators that\nhave been used across past research. Finally, we review and contextualize\nprominent applications of differentiable simulation. By offering a\ncomprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in differentiable\nsimulation, this work aims to serve as a resource for researchers and\npractitioners looking to understand and integrate differentiable physics within\ntheir research. We conclude by highlighting current limitations as well as\nproviding insights into future directions for the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
