These frameworks are still usually\ninsufficient to solve complicated logical problems, such as Zebra puzzles, due\nto the inherent complexity of translating natural language clues into logical\nstatements. We introduce a multi-agent system, ZPS, that integrates LLMs with\nan off the shelf theorem prover. This system tackles the complex puzzle-solving\ntask by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, generating\nSMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) code to solve them with a theorem prover,\nand using feedback between the agents to repeatedly improve their answers. We\nalso introduce an automated grid puzzle grader to assess the correctness of our\npuzzle solutions and show that the automated grader is reliable by evaluating\nit in a user-study. Our approach shows improvement in all three LLMs we tested,\nwith GPT-4 showing 166% improvement in the number of fully correct solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
