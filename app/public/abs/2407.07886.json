The primary objectives of\nthis study are to investigate the existence of a mild solution and approximate\ncontrollability of both linear and semilinear control systems in Banach spaces.\nTo accomplish this, we begin by introducing the concept of a resolvent family\nassociated with the homogeneous neutral integro-differential equation without\nmemory. In the process, we establish some important properties of the resolvent\nfamily. Subsequently, we develop approximate controllability results for a\nlinear control problem by constructing a linear-quadratic regulator problem.\nThis involves establishing the existence of an optimal pair and determining the\nexpression of the optimal control that produces the approximate controllability\nof the linear system. Furthermore, we deduce sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of a mild solution and approximate controllability of a semilinear\nsystem in a reflexive Banach space with a uniformly convex dual. Additionally,\nwe delve into the discussion of approximate controllability for a semilinear\nproblem in general Banach space, assuming a Lipschitz type condition on the\nnonlinear term. Finally, we implement our findings to examine the approximate\ncontrollability of certain partial differential equations, demonstrating their\npractical relevance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
