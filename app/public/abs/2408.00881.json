SaludConectaMX is unique in that it integrates\npatient clinical indicators with social determinants and caregiver mental\nhealth, forming a social-clinical perspective of the patient's evolving health\ntrajectory. The system is composed of a web application (for hospital staff)\nand a mobile application (for family caregivers), providing the opportunity for\ncooperative patient monitoring in both hospital and home settings. This paper\npresents the system's preliminary design and usability evaluation results from\na 1.5-year pilot study. Our findings indicate that while the hospital web app\ndemonstrates high completion rates and user satisfaction, the family mobile app\nrequires additional improvements for optimal accessibility; statistical and\nqualitative data analysis illuminate pathways for system improvement. Based on\nthis evidence, we formalize suggestions for health system development in LMICs,\nwhich HCI researchers may leverage in future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5TMcQjM2T0TWWn02qNnO0eduOGJBAVURVQhn5PW-a7c","pdfSize":"1403211"}
