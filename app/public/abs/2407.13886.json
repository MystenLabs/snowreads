Their synthesis through topotactic oxygen\nreduction from the parent perovskite phase remains a complex and elusive\nprocess. This study delves into the nano-scale effects of the topotactic\nlattice transformation within LaNiO$_2$ crystals. Leveraging high-resolution\nscanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy, our investigations\nuncover a panorama of structural alterations, including grain boundaries and\ncoherent twin boundaries, triggered by reduction-induced transformations. In\naddition, our analyses unveil the formation of an oxygen-rich disordered\ntransition phase encircling impurities and pervading crystalline domains, and\nthe internal strain is accommodated by grain boundary formation. By unraveling\nthese nano-scale effects, our findings provide insights into the microscopic\nintricacies of the topotactic reduction process elucidating the transition from\nthe perovskite to the infinite-layer phase within nickelate bulk crystals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZAq8jKOQl53OlbFOTMOoWbc93Uw3yI6EchP6EyfH-Xs","pdfSize":"12368588"}
