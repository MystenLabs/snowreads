In this paper, for color image processing problems, we\nintroduce a concept of the non-negative RB matrix and then use the\nmultiplication properties of RB to propose a non-negative RB matrix\nfactorization (NRBMF) model. The NRBMF model is introduced to address the\nchallenge of reasonably establishing a non-negative quaternion matrix\nfactorization model, which is primarily hindered by the multiplication\nproperties of traditional quaternions. Furthermore, this paper transforms the\nproblem of solving the NRBMF model into an RB alternating non-negative least\nsquares (RB-ANNLS) problem. Then, by introducing a method to compute the\ngradient of the real function with RB matrix variables, we solve the RB-ANNLS\noptimization problem using the RB projected gradient algorithm and conduct a\nconvergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, we validate the effectiveness\nand superiority of the proposed NRBMF model in color face recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
