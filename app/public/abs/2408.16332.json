In fact, we consider a relaxation\nterm involving the second time derivative of the chemical potential in the\nfirst equation of the system. We develop a well-posedness, continuous\ndependence and regularity theory for the initial-boundary value problem.\nMoreover, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the system as the\nrelaxation parameter tends to 0 and prove the convergence to the viscous\nCahn--Hilliard system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
