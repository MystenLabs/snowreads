While previous research has primarily focused on qualitative analysis\nover minimal models; our study concentrates on the quantitative aspect,\nspecifically counting of minimal models. Exact counting of minimal models is\nstrictly harder than #P, prompting our investigation into establishing a lower\nbound for their quantity, which is often useful in related applications. In\nthis paper, we introduce two novel techniques for counting minimal models,\nleveraging the expressive power of answer set programming: the first technique\nemploys methods from knowledge compilation, while the second one draws on\nrecent advancements in hashing-based approximate model counting. Through\nempirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our methods significantly improve\nthe lower bound estimates of the number of minimal models, surpassing the\nperformance of existing minimal model reasoning systems in terms of runtime.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
