This work reports the influence of Cu ions for\nthe transformation of analog to digital resistive switching in ITO/NiO/Ag\nmemristor devices. The undoped and low-concentration Cu doping illustrates the\nanalog switching, whereas higher doping demonstrates the digital\ncharacteristics. At higher bias voltage, the Schottky barrier is developed at\nboth ITO/NiO and NiO/Ag interfaces. The increasing and decreasing of current\nconduction with the escalating number of cycles for both the polarity in\nundoped and low doped is elucidated by the electrode-dominated mechanism in\nterms of reduction and enhancement of Schottky barrier height at the interface,\nrespectively. The digital switching characteristic due to the formation and\nrupturing of the vacancy filament at higher doped sample is induced due to the\nboosting of vacancies above the critical amount using ion implantation. The\nsynergic effect of current conduction due to local Cu migration and oxygen\nvacancies can be utilized as a learning and forgetting process for neuromorphic\napplications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x7LXRj4OP7-1E-xDz4cmRftQPANR6TNrtTnX17pLiHw","pdfSize":"4582056","objectId":"0x617be28b0f96fe1084537d576ba301c9856aba8860bd1ec3a182a9b2b800193d","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
