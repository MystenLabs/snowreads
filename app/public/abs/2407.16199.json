The Central Sets Theorem due to\nFurstenberg is a strong simultaneous extension of both theorems, which also\napplies to general commutative semigroups. Beiglboeck provided a common\nextension of the Central Sets Theorem and Milliken-Taylor Theorem in\ncommutative case. Furstenberg's original Central Sets Theorem was proved in\n\\cite{key-2} for $\\left(\\mathbb{N},+\\right)$ for finitely many sequences at a\ntime. Bergelson and Hindman provided a non commutative version of this Theorem\n\\cite{key-3}. The first author of this article jointly with Hindman and Straus\nprovided a non-commutative version of Central Sets Theorem using arbitrary many\nsequence at a time \\cite{key-5}. In this work we will provide a non-commutative\nextension of Beiglboeck's Theorem. We also provide polynomial generalization of\nBeiglbock's theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KYJqp7DM9IQQ9xjDpwb-JPOpftyeRwTj1QoQmZSSe3Q","pdfSize":"182348"}
