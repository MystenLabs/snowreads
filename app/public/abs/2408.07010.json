Given a graph $G$ and a set $E\\subseteq\n\\mathbb{F}_q^2$, let $\\Delta_G(E)$ be the generalized distance set\ncorresponding to $G$. In the case when $G$ is the complete graph on $k+1$\nvertices, Bennett, Hart, Iosevich, Pakianathan, and Rudnev showed that when\n$|E|\\geq q^{d-\\frac{d-1}{k+1}}$, it follows that $|\\Delta_G(E)|\\geq\ncq^{\\binom{k+1}{2}}$. In the case when $k=d=2$, the threshold can be improved\nto $|E|\\geq q^{\\frac{8}{5}}$.\n  Moreover, Jardine, Iosevich, and McDonald showed that in the case when $G$ is\na tree with $k+1$ vertices, then whenever $E\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_q^d$, $d\\geq\n2$ satisfies $|E|\\geq C_kq^{\\frac{d+1}{2}}$, it follows that\n$\\Delta_G(E)=\\mathbb{F}_q^k$. In this paper, we present a technique which\nenables us to study certain graphs with both rigid and non-rigid components. In\nparticular, we show that for $E\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_q^2$, $q=p^n$, $n$ odd,\n$p\\equiv 3 \\ \\text{mod} \\ 4$, and $G$ is the graph consisting of two triangles\njoined at a vertex, then whenever $|E|\\geq q^{\\frac{12}{7}}$, it follows that\n$|\\Delta_G(E)|\\geq cq^6$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
