This technique, utilizing support vector machine (SVM) statistics,\nprovides a more nuanced prediction than the previous two-component Gaussian\nmixture in duration of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Based on further\ncovariance testing from \\textit{Fermi}-GBM, \\textit{Swift}-BAT, and\n\\textit{Swift}-XRT data, we find that our classification based only on prompt\nemission properties gives perspective on the recent evidence that mergers and\ncollapsars exist in both long and short GRB populations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"36-hkwHDmxonaO_Xffl4cVkUkKGF3lq5WT_c4K7pDM4","pdfSize":"955080"}
