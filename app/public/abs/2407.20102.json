Given a subspace\n$\\mathbb{{Y}}$ of $\\ell_1^n$, we completely identify the elements $x$ in\n$\\ell_1^n,$ for which best coapproximations to $x$ out of $\\mathbb{{Y}}$ exist.\nThe methods developed in this article are computationally effective and it\nallows us to present an algorithmic approach to the concerned problem. We also\nidentify the coproximinal subspaces and co-Chebyshev subspaces of $\\ell_1^n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
