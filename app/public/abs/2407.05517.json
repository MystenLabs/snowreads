However,\nthese techniques rely on accurate estimates of the channel state information at\nthe transmitter (CSIT), which is not possible to obtain in practical systems.\nAs a result, precoders cannot handle interference as expected and the residual\ninterference substantially degrades the performance of the system. To address\nthis problem, CF systems require precoders that are robust to CSIT\nimperfections. In this paper, we propose novel robust precoding techniques to\nmitigate the effects of residual multiuser interference. To this end, we\ninclude a loading term that minimizes the effects of the imperfect CSIT in the\noptimization objective. We further derive robust precoders that employ clusters\nof users and access points to reduce the computational cost and the signaling\nload. Numerical experiments show that the proposed robust minimum mean-square\nerror (MMSE) precoding techniques outperform the conventional MMSE precoder for\nvarious accuracy levels of CSIT estimates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
