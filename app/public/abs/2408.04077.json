This unit redefines the\ntraditional convolutional layer by implementing a pair of complementary\nfilters: a trainable push kernel and its counterpart, the pull kernel. The push\nkernel (analogous to traditional convolution) learns to respond to specific\nstimuli, while the pull kernel reacts to the same stimuli but of opposite\ncontrast. This configuration enhances stimulus selectivity and effectively\ninhibits response in regions lacking preferred stimuli. This effect is\nattributed to the push and pull kernels, which produce responses of comparable\nmagnitude in such regions, thereby neutralizing each other. The incorporation\nof the PushPull-Conv into ResNets significantly increases their robustness to\nimage corruption. Our experiments with benchmark corruption datasets show that\nthe PushPull-Conv can be combined with other data augmentation techniques to\nfurther improve model robustness. We set a new robustness benchmark on ResNet50\nachieving an $mCE$ of 49.95$\\%$ on ImageNet-C when combining PRIME augmentation\nwith PushPull inhibition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
