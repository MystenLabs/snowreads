For weak\nattraction between impurities and fermions, where only the manifold of lowest\nLandau levels is relevant, we obtain an analytical expression of mediated\npolaron-polaorn interactions. Remarkably, polaron interactions are exactly zero\nwhen fermions in lowest Landau levels outnumber heavy impurities. For strong\nattraction, different manifolds of higher Landau levels come into play and we\nderive a set of equations that can be used to numerically solve the mediated\npolaron interaction potential. We find that the potential vanishes when the\ndistance R between impurities is larger than the magnetic length, but strongly\ndiverges at short range following a Coulomb form -1/R. Our exact results of\npolaron-polaron interactions might be examined in cold-atom setups, where a\nsystem of Fermi polarons in the quantum Hall regime is realized with synthetic\ngauge field or under fast rotation. Our predictions could also be useful to\nunderstand the effective interaction between exciton-polarons in electron-doped\nsemiconductors under strong magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hiEWwR6F16auMWnmw2q9XXjr2YYuVV-EgeGz_tRquTU","pdfSize":"435911"}
