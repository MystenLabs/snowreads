The study of obstacle courses provides invaluable\ninsights into the challenges legged robots face, offering a controlled\nenvironment to assess and enhance their capabilities. Traversing it with a\none-legged hopper introduces intricate challenges, such as planning over\ncontacts and dealing with flight phases, which necessitates a sophisticated\ncontroller. A novel model predictive parkour controller is introduced, that\nfinds an optimal path through a real-time changing obstacle course with mixed\ninteger motion planning. The execution of this optimized path is then achieved\nthrough a state machine employing a PD control scheme with feedforward torques,\nensuring robust and accurate performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
