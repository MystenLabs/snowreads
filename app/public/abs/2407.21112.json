A comb is\ncomposed of a backbone that is a self-avoiding walk and a set of $t$ teeth,\nalso modelled as mutually and self-avoiding walks, attached to the backbone at\nvertices or nodes of degree 3. Each tooth of the comb has $m_a$ edges and there\nare $m_b$ edges in the backbone between adjacent degree 3 vertices and between\nthe first and last nodes of degree 3 and the end vertices of degree 1 of the\nbackbone. We are interested in the exponential growth rate as $t \\to \\infty$\nwith $m_a$ and $m_b$ fixed. We prove upper bounds on this growth rate and show\nthat for small values of $m_a$ the growth rate is strictly less than that of\nself-avoiding walks.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
