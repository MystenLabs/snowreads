Such a scenario may explain why insignificant\nperturbations can generate large disruptions, through the propagation of\n``avalanches'' across the system. In this short review, we discuss how SOC\ncould offer a plausible solution to the excess volatility puzzle in financial\nmarkets and the analogue ``small shocks, large business cycle puzzle'' for the\neconomy at large, as initially surmised by Per Bak et al. in 1993. We argue\nthat in general the quest for efficiency and the necessity of *resilience* may\nbe mutually incompatible and require specific policy considerations.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
