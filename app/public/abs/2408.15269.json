Moreover, this\nperturbation can be made arbitrarily L^2-small with respect to the Taub-Bolt\nmetric. The method of proof closely follows the strategy adopted in [14], where\nthe author constructs, via a Wa\\.zewski box argument, Ricci flows on compact\nmanifolds which encounter finite singularities modelled on a given\nasymptotically conical shrinking soliton.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
