In\nthe non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to\nsaturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians\nwhose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground\nstates. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on\ncapturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus\nform the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped\ntwo-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one\ndimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of\nthese PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal\ncharacteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionc and\ninteracting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich\nplatform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological\ninvariant, providing a platform for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and\nquantum information pursuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
