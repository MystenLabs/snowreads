Despite demonstrated\nsuccess, such networks suffer from some fundamental problems: 1) It contains\npooling operation to cope with inherently disordered point clouds, hindering\nthe capture of 3D spatial information that is useful for tracking, a regression\ntask. 2) The adopted set abstraction operation hardly handles\ndensity-inconsistent point clouds, also preventing 3D spatial information from\nbeing modeled. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel tracking\nframework, termed VoxelTrack. By voxelizing inherently disordered point clouds\ninto 3D voxels and extracting their features via sparse convolution blocks,\nVoxelTrack effectively models precise and robust 3D spatial information,\nthereby guiding accurate position prediction for tracked objects. Moreover,\nVoxelTrack incorporates a dual-stream encoder with cross-iterative feature\nfusion module to further explore fine-grained 3D spatial information for\ntracking. Benefiting from accurate 3D spatial information being modeled, our\nVoxelTrack simplifies tracking pipeline with a single regression loss.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three widely-adopted datasets including\nKITTI, NuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset. The experimental results confirm that\nVoxelTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance (88.3%, 71.4% and 63.6% mean\nprecision on the three datasets, respectively), and outperforms the existing\ntrackers with a real-time speed of 36 Fps on a single TITAN RTX GPU. The source\ncode and model will be released.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mDaHDM4p-NO-ETR2xhnIE9eWwYiqghuAQ4w0qdXM_c4","pdfSize":"1554791"}
