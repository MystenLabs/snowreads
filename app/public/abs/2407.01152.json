We also\ndescribe the invariants of its Sylow subgroup in the defining characteristic.\nIn both cases we construct minimal algebra generating sets and describe the\nrelations among the generators. Both rings of invariants are shown to be\nComplete Intersections and thus are Cohen-Macaulay. We expect the techniques we\nuse will generalise to give a systematic computation for rings of invariants\nfor all of the finite classical groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
