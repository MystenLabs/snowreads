The first approach\ncorresponds to the brute force method based on combinatorics. It generates all\npossible complete preference orderings compatible with the partial preference\norderings and calculates the Frobenius distance between all fully compatible\npreference orderings. Unfortunately, this first method is not very efficient in\nsolving high-dimensional problems because of its big combinatorial complexity.\nThat is why we propose to circumvent this problem by using a second approach\nbased on belief functions, which can adequately model the missing information\nof partial preference orderings. This second approach to the calculation of\ndistance does not suffer from combinatorial complexity limitation. We show\nthrough simple examples how these two theoretical methods work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
