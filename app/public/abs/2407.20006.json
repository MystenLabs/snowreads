As there is no clear model for the\nsource in these searches, one needs to understand and reconstruct the system\nthat produced the gravitational waves. Here we aim to reconstruct the source\nmotion and masses of a system based only on its gravitational wave strain. We\ntrain a normalising flow on two models including circular orbits and random\nunphysical motion of two point masses. These models are used as a toy problem\nto illustrate the technique. We then reconstruct a distribution of possible\nmotions of masses that can produce the given gravitational wave signal. We\ndemonstrate the ability to reconstruct the full distribution of possible mass\nmotions from strain data across multiple gravitational wave detectors. This\ndistribution encompasses the degenerate motions that are expected to produce\nidentical gravitational wave strains.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
