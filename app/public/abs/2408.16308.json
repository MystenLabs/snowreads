In this paper, we propose AdaMotif, a novel approach that can\ncapture the essential structure patterns of large graphs and effectively reveal\nthe overall structures via adaptive motif designs. Specifically, our approach\ninvolves partitioning a given large graph into multiple subgraphs, then\nclustering similar subgraphs and extracting similar structural information\nwithin each cluster. Subsequently, adaptive motifs representing each cluster\nare generated and utilized to replace the corresponding subgraphs, leading to a\nsimplified visualization. Our approach aims to preserve as much information as\npossible from the subgraphs while simplifying the graph efficiently. Notably,\nour approach successfully visualizes crucial community information within a\nlarge graph. We conduct case studies and a user study using real-world graphs\nto validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate\nthe capability of our approach in simplifying graphs while retaining important\nstructural and community information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3O9li4MUoBKwchhUpyotbZbeo-bvUaeKICO2McPGbFk","pdfSize":"19658608"}
