We demonstrate that these can be reduced by\npartial integration to sums over integrals with exponent $m=0$ which have known\nrepresentations as finite sums over polygamma functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
