However, the scalability and generalization capabilities\nof current approaches are considerably restricted by their reliance on an\nexpensive curated database. To overcome this long-standing scalability\nchallenge, we present a unique approach that leverages readily available\ndatabases for general image aesthetic assessment and image quality assessment.\nSpecifically, we view each database as a distinct image score regression task\nthat exhibits varying degrees of personalization potential. By determining\noptimal combinations of task vectors, known to represent specific traits of\neach database, we successfully create personalized models for individuals. This\napproach of integrating multiple models allows us to harness a substantial\namount of data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in generalizing to previously unseen domains-a challenge previous\napproaches have struggled to achieve-making it highly applicable to real-world\nscenarios. Our novel approach significantly advances the field by offering\nscalable solutions for personalized aesthetic assessment and establishing high\nstandards for future research.\nhttps://yeolj00.github.io/personal-projects/personalized-aesthetics/\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
