We present new Bayesian Distance\nClustering (BDC) models and inference algorithms with improved scalability\nwhile maintaining the predictive accuracy of modern Bayesian non-parametric\nmodels. Unlike traditional methods, BDC models the distance between\nobservations rather than the observations directly, offering a compromise\nbetween the scalability of distance-based methods and the enhanced predictive\npower and probabilistic interpretation of model-based methods. However,\nexisting BDC models still rely on performing inference on the partition model\nto group observations into clusters. The support of this partition model grows\nexponentially with the dataset's size, complicating posterior space exploration\nand leading to many costly likelihood evaluations. Inspired by K-medoids, we\npropose using tessellations in discrete space to simplify inference by focusing\nthe learning task on finding the best tessellation centers, or \"medoids.\"\nAdditionally, we extend our models to effectively handle multi-view data, such\nas data comprised of clusters that evolve across time, enhancing their\napplicability to complex datasets. The real data application in numismatics\ndemonstrates the efficacy of our approach.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
