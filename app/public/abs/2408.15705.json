It designs an appropriate boundary feedback law that\nconsists of a linear combination of a damping mechanism and a delay term. The\nstudy shows that, with time delay feedback and a smallness restriction on the\nsize of the initial data the energy the Hirota-Satsuma system decays\nexponentially by employing the Lyapunov method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
