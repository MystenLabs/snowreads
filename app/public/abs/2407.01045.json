In this paper, we study\n$G_\\eta(x;q)$, a function similar to $G(x;q)$, but including the weighting\nfactor $\\eta\\left(\\frac{p}{x}\\right)$, which has a dampening effect on the\nvalues of $G_\\eta$. Our study is motivated by the disproof of Hooley's\nconjecture by Fiorilli and Martin in the range $q \\asymp \\log \\log x$. Even\nthough this weighting factor dampens the values, we still prove that an\nestimation of the form $G_\\eta(x;q) \\ll x\\log q$ is false in the same range.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
