However, their performance under\ndomain shift is yet underexplored. This paper investigates the zero-shot domain\nadaptation potential of FMs by comparing different backbone architectures and\nintroducing novel domain-aware components that leverage domain related textual\nembeddings. We propose domain adaptive normalization, termed as Domino, which\nexplicitly leverages domain embeddings during fine-tuning, thus making the\nmodel domain aware. Ultimately, Domino enables more robust computer vision\nmodels that can adapt effectively to various unseen domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
