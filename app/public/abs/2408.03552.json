Analysis of\nthe results shows that it is a primordial binary cluster. It is possible that\nthis binary cluster is undergoing two-body relaxation by inspecting the radial\nvelocity anomalies of its member stars. In addition, based on the analysis of\nits metal abundances, we found that the components of this binary cluster may\nhave been formed by the deep fusion of multiple subclusters. Finally, we\ninvestigated the 3D morphology of this binary cluster, simulated the\ntrajectories of its components in the galactic disk, and concluded that its\ncomponents may not merge into a single cluster.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
