We show that if the\ngenus of $S$ is at least $3$, then the Fuchsian locus contains quasi-convex\nsubsets of infinite diameter for the Weil--Petersson metric whose diameter for\nthe path metric of the pressure metric is finite. This is established through\nshowing that biinfinite paths of bending deformations have controlled bounded\nlength. To this end we give a geometric interpretation of Fock--Goncharov\npositivity and show that bending deformations of Fuchsian representations\nstabilize a uniform Finsler quasi-convex disk in the symmetric space\n$\\mathrm{PSL}_d(\\mathbb R)/\\mathrm{PSO}(d)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
