As an application of the explicit description of the standard\ncocycle, we obtain a topological proof of Wolpert's formula for the\nWeil-Petersson symplectic form in terms of the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates\nassociated with the pants decomposition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
