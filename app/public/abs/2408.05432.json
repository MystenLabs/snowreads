As direct search using the Dijkstra's\nalgorithm results in a large search space, a plethora of complex-index-based\napproaches have been proposed to speedup the query processing. However, even\nwith the current state-of-the-art approach, long query processing delays\npersist, along with significant space overhead and prohibitively long indexing\ntime. In this paper, we depart from the complex index designs prevalent in\nexisting literature and propose a simple index named KNN-Index. With KNN-Index,\nwe can answer a kNN query optimally and progressively with small and\nsize-bounded index. To improve the index construction performance, we propose a\nbidirectional construction algorithm which can effectively share the common\ncomputation during the construction. Theoretical analysis and experimental\nresults on real road networks demonstrate the superiority of KNN-Index over the\nstate-of-the-art approach in query processing performance, index size, and\nindex construction efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
