Our results are constructive and\ngive rise to a method for associating the Whitney strata of the projection to\nthe faces of the polytope of the corresponding toric variety. For all examples\nwe produced, our resulting algorithm outperforms known general purpose methods\nin Helmer and Nanda (FoCM, 2022), and Dinh and Jelonek (DCG, 2021) for\ncomputing map-stratifications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
