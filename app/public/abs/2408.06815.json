The energy of the first excited\natomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be\n8.308$\\pm$0.011 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the\n$^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.338$\\pm$0.024 eV [Kraemer et al., Nature\n617, 706 (2023)]. It was found that within the uncertainty range of both atomic\nand nuclear excitation energies, the rate of nuclear excitation by electron\ntransition can vary by more than 20 orders of magnitude. Our results indicate\nthat the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate\nreaches an enormous value of $1.05\\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance\n($\\Delta=0$ meV). Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion\ntrap (EBIT), the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging\nfrom tenths to approximately $6\\times10^{19}$ s$^{-1}$. Thus, EBIT experimental\nstudies could serve as an extremely sensitive tool for the independent\nverification of the excitation energy of the isomeric state in the $^{229}$Th\nnucleus.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
