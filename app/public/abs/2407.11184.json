This generalizes a one-dimensional construction of\nKurasov and Sarnak. To do this, we employ a class of complex algebraic\nvarieties avoiding certain regions in $\\mathbb{C}^n$, which generalize\nhypersurfaces defined by Lee-Yang polynomials. We show that these are Delone\nalmost periodic sets that have at most finite intersection with every discrete\nperiodic set.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n4ENCLRhHFMKEFuN-XKE02HraPAEeY6m52__rf4zOZA","pdfSize":"3818729"}
