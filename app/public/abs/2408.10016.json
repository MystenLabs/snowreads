By\nleveraging advanced machine learning classification techniques, including\nLogistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, the study aims\nto predict minute-level price movements using an extensive set of liquidity\nmetrics derived from the Trade and Quote (TAQ) data. The findings reveal that\nemploying a broad spectrum of liquidity measures yields higher predictive\naccuracy compared to models utilizing a reduced subset of features. Key\nliquidity metrics, such as Liquidity Ratio, Flow Ratio, and Turnover,\nconsistently emerged as significant predictors across all models, with the\nRandom Forest algorithm demonstrating superior accuracy. This study not only\nunderscores the critical role of liquidity in market stability and transaction\ncosts but also highlights the complexities involved in short-interval market\npredictions. The research suggests that a comprehensive set of liquidity\nmeasures is essential for accurate prediction, and proposes future work to\nvalidate these findings across different stock datasets to assess their\ngeneralizability.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
