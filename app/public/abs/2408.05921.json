We discuss various identical and nonidentical\nsystems with fixed and exponential distributed delays and derive relationships\nbetween the coupling delay and collective frequency for a stably synchronized\nstate. For the nonidentical system of coupled oscillators, we consider the\nLorentzian distribution of intrinsic frequencies and exponential distributions\nof coupling time delays in coupled oscillators, and analytically derived the\ncollective frequency-time delay relationship. We found that the collective\nfrequency of the network oscillations is dependent on both coupling strength\nand time delay. In identical cases, the network frequency decreases in most\ncases of positive coupling and increases in a negative coupling with\nincreasing. In non-identical cases with distributed delays, along with the\nmodulations in the network frequency, we discussed time-delay coupling can also\nlead to the appearance of bifurcations and transitions in the system's behavior\nresulting in the emergence of new patterns and the breakdown of existing ones.\nWe discuss the implications of these results in understanding the behaviors of\nthe natural systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
