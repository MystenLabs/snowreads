Although algorithms that can understand and\napply human language are becoming increasingly sophisticated, it is difficult\nto apply them to processes that rely on human emotions and senses in industries\nthat still mainly deal with standardized data. In particular, in processes\nwhere brightness, saturation, and color information are essential, such as\npainting and injection molding, most small and medium-sized companies,\nexcluding large corporations, rely on the tacit knowledge and sensibility of\ncolor mixers, and even customer companies often present non-standardized\nrequirements. . In this paper, we proposed TENN to infer color recipe based on\nunstructured data with emotional natural language, and demonstrated it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
