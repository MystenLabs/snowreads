Understanding the explosion\nmechanism of SNe Ia is crucial for their cosmological calibration and for\nadvancing our knowledge of stellar physics. The estimation of $^{56}$Ni mass\nproduced in these events is key to elucidating their explosion mechanism. This\nstudy compares two methods of $^{56}$Ni mass estimation. We first examine the\nrelationship between peak luminosity and the second maximum in near-infrared\n(NIR) bands using observations of 18 nearby SNe Ia. Based on this relationship,\nwe estimate the Ni mass for a set of nine well-observed SNe Ia using the Arnett\nrule. Additionally, we estimate the $^{56}$Ni mass using bolometric light\ncurves of these SNe through energy conservation arguments. A comparison of\nthese two estimation methods using Student's t-test reveals no statistically\nsignificant differences between the estimates. This finding suggests that both\nmethods provide robust estimates of Ni mass in SNe Ia.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Q9kpNgCtr5LnK8TDdibNw7bkgHJxC-SCxv0D0WyTUQg","pdfSize":"3121957"}
