In this scenario, the geometry of the 4D- early\nUniverse is described as a vacuum bubble that undergoes quasi-de Sitter\nexpansion in Kerr- AdS$_5$ spacetime. We find that the BH mass and spin\nparameter, which show an anti-correlation against the total radiation, are\nimportant to resolve the ${}^4$He anomaly. The present results provide clues to\nfinding a connection between the observed results of light-element\nnucleosynthesis and the scenario of the 4D-bubble universe in AdS$_5$\nspacetimes\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sKBllYU7XvaICcC5RLweGmA6gbhWhE5oy1tCh_KjXOM","pdfSize":"1634831"}
