In this setting, we establish the existence of infinitely many\nsolutions and of a nonnegative least energy solution. We show that, as the\nregions of attraction shrink, least energy solutions of the system concentrate.\nWe study this behavior and characterize their limit profile. In particular, we\nshow that if each component of a least energy solution is attracted to a\ndifferent region, then the components decouple in the limit, whereas if all the\ncomponents are attracted to the same region, they remain coupled.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
