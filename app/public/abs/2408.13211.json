In this paper, we present an alternative approach: an automated\nmethod for synthesizing the functionality of a quantum algorithm into a quantum\ncircuit model representation. Our methodology involves training a neural\nnetwork model using diverse input-output mappings of the quantum algorithm. We\ndemonstrate that this trained model can effectively generate a quantum circuit\nmodel equivalent to the original algorithm. Remarkably, our observations\nindicate that the trained model achieves near-perfect mapping of unseen inputs\nto their respective outputs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FeKdP4hrE7i5E4thfRQV2JVo2AadvXFTB52cDFVK_Rg","pdfSize":"747087"}
