Partial wave analysis can be applied to reveal the\nmomentum spectral structure and identify the positions of valleys/peaks of the\nmultiphoton rings by combining with $CP$ conservation. Moreover, considering\nthe spin states of created pairs in partial wave analysis, the particle orbital\nangular momentum associated with the valleys/peaks can also be identified from\nmultiphoton rings. It is found that the results for angular distribution by\nthis approximate analytical treatment and by the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner\nformalism are consistent with each other. The present results are helpful for\nunderstanding the angular momentum information in momentum spectra, and they\nalso have an implication for revealing the vortex structure near the valleys.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uqxONXt39AtjqCQ1HnmlP-P4lbd0ggW1ELSBSTAioME","pdfSize":"973971"}
