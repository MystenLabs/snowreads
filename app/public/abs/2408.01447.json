As robotic devices start\npercolating into our daily lives they must behave as fully trustworthy objects,\nsuch that humans accept them just as we trust interacting with other people in\nour daily lives.\n  How can we learn from system models and findings from social sciences and how\ncan such learnings be translated into requirements for future technical\nsolutions? We present a novel holistic approach on how to tackle\ntrustworthiness systematically in the context of communications. We propose a\nfirst attempt to incorporate objective system properties and subjective beliefs\nto establish trustworthiness-based trust, in particular in the context of the\nfuture Tactile Internet connecting robotic devices. A particular focus is on\nthe underlying communications technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
