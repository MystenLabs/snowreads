In experiments, TBU is typically\nseen to occur in patterns that locally can be circular (spot), linear (streak),\nor intermediate . We investigate a two-dimensional (2D) model of localized TBU\nusing a Fourier spectral collocation method to observe how the evaporation\ndistribution affects the resulting dynamics of tear film thickness and\nosmolarity, among other variables. We find that the dynamics are not simply an\naddition of individual 1D solutions of independent TBU events, and we show how\nthe TBU quantities of interest vary continuously from spots to streaks for the\nshape of the evaporation distribution. We also find a significant speedup by\nusing a proper orthogonal decomposition to reduce the dimension of the\nnumerical system. The speedup will be especially useful for future applications\nof the model to inverse problems, allowing the clinical observation at scale of\nquantities that are thought to be important to DED but not directly measurable\nin vivo within TBU locales.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
