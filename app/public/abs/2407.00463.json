It\npromotes transparency and replicability by releasing both the pre-trained\nmodels and the complete \"recipes\" of code and algorithms required for training\nthem. This paper presents SpeechBrain 1.0, a significant milestone in the\nevolution of the toolkit, which now has over 200 recipes for speech, audio, and\nlanguage processing tasks, and more than 100 models available on Hugging Face.\nSpeechBrain 1.0 introduces new technologies to support diverse learning\nmodalities, Large Language Model (LLM) integration, and advanced decoding\nstrategies, along with novel models, tasks, and modalities. It also includes a\nnew benchmark repository, offering researchers a unified platform for\nevaluating models across diverse tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
