However,\nadvancements in technology, such as RDMA, have made it feasible to relax this\nrequirement, allowing for more effective use of modern datacenter topologies\nlike FatTree and Dragonfly. The rise of AI/ML workloads underscores the\nnecessity for enhanced link utilization, a challenge for single-path load\nbalancers due to issues like ECMP collisions.\n  In this paper, we introduce REPS, a novel per-packet traffic load-balancing\nalgorithm that integrates seamlessly with existing congestion control\nmechanisms. REPS reroutes packets around congested hotspots and unreliable or\nfailing links with remarkable simplicity and minimal state requirements.\n  Our evaluation demonstrates that REPS significantly outperforms traditional\npacket spraying and other state-of-the-art solutions in datacenter networks,\noffering substantial improvements in performance and link utilization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
