Further, rank and cardinality of a constacyclic code of\narbitrary length over a non-chain ring of the type $\\mathtt{R_{_{\\theta}}}$\nhave been obtained by determining a minimal spanning set of the code. Also,\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for a constacyclic code of arbitrary length\nover a non-chain ring of the type $\\mathtt{R_{_{\\theta}}}$ to be reversible\nhave been determined. Examples have also been presented in support of our\nresults.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
