Despite its importance in biomolecular\nregulation and signal transduction, the underlying dynamical process is not\nwell understood. This study introduces a dynamical model of allosteric\ncommunication based on \"contact clusters\"-localized groups of highly correlated\ncontacts that facilitate interactions between secondary structures. The model\nshows that allostery involves a multi-step process with cooperative contact\nchanges within clusters and communication between distant clusters mediated by\nrigid secondary structures. Considering time-dependent experiments on a\nphotoswitchable PDZ3 domain, extensive (in total $\\sim 500\\,\\mu$s) molecular\ndynamics simulations are conducted that directly monitor the photoinduced\nallosteric transition. The structural reorganization is illustrated by the time\nevolution of the contact clusters and the ligand, which affects the nonlocal\ncoupling between distant clusters. A timescale analysis reveals dynamics from\nnano- to microseconds, which are in excellent agreement with the experimentally\nmeasured timescales.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
