Let $d^c(v)$ be the number of distinct colors on the\nedges at $v \\in V$ and let $\\delta^c(G) = \\min_{v \\in V} \\{ d^{c}(v) \\}$. H. Li\nproved that $\\delta^c(G) > n/2$ guarantees a rainbow triangle in $G$. We give\nextensions of Li's result to cliques $K_r$ for $r \\ge 4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
