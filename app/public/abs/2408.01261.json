Given an analytic equivalence relation $E$,\neither ${E_0^{\\mathbb{N}}}\\leq_B{E}$ or else any Borel homomorphism from\n$E_0^{\\mathbb{N}}$ to $E$ is \"very far from a reduction\", specifically, it\nfactors, on a comeager set, through the projection map\n$(2^{\\mathbb{N}})^{\\mathbb{N}}\\to (2^{\\mathbb{N}})^k$ for some\n$k\\in\\mathbb{N}$. As a corollary, we prove that $E_0^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is a prime\nequivalence relation, answering a question on Clemens.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2AviyFtwTGrq51o_vcPB1zPqz8rkDnzDELCtHbo1F34","pdfSize":"146852"}
