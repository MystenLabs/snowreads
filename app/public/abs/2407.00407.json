In spite of the costs, labeling\nand categorizing entities is essential for NLP tasks such as semantic\nevaluation. Even though annotation can be done by non-experts in most cases,\ndue to the fact that this requires human labor, the process is costly. Another\nmajor challenge encountered in data annotation is maintaining the annotation\nconsistency. Annotation efforts are typically carried out by teams of multiple\nannotators. The annotations need to maintain the consistency in relation to\nboth the domain truth and annotation format while reducing human errors.\nAnnotating a specialized domain that deviates significantly from the general\ndomain, such as fantasy literature, will see a lot of human error and annotator\ndisagreement. So it is vital that proper guidelines and error reduction\nmechanisms are enforced. One such way to enforce these constraints is using a\nspecialized application. Such an app can ensure that the notations are\nconsistent, and the labels can be pre-defined or restricted reducing the room\nfor errors. In this paper, we present SHADE, an annotation software that can be\nused to annotate entities in the high fantasy literature domain.
