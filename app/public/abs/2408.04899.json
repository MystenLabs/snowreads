As part of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with\nMeerKAT) Large Survey Project, we are using the core array of the MeerKAT radio\ntelescope (MeerKAT) to conduct a targeted search of the LMC for radio pulsars\nat L-band frequencies, 856-1712$\\,$MHz. The excellent sensitivity of MeerKAT,\ncoupled with a 2-hour integration time, makes the survey 3 times more sensitive\nthan previous LMC radio pulsar surveys. We report the results from the initial\nfour survey pointings which has resulted in the discovery of seven new radio\npulsars, increasing the LMC radio pulsar population by 30 per cent. The pulse\nperiods of these new pulsars range from 278 to 1690$\\,$ms, and the highest\ndispersion measure is 254.20$\\,$pc$\\,$cm$^{-3}$. We searched for, but did not\nfind any significant pulsed radio emission in a beam centred on the SN$\\,$1987A\nremnant, establishing an upper limit of 6.3$\\,{\\mu}$Jy on its minimum flux\ndensity at 1400$\\,$MHz.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
