In this work, we argue that widely available web images can also be\nconsidered for the learning of new classes. To achieve this, firstly we\nintroduce a strategy to select web images which are similar to previously seen\nexamples in the latent space using a Fourier-based domain discriminator. Then,\nan effective caption-driven reharsal strategy is proposed to preserve\npreviously learnt classes. To our knowledge, this is the first work to rely\nsolely on web images for both the learning of new concepts and the preservation\nof the already learned ones in WILSS. Experimental results show that the\nproposed approach can reach state-of-the-art performances without using\nmanually selected and annotated data in the incremental steps.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
