This paper introduces an adaptive speed\ncontroller tailored for scenarios of mixed autonomy, where AVs interact with\nhuman-driven vehicles. We model the traffic dynamics using a system of strongly\ncoupled Partial and Ordinary Differential Equations (PDE-ODE), with the PDE\ncapturing the general flow of human-driven traffic and the ODE characterizing\nthe trajectory of the AVs. A speed policy for AVs is derived using a\nReinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm structured within an Actor-Critic (AC)\nframework. This algorithm interacts with the PDE-ODE model to optimize the AV\ncontrol policy. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the\ncontroller's impact on traffic patterns, showing the potential of AVs to\nimprove traffic flow and reduce congestion.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AtK-jOeLUg634w58eLO1sD9y5dTU9PerayWu7vg6-sA","pdfSize":"3344208"}
