In the random walk case, this gives an alternative proof of a recent\nresult of E. Pek\\\"oz and R. Righter in 2024. Our arguments in both discrete and\ncontinuous cases are parallel to each other. We also outline a simple SDE proof\nfor the Brownian case based on a standard comparison theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
