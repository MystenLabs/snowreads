Surprisingly, the onset of secondary shearless curves has been\nreported in a few twist systems. Meanwhile, we found that, in twist systems,\nthe onset of these secondary shearless curves is a standard process that may\nappear as control parameters are varied in situations where there is resonant\nmode coupling. Namely, we analyze these shearless bifurcations in two-harmonic\nsystems for the standard map, the Ullmann map, and for the Walker-Ford\nHamiltonian flow. The onset of shearless curves is related to bifurcations of\nperiodic points. Furthermore, depending on the bifurcation, these shearless\ncurves can emerge alone or in pairs, and in some cases, deform into\nseparatrices.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"aeVeWZ7V9Gk0TBcXLpVWp-Ze3OCNvylSoA4vCuKOa4Y","pdfSize":"2635376"}
