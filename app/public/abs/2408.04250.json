High-order finite element method solution of the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations provide a reference to validate the\nanalytical formulae derived here. Both analytical and numerical investigations\nagree on an independence of the configuration to the Reynolds number. Up to the\ncritical Reynolds number, found to lie above $10^4$, the hydrodynamic solution\nof this configuration is solely governed by the Stokes number. The exact\nexpression of the sound radiated in the far field is computed by accounting for\nthe cylinder scattering by means of tailored Green's functions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vo8aOgC3dXQBJQ-WnSfYielRt8jiPoOtzjQDGpIqBYA","pdfSize":"3637744"}
