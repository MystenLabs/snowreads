A critical\nchallenge of AMM-powered trading is that transaction order has high financial\nvalue, so a policy or method to order transactions in a \"good\" (optimal) manner\nis vital. We offer economic measures of both price stability (low volatility)\nand inequality that inform how a \"social planner\" should pick an optimal\nordering. We show that there is a trade-off between achieving price stability\nand reducing inequality, and that policymakers must choose which to prioritize.\nIn addition, picking the optimal order can often be costly, especially when\nperforming an exhaustive search over trade orderings (permutations). As an\nalternative we provide a simple algorithm, Clever Look-ahead Volatility\nReduction (CLVR). This algorithm constructs an ordering which approximately\nminimizes price volatility with a small computation cost. We also provide\ninsight into the strategy changes that may occur if traders are subject to this\nsequencing algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
