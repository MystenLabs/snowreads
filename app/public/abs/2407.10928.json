The impulse, spin kick,\nand leading-order waveforms exhibit such a nontrivial dependence. A signal of\nthis additional structure is the change in the magnitude of the spin vector\nunder conservative Hamiltonian evolution, similar to our previous studies in\nelectrodynamics. These additional degrees of freedom describe dynamical mass\nmultipoles of compact objects and decouple for black holes. We also show that\nthe conservative impulse, spin kick and change of the additional degrees of\nfreedom are encoded in the eikonal phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
