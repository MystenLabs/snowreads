The title clickbait extensively exists\nin news domain and increases the difficulty for news recommendation to offer\nsatisfactory services for users. Fortunately, we find that news abstract, as a\ncritical field of news, aligns cohesively with the news authenticity. To this\nend, we propose a Title Debiasing News Recommendation with Cross-field\nContrastive learning (TDNR-C2) to overcome the title bias by incorporating news\nabstract. Specifically, a multi-field knowledge extraction module is devised to\nextract multi-view knowledge about news from various fields. Afterwards, we\npresent a cross-field contrastive learning module to conduct bias removal via\ncontrasting learned knowledge from title and abstract fileds. Experimental\nresults on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nTDNR-C2 over existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis also indicates\nthe significance of news abstract for title debiasing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
