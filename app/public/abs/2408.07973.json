The Gardner equation is chosen as\nthe key example for it comprises both the Korteweg-de Vries and modified\nKorteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations. The Gardner and Miura transformations which\nconnect these equations are also computed using the concept of scaling\nhomogeneity. Exact solitary wave solutions and solitons of the Gardner equation\nare derived using Hirota's method and other direct methods. The nature of these\nsolutions depends on the sign of the cubic term in the Gardner equation and the\nunderlying mKdV equation. It is shown that flat (table-top) waves of large\namplitude only occur when the sign of the cubic nonlinearity is negative\n(defocusing case) whereas the focusing Gardner equation has the standard\nelastically colliding solitons. The paper's aim is to provide a review of\nintegrability properties and solutions of the Gardner equation and illustrate\nthe applicability of the scaling symmetry approach. The methods and algorithms\nused in this paper have been implemented in Mathematica but can be adapted for\nmajor computer algebra systems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
