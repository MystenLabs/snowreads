The prevailing models used to\ndescribe molecular geometry include the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion\n(VSEPR) theory, hybridization theory, and molecular orbital theory. While these\nmodels provide significant insights, they also have inherent limitations.\nApplying string theory and graph theory with topological and macrotensorial\nmethods could improve the understanding of molecular behavior. Objective:\nexplore the potential applications of string and graph theory to material\nscience, focusing on molecular geometry, electron domains, and phase changes\nvia symmetries. Molecular geometry: each molecule is associated with a simple\ngraph with an orthonormal representation inducing metrics via the usage of\nmacrotensor operators, allowing the calculation of angles between molecules and\nfollowing the equations of motion. Phase changes: a series of inequalities are\nproposed depending on the energy-momentum densities of bonds and the edges of\nthe associated graph where electrons or atoms are located, its topology, and\nisometries, exploring possible new states of matter. Conclusions: application\nof macrotensors, graphs, string theory, partitions, and correlation functions\nof dimensions to material science, specifically to molecular geometry and phase\nchanges, allows for a more dynamic and flexible description of natural\nphenomena involving matter and the prediction of possible new states of matter\nas other forms of condensates. This presents a different perspective, opening\npossibilities for Experimental confirmation, applications, simulations of\nexamples and further refinement of the presented approach are anticipated,\nwhich could be transformative for material science.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
