Committee hearings are a core feature of any\nlegislature, and they offer an institutional setting which promotes the\nexchange of arguments and reasoning that directly impact and shape legislation.\nWe apply What Is Being Argued (WIBA), which is an argument extraction and\nanalysis framework that we previously developed, to U.S. Congressional\ncommittee hearings from 2005 to 2023 (109th to 117th Congresses). Then, we\nfurther expand WIBA by introducing new ways to quantify various dynamics of\ndemocratic deliberation. Specifically, these extensions present a variety of\nsummary statistics capturing how deliberative or controversial a discourse was,\nas well as useful visualizations to the WIBA output that aid analyzing\narguments made during the legislative deliberation. Our application reveals\npotential biases in the committee system, and how political parties control the\nflow of information in 'hot topic' hearings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
