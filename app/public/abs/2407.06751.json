These devices are often subject to lab analysis with the objective to\nreveal secret hidden information. One kind of attacks to reveal the\ncryptographic key is to perform optical Fault Injection attacks. In this work,\nwe investigated the IHP radiation tolerant shift registers built of Triple\nModular Redundant flip-flops. In our experiments, we were able to inject\ndifferent transient faults into TMR registers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
