Given a\nhenselian valued field of equal characteristic $0$ with divisible value group,\nwe show that the property of being geometrically $C_1$ lifts from the residue\nfield to the valued field. We also prove that algebraically maximal valued\nfields with divisible value group and finite residue field are geometrically\n$C_1$. In particular, any maximal totally ramified extension of a local field\nis geometrically $C_1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
