Faced with the\nchallenges of the diverse and unstructured nature of medical articles, our\nstudy introduces a multi-step system to first identify relevant articles, then\nclassify them based on the presence of risk factor discussions and, finally,\nextract specific risk factor information for a disease through a\nquestion-answering model.\n  Our contributions include the development of a comprehensive pipeline for the\nautomated extraction of risk factors and the compilation of several datasets,\nwhich can serve as valuable resources for further research in this area. These\ndatasets encompass a wide range of diseases, as well as their associated risk\nfactors, meticulously identified and validated through a fine-grained\nevaluation scheme. We conducted both automatic and thorough manual evaluation,\ndemonstrating encouraging results. We also highlight the importance of\nimproving models and expanding dataset comprehensiveness to keep pace with the\nrapidly evolving field of medical research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
