This model is an eight-dimensional\nsystem of ordinary differential equations. Since the reaction system has a\ncascade structure, we show that the eight-order model can be reduced to a\nfour-dimensional one. Using general growth rates, we provide an in-depth\nmathematical analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the system. First, we\ndetermine all the steady states of the model where there can be more than\nfifteen equilibria with a non-monotonic growth rate. Then, the necessary and\nsufficient conditions of existence and local stability of all steady states are\nestablished according to the operating parameters: the dilution rate, the input\nconcentrations of the two nutrients, and the distribution of the total process\nvolume considered. The operating diagrams are then analyzed theoretically to\ndescribe the asymptotic behavior of the process according to the four control\nparameters. There can be seventy regions with rich behavior where the system\nmay exhibit bistability or tristability with the coexistence of both microbial\nspecies in the two bioreactors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
