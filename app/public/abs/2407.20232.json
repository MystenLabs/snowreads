To solve this problem, we propose\n$\\textit{Specify ANd Edit}$ (SANE), a zero-shot inference pipeline for\ndiffusion-based editing systems. We use a large language model (LLM) to\ndecompose the input instruction into specific instructions, i.e. well-defined\ninterventions to apply to the input image to satisfy the user's request. We\nbenefit from the LLM-derived instructions along the original one, thanks to a\nnovel denoising guidance strategy specifically designed for the task. Our\nexperiments with three baselines and on two datasets demonstrate the benefits\nof SANE in all setups. Moreover, our pipeline improves the interpretability of\nediting models, and boosts the output diversity. We also demonstrate that our\napproach can be applied to any edit, whether ambiguous or not.
