We develop a general approach to describe classical field theories\non such geometries in a linearized approximation, by using free scalar fields\nas a model. Perturbations caused by shockwaves exist above the wave front and\nare solutions to a characteristic Cauchy problem with initial data on the wave\nfront determined by a supertranslation of ingoing fields. A special attention\nis paid to perturbations of fields of pointlike sources generated by\nplane-fronted gravitational shockwaves. One has three effects: conversion of\nnon-stationary perturbations into an outgoing radiation, a spherical scalar\nshockwave which appears when the gravitational wave hits the source, and a\nplane scalar shockwave accompanying the initial gravitational wave. Our\nanalysis is applicable to gravitational shockwaves of a general class including\ngeometries sourced by null particles and null branes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
