We point out the essential role of the causality\ncondition, which requires that any point of the system should rotate slower\nthan the velocity of light. We show that imposing this physical requirement\nleads to inhibition of the splitting between the chiral and confining\ntransitions, which becomes negligibly small ($\\Delta T \\sim 1$~MeV or less) for\nexperimentally relevant, slow angular velocities $\\Omega \\sim 10$~MeV of a\n$(5-10)$~fm-sized systems. Moreover, the boundedness of the system has a much\nbigger effect on temperature splitting than the rotation itself: the splitting\nreaches 10~MeV in a small, one-fermi-sized non-rotating system. The temperature\nsplitting may, however, become enhanced in an academic limit of\nultra-relativistic regimes when the boundary of the system rotates at\nnear-to-light velocities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
