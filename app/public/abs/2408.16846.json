Unfortunately, when the data is corrupted by noise, the\nidentified model can be biased. Additionally, depending on the choice of\nlifting functions, the identified model can be unstable, even when the\nunderlying system is asymptotically stable. This paper presents an approach to\nreduce the bias in an approximate Koopman model, and simultaneously ensure\nasymptotic stability, when using noisy data. Additionally, the proposed\ndata-driven modeling approach is applicable to systems with inputs, such as a\nknown forcing function or a control input. Specifically, bias is reduced by\nusing a total least-squares, modified to accommodate inputs in addition to\nlifted inputs. To enforce asymptotic stability of the approximate Koopman\nmodel, linear matrix inequality constraints are augmented to the identification\nproblem. The performance of the proposed method is then compared to the\nwell-known extended dynamic mode decomposition method and to the newly\nintroduced forward-backward extended dynamic mode decomposition method using a\nsimulated Duffing oscillator dataset and experimental soft robot arm dataset.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
