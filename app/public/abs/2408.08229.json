Our calculations are model independent and apply to any ultra-violet\ncomplete theory of quantum gravity that admit general relativity as a low\nenergy theory. We show that it is important to consider the full effective\naction to obtain renormalization group invariant solutions. We investigate the\nvalidity range of our techniques within simple cosmological models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
