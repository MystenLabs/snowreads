We are interested in tiling regions formed by the\nfinite union of unit cubes. We investigate domino tilings, slab tilings and\nmixed tilings (vertical dominoes and horizontal slabs). A flip is a local move:\nin a slab (resp. domino) tiling, two neighboring parallel slabs (resp.\ndominoes) are removed and placed back in a different position.\n  We may interpret a three dimensional region as being made of floors. A slab\nor domino which crosses two floors is vertical, and horizontal otherwise. We\ncan also define a flip in a mixed tiling, we replace four vertical dominoes in\na $2\\times 2\\times 2$ box by two horizontal slabs and vice-versa.\n  Inspired by the twist for domino tilings we construct a flip invariant for\nmixed tilings. Based on this, we then construct the triple twist for slab\ntilings: an invariant under flips assuming values in $\\mathbb{Z}^3$. We show\nthat if the region is a large box then the triple twist assumes a large number\nof possible values, at least proportional to the fourth power of the volume. We\nalso give examples of smaller regions for which the triple twist assumes only\none value and the set of tilings is connected under flips.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
