Recently, the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) has shown the\npotential to generate high-quality images by converting Gaussian random noise\ninto realistic images. In this paper, we apply the DPM to augment the deep\nultraviolet fluorescence (DUV) image dataset with an aim to improve breast\ncancer classification for intraoperative margin assessment. For classification,\nwe divide the whole surface DUV image into small patches and extract\nconvolutional features for each patch by utilizing the pre-trained ResNet.\nThen, we feed them into an XGBoost classifier for patch-level decisions and\nthen fuse them with a regional importance map computed by Grad-CAM++ for whole\nsurface-level prediction. Our experimental results show that augmenting the\ntraining dataset with the DPM significantly improves breast cancer detection\nperformance in DUV images, increasing accuracy from 93% to 97%, compared to\nusing Affine transformations and ProGAN.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
