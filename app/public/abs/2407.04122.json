We find\nthe fundamental solutions of linear differential operators of infinite order\nand show that the unique solution of the corresponding inhomogeneous equation\ncan be represented as a convolution of the fundamental solution of this\noperator and the right-hand side. We also prove the existence and uniqueness\ntheorem of the Cauchy problem for some linear differential equations in the\nmodule of formal power series with copolynomial coefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
