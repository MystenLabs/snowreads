We compare the method\nwith one alternative method on various widely and not widely known BNs of\ndifferent sizes and study the scalability of both methods on them. We also\npropose an approach to check the contamination of BNs in LLM, which shows that\nsome widely known BNs are inapplicable for testing the LLM usage for BNs\nstructure elicitation. We also show that some BNs may be inapplicable for such\nexperiments because their node names are indistinguishable. The experiments on\nthe other BNs show that our method performs better than the existing method\nwith one of the three studied LLMs; however, the performance of both methods\nsignificantly decreases with the increase in BN size.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CEGruMhWMMPs2Wv6oJ6htjG_TLrkZfvAaJN4YN2OOI0","pdfSize":"552653"}
