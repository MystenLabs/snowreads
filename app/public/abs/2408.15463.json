This\nstudy is conducted in the presence of a magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$ and the\ntransport of a direct current $\\mathbf{J}$. We use the well-know time dependent\nGinzburg-Landau theory ($\\mathbf{TDGL}$) for analyzed the possible effects on\nthe density Gibbs free energy $\\mathbf{F}$, magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$, and\nsuperconducting electronic Cooper pair density $|\\psi|^{2}$. We are interested\nin studying two cases: varying the $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{x}$ of the\nnanobridge in the absence of induced $\\mathbf{J}$, and including the induction\nof external $\\mathbf{J}$ for fixed $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{x}$. We find that\n$\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{x}$ play an essential role in stabilizing\n(controlling) vortex states in the nanobridge, and the presence of induced\n$\\mathbf{J}$ ($\\mathbf{J}>0$ and $\\mathbf{J}<0$), with a fixed $\\mathbf{L}$ and\n$\\mathbf{x}$, causes the movement of vortex states in the nanobridge just when\n$\\mathbf{J}$ is induced at both faces of superconducting nanobridge system.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
