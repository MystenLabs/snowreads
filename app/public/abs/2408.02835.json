Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are\ncomputationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional\ncomputers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware\nusing spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations,\nwe build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation\nthrough time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network.\nLeveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the\nsequential digits classification task with $89.83\\pm2.91~\\%$ accuracy, as good\nas the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the\ntime constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to\nadapt to different input time scales.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
