PCoR* terms consist of\nthe following standard operators on binary relations: identity, empty,\nuniversality, union, intersection, composition, converse, and\nreflexive-transitive closure (so, PCoR* terms subsume Kleene algebra terms and\nallegory terms as fragments). Additionally, we show that the equational theory\nof PCoR* extended with tests and nominals (in hybrid logic) is still\nEXPSPACE-complete; moreover, it is PSPACE-complete for its intersection-free\nfragment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
