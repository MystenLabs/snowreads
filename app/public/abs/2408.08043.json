In this work, we analyse the\nphenomenological prospects of (neutral) triple Higgs compared to di-Higgs boson\nproduction, for a range of Higgs-sector extensions from a strong first-order\nelectroweak phase transition perspective. In parallel, we include constraints\nfrom existing exotics and Higgs boson measurements that further limit the\nparameter space of such models. Resonance contributions offer large\nmodifications in particular for triple Higgs production, albeit starting from a\nsmall SM expectation. With enhancements of order 40 over the SM, however,\nexperimental efforts to obtain limits at the HL-LHC are well-motivated and\nwell-placed. This is further highlighted by the potential of these processes to\ninform the investigation of the thermal history of our universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
