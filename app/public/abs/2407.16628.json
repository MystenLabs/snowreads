Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) interacts with\nelectromagnetic fields via kinetic mixing, implicating an approach to give a\nconstraint with extragalactic very high energy (VHE) sources. In this work, we\nattempt to constrain the kinetic mixing from the photon-dark photon scattering\nprocess in the host galaxy of blazar, the intergalactic medium and the Milky\nWay. The VHE photons from a blazar would pass through a dense DM spike around\nthe supermassive black hole where the absorption from DPDM is dramatically\nenhanced. The kinetic mixing is constrained to be $\\epsilon \\sim 10^{-7}$ at a\n95$\\%$ confidence level with $m_{\\rm D}\\sim 0.03 - 1$ eV mass range from the\nobservations of Markarian (Mrk) 421 and Mrk 501.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
