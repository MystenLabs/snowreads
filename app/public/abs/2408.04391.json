The prediction quality\nof a machine learning model is evaluated model-independent based on a\ncross-validation approach, where the approximation error is estimated for\nunknown data. The presented measures quantify the amount of explained variation\nin the model prediction. The reliability of these measures is assessed by means\nof several numerical examples, where an additional data set for the\nverification of the estimated prediction error is available. Furthermore, the\nconfidence bounds of the presented quality measures are estimated and local\nquality measures are derived from the prediction residuals obtained by the\ncross-validation approach.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
