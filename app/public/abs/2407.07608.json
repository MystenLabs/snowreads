The primary question concerning breath\nfigures is how the condensing vapor is allocated between the growth of existing\ndroplets and the nucleation of new ones. Although numerous theoretical studies\nhave concentrated on scenarios resulting in highly polydisperse droplet\nensembles, a companion paper [Bouillant {\\em et al.}, submitted] demonstrates\nthat nearly monodisperse patterns can be achieved on defect-free substrates in\na diffusion-controlled regime. The objective of this work is to present a\ntheoretical framework that elucidates the formation and evolution of\nnearly-monodisperse patterns in breath figures. We discover that, following a\nshort nucleation phase, the number of droplets remains constant over an\nextensive range of timescales due to collective effects mediated by the\ndiffusion of vapor. The spatial extent of these diffusive interactions is\nidentified through asymptotic matching, based on which we provide an accurate\ndescription of breath figures through a mean-field model. The model accounts\nfor the sub-diffusive growth of droplets as well as for the arrest of\nnucleating new droplets, and reveal the scaling laws for the droplet density\nobserved in experiments. Finally, droplets expand and ultimately coalesce,\nwhich is shown to trigger a scale-free coarsening of the breath figures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q5IfGDznFR1iCTcwNPJdgDM06Tw0JroQzNkGKrd__F4","pdfSize":"2575247"}
