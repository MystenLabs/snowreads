However, the\neffectiveness of persuasive socially assistive robot behaviors and their impact\non the sustained motivation of older adults is still not well understood. This\nextended abstract describes our prior human-robot interaction study on\ninvestigating the effectiveness of persuasive social robot behaviors with care\nproviders, followed by our current research assessing the impact of these\npersuasive robot behaviors on the well-being of older adults in long-term care.\nThe findings provide insights into engagement and sustained motivation of older\nadults when providing assistance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
