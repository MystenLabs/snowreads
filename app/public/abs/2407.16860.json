Numerous OIE systems are developed,\nclaiming ever-increasing performance, marking the need for objective\nbenchmarks. BenchIE is the latest reference we know of. Despite being very well\nthought out, we noticed a number of issues we believe are limiting. Therefore,\nwe propose $\\textit{BenchIE}^{FL}$, a new OIE benchmark which fully enforces\nthe principles of BenchIE while containing fewer errors, omissions and\nshortcomings when candidate facts are matched towards reference ones.\n$\\textit{BenchIE}^{FL}$ allows insightful conclusions to be drawn on the actual\nperformance of OIE extractors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7nD7zf1XFIDIyz29cyODr8PxbfNBMQC148-CN8vONF4","pdfSize":"1980754"}
