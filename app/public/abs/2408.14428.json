Compared to previous studies, we apply an\nalternative viewpoint motivated by open-system physics by separating the phase\nfield into homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts, describing a quantum pendulum\n(subsystem) and an interacting phononic bath (environment). To study the\nrelaxation dynamics in the model, we perform quantum quenches using the\nmini-superspace-based truncated Hamiltonian approach developed recently and\nsimulate the real-time evolution of various entanglement measures and the\nenergy transfer between the subsystem and its environment. Our findings\ndemonstrate that in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations, the\nrelaxation dynamics is substantially faster, signalled by the increase of\nentanglement and energy transfer between the quantum pendulum and the phonon\nbath.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
