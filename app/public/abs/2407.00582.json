We\nengineered Robo-AO-2 to deliver robotic, diffraction-limited observations at\nvisible and near-infrared wavelengths in unprecedented numbers. This new\ninstrument takes advantage of upgraded components, manufacturing techniques and\ncontrol; and includes a parallel reconfigurable natural guide star wavefront\nsensor with which to explore hybrid wavefront sensing techniques. We present\nthe results of commissioning in 2023 and 2024.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
