Its payload consists of two identical Rowland Circle-type long-slit\nspectrographs, sharing a single MicroChannel plate detector. Each spectrograph\nchannel consists of an off-axis parabola primary mirror and a toroidal\ndiffraction grating optimized for the 1013-1057 Angstroms bandpass. Despite the\nsimple configuration, the optical alignment/integration process for Aspera is\nchallenging due to tight optical alignment tolerances, driven by the compact\nform factor, and the contamination sensitivity of the Far-Ultraviolet optics\nand detectors. In this paper, we discuss implementing a novel multi-phase\napproach to meet these requirements using state-of-the-art optical metrology\ntools. For coarsely positioning the optics we use a blue-laser 3D scanner while\nthe fine alignment is done with a Zygo interferometer and a custom\ncomputer-generated hologram. The detector focus requires iterative in-vacuum\nalignment using a Vacuum UV collimator. The alignment is done in a controlled\ncleanroom facility at the University of Arizona.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zHEYcKonHVP0S1kRw9FTnD7LQS91tFxlAOCRbehnR7U","pdfSize":"50512564"}
