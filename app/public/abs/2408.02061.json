However, these methods are less effective in complex parking scenarios\ndue to the intricate design of the algorithms. In contrast,\nneural-network-based methods tend to be more intuitive and versatile than the\nrule-based methods. By collecting a large number of expert parking trajectory\ndata and emulating human strategy via learning-based methods, the parking task\ncan be effectively addressed. In this paper, we employ imitation learning to\nperform end-to-end planning from RGB images to path planning by imitating human\ndriving trajectories. The proposed end-to-end approach utilizes a target query\nencoder to fuse images and target features, and a transformer-based decoder to\nautoregressively predict future waypoints. We conducted extensive experiments\nin real-world scenarios, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieved an average parking success rate of 87.8% across four different\nreal-world garages. Real-vehicle experiments further validate the feasibility\nand effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
