We introduce a new target loss function tailored\nto this setting that accounts for both the classification error and the\ncardinality of the set predicted. To optimize this loss function, we propose\ntwo families of surrogate losses: cost-sensitive comp-sum losses and\ncost-sensitive constrained losses. Minimizing these loss functions leads to new\ncardinality-aware algorithms that we describe in detail in the case of both\ntop-$k$ and threshold-based classifiers. We establish $H$-consistency bounds\nfor our cardinality-aware surrogate loss functions, thereby providing a strong\ntheoretical foundation for our algorithms. We report the results of extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and SVHN datasets demonstrating\nthe effectiveness and benefits of our cardinality-aware algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
