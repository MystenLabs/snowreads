Given a constant $\\varepsilon > 0$, the problem asks for an\n$L$-coloring of $G$ in which at least $\\varepsilon |U|$ vertices in $U$ receive\ntheir preferred color. We use a method of reducible subgraphs to approach this\nproblem. We develop a vertex-partitioning tool that, when used with a new\nreducible subgraph framework, allows us to define large reducible subgraphs.\nUsing this new tool, we show that if $G$ has maximum average degree less than\n$\\frac{11}{3}$, a list $L(v)$ of size $4$ at each $v \\in V(G)$, and a set $U\n\\subseteq V(G)$ of vertices with preferred colors, then there exists an\n$L$-coloring of $G$ for which at least $2^{-145} |U|$ vertices of $U$ receive\ntheir preferred color.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
