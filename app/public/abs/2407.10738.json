We propose AccDiffusion, an accurate method\nfor patch-wise higher-resolution image generation without training. An in-depth\nanalysis in this paper reveals an identical text prompt for different patches\ncauses repeated object generation, while no prompt compromises the image\ndetails. Therefore, our AccDiffusion, for the first time, proposes to decouple\nthe vanilla image-content-aware prompt into a set of patch-content-aware\nprompts, each of which serves as a more precise description of an image patch.\nBesides, AccDiffusion also introduces dilated sampling with window interaction\nfor better global consistency in higher-resolution image generation.\nExperimental comparison with existing methods demonstrates that our\nAccDiffusion effectively addresses the issue of repeated object generation and\nleads to better performance in higher-resolution image generation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
