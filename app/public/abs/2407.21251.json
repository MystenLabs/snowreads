These groups are derived from the direct\nproduct of rotational groups on $\\mathbf{H}^2$ and some translation components\non the real fibre direction $\\mathbf{R}$ that can be determined by the\ncorresponding Frobenius congruences. Moreover, we developed a procedure to\ndetermine the optimal radius for the densest geodesic ball packing\nconfigurations related to the considered screw motion groups. The highest\npacking density, $\\approx0.80529$, is achieved by a multi-transitive case given\nby rotational parameters $(2,20,4)$. E. Moln\\'{a}r demonstrated that\nhomogeneous 3-spaces can be uniformly interpreted in the projective 3-sphere\n$\\mathcal{PS}^3(\\mathbf{V}^4, \\boldsymbol{V}_4, \\mathbf{R})$. We use this\nprojective model of $\\mathbf{H}^2\\!\\times\\!\\mathbf{R}$ to compute and visualize\nthe locally optimal geodesic ball arrangements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
