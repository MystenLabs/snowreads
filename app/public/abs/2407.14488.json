By developing $p$-adic Hodge\ntheory for general valuation rings, we establish a geometric analogue of Sen's\ncriterion for any $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic varieties: its\n(Riemann-Zariski) stalkwise perfectoidness is necessary for the non-vanishing\nof the geometric Sen operators. As the latter is verified for general Shimura\nvarieties by Pan and Camargo, we obtain the perfectoidness of every completed\nstalk of general Shimura varieties at infinite level at $p$. As an application,\nwe prove that the integral completed cohomology groups vanish in higher\ndegrees, verifying a conjecture of Calegari-Emerton for general Shimura\nvarieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
