The proposed\nmethod, based on a locally-conservative discretization, guarantees also the\nspatial conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy and is kinetic\nenergy-preserving. In order to achieve the entropy-conservation property for an\narbitrary non-ideal gas, a general strategy is adopted based on the\nmanipulation of discrete balance equations through the imposition of global\nentropy conservation and the use of a summation by parts rule. The procedure,\nwhich is extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy, conducts to a general form\nof the internal-energy numerical flux which results in a nonlinear function of\nthermodynamic and dynamic variables and still admits the mass flux as a\nresidual degree of freedom. The effectiveness of the novel entropy-conservative\nformulation is demonstrated through numerical tests making use of some of the\nmost popular cubic equations of state.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
