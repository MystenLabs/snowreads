The contribution to the\nvacuum is identified with dynamical dark energy $\\Lambda\\simeq\n\\alpha_p\\Lambda_0$ by an IR coupling $\\alpha_p\\sim \\hbar$ of the bare\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda_0\\sim\\hbar^{-1}$ consistent with general\nrelativity, where $\\hbar$ is the Planck constant. Described by the trace\n$J=(1-q)H^2$ of the Schouten tensor derived from a path integral formulation\nwith gauged global phase, the proposed $J$CDM takes us beyond the $\\Lambda$CDM\nlimit of frozen $J=\\Lambda$. The Hubble constant $H_0$ in $J$CDM is effectively\n$\\sqrt{6/5}$ times the {\\em Planck} value in $\\Lambda$CDM analysis of the CMB\naccording to $H(z)=H_0\\sqrt{1+(6/5)\\Omega_{M,0} Z_5(z) +\n\\Omega_{r,0}Z_6(z)}/(1+z)$, where $Z_n=(1+z)^n-1$ given densities of matter\n$\\Omega_{M,0}$ and radiation $\\Omega_{r,0}$. With no free parameters, $J$CDM\nhereby agrees with the Local Distance Ladder when satisfying the BAO measured\nby {\\em Planck}. On this cosmological background, galaxies possess an\nessentially $C^0$-transition to anomalous dynamics due to reduced inertia below\nthe de Sitter scale of acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $c$ is the velocity of\nlight. This is confirmed in SPARC over a 6$\\sigma$ tension in $\\Lambda$CDM\ngalaxy models, pointing to ultra-light CDM of mass $m_Dc^2<3\\times 10^{-21}$eV.\nSensitivity to this cosmological background explains the JWST 'Impossible\ngalaxies' at cosmic dawn by rapid gravitational collapse. We comment on an\noutlook on future confrontations with observations by {\\em Euclid}.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
