Many of these objects exhibit\nsigns of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, making their study crucial for\nunderstanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their\ngrowth with host galaxies. In this work, we examine low and medium resolution\nJWST/NIRSpec spectra from the JADES GTO public data release in the GOODS-N\nfield of a red, luminous ($M_{\\rm B}\\sim-22.2$ mag) and compact ($<500$ pc)\nsource at $z=4.13$. The rest-optical ($\\lambda_{\\rm rest} > 4000$ A) continuum\nof this source is strongly dominated by a massive (log$_{10}$[$M_*/M_\\odot]\n\\sim 10.6$), quenched (log$_{10}$[sSFR/yr$^{-1}$] $< -11$) galaxy, as indicated\nby the clear presence of a Balmer break and stellar absorption lines.\nStar-formation history modeling reveals a starburst episode followed by rapid\nquenching about 200 Myr ago. The spectrum shows extremely broad (FWHM $\\sim\n2500$ km/s) H$\\alpha$ emission and elevated optical line ratios, indicating an\nactively accreting SMBH. Moreover, our work has potentially revealed clear AGN\nsignatures in the rest-UV in LRDs for the first time, via a detection of a\nstrong Ly$\\alpha$ emission and a broad MgII, doublet. The derived black hole\nmass of log$_{10}$($M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot) \\sim 7.3$ results in $M_{\\rm\nBH}/M_*\\sim 0.04$ %, consistent with the local relations, unlike the elevated\nratios in other high-$z$ reddened AGN. Finally, we use JWST data from AGN at\n$z=4-10$ to explore an evolutionary link between high-$z$ reddened AGN, early\nquiescent galaxies, and local ellipticals.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
