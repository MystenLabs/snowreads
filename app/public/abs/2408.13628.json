This\nimportance escalates in multi-treatment marketing campaigns, where diverse\ntreatment is available and we may want to assign the customers to treatment\nthat can make the most impact. While there are existing approaches with\nconvenient frameworks like Causalml, there are potential spaces to enhance the\neffect of uplift modeling in multi treatment cases. This paper introduces a\nnovel approach to uplift modeling in multi-treatment campaigns, leveraging\nscore ranking and calibration techniques to improve overall performance of the\nmarketing campaign. We review existing uplift models, including Meta Learner\nframeworks (S, T, X), and their application in real-world scenarios.\nAdditionally, we delve into insights from multi-treatment studies to highlight\nthe complexities and potential advancements in the field. Our methodology\nincorporates Meta-Learner calibration and a scoring rank-based offer selection\nstrategy. Extensive experiment results with real-world datasets demonstrate the\npractical benefits and superior performance of our approach. The findings\nunderscore the critical role of integrating score ranking and calibration\ntechniques in refining the performance and reliability of uplift predictions,\nthereby advancing predictive modeling in marketing analytics and providing\nactionable insights for practitioners seeking to optimize their campaign\nstrategies.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
