Supervised machine learning techniques hold great promise for\nalleviating this weakness by inferring models from data. We propose a novel\ncontrol barrier function-based framework for safe control through\nevent-triggered learning, which switches between prioritizing control\nperformance and improving model accuracy based on the uncertainty of the\nlearned model. By updating a Gaussian process model with training points\ngathered online, the approach guarantees the feasibility of control barrier\nfunction conditions with high probability, such that safety can be ensured in a\ndata-efficient manner. Furthermore, we establish the absence of Zeno behavior\nin the triggering scheme, and extend the algorithm to sampled-data realizations\nby accounting for inter-sampling effects. The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach and theory is demonstrated in simulations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
