When data correspondence is not present or loosely established,\nthe calibration problem becomes a parameter estimation problem that aligns the\ntwo data distributions. This procedure is conceptually identical to the\nunderlying principle of GAN training in which networks are trained to match the\ngenerative distribution to the real data distribution. As a primary\napplication, this idea is applied to the hand-eye calibration problem,\ndemonstrating the proposed method's applicability and benefits in complicated\ncalibration problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
