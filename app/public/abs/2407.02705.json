We propose the normalized tension of domain wall connecting different\nfield values, with a varying normalization relative to a local energy scale, as\nthe distance. We show this definition reproduces the usual moduli space\ndistance for zero potential, as well as the $d\\propto |\\log \\Lambda|$ behavior\nwith the vacuum energy $\\Lambda$ in the AdS case, previously proposed in the\nliterature. In the case of large AdS we also obtain the expected exponent of\nmass versus distance in one particular case, when the mass of the light tower\nis $m\\sim \\sqrt \\Lambda$ and there is a single extra dimension decompactifying.\nWe also discuss the features and shortcomings of alternative but related\nproposals.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OWGQ1NNRnPcVFtH3l7dzA8KBEoDGIDxYcJNwDk9nJzo","pdfSize":"934906"}
