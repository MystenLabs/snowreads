The proposed antenna consists of a patch\nelement and a 3-turn Complementary Spiral Resonator (3-CSR) with antenna\ndimension of 50 mm x 50 mm. 3-CSR is inserted in the ground plane to reduce the\nantenna size. This modification also increased the impedance bandwidth from 43\nMHz (1.78-1.83 GHz) to 310 MHz (1.69-2.0 GHz) . Moreover, antenna is fabricated\nand simulated and measured results are in good agreement. Additionally, a\nrectifier and matching circuits are designed at -10 dBm to realize a rectenna\n(rectifying antenna) for WPT application. Rectenna efficiency of 53.6 % is\nachieved at a low input power of -10 dBm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
