When restricted to the\nplanar circular electrical case, this graphical map finds the split system\nassociated uniquely to the Kalmanson resistance distance of the dual network,\nmatching the induced split system familiar from phylogenetics. This is extended\nto compactifications of the respective spaces, taking cactus networks to the\nnewly defined compactified split systems. The graphical map preserves both\ncomponents and cactus structure, allowing an elegant enumeration of induced\nphylogenetic split systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
