Its event-driven\nparadigm facilitates promising prospect in resilient and energy-efficient\ncoordination among power electronic converters. However, different from\nbiological neurons that are focused in the literature, microgrids exhibit\ndistinct architectures and features, implying potentially diverse adaptability\nin its capabilities to dismiss information transfer, which remains largely\nunrevealed. One of the biggest drawbacks in the information transfer theory is\nthe impact of noise in the signaling accuracy. Hence, this article hereby\nexplores the noise resiliency of neuromorphic inferential communication in\nmicrogrids through case studies and underlines potential challenges and\nsolutions as extensions beyond the results, thus offering insights for its\nimplementation in real-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2lpbG6KW5Owx4KyNMcUTDFpbpylZRBHDmYjUuROSHw4","pdfSize":"1670434"}
