These modified moments are\ndetermined from powers of the original distribution. The nth-power distribution\nis guaranteed to have finite moments up to n-1. Samples from the nth-power\ndistribution are drawn from n-tuple Independent Approximates, which are the set\nof independent samples grouped into n-tuples and sub-selected to be\napproximately equal to each other. We show that Independent Approximates are a\nmaximum likelihood estimator for the generalized Pareto and the Student's t\ndistributions, which are members of the family of coupled exponential\ndistributions. We use the first (original), second, and third power\ndistributions to estimate their zeroth (geometric mean), first, and second\npower-moments respectively. In turn, these power-moments are used to estimate\nthe scale and shape of the distributions. A least absolute deviation criteria\nis used to select the optimal set of Independent Approximates. Estimates using\nhigher powers and moments are possible though the number of n-tuples that are\napproximately equal may be limited.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
