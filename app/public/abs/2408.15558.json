Applying the Hermitian\nconstruction, a new class of $2^{m}$-ary\n  quantum codes are obtained from Hermitian constacyclic self-orthogonal codes\nover $\\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}+{u}\\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}.$ We secondly define another\nclass of maps, which changes the Hermitian self-orthogonal property of linear\ncodes over $R$ into the trace self-orthogonal property of linear codes over\n$\\mathbb{F}_{p^{2m}}$. Using the Symplectic construction, a new class of\n$p^{m}$-ary quantum codes are obtained from Hermitian constacyclic\nself-orthogonal codes over $R.$\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
