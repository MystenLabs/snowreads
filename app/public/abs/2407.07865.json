Upon realizing the similarities\nof these conditions with unilateral contact problems in mechanics, we take\ninspiration from that literature to propose two approaches: the first method\nrelies on a strongly consistent penalization term, whereas the second one is\nobtained by an hybridization approach, in which the value of the pressure on\nthe surface is treated as a separate set of unknowns. The flow problem is\ndiscretized in mixed form with div-conforming elements so that the water mass\nis preserved. Numerical experiments show the validity of the proposed strategy\nin handling the seepage boundary conditions on geometries with increasing\ncomplexity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
