The proposed approach\ninvolves the introduction of a semi-supervised learning (SSL) with a biased\nteacher (SSLB) algorithm, which effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled\nchannel data. To reduce measurement expenses, unlabeled data is generated using\nan updated channel simulator (UCHS), and then weighted by adaptive confidence\nvalues to simplify the tuning of hyperparameters. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves superior performance while\nminimizing measurement overhead and training expense compared to existing\nbenchmarks, offering a valuable and practical solution for indoor positioning.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bMgls9bh6RHGU_zOnebTpsWFykGdN9XHwFboQkcXn2I","pdfSize":"1446756"}
