We incorporate the IKF with the conjugate gradient\nalgorithm, which substantially accelerates the computation of matrix inversion\nfor a general form of covariance matrices, whereas other approximation\napproaches may not be directly applicable. We demonstrate the scalability and\nefficiency of the IKF approach through distinct applications, including\nnonparametric estimation of particle interaction functions and predicting\nincomplete lattices of correlated data, using both simulation and real-world\nobservations, including cell trajectory and satellite radar interferogram.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
