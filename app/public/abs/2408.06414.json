Our method applies ideas of the Tensor\nRenormalization Group to obtain an improved action which is used to extract\ncritical properties by performing Monte Carlo simulations on relatively small\nsystem sizes. We demonstrate this method on the XY model in three dimensions.\nOur method may provide a framework with which to efficiently study universal\nproperties in a large class of phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
