The second main result of the paper is to study the log-convexity and\nlog-concavity of the function $$h_p(x)=(1-x)^p{\\cal K}(\\sqrt x).$$ We prove\nthat $h_p$ is strictly log-concave on $(0,1)$ if and only if $p\\geq 7/32$ and\nstrictly log-convex if and only if $p\\leq 0$. This solves some problems posed\nby Yang and Tian and complete their result and a result of Alzer and Richards\nthat $f_a$ is strictly concave on $(0,1)$ if and only if $a=4/3$ and $1/f_a$ is\nstrictly concave on $(0,1)$ if and only if $a\\geq 8/5$. As applications of the\nconvexity and concavity, we establish among other inequalities, that for $a\\geq\na_c$ and all $r\\in(0,1)$ $$\\frac{2\\pi\\sqrt\\pi}{(2a+\\log 2)\\Gamma(3/4)^2}\\leq\n\\frac{{\\cal K}(\\sqrt r)}{a-\\frac12\\log (r)}+\\frac{{\\cal\nK}(\\sqrt{1-r})}{a-\\frac12\\log (1-r)}<1+\\frac\\pi{2a},$$ and for $p\\geq 3(2+\\sqrt\n2)/8$ and all $r\\in(0,1)$ $$\\sqrt{(r-r^2)^p{\\cal K}(\\sqrt{1-r}){\\cal K}(\\sqrt\nr)}< \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt\\pi}{2^{p+1}\\Gamma(3/4)^2}<\\frac{r^p{\\cal\nK}(\\sqrt{1-r})+(1-r)^p{\\cal K}(\\sqrt r)}{2}.$$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
