For example, the functor $BO(-)$, which sends a\n$C_2$-representation $V$ to the classifying space of its orthogonal group\n$BO(V)$. We obtain a bigraded sequence of approximations to $F$, called the\nstrongly $(p,q)$-polynomial approximations $T_{p,q}F$. The bigrading arises\nfrom the bigrading on $C_2$-representations. The homotopy fibre $D_{p,q}F$ of\nthe map from $T_{p+1,q}T_{p,q+1}F$ to $T_{p,q}F$ is such that the approximation\n$T_{p+1,q}T_{p,q+1}D_{p,q}F$ is equivalent to the functor $D_{p,q}F$ itself and\nthe approximation $T_{p,q}D_{p,q}F$ is trivial. A functor with these properties\nis called $(p,q)$-homogeneous. Via a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences, we prove\nthat $(p,q)$-homogeneous functors are fully determined by orthogonal spectra\nwith a genuine action of $C_2$ and a naive action of the orthogonal group\n$O(p,q)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uWZDi7xuyNUgyUNVtpvRhJLn0t3r0GUWRXJCCEIWnIs","pdfSize":"821610"}
