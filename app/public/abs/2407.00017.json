CityJSONSeq was added to the CityJSON\nversion 2.0 standard to allow us to stream very large 3D city models. The main\nidea is to decompose a CityJSON dataset into its individual city objects (each\nbuilding, each tree, etc.) and create several independent JSON objects of a\nnewly defined type: 'CityJSONFeature'. We elaborate on the engineering\ndecisions that were taken to develop CityJSONSeq, we present the open-source\nsoftware we have developed to convert to and from CityJSONSeq, and we discuss\ndifferent aspects of the new format, eg filesize, usability, memory footprint,\netc. For several use-cases, we consider CityJSONSeq to be a better format than\nCityJSON because: (1) once serialised it is about 10% more compact; (2) it\ntakes an order of magnitude less time to process; and (3) it uses significantly\nless memory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
