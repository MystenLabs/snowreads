Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been\nproposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing\ntests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal,\nparticularly for programs with multiple faults.\n  This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with\nmultiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple\nobservations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT\nformula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations\nand simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two\nbenchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster\nthan other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only\ngenerates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other\napproaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FbdnGHjQtGLFZQbYrSefasj5-OZJiYLp3a3zbIPE2ms","pdfSize":"874884"}
