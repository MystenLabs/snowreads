The degree index in our setup is a certain measure of degree\nirregularity whose basic properties are well studied in the literature, and the\ncorresponding theoretical analysis in a random graph setup turns out to be\ntractable. On the other hand, the clustering index, based on a similar\nreasoning, is first introduced in this manuscript. Computing exact expressions\nfor the expected clustering index turns out to be more challenging even in the\ncase of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, and our results are on obtaining relevant\nupper bounds. These are also complemented with observations based on Monte\nCarlo simulations. Besides the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi case, we also do\nsimulation-based analysis for random regular graphs, the Barab\\'asi-Albert\nmodel and the Watts-Strogatz model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
