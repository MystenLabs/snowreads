We implement the\ncausal curiosity method which combines machine learning times series\nclassification and clustering with a causal framework. We analyse three\ndistinct wind environments: constant wind, shear wind, and turbulence, and\nexplore different optimisation strategies for optimal UAV manoeuvres to\nestimate the wind conditions. The proposed approach can be used to design\noptimal trajectories in challenging weather conditions, and to avoid\nspecialised sensors that add to the UAV's weight and compromise its\nfunctionality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
