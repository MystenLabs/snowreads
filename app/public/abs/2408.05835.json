In\nthis paper, we present Devlore which allows realm VMs to directly access\nintegrated peripherals. Devlore memory isolation re-purposes CCA hardware\nprimitives (granule protection and stage-two page tables), while our interrupt\nisolation adapts a delegate-but-check strategy. Our choice of offloading\ninterrupt management to the hypervisor but adding correctness checks in the\ntrusted software allows Devlore to preserve compatibility and performance. We\nevaluate Devlore on Arm FVP to demonstrate 5 diverse peripherals attached to\nrealm VMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
