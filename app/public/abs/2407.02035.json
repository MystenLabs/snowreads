Starting with\nan initial positive temperature, we show that there exist solutions to a\nKelvin-Voigt model for quasi-static nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity at a\nfinite-strain setting [Mielke-Roub\\'i\\v{c}ek '20], obeying an\nexponential-in-time lower bound on the temperature. Afterwards, we focus on the\ncase of deformations near the identity and temperatures near a critical\npositive temperature, and we show that weak solutions of the nonlinear system\nconverge in a suitable sense to solutions of a system in linearized\nthermoviscoelasticity. Our result extends the recent linearization result in\n[Badal-Friedrich-Kru\\v{z}\\'ik '23], as it allows the critical temperature to be\npositive.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
