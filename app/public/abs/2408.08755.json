It predicts several features of the exact phase\ndiagram correctly even at low orders. It is shown that increasing the order of\nthe expansion improves the accuracy of the crystal phase except for very small\ntemperatures, where the expansion completely fails regardless of the order of\nthe expansion. The source of this behaviour seems to be related to the\nSilver-Blaze phenomenon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
