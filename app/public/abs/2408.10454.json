The filter creates an original kind of particles, called scout\nparticles, that bring information from the measurement noise onto the state\nprior probability density function. Thanks to the creation of high-order\npolynomial maps and their inversions, the scouting of the measurements helps\nthe SIS algorithm identify the region of the prior more affected by the\nlikelihood distribution. The result of the technique is two different versions\nof the proposed Scout Particle Filter (SPF), which identifies and delimits the\nregion where the true posterior probability has high density in the SIS\nalgorithm. Four different numerical applications show the benefits of the\nmethodology both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, where the SPF is compared\nto other particle filters, with a particular focus on target tracking and orbit\ndetermination problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"lAvBuEv7p-8h4hYjxafhOo77bJQuTGu53gPy2tAxSsM","pdfSize":"5097539"}
