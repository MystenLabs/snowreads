The long range\npart of either potential has bounded variation. The short range part of the\nmagnetic potential belongs to $L^1(\\mathbb{R} ; \\mathbb{R}) \\cap\nL^2(\\mathbb{R})$, while the short range part of the electric potential is a\nfinite signed measure. The proof is a one dimensional instance of the energy\nmethod, which is used to prove Carleman estimates in higher dimensions and in\nmore complicated geometries. The novelty of our result lies in the weak\nregularity assumptions on the coefficients. As a consequence of the Carleman\nestimate, we establish an optimal limiting absorption resolvent estimates for\n$P(h)$. We also present standard applications to the distribution of resonances\nfor $P(1)$ and to associated evolution equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mGLzDLyTZCqjY5w8wEuaoVFpx82QETvvhPiaBSsZfJo","pdfSize":"371880"}
