To tackle this\nchallenge when clustering within sequential data, we present a method for\nestimating the number of clusters when the data is a trajectory of a Block\nMarkov Chain. Block Markov Chains are Markov Chains that exhibit a block\nstructure in their transition matrix. The method considers a matrix that counts\nthe number of transitions between different states within the trajectory, and\ntransforms this into a spectral embedding whose dimension is set via singular\nvalue thresholding. The number of clusters is subsequently estimated via\ndensity-based clustering of this spectral embedding, an approach inspired by\nliterature on the Stochastic Block Model. By leveraging and augmenting recent\nresults on the spectral concentration of random matrices with Markovian\ndependence, we show that the method is asymptotically consistent - in spite of\nthe dependencies between the count matrix's entries, and even when the count\nmatrix is sparse. We also present a numerical evaluation of our method, and\ncompare it to alternatives.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
