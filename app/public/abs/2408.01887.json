{"id":"2408.01887","title":"The Logic of Political Survival Revisited: Consequences of Elite\n  Uncertainty Under Authoritarian Rule","authors":"Tamar Zeilberger","authorsParsed":[["Zeilberger","Tamar",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2024 00:09:52 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-06","timestamp":1722730192000,"abstract":"  Existing research has established that autocrats offer concessions to prevent\nouster by their inner circle. This paper examines how those concessions are\ninfluenced by the relative uncertainty of an autocrat's inner circle about\nremaining in that favored body. I take as my starting point the formal model of\npolitical survival presented in Bueno de Mesquita et al.'s The Logic of\nPolitical Survival. I extend the model to account for variation in the relative\nuncertainty of an autocrat's inner circle. To make the math tractable, I\ndispense with convention and introduce comparative statics across two models\nwith different formulations of uncertainty. This exercise reveals a set of\nconditions under which to expect an increase in the concessions offered by an\nautocrat, with implications for development and democracy. Those findings yield\na corresponding set of logical corollaries with potential to further our\nunderstanding of authoritarian politics, including an unexamined facet of the\n\"dictator's dilemma\" (Wintrobe 1990, 1998) and related incentives for members\nof an inner circle to permit purges or act to destabilize their ranks. The\nmodels also identify a source of policy volatility not found outside of\nautocracies. Taken together, the findings suggest a need for more research on\nelite uncertainty in autocracies.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
