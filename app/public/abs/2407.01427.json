Using this concept, under a mild\nassumption of compactness, we estimate the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between\nprincipal $G$-bundles and certain reductive homogeneous $G$-spaces. In\naddition, we prove that every reduction of the structure group $G$ to a closed\nconnected subgroup gives rise to a sequence of Riemannian metrics on the total\nspace for which the underlying sequence of metric spaces converges, in the\nGromov-Housdorff topology, to a normal reductive homogeneous $G$-space. This\nlast finding allows one to detect the presence of certain reductive homogeneous\n$G$-spaces in the Gromov-Housdorff closure of the moduli space of Riemannian\nmetrics of the total space of the bundle through topological invariants\nprovided by obstruction theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
