The geometric map of study\nmay be analogized to the billiard map with a different reflection rule so that\neach iteration is a contraction over the space, thereby providing asymptotic\nbehavior of interest. Our study emphasizes the behavior of periodic orbits\ngenerated by the map, with description of their geometry and bifurcation\nbehavior. We establish that for any initial point in the space, the orbit will\nconverge to a fixed point or periodic orbit, and we demonstrate that there\nexists an infinite variety of periodic orbits the orbits may converge to,\ndependent on the parameters of the underlying space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kLcGBUmmKTSNyCPnx6AlOeuzJiDCe8SGugCOGyBhiQU","pdfSize":"2930806"}
