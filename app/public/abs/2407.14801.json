We introduce a new simple sorting\nalgorithm in that model which has asymptotically optimal IO complexity\n$O(\\frac{n}{B} \\log_{M/B} n)$, where $n$ is the instance size, $M$ size of the\ncache and $B$ size of a memory block. This is the same as the complexity of the\nbest known cache-oblivious sorting algorithm FunnelSort.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gg4NWy18k_SBMVmaZuyhdzQOzRLhAlx2-62568H5rWI","pdfSize":"339982","objectId":"0xbe5c9510732a9fe8aa748512b9c84dadc4a7904fcf980bfef1db3f6426ebd132","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
