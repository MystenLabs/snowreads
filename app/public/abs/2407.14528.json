We show that these integral\nvariables can be transformed into the spacetime metric, leading to a new\nrepresentation of quantum mechanics. We show that the wave-particle duality can\nbe interpreted as the uncertainty of spacetime for the particle. Summarizing\nall possible trajectories in conventional path integral quantum mechanics can\nbe transformed into the summation of all possible spacetime metrics. We\nemphasize that in conventional quantum gravity, it is possible that the\nclassical matter fields correspond to the quantum spacetime. We argue that this\nis not quite reasonable and propose a new path integral quantum gravity model\nbased on the new interpretation of wave-particle duality. In this model, the\naforementioned drawback of conventional quantum gravity naturally disappears.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
