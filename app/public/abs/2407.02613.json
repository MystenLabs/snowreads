Traditional wildfire\nmodeling, while useful, often fails to adapt to the rapid dynamics of such\nevents. This report introduces the (Wildfire Autonomous Response and Prediction\nUsing Cellular Automata) WARP-CA model, a novel approach that integrates\nterrain generation using Perlin noise with the dynamism of Cellular Automata\n(CA) to simulate wildfire spread. We explore the potential of Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) to manage wildfires by simulating autonomous\nagents, such as UAVs and UGVs, within a collaborative framework. Our\nmethodology combines world simulation techniques and investigates emergent\nbehaviors in MARL, focusing on efficient wildfire suppression and considering\ncritical environmental factors like wind patterns and terrain features.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6fY2-ba5Njuc-VHbfiw9gIKiBagRDcUe92kldQF-mCE","pdfSize":"1925319"}
