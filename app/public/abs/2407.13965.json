It is demonstrated that exposing the ANNs to variations during\ntraining processes can improve their robustness and generalization\ncapabilities. However, the way in which this variation is introduced can have a\nsignificant impact. In this paper, we define various training schedules to\nspecify how these variations are introduced during an evolutionary learning\nprocess. In particular, we focus on morphological robustness and\ngeneralizability concerned with finding an ANN-based controller that can\nprovide sufficient performance on a range of physical variations. Then, we\nperform an extensive analysis of the effect of these training schedules on\nmorphological generalization. Furthermore, we formalize the process of training\nsample selection (i.e., morphological variations) to improve generalization as\na reinforcement learning problem. Overall, our results provide deeper insights\ninto the role of variability and the ways of enhancing the generalization\nproperty of evolved ANN-based controllers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5L3Aj7Zfmezxr0mi6NYi5PNk4LNdLFbY3VnjGqV9Gto","pdfSize":"1670775","objectId":"0x3eb6a2128e1a0db4b05d8cf6df1c3ffdf9e86489359acc3deacdfd0f2e4a8ccf","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
