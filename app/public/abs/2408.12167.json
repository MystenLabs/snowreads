Recent years have\nwitnessed rapid advancements in attaining quantum-limited optical detection and\ncontrol of a nanoscale particle by coupling its motion to a high-finesse\noptical cavity in the resolved-sideband regime. In order to control the\nparticle deeper in the quantum regime, however, it is necessary to\nsignificantly enhance the coupling between the particle and the cavity. Here,\nwe present a novel platform that can allow for achieving this. Our system\nconsists of a conventional optical tweezer and a toroidal optical microcavity\nwith an ultrahigh quality (Q) factor. The optomechanical coupling between the\nparticle and the cavity is established by placing the particle in the near\nfield of the cavity. The significantly reduced mode volume allows us to achieve\na 100-fold increase in the single photon optomechanical coupling compared to a\nconventional Fabry-P\\'erot cavity with macroscopic mirrors, while ultralow loss\nof the cavity maintains the system close to the resolved-sideband regime. Our\napproach paves the way for enabling quantum experiments on levitated mesoscopic\nparticles with high quantum cooperativity near the resolved-sideband regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
