This approach is crucial in many\ndisciplines like engineering, biology, astronomy, and economics. In this paper,\nwe consider the following dimensionality reduction instance: Given an\nn-dimensional probability distribution p and an integer m<n, we aim to find the\nm-dimensional probability distribution q that is the closest to p, using the\nKullback-Leibler divergence as the measure of closeness. We prove that the\nproblem is strongly NP-hard, and we present an approximation algorithm for it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
