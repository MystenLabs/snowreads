Recently, Richardson extrapolation and\npolynomial interpolation have been proposed to mitigate the Trotter error\nincurred by use of these formulae. This work provides an improved, rigorous\nanalysis of these techniques for the task of calculating time-evolved\nexpectation values. We demonstrate that, to achieve error $\\epsilon$ in a\nsimulation of time $T$ using a $p^\\text{th}$-order product formula with\nextrapolation, circuits depths of $O\\left(T^{1+1/p}\n\\textrm{polylog}(1/\\epsilon)\\right)$ are sufficient -- an exponential\nimprovement in the precision over product formulae alone. Furthermore, we\nachieve commutator scaling, improve the complexity with $T$, and do not require\nfractional implementations of Trotter steps. Our results provide a more\naccurate characterisation of the algorithmic error mitigation techniques\ncurrently proposed to reduce Trotter error.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
