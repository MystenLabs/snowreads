Typically, it finds the most suitable\nhypothesis from the set of hypotheses under the sampled pseudo-references. mbrs\nis a library of MBR decoding, which can flexibly combine various metrics,\nalternative expectation estimations, and algorithmic variants. It is designed\nwith a focus on speed measurement and calling count of code blocks,\ntransparency, reproducibility, and extensibility, which are essential for\nresearchers and developers.
