Recent studies show that syntactic information\nboosts language model performance and offers clues for people to understand\ntheir learning mechanisms. Unlike languages with a fixed word order such as\nEnglish, Korean allows for varied word sequences, despite its canonical\nstructure, due to case markers that indicate the functions of sentence\ncomponents. This study explores whether Korean language models can accurately\ncapture this flexibility. We note that incomplete word orders and omitted case\nmarkers frequently appear in ordinary Korean communication. To investigate this\nfurther, we introduce the Syntactically Incomplete Korean (SIKO) dataset.\nThrough SIKO, we assessed Korean language models' flexibility with incomplete\nsyntax and confirmed the dataset's training value. Results indicate these\nmodels reflect Korean's inherent flexibility, accurately handling incomplete\ninputs. Moreover, fine-tuning with SIKO enhances the ability to handle common\nincomplete Korean syntactic forms. The dataset's simple construction process,\ncoupled with significant performance enhancements, solidifies its standing as\nan effective data augmentation technique.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
