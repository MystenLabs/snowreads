RSVQA\nautomatically extracts information from satellite images, so far only optical,\nand a question to automatically search for the answer in the image and provide\nit in a textual form. In our research, we study whether Synthetic Aperture\nRadar (SAR) images can be beneficial to this field. We divide our study into\nthree phases which include classification methods and VQA. In the first one, we\nexplore the classification results of SAR alone and investigate the best method\nto extract information from SAR data. Then, we study the combination of SAR and\noptical data. In the last phase, we investigate how SAR images and a\ncombination of different modalities behave in RSVQA compared to a method only\nusing optical images. We conclude that adding the SAR modality leads to\nimproved performances, although further research on using SAR data to\nautomatically answer questions is needed as well as more balanced datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
