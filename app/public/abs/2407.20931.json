I find a declining trend in matching efficiency, consistent with\ndecreasing job and worker finding rates. The implied match elasticity with\nrespect to unemployment is 0.5-0.9, whereas the implied match elasticity with\nrespect to vacancies varies between -0.4 and 0.4. Decomposing aggregate data\ninto full-time and part-time ones, I find that the sharp decline of matching\nefficiency after 2015 shown in the aggregate trend is driven by the decline of\nboth full-time and part-time ones. Second, I extend the mismatch index proposed\nby Sahin et al (2014) to the nonparametric version and develop the\ncomputational methodology. I find that the mismatch across occupations is more\nsevere than across prefectures and the original Cobb-Douglas mismatch index is\nunderestimated.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
