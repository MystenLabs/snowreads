However, handling the sparse and unordered nature of\npoint cloud data presents challenges for efficient and accurate segmentation.\nInspired by the Mamba model's success in natural language processing, we\npropose the Serialized Point Cloud Mamba Segmentation Model (Serialized Point\nMamba), which leverages a state-space model to dynamically compress sequences,\nreduce memory usage, and enhance computational efficiency. Serialized Point\nMamba integrates local-global modeling capabilities with linear complexity,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on both indoor and outdoor datasets.\nThis approach includes novel techniques such as staged point cloud sequence\nlearning, grid pooling, and Conditional Positional Encoding, facilitating\neffective segmentation across diverse point cloud tasks. Our method achieved\n76.8 mIoU on Scannet and 70.3 mIoU on S3DIS. In Scannetv2 instance\nsegmentation, it recorded 40.0 mAP. It also had the lowest latency and\nreasonable memory use, making it the SOTA among point semantic segmentation\nmodels based on mamba.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
