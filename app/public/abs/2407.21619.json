We first present a novel strategy for analytic integration of the BPS\nequations, which makes use of the integrals of motion. Subsequently, we discuss\nthe suitable choice of integration constants that gives rise to smooth\ngeometries. These flows are asymptotically locally AdS$_7$ in their UV limit,\nwhile their IR geometry is AdS$_3\\times \\mathbb{R}^4$. We then discuss their\nuplifts to 11d and massive IIA supergravity and observe that they describe\none-parameter deformations of their AdS$_7\\times S^4$ and AdS$_7\\times S^3$\nvacua, respectively, their holographic interpretation being as conformal defect\nCFT$_2$'s within the corresponding dual SCFT$_6$'s. We conclude with the\ncomputation of the holographic central charge, by focussing on the M-theory\ninterpretation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
