It includes a brief introduction,\nimplementation details, and results for the photoionization cross-section of\nthe beryllium atom. Beryllium is a convenient test due to small but significant\nrelativistic effects. The current calculation aligns with other R-matrix\ncalculations and experiments. It observes the change in the Fano line shape of\nthe (2pnd)1P series and, reveals a previously unnoticed coupling between\ntriplet and singlet series observable in the ground state photoionization\ncross-section.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"phhlC259RulFk7fbVFY7VQZr6E3sokNwlisDbwzckMs","pdfSize":"648976"}
