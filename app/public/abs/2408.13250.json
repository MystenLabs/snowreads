The parameters are calibrated to data\nfrom a recent set of $^{3}$He-${}^4$He elastic scattering differential cross\nsection measurements. Analysis of these data for $E_{\\rm lab} \\leq 4.3$ MeV\nyields a unimodal posterior for which both methods obtain the same structure.\nHowever, the effective-range expansion amplitude does not account for the\n$7/2^-$ state of ${}^7$Be so, even after calibration, the description of data\nat the upper end of this energy range is poor. The data up to $E_{\\rm lab}=2.6$\nMeV can be well described, but calibration to this lower-energy subset of the\ndata yields a bimodal posterior. After adapting VI to treat such a multi-modal\nposterior we find good agreement between the VI results and those obtained with\nparallel-tempered Monte Carlo sampling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
