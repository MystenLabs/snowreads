Due to the degeneracy of the lens parameters for the\nbinary microlensing, additional features such as parallax and finite-size\neffects need to identify the lens parameters. The frequency-shift effect as the\nrelativistic analogy of the gravity assist for the photons, is an extra\nobservation that provides additional constraint between the lens parameters .\nIn this work, we extend the application of the frequency shift effect to binary\nmicrolensing and derive the frequency shift during the lensing and caustic\ncrossing. The frequency shift for the binary lens is of the order of\n${\\Delta\\nu}/{\\nu}\\sim 10^{-12}$. We also investigate the feasibility of\ndetecting this effect by employing Cross-Correlation methods .\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
