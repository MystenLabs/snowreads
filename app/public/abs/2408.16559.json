To push the boundaries of sUAS simulation testing in realistic\nenvironments, we previously developed the DroneReqValidator (DRV) platform,\nallowing developers to automatically conduct simulation testing in digital twin\nof earth. In this paper, we present DRV 2.0, which introduces a novel component\ncalled DroneWiS (Drone Wind Simulation). DroneWiS allows sUAS developers to\nautomatically simulate realistic windy conditions and test the resilience of\nsUAS against wind. Unlike current state-of-the-art simulation tools such as\nGazebo and AirSim that only simulate basic wind conditions, DroneWiS leverages\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to compute the unique wind flows caused by\nthe interaction of wind with the objects in the environment such as buildings\nand uneven terrains. This simulation capability provides deeper insights to\ndevelopers about the navigation capability of sUAS in challenging and realistic\nwindy conditions. DroneWiS equips sUAS developers with a powerful tool to test,\ndebug, and improve the reliability and safety of sUAS in real-world.
