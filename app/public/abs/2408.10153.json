One of the major\nchallenges in this area is the domain gap between annotated but unrealistic\nsynthetic data and unannotated but realistic clinical data. Previous attempts\nto bridge this domain gap directly target the depth estimation task itself. We\npropose a general pipeline of structure-preserving synthetic-to-real (sim2real)\nimage translation (producing a modified version of the input image) to retain\ndepth geometry through the translation process. This allows us to generate\nlarge quantities of realistic-looking synthetic images for supervised depth\nestimation with improved generalization to the clinical domain. We also propose\na dataset of hand-picked sequences from clinical colonoscopies to improve the\nimage translation process. We demonstrate the simultaneous realism of the\ntranslated images and preservation of depth maps via the performance of\ndownstream depth estimation on various datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
