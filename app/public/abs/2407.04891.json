We define the $(\\infty, 1)$-category $\\mathrm{SBim}_E(n)$ of\n$E$-valued U(n) Soergel bimodules, where $E$ is a connective\n$\\mathbb{E}_\\infty$-ring spectrum, and assemble them into a monoidal locally\nadditive $(\\infty, 2)$-category $\\mathrm{SBim}_E$. When $E$ has a complex\norientation, we then construct a braiding, i.e. an $\\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra\nstructure, on the universal locally stable $(\\infty, 2)$-category\n$\\mathrm{K}^b_{\\mathrm{loc}}(\\mathrm{SBim}_E)$ associated to $\\mathrm{SBim}_E$.\nAlong the way, we also prove spectral analogs of standard splittings of Soergel\nbimodules. This is a topological generalization of the type $A$ Soergel\nbimodule theory developed in a previous paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
