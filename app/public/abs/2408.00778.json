In this\npaper, we explore abstract-to-detailed task transitions in the context of\nfrontend code generation as a step towards intent-based user interfaces, aiming\nto bridge the gap between abstract user intentions and concrete\nimplementations. We introduce Frontend Diffusion, an end-to-end LLM-powered\ntool that generates high-quality websites from user sketches. The system\nemploys a three-stage task transition process: sketching, writing, and coding.\nWe demonstrate the potential of task transitions to reduce human intervention\nand communication costs in complex tasks. Our work also opens avenues for\nexploring similar approaches in other domains, potentially extending to more\ncomplex, interdependent tasks such as video production.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Uk2ohICkceIpqKoPuODGPWqrMU3bGoIRuTN6mLGlsVY","pdfSize":"48734314","txDigest":"A9ZNb6cS7RopgEkTb6jsvwdSN1Bqz81ykSApuHbnxJqh","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
