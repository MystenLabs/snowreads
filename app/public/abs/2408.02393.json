However, this assumption does not match reality;\nfailing to take dependencies into account can cause models to fail\ndramatically. The field of multi-axis graphical modelling (also called\nmulti-way modelling, Kronecker-separable modelling) has seen growth over the\npast decade, but these models require that the data have zero mean. In the\nmulti-axis case, inference is typically done in the single sample scenario,\nmaking mean inference impossible.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate how the zero-mean assumption can cause\negregious modelling errors, as well as propose a relaxation to the zero-mean\nassumption that allows the avoidance of such errors. Specifically, we propose\nthe \"Kronecker-sum-structured mean\" assumption, which leads to models with\nnonconvex-but-unimodal log-likelihoods that can be solved efficiently with\ncoordinate descent.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
