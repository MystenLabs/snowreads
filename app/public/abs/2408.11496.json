In the Chebyshev case we extend the optimal non-asymptotic lower\nbound previously known only in a handful of examples to regular compact sets\nand a large class weights. Using the non-asymptotic lower bound, we extend\nWidom's asymptotic lower bound for weights bounded away from zero to a large\nclass of weights with zeros including weights with strong zeros and infinitely\nmany zeros. As an application of the asymptotic lower bound we extend\nBernstein's 1931 asymptotics result for weighted Chebyshev polynomials on an\ninterval to arbitrary Riemann integrable weights with finitely many zeros and\nto some continuous weights with infinitely many zeros. In the case of\northogonal polynomials, we derive optimal asymptotic and non-asymptotic lower\nbound on arbitrary regular compact sets for a large class of weights in the\nnon-asymptotic case and for arbitrary Szeg\\H{o} class weights in the asymptotic\ncase, extending previously known bounds on finite gap and Parreau--Widom sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
