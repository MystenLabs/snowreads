However, the\nability to (de)compose tasks is a linchpin in developing robotic systems\ncapable of learning complex behaviors. Yet, compositional reinforcement\nlearning is beset with difficulties, including the high dimensionality of the\nproblem space, scarcity of rewards, and absence of system robustness after task\ncomposition. To surmount these challenges, we view task composition through the\nprism of category theory -- a mathematical discipline exploring structures and\ntheir compositional relationships. The categorical properties of Markov\ndecision processes untangle complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, allowing\nfor strategical reduction of dimensionality, facilitating more tractable reward\nstructures, and bolstering system robustness. Experimental results support the\ncategorical theory of reinforcement learning by enabling skill reduction,\nreuse, and recycling when learning complex robotic arm tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
