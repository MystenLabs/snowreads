To extract the decay amplitudes, a\nthree-point correlation function is defined and calculated at hadron and\nquark-gluon level, respectively. Both the W-exchange and the W-inward emission\ndiagrams are considered in the quark-gluon level calculation, where the\ntwo-particle light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of kaon are used as\nnon-perturbative input. We obtain the decay amplitudes contributed from the\ntwist-2 and twist-3 kaon LCDAs, respectively. The obtained P-wave amplitude is\nconsistent with those predicted in the literature, while the S-wave one is much\nsmaller. This significant difference between the S- and P- wave amplitudes\nleads to small up-down spin asymmetry, closing to the experimental measurement.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
