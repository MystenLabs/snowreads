Using this forcing poset, we prove several consistency\nresults concerning finitely splitting subtrees of Aronszajn trees. For example,\nit is consistent that there exists an infinitely splitting Suslin tree whose\ntopological square is not Lindel\\\"{o}f, which solves an open problem due to\nMarun. For any $2 < n < \\omega$, it is consistent that every $(\\ge \\!\nn)$-splitting normal Aronszajn tree contains a normal $n$-splitting subtree,\nbut there exists a normal infinitely splitting Aronszajn tree which contains no\n$(< \\! n)$-splitting subtree. To show the latter consistency result, we prove a\nforcing iteration preservation theorem related to not adding new\nsmall-splitting subtrees of Aronszajn trees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
