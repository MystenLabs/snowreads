However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a\nsignificant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of\nthe systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a\ngeneral formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory\nkernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into\nauxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the\ncoupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order\nmoments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is\ngeneral, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum\nsystem--the spin-boson model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
