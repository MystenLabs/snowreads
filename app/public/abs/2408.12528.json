Unlike fully autoregressive models, Show-o\nunifies autoregressive and (discrete) diffusion modeling to adaptively handle\ninputs and outputs of various and mixed modalities. The unified model flexibly\nsupports a wide range of vision-language tasks including visual\nquestion-answering, text-to-image generation, text-guided\ninpainting/extrapolation, and mixed-modality generation. Across various\nbenchmarks, it demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing\nindividual models with an equivalent or larger number of parameters tailored\nfor understanding or generation. This significantly highlights its potential as\na next-generation foundation model.
