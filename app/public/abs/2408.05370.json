In online recoloring, there is a fixed set $V$ of $n$ vertices\nand an initial coloring $c_0: V\\rightarrow [k]$ for some $k\\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^{>0}$. Under an online sequence $\\sigma$ of requests where each\nrequest is an edge $(u_t,v_t)$, a proper vertex coloring $c$ of the graph $G_t$\ninduced by requests until time $t$ needs to be maintained for all $t$; i.e.,\nfor any $(u,v)\\in G_t$, $c(u)\\neq c(v)$. The objective is to minimize the total\nweight of vertices recolored for the sequence $\\sigma$.\n  We obtain the first competitive algorithms for capacitated online recoloring\nand fully dynamic recoloring. Our first set of results is for $2$-recoloring\nusing algorithms that are $(1+\\varepsilon)$-resource augmented where\n$\\varepsilon\\in (0,1)$ is an arbitrarily small constant. Our main result is an\n$O(\\log n)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for weighted bipartite graphs,\nwhich is asymptotically optimal in light of an $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower bound\nthat holds for an unbounded amount of augmentation. We also present an $O(n\\log\nn)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for fully dynamic recoloring, which is\noptimal within an $O(\\log n)$ factor in light of a $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound that\nholds for an unbounded amount of augmentation.\n  Our second set of results is for $\\Delta$-recoloring in an\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-overprovisioned setting where the maximum degree of $G_t$ is\nbounded by $(1-\\varepsilon)\\Delta$ for all $t$, and each color assigned to at\nmost $(1+\\varepsilon)\\frac{n}{\\Delta}$ vertices, for an arbitrary $\\varepsilon\n> 0$. Our main result is an $O(1)$-competitive randomized algorithm for $\\Delta\n= O(\\sqrt{n/\\log n})$. We also present an $O(\\Delta)$-competitive deterministic\nalgorithm for $\\Delta \\le \\varepsilon n/2$. Both results are asymptotically\noptimal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
