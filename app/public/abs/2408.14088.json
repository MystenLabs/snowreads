Objective: We compare\nthe perceived usability of two similarly online collaborative modeling tools,\nthe SOCIO chatbot and the Creately web-based tool. Method: We conducted a\ncrossover experiment with 66 participants. The evaluation instrument was based\non the System Usability Scale (SUS). We performed a quantitative and\nqualitative exploration, employing inferential statistics and thematic\nanalysis. Results: The results indicate that chatbots enabling natural language\ncommunication enhance communication and collaboration efficiency and improve\nthe user experience. Conclusion: Chatbots need to improve guidance and help for\nnovices, but they appear beneficial for enhancing user experience.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
