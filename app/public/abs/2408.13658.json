The linear\ndispersion relation is given in an integral representation involving only the\nstandard plasma dispersion function. The wave frequency and growth rate are\nderived without the density inhomogeneity. Numerical solutions of the\ndispersion equation are conducted to show the different effects of the\nsuprathermal ions and electrons. We find that the suprathermal ions can enhance\nthe instability in large wavenumbers but suppress it in small wavenumbers.\nThus, the suprathermalization of ions could be one of the factors leading to a\nlower limit of wavenumbers for the ITG instabilities. Besides, the numerical\ncalculations also imply that the thermal speed ratio affects the intensities of\nthe suprathermal effects. Finally, in the presence of density inhomogeneity,\nthe ITG instability boundary is numerically analyzed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kd1a_BWV25f-iCmGn-BXEPt-KvY1PCmM8xEZ_nDTsi8","pdfSize":"496623"}
