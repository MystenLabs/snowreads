Existing TTA\nmethods often focus on improving recognition performance specifically for test\ndata associated with classes in the training set. However, during the\nopen-world inference process, there are inevitably test data instances from\nunknown classes, commonly referred to as outliers. This paper pays attention to\nthe problem that conducts both sample recognition and outlier rejection during\ninference while outliers exist. To address this problem, we propose a new\napproach called STAble Memory rePlay (STAMP), which performs optimization over\na stable memory bank instead of the risky mini-batch. In particular, the memory\nbank is dynamically updated by selecting low-entropy and label-consistent\nsamples in a class-balanced manner. In addition, we develop a self-weighted\nentropy minimization strategy that assigns higher weight to low-entropy\nsamples. Extensive results demonstrate that STAMP outperforms existing TTA\nmethods in terms of both recognition and outlier detection performance.
