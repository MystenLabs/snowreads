Specifically, we consider the\nhardware impairments and phase noise at transceivers, as well as the phase\nshift errors generated within the STAR-RIS. We commence by introducing the\nSTAR-RIS signal model, channel model, and imperfect hardware components. Then,\nthe linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimate is derived with\npilot contamination, which provides sufficient information for sequential data\nprocessing. Moreover, a channel capacity lower bound is derived in the case of\na finite number of RIS elements and access points (APs), while a closed-form\nexpression for the downlink ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) for maximum ratio\n(MR) precoding is also deduced, where only the channel statistics are used. Our\nnumerical results demonstrate that the STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system achieves\nhigher SE compared to the conventional CF-mMIMO system, even with imperfect\nhardware.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
