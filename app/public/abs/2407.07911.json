We show somehow unexpectedly that linear independence of $S_1$ is\nequivalent to that of $S_k$ for $k=2$ and $3$ under certain rank conditions.\nAmong technical treatments in the proof, of independent conceptual interest is\na novel polynomial identity which elegantly incorporates quadratic forms and\nmatrix determinants.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
