In this paper, a holistic trustworthiness assessment framework for\nultra-wideband self-localization is proposed, including attributes of\nreliability, security, privacy, and resilience. Our goal is to provide guidance\nfor evaluating a system's trustworthiness based on objective evidence,\nso-called trustworthiness indicators. These indicators are carefully selected\nthrough the threat analysis of the particular system. Our approach guarantees\nthat the resulting trustworthiness indicators correspond to chosen real-world\nthreats. Moreover, experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. While the framework is tailored for this\nspecific use case, the process itself serves as a versatile template, which can\nbe used in other applications in the domains of the Internet of Things or\ncyber-physical systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pa27w5ZLlOIILnpQHrkWnxfMtRpyHbceLAxZbriQcQw","pdfSize":"2362272"}
