As a result, the system, with proper initialization, can\nremain in a highly symmetric subset of the state space, where the photon\nemission of each atom constructively interferes with each other, leading to\nsuperradiance at steady state. However, because of the degeneracy of steady\nstates for the driven Dicke model, the steady state can be qualitatively\naltered by an infinitesimal perturbation. In this work, we simulate\nsuperconducting qubits coupled to a 1D waveguide as the extended system and\ntheoretically investigate four kinds of perturbations: local dephasing,\nindividual driving phases, the separation between adjacent qubits, and\nindividual detunings. Using an angular momentum basis, we predict the dimension\nof the degenerate subspace and study the transition within the subspace due to\nthe perturbation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lzYRMngCJxL9JB7B7IAB4aFJFkhLnm1DMhv8vVbAD3A","pdfSize":"819944"}
