Usually, stacking multiple layers can\nimprove the performance of GCN by leveraging information from high-order\nneighbors. However, the increase of the network depth will induce the\nover-smoothing problem, which can be attributed to the quality and quantity of\nneighbors changing: (a) neighbor quality, node's neighbors become overlapping\nin high order, leading to aggregated information becoming indistinguishable,\n(b) neighbor quantity, the exponentially growing aggregated neighbors submerges\nthe node's initial feature by recursively aggregating operations. Current\nsolutions mainly focus on one of the above causes and seldom consider both at\nonce.\n  Aiming at tackling both causes of over-smoothing in one shot, we introduce a\nsimple Two-Sided Constraint (TSC) for GCNs, comprising two straightforward yet\npotent techniques: random masking and contrastive constraint. The random\nmasking acts on the representation matrix's columns to regulate the degree of\ninformation aggregation from neighbors, thus preventing the convergence of node\nrepresentations. Meanwhile, the contrastive constraint, applied to the\nrepresentation matrix's rows, enhances the discriminability of the nodes.\nDesigned as a plug-in module, TSC can be easily coupled with GCN or SGC\narchitectures. Experimental analyses on diverse real-world graph datasets\nverify that our approach markedly reduces the convergence of node's\nrepresentation and the performance degradation in deeper GCN.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
