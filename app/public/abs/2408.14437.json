However, realizing their efficiency\nbenefits requires specialized hardware and a co-design approach that\neffectively leverages sparsity. We explore the hardware-software co-design of\nsparse SNNs, examining how sparsity representation, hardware architectures, and\ntraining techniques influence hardware efficiency. We analyze the impact of\nstatic and dynamic sparsity, discuss the implications of different neuron\nmodels and encoding schemes, and investigate the need for adaptability in\nhardware designs. Our work aims to illuminate the path towards embedded\nneuromorphic systems that fully exploit the computational advantages of sparse\nSNNs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"juI3WktvVuaA1uO3DQ6dnjH3QmamtlfI2LOdSHsiPIU","pdfSize":"555349"}
