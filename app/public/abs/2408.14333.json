Although various chaos indicators are widely\nused in studying nonlinear dynamical systems, including modern particle\naccelerators, it is the first time to use a measurable one in a real-world\nmachine for online nonlinear optimization. Poincar\\'e maps, constructed with\nthe turn-by-turn beam trajectory readings from beam position monitors, are\ncommonly used to observe the nonlinearity in ring-based accelerators. However,\nsuch observations typically only provide a qualitative interpretation. We\nanalyze their entropy to quantify the chaos in measured Poincar\\'e maps. After\nsome canonical transformations on the Poincar\\'e maps, not only can the\ncommonly used nonlinear characterizations be extracted, but more importantly,\nthe chaos can be quantitatively calibrated with Shannon entropy, and then used\nas the online optimization objectives.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G_SefKX0lF7Dd8bXU-zDCNKlcokTpKsag2P67PHUjOo","pdfSize":"4739155"}
