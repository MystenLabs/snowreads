As a corollary, if $A$ is an infinite-dimensional\nseparable simple unital C*-algebra which has stable rank one and strict\ncomparison, $\\alpha\\colon G\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Aut}(A)$ is an action of a\nfinite group $G$ on $A$ with the weak tracial Rokhlin property, then\n$A\\rtimes_\\alpha G$ has stable rank one.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
