This is particularly true for\nmodels of multiphysics flows in the brain, due to the geometrical complexity of\nthe cerebral anatomy - requiring a very fine computational mesh for finite\nelement discretization - and to the high number of variables involved. Indeed,\nthis kind of problems can be modeled by a coupled system encompassing the\nStokes equations for the cerebrospinal fluid in the brain ventricles and\nMultiple-network Poro-Elasticity (MPE) equations describing the brain tissue,\nthe interstitial fluid, and the blood vascular networks at different space\nscales. The present work aims to rigorously derive a posteriori error estimates\nfor the coupled Stokes-MPE problem, as a first step towards the design of\nadaptive refinement strategies or reduced order models to decrease the\ncomputational demand of the problem. Through numerical experiments, we verify\nthe reliability and optimal efficiency of the proposed a posteriori estimator\nand identify the role of the different solution variables in its composition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
