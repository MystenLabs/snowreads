Values near their excitation\nthresholds were extracted from the observed emissivity by rapidly cycling the\nenergy of the exciting electron beam. This allows us to subtract time-dependent\ncontributions of the forbidden $z$-line emission to the multiplet. We develop a\ntime-dependent collisional-radiative model to further demonstrate the method\nand predict all spectral features. We then compare the extracted $x+y+w$\ncross-sections with calculations based on distorted-wave and R-matrix methods\nfrom the literature and our own predictions using the Flexible Atomic Code\n(FAC). All R-matrix results are validated by our measurements of direct and\nresonant excitation, supporting the use of such state-of-the-art codes for\nastrophysical and plasma physics diagnostics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
