{"id":"2408.03848","title":"B Anomalies in Two Higgs Doublet Model with Flavor Symmetry","authors":"Qiaoyi Wen, Fanrong Xu","authorsParsed":[["Wen","Qiaoyi",""],["Xu","Fanrong",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2024 15:44:45 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-08","timestamp":1723045485000,"abstract":"  The long-standing flavor anomalies in $b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ and $b \\to c\n\\ell \\nu$ persist. In this work, we explore a specific flavor-gauged two-Higgs\ndoublet model (FG2HDM) extended by a scalar singlet, with an imposed $U(1)$\nflavor symmetry. Compared to the Standard Model (SM), four additional scalars\nand one neutral gauge boson $Z'$ are added to the particle spectrum. The\nspecial Yukawa coupling matrices, due to the $U(1)$ symmetry, lead to\nflavor-changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) interactions uniquely occurring in the\ndown-type quark sector, while the new gauge boson $Z'$ induces flavor-changing\nneutral current (FCNC) interactions in the down-type quark sector as well. The\ntwo distinct types of anomalies can be accommodated simultaneously in such a\nmodel. Incorporating scalar and vector contributions to $b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$\nand $B_s^0$-$\\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing, along with charged Higgs contributions to $b\n\\to c \\ell \\nu$, we investigate the parameter space in FG2HDM and find\nsubstantial room in the solution space. Specifically, in the SM-like model\nsetup, the data suggests that $m_{Z'} < 450\\, \\text{GeV}$, $\\tan\\beta < 28$,\nand $g'/m_{Z'} > 3.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{GeV}^{-1}$, while there are fewer\nconstraints on heavy scalars, which can be further tested by a combination of\nother observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
