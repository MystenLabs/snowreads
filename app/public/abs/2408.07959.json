Our tracking algorithm is based on a patch searching and\nincludes two steps. We first locate the given point to a patch near a vertex,\nand then the host element is determined within the patch domain. We prove that\nthe patch in the first step can be rapidly identified by constructing an\nauxiliary Cartesian grid with a prescribed resolution. Then, the second step\ncan be converted into a searching problem, which can be easily solved by\nsearching algorithms. Only coordinates to particles are required in our method.\nWe conduct a series of numerical tests in two and three dimensions to\nillustrate the robustness and efficiency in our method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
