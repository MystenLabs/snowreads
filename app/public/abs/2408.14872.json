Our characterization\ngeneralizes various results in the literature, helps to solve identification\nproblems of binary response models, and paves the way for many new\napplications. We apply the result to test the hypothesis that marginal\nhappiness is decreasing in income, a principle that is commonly accepted but so\nfar not established empirically.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
