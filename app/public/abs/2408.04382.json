{"id":"2408.04382","title":"Judgment2vec: Apply Graph Analytics to Searching and Recommendation of\n  Similar Judgments","authors":"Hsuan-Lei Shao","authorsParsed":[["Shao","Hsuan-Lei",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2024 11:37:32 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-09","timestamp":1723117052000,"abstract":"  In court practice, legal professionals rely on their training to provide\nopinions that resolve cases, one of the most crucial aspects being the ability\nto identify similar judgments from previous courts efficiently. However,\nfinding a similar case is challenging and often depends on experience, legal\ndomain knowledge, and extensive labor hours, making veteran lawyers or judges\nindispensable. This research aims to automate the analysis of judgment text\nsimilarity. We utilized a judgment dataset labeled as the \"golden standard\" by\nexperts, which includes human-verified features that can be converted into an\n\"expert similarity score.\" We then constructed a knowledge graph based on\n\"case-article\" relationships, ranking each case using natural language\nprocessing to derive a \"Node2vec similarity score.\" By evaluating these two\nsimilarity scores, we identified their discrepancies and relationships. The\nresults can significantly reduce the labor hours required for legal searches\nand recommendations, with potential applications extending to various fields of\ninformation retrieval.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
