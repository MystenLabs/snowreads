To\naddress this challenge, we introduce two extremely fine-grained visual\nrecognition benchmark datasets that contain very challenging resembling glyphs\n(characters/letters) in the wild to be distinguished. Moreover, we propose a\nsimple yet effective two-stage contrastive learning approach to the extremely\nfine-grained recognition task of resembling glyphs discrimination. In the first\nstage, we utilize supervised contrastive learning to leverage label information\nto warm-up the backbone network. In the second stage, we introduce CCFG-Net, a\nnetwork architecture that integrates classification and contrastive learning in\nboth Euclidean and Angular spaces, in which contrastive learning is applied in\nboth supervised learning and pairwise discrimination manners to enhance the\nmodel's feature representation capability. Overall, our proposed approach\neffectively exploits the complementary strengths of contrastive learning and\nclassification, leading to improved recognition performance on the resembling\nglyphs. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art fine-grained\nclassification approaches under both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and\nTransformer backbones demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
