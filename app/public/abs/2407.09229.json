By a Weierstrass-type function, we mean\nthat in the definition of the well-known Weierstrass function, the power\nfunction is replaced by a submultiplicative function, and the Lipschitz\ncontinuous cosine and sine functions are replaced by a general H\\\"older\ncontinuous function. Our results extend some of the recent results of Schied\nand Zhang (2020, 2024).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
