The mean-flow nonequilibrium is identified by comparing two\ncharacteristic velocities: the friction velocity (u_tau) and the\nviscous-pressure gradient velocity (up). In regions where the pressure gradient\nvelocity is comparable to the friction velocity (up \\sim u_tau, the near-wall\nturbulent closure is modified to include the effect of the pressure-gradient\nand convective terms. The performance of this wall model is evaluated in two\ncanonical flows experiencing smooth body separation: the NASA-Boeing speed bump\nand the Bachalo-Johnson bump. Improvements in the predictive capabilities of\nthe proposed model for the conventional equilibrium wall model are theorized\nand then demonstrated through numerical experiments. In particular, the\nproposed wall model can capture the onset of boundary layer separation observed\nin experiments or DNS calculations at resolutions where the equilibrium wall\nmodel fails to separate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
