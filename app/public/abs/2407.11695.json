We\nfirst show that the Maitra spacetime is the unique non-rigidly (non null shear\nscalar) rotating solution with a regular axis and that is the most general one\nof the field equations. We are also able to demonstrate what Maitra's paper\ndoes not show, where the solution is merely stated without any demonstration.\nThen we find that the non-rigidly rotating spacetimes, not necessarily regular,\ncan be matched, across timelike cylindrical hypersurfaces, to a one-parameter\nfamily of stationary vacuum exteriors given by the Weyl class but not to the\nLewis class, generalizing a result by Bonnor and Steidman. Among other\nproperties, it is shown that the amount of rotating dust packed inside a\ncylinder is bigger if it is rigidly rotating than non-rigidly rotating.\nFinally, we show that in the non-rigidly rotating cases the fluid necessarily\nhas vorticity and the spacetimes are not silent, where the magnetic part of the\nWeyl tensor is non-zero.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
