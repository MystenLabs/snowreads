We exploit the HSMs for\nformulating a variational optimization approach, solving non-regular partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) with non-continuous shock-type solutions. The HSM\ntechnique simultaneously obtains a parametrization of the position and the\nheight of the shocks as well as the solution of the PDE. We show that the HSM\ntechnique circumvents the notorious Gibbs phenomenon, which limits the accuracy\nthat classic numerical methods reach. Numerical experiments, addressing linear\nand non-linearly propagating shocks, demonstrate the strong approximation power\nof the HSM technique.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"rk6Hhug-IkemDMYp6Vo5YMWRYe5BrFxZaOjDcz4j-TQ","pdfSize":"635581","txDigest":"9SSwCxi8gR6Cas4GtXpAeqc43K1qRwBUNSbcKwsPJt3E","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
