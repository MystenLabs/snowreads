In particular, it has been well known that a certain type of\nparametric holomorphy of the PDE solutions allows the application of deep\nneural networks without encountering the curse of dimensionality. This paper\naims to propose a general framework for verifying the desired parametric\nholomorphy by utilizing the bounds on parametric derivatives. The framework is\nillustrated with examples of parametric elliptic eigenvalue problems (EVPs),\nencompassing both linear and semilinear cases. As the results, it will be shown\nthat the ground eigenpairs have the desired holomorphy. Furthermore, under the\nsame conditions, improved bounds for the mixed derivatives of the ground\neigenpairs are derived. These bounds are well known to take a crucial role in\nthe error analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
