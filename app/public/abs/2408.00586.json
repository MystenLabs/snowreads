The Lipschitz constants in both situations\ndraw information solely from function values, and the global Lipschitz modulus\nis found when it exists. Some examples of classes of globally Lipschitz\ncontinuous convex functions beside the norms are also provided along with their\nglobal Lipschitz modulus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
