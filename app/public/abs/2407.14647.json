Every M\\\"obius coefficient is a quotient\nof two sums, each indexed by certain collections of paths in the digraph. Our\nresult contains, as particular cases, previous theorems by Hall (for posets)\nand Leinster (for skeletal categories whose idempotents are identities). A\nbyproduct is a novel expression for the magnitude of a metric space as sum over\nself-avoiding paths with finitely many terms. By means of Berg's formula, our\nmain constructions can be extended to Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses, yielding an\nanalogous combinatorial interpretation of M\\\"obius pseudoinversion and,\nconsequently, of the magnitude of an arbitrary finite category.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
