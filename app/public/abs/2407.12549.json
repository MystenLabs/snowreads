We chirally (i.e.\ndirection-dependently) couple roughly 900 cesium atoms to the forward\npropagating mode of an optical nanofiber. We then prepare the ensemble in the\nmaximally inverted state, where the subsequent collective emission of a burst\nis known as superfluorescence. Here, we observe that second-order coherence\nemerges in the course of the decay. This is a clear feature of the underlying\ncollective dynamics that is also at the origin of the superradiant burst\nitself. We furthermore study the dynamics of the second-order coherence\nfunction of the emission in dependence on the initial average dipole moment of\nthe ensemble. In addition, by correlating the detection of early and late\nphoton emission events, we obtain evidence for fundamental shot-to-shot\nfluctuations in the delay of the start of the burst emission. Our findings\nreveal that, despite the fundamentally different coupling Hamiltonian,\nsuperradiance in cascaded and symmetrically coupled systems feature a\nstrikingly large number of similarities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
