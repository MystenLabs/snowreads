Assuming the\nShafarevich-Tate conjecture, we show that if a semistable principally polarised\nabelian variety $A/\\mathbb{Q}$ satisfies the parity conjecture over\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ and over all quadratic fields, then it satisfies it over all\nnumber fields. More generally, we establish a criterion for when the parity\nconjecture for the base change of an abelian variety to a larger number field\nis already implied by the parity conjecture over the ground field and over\nother small extensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
