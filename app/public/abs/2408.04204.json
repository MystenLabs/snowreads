By applying this technique, we\naim to optimize the evolution of the Hubble parameter from recombination to the\npresent epoch, addressing both tensions simultaneously. To maximize the\ngoodness of fit, our learning technique achieves a fit that surpasses even the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. Our results demonstrate a tendency to weaken both early and\nlate time tensions in a completely model-independent manner.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
