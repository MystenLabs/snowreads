We show that\nboth critical temperature enhancement and suppression can come purely from\ngeometric effects. These include aspects of scattering of electrons on these\ncrystalline defects even when the coupling constant is unchanged. We consider\ntwo dimensional rectangular and three dimensional body centered cubic lattices\nwith onsite s-wave superconducting pairing, nearest and next-to-nearest\nneighbor hoppings. In the considered two dimensional lattice with twin\nboundaries, the superconducting critical temperature associated with twinning\nplanes is suppressed for moderate band filling and enhanced for an almost\nempty/filled band. The superconducting phase diagram is more diverse for the\nthree dimensional lattice, which is caused by the interplay of van Hove\nsingularity, changing coordination number, and modification of distances to\nnearest and next-to-nearest neighbors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
