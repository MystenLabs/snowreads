We study the\ncircular motion of test particles in accretion disk and calculate the radius of\nthe innermost stable circular orbits. Using the steady-state Novikov-Thorne\nmodel we also compute the observational characteristics of such black hole's\naccretion disk and compare our results with the usual Schwarzschild black hole\nin the absence of dark matter fluid. We find that the tangential pressure plays\na significant role in decreasing the size of the innermost stable circular\norbits and thus increases the luminosity of black hole's accretion disk.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
