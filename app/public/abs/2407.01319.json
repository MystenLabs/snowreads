It is shown that in both cases a combined action of the Ising-type\nspin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman field results in appearance of a nonunitary\nsuperconducting triplet correlations with nonzero average Cooper pair spin,\nwhich carry spin current in the presence of a condensate motion. Properties of\nthis dissipationless spin current are investigated. In particular, it is shown\nthat it manifests a rectification effect. In addition, in S/F heterostructures\nthe amplitude and the sign of the spin current are controlled by gating.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yTRw_HYn1kDunBr6Iw_iSJzaSCGFichROWydUvoizYU","pdfSize":"1517403","objectId":"0x6882349639f319d2927c495711887f82ae7cc7d60da6597023de29e1f1f5c7d5","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
