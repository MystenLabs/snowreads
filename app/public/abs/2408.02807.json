Here, the first DM acts causally whereas the second DM\nestimates non-causally. When the vector length grows, we characterize, via a\nsingle-letter expression, the optimal trade-off between the power cost at the\nfirst DM and the estimation cost at the second DM. In this paper, we show that\nthe best linear scheme is achieved by using the time-sharing method between two\naffine strategies, which coincides with the convex envelope of the solution of\nWitsenhausen in 1968. Here also, Witsenhausen's two-point strategy and the\nscheme of Grover and Sahai in 2010 where both devices operate non-causally,\noutperform our best linear scheme. Therefore, gains obtained with block-coding\nschemes are only attainable if all DMs operate non-causally.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
