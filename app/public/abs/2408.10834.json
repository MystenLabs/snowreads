The history of the Lagrangian\nformalism in biology is much shorter, spanning only the last 50 years. In this\npaper, a broad review of the Lagrangian formalism in biology is presented in\nthe context of both its historical and modern developments. Detailed\ndescriptions of different methods to derive Lagrangians for five selected\npopulation dynamics models are given and the resulting Lagrangians are\npresented and discussed. The procedure to use the obtained Lagrangians to gain\nnew biological insights into the evolution of the populations without solving\nthe equations of motion is described and applied to the models. Finally,\nperspectives of the Lagrangian formalism in biology are discussed.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KNnTfF1KQym5kIlos3Big7J5ifL0WCfAyJa7QmPeFY8","pdfSize":"288676"}
