This is accompanied by a shorter nacelle, leaving less\navailable space for acoustic treatments. In this context, a progress in the\nliner technology is highly demanded, prospecting alternative solutions to\nclassic liners. The SALUTE H2020 project has taken up this challenge, proposing\nelectro-active acoustic liners, made up of loudspeakers (actuators) and\nmicrophones (sensors). The electro-active means allow to program the surface\nimpedance on the electroacoustic liner, but also to conceive alternative\nboundary laws. Test-rigs of gradually increasing complexities have allowed to\nraise the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) up to 3-4. In this second part, the\nelectroacoustic liner is adapted to treat the walls at the intake of a scaled\nturbofan nacelle. The performance of the electroacoustic liner demonstrate its\npotentialities for reducing noise radiation from turbofan.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
