We extend an existing\ngeneral model of memristors - the Generalised Metastable Switch Model - to an\nevent-driven setting, eliminating errors associated discrete time\napproximation, as well as offering potential improvements in terms of\ncomputational efficiency for simulation. We introduce the notion of a\nvolatility state variable, to allow for the modelling of memory-dependent and\ndynamic switching behaviour, succinctly capturing and unifying a variety of\nvolatile phenomena present in memristive devices, including state relaxation,\nstructural disruption, Joule heating, and drift acceleration phenomena. We\nsupply a drift dataset for titanium dioxide memristors and introduce a linear\nconductance model to simulate the drift characteristics, motivated by a\nproposed physical model of filament growth. We then demonstrate an approach for\nfitting the parameters of the event-based model to the drift model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sxCYWDYo3kl1300nFA7rhGPzfC_YaswdlUoIYqj13Rk","pdfSize":"2171979"}
