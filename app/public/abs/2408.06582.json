If interpreted as\nprimordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted\nspectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly\nblue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \\simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation\nfor the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete\nEkpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result\nwithout pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with\nconstraints from the current observations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
