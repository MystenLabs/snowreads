However, some of the current lightweight models exhibit poor\nrobustness across different datasets, which hinders their broader adoption.\nThis paper proposes a lightweight and vanilla model called LV-UNet, which\neffectively utilizes pre-trained MobileNetv3-Large models and introduces\nfusible modules. It can be trained using an improved deep training strategy and\nswitched to deployment mode during inference, reducing both parameter count and\ncomputational load. Experiments are conducted on ISIC 2016, BUSI, CVC-\nClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, and Kvair-SEG datasets, achieving better performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art and classic models.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
