This dependency\nrenders the quantum operations involving these gates probabilistic when\nattempting to advance quantum processes within the quantum circuit model. Such\nan approach leads to significant information loss whenever measurements yield\nthe undesired fermion parity. To resolve the problem of wasting information, we\ndevise topological operations that allow for the non-dissipative correction of\ninformation from undesired fermion parity to the desired one. We will use the\nsparse-dense mixed encoding process for the controlled-NOT gate as an example\nto explain how corrections can be implemented without affecting the quantum\ninformation carried by the computational qubits. This correction process can be\napplied {to} either the undesired input qubits or the fermion parity-dependent\nquantum gates, and it works for both Majorana-zero-mode-based and\nMajorana-edge-mode-based topological quantum computation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
