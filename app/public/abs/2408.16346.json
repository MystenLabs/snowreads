Virtual fieldwork is an approach meant to\nenable scientists trained in fieldwork to apply these skills to a virtual\nrepresentation of outcrops that are inaccessible to humans e.g. due to being\nlocated on the seafloor. For this purpose we develop a virtual fieldwork\nsoftware in the game engine and 3D creation tool Unreal Engine. This software\nis developed specifically for a large, spatially immersive environment as well\nas virtual reality using head-mounted displays. It contains multiple options\nfor quantitative measurements of visualized 3D model data. We visualize three\ndistinct real-world datasets gathered by different photogrammetric and\nbathymetric methods as use cases and gather initial feedback from domain\nexperts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
