The Hamiltonian formalism is commonly used in the\ncontext of general relativity. The set of Lagrange multipliers are introduced\nin the formalism, and they are corresponding to the Hamiltonian constraints\nwhich are written in terms of \"weak equality\" - the equality is satisfied if\nthe constraints hold. Follow the low-entropy hypothesis, we postulate a\nmodeling mechanism - a weak equality (of modeling) that holds only on the\nsubspace of the theory space of physical models defined by some modeling\nconstraints. By applying the modeling mechanism, we obtain a specific model of\nmodified gravity under specific modeling conditions. We derive a novel equation\nof modeling from the mechanism, that describes how different gravitational\nmodels emerge. The solution of the modeling equation naturally turns out to be\nthe model of $R^2$-gravity (with additional terms) if ordinary matter is\nnegligible. We also found that this mechanism leads to two models: large-field\ninflation and wave-like dark matter. Interestingly, the wave-like dark matter\nmodel is supported by the most recent observations of Einstein rings.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
