These models are\nenriched by the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions and\nexternal magnetic fields, creating a complex interplay of quantum phenomena.\nThe exploration commences by initializing the system in a superposition of\nspin-coherent states, setting the stage for a nuanced analysis of entanglement\nevolution over time. By employing the negativity metric as the pivotal\ncriterion for assessing entanglement, we gain insights into the subtle\nrelationships between DM interactions, external magnetic fields, and the\nentanglement dynamics within this composite system. Through this comprehensive\ninvestigation, we aim to unravel the intricate dynamics and behaviors that\nemerge from the interplay of these fundamental elements, shedding light on the\nunderlying principles governing quantum entanglement in this context.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
