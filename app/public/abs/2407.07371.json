The main variables are the\nconcentration and the electric potential, whose equation is assigned a Robin BC\nwith a very important physical interpretation. The solvability of both\nequations is studied in different funcional settings, to finally prove the\nwell-posedness of a broken mixed variational formulation. The latter\nformulation opens the opportunity of performing discretization and numerical\nsolution via the Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method, which guarantees\ndiscrete stability thanks to optimal test functions. With only the usual\nassumptions on the data and the discretization, we show that the method herein\nproposed is convergent. This analytical effort complements other recent works\non batttery multiphysics, that have been more modeling and computing oriented,\nand establishes the DPG approach as a valuable tool to contribute toward an\nefficient analysis and design of batteries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
