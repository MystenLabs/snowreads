Using the framework of\nlubrication theory, which posits that drag force scales inversely with the film\nthickness, we explore how particles can achieve finite-time contact despite\ntheoretical predictions of infinite time under constant force. We conduct\nexperiments where a spherical particle settles under gravity and magnetic\nattraction, the latter introducing a spatially varying force. Our findings\nreveal that a spatially varying force significantly alters the settling\ntrajectory, enabling finite-time contact. The results are supported by a simple\nmodel that links hydrodynamic drag and the impact of spatially varying forces.\nFinally, we illustrate that forces can be inferred from kinematic observations.\nIn the future, this may provide insights into biological and microscale systems\nwhere direct force measurements are challenging. Our study demonstrates that\nvarying forces can be harnessed to overcome lubrication barriers, offering\npotential applications in designing self-assembly systems and improving surface\ninteraction processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"FoQNAon2M2f_1mfPMSNadtdCMr5Z16McIpzBAz1xUQw","pdfSize":"21437950"}
