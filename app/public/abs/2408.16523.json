This approach\nsimplifies the MR-UCCSD computation by integrating quantum computing\ntechniques, and reduces its complexity. As a profit of the better MR states,\nour MR-UCCSD approach satisfies systematically the predefined errors below\n10$^{-5}$ Hartree,which is the highest precision of single reference UCCSD\napproach, along the whole bond length with only hundreds of CNOT gates, and\nmeets satisfactory the requirements of both computational precision and quantum\nresource reduction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EP-3p1oBZb3iSv9XiRxtoqd9ZVdJnquMdVgv_sy1jQ8","pdfSize":"290412"}
