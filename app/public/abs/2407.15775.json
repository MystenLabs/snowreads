Rational\napproximation in the uniform norm can be used to convert inverting those\nfractional operators into inverting a series of shifted Laplace operators. Care\nmust be taken in the approximation so that the shifted Laplace operators remain\nsymmetric positive definite, making them better conditioned. In this work, we\nstudy two greedy algorithms for finding rational approximations to such\nfractional operators. The first algorithm improves the orthogonal greedy\nalgorithm discussed in [Li et al., SISC, 2024] by adding one minimization step\nin the uniform norm to the procedure. The second approach employs the weak\nChebyshev greedy algorithm in the uniform norm. Both methods yield\nnon-increasing error. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our\nproposed algorithms, which are also flexible and applicable to other\napproximation problems. Moreover, with effective rational approximations to the\nfractional operator, the resulting algorithms show good performance in\npreconditioning a Darcy-Stokes coupled problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
