Despite its success, AFT is not\nreadily applicable to higher-order definitions. To solve such an issue, we\ndevise a formal mathematical framework employing concepts drawn from Category\nTheory. In particular, we make use of the notion of Cartesian closed category\nto inductively construct higher-order approximation spaces while preserving the\nstructures necessary for the correct application of AFT. We show that this\nnovel theoretical approach extends standard AFT to a higher-order environment,\nand generalizes the AFT setting of arXiv:1804.08335 .\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
