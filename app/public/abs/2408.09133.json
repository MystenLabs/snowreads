In this work design, simulation\nand measurement of a new dual-band slant-polarized MIMO antenna with HPBW (Half\nPower Beam Width) of around 900 are presented. Then, four replicas of the\nproposed antenna set are placed at four different poles (North, South, West and\nEast) to cover 3600 around the vehicle as an omni-directional pattern. In the\nreal world scenario, the proper antenna set is selected to communicate with the\nintended user. Each slant MIMO antenna set consists of two inclined (450) low\nband (LB: 700 to 900 MHz) and two inclined high band (HB: 1.7 to 2.7 GHz)\nlog-periodic antennas. The measured gain of LB and HB antennas are 7 dBi and 8\ndBi, respectively. Great agreement between simulation and measurement results\nconfirms the accuracy of the design and simulation procedures of antenna system\nusing optimization algorithm (Genetic method). The proposed antenna is also\nmeasured in the field for industrial applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
