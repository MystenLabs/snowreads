We\nalso consider the same construction of a quantum code for a general normalized\nButson Hadamard matrix and search for a condition for the quantum code to be a\nstabilizer code.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
