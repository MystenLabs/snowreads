We prove\nthat the associated flow map possesses a positive top Lyapunov exponent and its\nassociated one-point, two-point and projective Markov chains are geometrically\nergodic. For a passive scalar, it follows that such a velocity is a space-time\nsmooth exponentially mixing field, uniformly in the diffusivity coefficient.\nFor a passive vector, it provides an example of a universal ideal (i.e.\nnon-diffusive) kinematic dynamo.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
