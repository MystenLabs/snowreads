We benchmark this method against\nother state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms by learning random two-local thermal\nstates. We perform numerical experiments on systems of up to 12 qubits,\ncomparing our method to learning algorithms that use linear objective\nfunctions, and show that R\\'enyi-ADAPT is capable of constructing shallow\nquantum circuits competitive with existing methods, while the gradients remain\nfavorable resulting from the maximal R\\'enyi divergence loss function.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
