The quasi-particle spectrum consists of gapped low-energy levels\nwhile the high energy modes accumulate at a single point. When the low energy\ngaps are large enough, turning on the local interactions does not effectively\nmix high and low energy modes, leading to the freezing of the dynamical\nevolution. In general, the states within the excited subspace are shielded from\nthe long-range signatures of the model, which are responsible for the low\nenergy extended states, and the dynamics effectively look as if long-range\nhopping were absent. This cooperative shielding mechanism becomes evident in\npresence of disorder. It is shown that shielding and freezing are a universal\nfeature of long-range interacting systems and conjecture that they are related\nto the existence of quasi-stationary states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
