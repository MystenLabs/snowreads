In this work, we\ndemonstrate a heteroatomic Andreev molecule, where two normal artificial atoms\nrealized by quantum dots (QDs) are coupled by a superconducting island (SCI).\nWe show that the two normal atoms strongly hybridize and form a\n3-electron-based molecular state. Our density matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) calculations explain quantitatively the robust binding of electrons. The\ntunability of the structure allows us to drive a quantum phase transition from\nan antiferromagnetic Andreev molecular state to a heteroatomic Andreev molecule\nwith ferromagnetically coupled QDs using simple electrical gating.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
