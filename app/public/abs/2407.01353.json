Strengthening a result by Rademacher, it is shown that a polytopal\nlocal maximizer with a simplicial vertex must be a simplex. A similar statement\nis shown for a centrally symmetric local maximizer with a simplicial vertex: it\nhas to be a cross-polytope. Moreover, we show that a zonotope that maximizes\nthe isotropic constant and that has a cubical zone must be a cube. Finally, we\nconsider the class of zonotopes with at most n+1 generators and determine the\nextremals in this class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
