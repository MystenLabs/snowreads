While 2D image analysis approaches are insufficient for handling the 3D\nfeatures of wounds, existing approaches utilizing 3D reconstruction methods\nhave not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive study on 3D wound reconstruction from consumer-grade videos.\nSpecifically, we introduce the SALVE dataset, comprising video recordings of\nrealistic wound phantoms captured with different cameras. Using this dataset,\nwe assess the accuracy and precision of state-of-the-art methods for 3D\nreconstruction, ranging from traditional photogrammetry pipelines to advanced\nneural rendering approaches. In our experiments, we observe that photogrammetry\napproaches do not provide smooth surfaces suitable for precise clinical\nmeasurements of wounds. Neural rendering approaches show promise in addressing\nthis issue, advancing the use of this technology in wound care practices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jQxFRqkUd-BHSygBpyP1QV0YzgTngZRaBl4Ncr4g8dI","pdfSize":"38625222"}
