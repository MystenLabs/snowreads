To explain the\nnature of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe, three\nright-handed neutrinos and $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interaction are introduced in the\nbulk, in addition to the field contents of the Bento-Branco-Parada model. The\nwave-function profiles in the fifth dimension can suppress dangerous operators\nallowed by symmetries, and the scale of spontaneous CP symmetry breaking can be\nsufficiently large to be consistent with thermal leptogenesis. In this model,\nthe lightest right-handed neutrino serves as dark matter with a mass of\n$\\mathcal{O}(10)$ keV. This small mass and the necessarily small mixing are\nexplained by the exponentially localized wave-function in the fifth dimension\ndue to a bulk mass term. The correct relic abundance is achieved thanks to the\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interaction. The other heavy right-handed neutrinos explain\nthe baryon asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis, with the required CP\nviolating phases generated by interactions involving heavy leptons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
