The exposure change and\nabsence make existing methods generate flickering HDR results. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel paradigm to render HDR frames via completing the absent\nexposure information, hence the exposure information is complete and\nconsistent. Our approach involves interpolating neighbor LDR frames in the time\ndimension to reconstruct LDR frames for the absent exposures. Combining the\ninterpolated and given LDR frames, the complete set of exposure information is\navailable at each time stamp. This benefits the fusing process for HDR results,\nreducing noise and ghosting artifacts therefore improving temporal consistency.\nExtensive experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of\nabsent exposure completing in HDR video rendering.
