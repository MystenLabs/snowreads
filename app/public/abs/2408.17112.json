The development of a wireless\nand authenticated communication system is required to overcome the safety\nthreats and illegal access to the application system/data. The WIA-Comm System\nis the one that provides a bridge to control the devices at the application\nside. It has been designed to provide security by giving control rights only to\nthe device whose MAC (physical) address has already been registered, so only\nauthorized users can control the system. LoRa WAN technology has been used for\nwireless communication and Arduino IDE to develop the code for the required\nfunctionality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EosDS4OJlCVsL3ANZJiVouBQTYHX_WFNXADY2QtGPh4","pdfSize":"500629"}
