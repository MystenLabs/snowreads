Intuitionistic FCMs (iFCMs) have been\nproposed as an extension of FCMs offering a natural mechanism to assess the\nquality of their output through the estimation of hesitancy, a concept\nresembling to human hesitation in decision making. To address the challenge of\ninterpretable image classification, this paper introduces a novel framework,\nnamed Interpretable Intuitionistic FCM (I2FCM) which is domain-independent,\nsimple to implement, and can be applied on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nmodels, rendering them interpretable. To the best of our knowledge this is the\nfirst time iFCMs are applied for image classification. Further novel\ncontributions include: a feature extraction process focusing on the most\ninformative image regions; a learning algorithm for data-driven determination\nof the intuitionistic fuzzy interconnections of the iFCM; an inherently\ninterpretable classification approach based on image contents. In the context\nof image classification, hesitancy is considered as a degree of inconfidence\nwith which an image is categorized to a class. The constructed iFCM model\ndistinguishes the most representative image semantics and analyses them\nutilizing cause-and-effect relations. The effectiveness of the introduced\nframework is evaluated on publicly available datasets, and the experimental\nresults confirm that it can provide enhanced classification performance, while\nproviding interpretable inferences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
