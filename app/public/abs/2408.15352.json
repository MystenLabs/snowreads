We focus on discrete imprecise copulas that are in correspondence with\nthe Alternating Sign Matrices and provide some construction techniques of dual\npairs. Additionally, we show how to obtain (full-domain) self-dual imprecise\ncopulas through patchwork techniques. We further investigate the properties of\nthe constructed dual pairs and prove that they are coherent and avoiding sure\nloss.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
