In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalized cubic\npartitions and prove a number of new congruences akin to the classical\nRamanujan-type. We emphasize two methods of proofs, one elementary (relying\nsignificantly on functional equations) and the other based on modular forms. We\nclose by proving analogous results for generalized overcubic partitions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
