In\nexisting literature, the detuning of the two-photon drive is assumed to be zero\nfor implementing single and multi-qubit gates. We explore a modification of the\nHamiltonian for a range of detuning and demonstrate that high fidelity single\nqubit gates can be performed even by proper parameter matching. We also analyze\nthe CNOT gate in presence of an approximate detuning term and explain its\nfidelity improvements through Shortcut to Adiabaticity corrections.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
