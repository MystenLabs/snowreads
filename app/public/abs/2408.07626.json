It consists of bacteria embedded in an\nextracellular polymeric substance (EPS) that functions as a protective barrier.\nQuorum sensing (QS) is a method of bacterial communication, where autoinducers\n(AIs) propagate via diffusion through the EPS and water channels within the\nbiofilm. This diffusion process is anisotropic due to varying densities between\nthe EPS and water channels. This study introduces a 2D anisotropic diffusion\nmodel for molecular communication (MC) within biofilms, analyzing information\npropagation between a point-to-point transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) in\nbounded space. The channel impulse response is derived using Green's function\nfor concentration (GFC) and is validated with particle-based simulation (PBS).\nThe outcomes reveal similar results for both isotropic and anisotropic\ndiffusion when the TX is centrally located due to symmetry. However,\nanisotropic conditions lead to greater diffusion peaks when the TX is\npositioned off-center. Additionally, the propagation of AIs is inversely\nproportional to both overall biofilm size and and diffusion coefficient values.\nIt is hypothesized that anisotropic diffusion supports faster responses to\nhostile environmental changes because signals can propagate faster from the\nedge of the biofilm to the center.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
