A typical example is where one wishes to\ninvestigate treatment effects. Here we propose a new Bayesian approach based on\nrestricted mean survival times (RMST). A nonparametric prior is specified for\nthe underlying survival functions: this extends the standard univariate neutral\nto the right processes to a multivariate setting and induces a prior for the\nRMST's. We rely on a representation as exponential functionals of compound\nsubordinators to determine closed form expressions of prior and posterior mixed\nmoments of RMST's. These results are used to approximate functionals of the\nposterior distribution of RMST's and are essential for comparing\ntime--to--event data arising from different samples.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
