Based on properties of SSD set system, we derive the following (I) to\n(IV):\n  (I) For a nonnegative integer $k$ and a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|\\ge2$, let\n$X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_q\\subsetneq V$ denote all maximal proper subsets of $V$ that\ninduce $k$-edge-connected subgraphs. Then at least one of (a) and (b) holds:\n(a) $\\{X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_q\\}$ is a partition of $V$; and (b) $V\\setminus X_1,\nV\\setminus X_2,\\dots,V\\setminus X_q$ are pairwise disjoint.\n  (II) For a strongly-connected (i.e., $k=1$) digraph $G$, we show that whether\n$V$ is in (a) and/or (b) can be decided in $O(n+m)$ time and that we can\ngenerate all such $X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_q$ in $O(n+m+|X_1|+|X_2|+\\dots+|X_q|)$ time,\nwhere $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$.\n  (III) For a digraph $G$, we can enumerate in linear delay all vertex subsets\nof $V$ that induce strongly-connected subgraphs.\n  (IV) A digraph is Hamiltonian if there is a spanning subgraph that is\nstrongly-connected and in the case (a).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
