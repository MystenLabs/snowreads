The\nkinematical reduction of the model to lower dimensional domains leaves its\nfundamental degrees of freedom intact. Consequently, the degrees of freedom\nintrinsically agree even at the interface with a domain of a different\ndimensionality. Thus, this approach circumvents the need for intermediate\nfinite elements or mortar methods. We introduce the derivations of all models\nof various dimensions using tangential differential calculus. The coupling\nitself is then achieved by defining a mixed-dimensional action functional with\nconsistent Sobolev trace operators. Finally, we present numerical examples\ninvolving a three-dimensional silicone-rubber block reinforced with a curved\ngraphite shell on its lower surface, a three-dimensional silver block\nreinforced with a graphite plate and beams, and lastly, intersecting silver\nshells reinforced with graphite beams.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ba7w4TY52MrxHvPFs9qBbvCndqtHvZWyJS5Wq48EIW0","pdfSize":"6308223"}
