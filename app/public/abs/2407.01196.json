Here we propose a novel scheme\nthat achieves a scalable n-ion-2n-qubit quantum processor utilizing four\ninternal levels of each ion, and experimentally implement a 1-ion-2-qubit\nuniversal processor using the valence electron spin and nuclear spin of a\nsingle 171Yb+ ion. Fidelities of single-qubit and two-qubit gates are around\n0.98 obtained by quantum process tomography. Additionally, the Grover's\nalgorithm is implemented with a successful rate exceeding 0.99. We provide\nexplicit scaling-up protocols based on standard laser-less and laser-based\nframeworks, and further demonstrate that the electron/nuclear-spin scheme\nallows less demanding two-qubit entangling gates between different ions. The\nreplacement of some inter-atomic gates by intra-atomic gates could increase the\nfidelity of some quantum circuits. Our work paves the way towards achieving\n2n-times increase in the size of quantum computational Hilbert space with n\nions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
