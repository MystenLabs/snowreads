Incomprehensibility, however, is not an\noption for the use of (deep) reinforcement learning in the real world, as\nunpredictable actions can seriously harm the involved individuals. In this\nwork, we propose a genetic programming framework to generate explanations for\nthe decision-making process of already trained agents by imitating them with\nprograms. Programs are interpretable and can be executed to generate\nexplanations of why the agent chooses a particular action. Furthermore, we\nconduct an ablation study that investigates how extending the domain-specific\nlanguage by using library learning alters the performance of the method. We\ncompare our results with the previous state of the art for this problem and\nshow that we are comparable in performance but require much less hardware\nresources and computation time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"92AJxa1fTmv0WOM0kYHEqAKwiJCiddAeN943zXQ0XIc","pdfSize":"800165"}
