Traditional calibration methods\nare computationally intensive, requiring iterative, derivative-free\noptimization algorithms that often take hours or days to converge.\n  This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel, efficient, and\neffective calibration method for an L4-L5 IVD FE model using a neural network\n(NN) surrogate. The NN surrogate predicts simulation outcomes with high\naccuracy, outperforming other machine learning models, and significantly\nreduces the computational cost associated with traditional FE simulations.\nNext, a Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) approach guided by gradients of the NN\nsurrogate is proposed to efficiently calibrate FE models. Our method explicitly\nenforces feasibility with a projection step, thus maintaining material bounds\nthroughout the optimization process.\n  The proposed method is evaluated against state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithm\n(GA) and inverse model baselines on synthetic and in vitro experimental\ndatasets. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on synthetic data,\nachieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.06 compared to the baselines' MAE of\n0.18 and 0.54, respectively. On experimental specimens, our method outperforms\nthe baseline in 5 out of 6 cases. Most importantly, our approach reduces\ncalibration time to under three seconds, compared to up to 8 days per sample\nrequired by traditional calibration. Such efficiency paves the way for applying\nmore complex FE models, enabling accurate patient-specific simulations and\nadvancing spinal treatment planning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
