We\nuse irreducible level zero supercuspidal representations to show that these two\nnotions of Speh representations associated to cuspidal representations are\nrelated via a commutative diagram, and that their corresponding $(k,c)$\n$\\psi$-Whittaker models are also related. We use these results to relate the\nlocal Ginzburg-Kaplan integrals for level zero supercuspidal representations to\ntheir finite field counterparts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
