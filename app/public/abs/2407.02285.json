Some prior\nworks pose imaging as an inverse problem. This approach can yield high image\nquality with few transmits, but requires a very fine image grid and is not\nrobust to changes in measurement model parameters. We present INverse grid-Free\nEstimation of Reflectivities (INFER), an off-grid and stochastic algorithm that\nsolves the inverse scattering problem in ultrasound imaging. Our method jointly\noptimizes for the locations of the gridpoints, their reflectivities, and the\nmeasurement model parameters such as the speed of sound. This approach allows\nus to use significantly fewer gridpoints, while obtaining better contrast and\nresolution and being more robust to changes in the imaging target and the\nhardware. The use of stochastic optimization enables solving for multiple\ntransmissions simultaneously without increasing the required memory or\ncomputational load per iteration. We show that our method works across\ndifferent imaging targets and across different transmit schemes and compares\nfavorably against other beamforming and inverse solvers.
