To this end, we present our spatial augmented reality system\nARCADE, which can be utilized like a conventional monitor for displaying\nvirtual agents as well as additional content. With its optical-see-through\ndisplay, ARCADE creates the illusion of the agent being in the room similarly\nto a human. The applicability of our system is demonstrated in two different\ndialogue scenarios, which are included in the video accompanying this paper at\nhttps://youtu.be/9nH4c4Q-ooE.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
