This method paves the way for optimal arithmetic reducibility\nresults for such cocycles, thereby resolving Jitomirskaya's conjecture. From a\nspectral perspective, it leads to optimal arithmetic Anderson localization for\na class of quasiperiodic long-range operators on higher-dimensional lattices.\nIn particular, using structured quantitative almost reducibility, we establish\na sharp quantitative version of Aubry duality, enabling us to uncover new\nspectral insights for almost Mathieu operators with Diophantine frequencies.\nFor example, we precisely determine the exponential decay rate of spectral gaps\nin non-critical cases, thus addressing a question raised by Goldstein.\nAdditionally, we reveal the optimal asymptotic growth of extended\neigenfunctions for subcritical almost Mathieu operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
