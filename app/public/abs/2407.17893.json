We showed our participants common watch face micro visualizations\nincluding date, time, weather information, and four complications showing\nprogress charts of fitness data. Our findings suggest that while walking\ntrajectories did not significantly affect reading performance, overall walking\nactivity, especially at high speeds, hurt reading accuracy and, to some extent,\nresponse time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pTTwfUe1nKrgpQ5SzA0LCQMHns2Flg6_xdLs1rSix0M","pdfSize":"984150","objectId":"0x97bf468aff36627f1231f612d9354a63d11bc2c654a944ea3e2e5be718d0cdd6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
