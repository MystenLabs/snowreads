In order to\nstructure the exploration, however, the number of tuples considered needs to\ngrow exponentially as the search progresses. We propose a new novelty\ntechnique, classical count-based novelty, which aims to explore the state space\nwith a constant number of tuples, by leveraging the frequency of each tuple's\nappearance in a search tree. We then justify the mechanisms through which lower\ntuple counts lead the search towards novel tuples. We also introduce\nalgorithmic contributions in the form of a trimmed open list that maintains a\nconstant size by pruning nodes with bad novelty values. These techniques are\nshown to complement existing novelty heuristics when integrated in a classical\nsolver, achieving competitive results in challenging benchmarks from recent\nInternational Planning Competitions. Moreover, adapting our solver as the\nfrontend planner in dual configurations that utilize both memory and time\nthresholds demonstrates a significant increase in instance coverage, surpassing\ncurrent state-of-the-art solvers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
