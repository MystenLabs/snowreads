Here, we extend this\ncorrespondence to theories with dynamical degrees of freedom. We show that\nthree-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group\n$\\operatorname{SL}(2,\\mathbb R)$ is equivalent to the first-order formulation\nof three-dimensional Einstein gravity with no cosmological constant coupled to\na background stress-energy tensor density (which breaks the diffeomorphism\nsymmetry). The local degree of freedom of three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory\ncorresponds to degenerate \"gravitational waves\" in which the metric is\ndegenerate and the spin connection is no longer completely determined by the\nmetric. Turning on a cosmological constant produces the third-way (for\n$\\Lambda<0$) or the imaginary third-way (for $\\Lambda>0$) gauge theories with a\nbackground stress-energy tensor density.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
