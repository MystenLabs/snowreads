This occurs\ncommonly in practice -- we argue that the additional information is important\nfor prediction, and call this task \"augmented PU prediction\". We allow for\nlabeling to be feature dependent. In such scenario, Bayes classifier and its\nrisk is established and compared with a risk of a classifier which for\nunlabeled data is based only on predictors. We introduce several variants of\nthe empirical Bayes rule in such scenario and investigate their performance. We\nemphasise dangers (and ease) of applying classical classification rule in the\naugmented PU scenario -- due to no preexisting studies, an unaware researcher\nis prone to skewing the obtained predictions. We conclude that the variant\nbased on recently proposed variational autoencoder designed for PU scenario\nworks on par or better than other considered variants and yields advantage over\nfeature-only based methods in terms of accuracy for unlabeled samples.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"n1l2j6BpYQzUhzZOD8rcZ86M1CVpXFblSLDIBfMlWPY","pdfSize":"803710"}
