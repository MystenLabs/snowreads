We introduce FragPT2: a novel embedding\nframework that addresses multiple interacting active fragments. Fragments are\nassigned separate active spaces, constructed by localizing canonical molecular\norbitals. Each fragment is then solved with a multi-reference method,\nself-consistently embedded in the mean field from other fragments. Finally,\ninter-fragment correlations are reintroduced through multi-reference\nperturbation theory. Our framework provides an exhaustive classification of\ninter-fragment interaction terms, offering a tool to analyze the relative\nimportance of various processes such as dispersion, charge transfer, and spin\nexchange. We benchmark FragPT2 on challenging test systems, including \\ce{N_2}\ndimers, multiple aromatic dimers, and butadiene. We demonstrate that our method\ncan be succesful even for fragments defined by cutting through a covalent bond.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
