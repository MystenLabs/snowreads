Twin beams with tight spatial correlations detected by an\nintensified CCD camera with high spatial resolution are used to prepare the\ninitial fields. Up to three photons are added or subtracted to arrive at the\nnonclassical and non-Gaussian states. Only the photon-subtracted thermal states\nremain classical. In general, the experimental photon-added states exhibit\ngreater nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity than the comparable\nphoton-subtracted states. Once photons are added or subtracted in twin beams,\nboth processes result in comparable properties of the obtained states owing to\ntwin-beam photon pairing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
