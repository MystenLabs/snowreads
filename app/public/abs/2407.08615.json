Neural\noperators are a new type of models that can map between function spaces,\nallowing trained models to emulate the solution operators of PDEs. This paper\nintroduces a novel Fourier neural operator with a multigrid architecture\n(MgFNO). The MgFNO combines the frequency principle of deep neural networks\n(DNNs) with the multigrid idea for solving linear systems. To speed up the\ntraining process of the FNO, a three-layer V-cycle multigrid architecture is\nused. This architecture involves training the model multiple times on a coarse\ngrid and then transferring it to a fine grid to accelerate the training of the\nmodel. The DNN-based solver learns the solution from low to high frequency,\nwhile the multigrid method acquires the solution from high to low frequency.\nNote that the FNO is a resolution-invariant solution operator, therefore the\ncorresponding calculations are greatly simplified. Finally, experiments are\nconducted on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed MgFNO outperforms the traditional Fourier\nneural operator.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
