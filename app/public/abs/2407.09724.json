This\nmotivates the need for rigorous modeling of the Hawking emission spectrum.\nUsing semi-classical arguments, Page [Phys. Rev. D 16, 2402 (1977)] showed that\nthe emission of electrons and positrons is altered due to the black hole\nacquiring an equal and opposite charge to the emitted particle. The Poisson\nfluctuations of emitted particles cause the charge $Z|e|$ to random walk, but\nsince acquisition of charge increases the probability of the black hole\nemitting another charged particle of the same sign, the walk is biased toward\n$Z=0$, and $P(Z)$ approaches an equilibrium probability distribution with\nfinite variance $\\langle Z^2\\rangle$. This paper explores how this ``stochastic\ncharge'' phenomenon arises from quantum electrodynamics (QED) on a\nSchwarzschild spacetime. We prove that (except for a small Fermi blocking term)\nthe semi-classical variance $\\langle Z^2 \\rangle$ agrees with the variance of a\nquantum operator $\\langle \\hat{\\cal Z}^2 \\rangle$, where $\\hat{\\cal Z}$ may be\nthought of as an ``atomic number'' that includes the black hole as well as\ncharge near it (weighted by a factor of $2M/r$). In QED, the fluctuations in\n$\\hat{\\cal Z}$ do not arise from the black hole itself (whose charge remains\nfixed), but rather as a collective effect in the Hawking-emitted particles\nmediated by the long-range electromagnetic interaction. We find the rms charge\n$\\langle Z^2\\rangle^{1/2}$ asymptotes to 3.44 at small PBH masses $M \\lesssim\n2\\times 10^{16}\\,$g, declining to 2.42 at $M=5.2\\times 10^{17}\\,$g.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
