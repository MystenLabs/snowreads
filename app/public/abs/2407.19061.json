Positive semidefiniteness is a physical\nrequirement of density matrices, imposing nonnegative probabilities of\nmeasuring physical values. Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some\nbipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that\ncannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that\nbreaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a\nnegative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the\nconstruction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but\nlocal when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent\nnonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative\nquasi-probabilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
