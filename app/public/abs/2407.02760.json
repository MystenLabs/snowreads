Recent work on shape-based\nmodels inspired by dense epithelia have suggested a possible ``topological\nsharpening'' effect, by which four-fold vertices spatially coordinated along a\ncellular interface lead to a cusp-like restoring force acting on cells at the\ninterface, which in turn greatly suppresses interfacial fluctuations. We\nrevisit these interfacial fluctuations, focusing on the distinction between\nshort length scale reduction of interfacial fluctuations and long length scale\nrenormalized surface tension. To do this, we implement a spectrally resolved\nanalysis of fluctuations over extremely long simulation times. This leads to\nmore quantitative information on the topological sharpening effect, in which\nthe degree of sharpening depends on the length scale over which it is measured.\nWe compare our findings with a Brownian bridge model of the interface, and\nclose by analyzing existing experimental data in support of the role of\nshort-length-scale topological sharpening effects in real biological systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
