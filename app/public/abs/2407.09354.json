On one hand we prove that the Moreau's\nsweeping process driven by a uniformly prox-regular moving set with local\nbounded retraction has a unique solution provided that the coefficient of\nprox-regularity is larger than the size of any jump of the driving set. On the\nother hand we show how the case of local bounded retraction can be easily\nreduced to the $1$-Lipschitz continuous case: indeed we first solve the\nLipschitz continuous case by means of the so called ``catching-up algorithm\",\nand we reduce the local bounded retraction case to the Lipschitz one by using a\nreparametrization technique for functions with values in the family of\nprox-regular sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
