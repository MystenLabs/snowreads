It is\noften necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a\nparametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of\nthis PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is\ntime-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose\na framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios\nby meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base\ndistribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs\nunder different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of\nthe proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling,\nstochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the\nproposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter\nregimes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
