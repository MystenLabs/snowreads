Despite extensive research on\ndeveloping automated models to support decision-making in content moderation,\nthere remains a notable scarcity of studies that integrate the rules of online\ncommunities into content moderation. This study addresses this gap by proposing\na community rule-based content moderation framework that directly integrates\ncommunity rules into the moderation of user-generated content. Our experiment\nresults with datasets collected from two domains demonstrate the superior\nperformance of models based on the framework to baseline models across all\nevaluation metrics. In particular, incorporating community rules substantially\nenhances model performance in content moderation. The findings of this research\nhave significant research and practical implications for improving the\neffectiveness and generalizability of content moderation models in online\ncommunities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
