The first is strange-quark tagging, in\nparticular distinguishing strange-quark jets from down-quark jets. The second,\nwhich we term fragmentation tagging, involves identifying the fragmentation\nchannel of a quark. We exemplify the latter by training neural networks to\ndifferentiate between bottom jets containing a bottom baryon and those\ncontaining a bottom meson. The common challenge in these two problems is that\nneither quark lifetimes and masses nor parton showering provide discriminating\ntools, making it necessary to rely on differences in the distributions of the\nhadron types contained in each type of jet and their kinematics. For these\nclassification tasks, we employ variations of Graph Attention Networks and the\nParticle Transformer, which receive jet and all constituent properties as\ninputs. We compare their performance to a simple Multilayer Perceptron that\nuses simple variables. We find that the more sophisticated architectures do not\nimprove $s$-quark versus $d$-quark jet differentiation by a significant amount,\nbut they do lead to a significant gain in $b$-baryon versus $b$-meson jet\ndifferentiation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_6PkQ1FfGmHWZ4HzmKnWNysV5Cdj-jLhre3h_loRBh0","pdfSize":"2410489"}
