Under fairly general\nassumptions, we provide a characterization of the dominant term of the\nasymptotic expansion of the eigenvalue variation in this abstract setting. Many\nof the results about quantitative spectral stability available in the\nliterature can be recovered by our analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate our\nresult with several applications, e.g. quantitative spectral stability for a\nRobin to Neumann problem, conformal transformations of Riemann metrics,\nDirichlet forms under the removal of sets of small capacity, and for families\nof pseudo-differentials operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
