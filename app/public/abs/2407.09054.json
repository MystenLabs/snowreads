The material parameter identification\nprocedure is firstly presented in details, and the simulated results are highly\nconsistent with experimental ones, especially in terms of stress drop\nmagnitudes and PLC band widths. The distribution of simulated stress drop\nmagnitudes at a constant tensile velocity (0.01 mm/s) follows a normal\ndistribution and its peak value is in the range of 26-28 MPa. Furthermore, the\nsimulated band width slightly fluctuates with the increase of true strain and\nits average value is about 1.5 mm. Besides, the staircase behavior of\nstrain-time curves and the hopping propagation of the PLC band are observed in\nTi-12Mo alloy tensile process, which are related to the strain localization and\nstress drop magnitudes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
