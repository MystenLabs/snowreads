It is found that the dynamical friction force is\nsignificantly affected by the topological charge of the vortex structure of the\nBEC core with the strongest effect at distances near the galactic center. It is\nalso shown that the ultralight dark matter self-interaction plays an important\nrole in studying the dynamical friction.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
