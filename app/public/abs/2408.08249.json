We follow the crossover from ballistic to diffusive transport\nabove a scale set by the scattering length, finding the intuitive result that\nthe diffusion constant scales as $D \\propto 1/\\rho$ at low densities $\\rho$.\nOur numerical approach generalizes the Dissipation-Assisted Operator Evolution\n(DAOE) algorithm: in the spirit of the BBGKY hierarchy, we effectively\napproximate non-local operators by their ensemble averages, rather than\ndiscarding them entirely. This greatly reduces the operator entanglement\nentropy, while still giving accurate predictions for diffusion constants across\nall density scales. We further construct a minimal model for the transport\ncrossover, yielding charge correlation functions which agree well with our\nnumerical data. Our results clarify the dominant contributions to hydrodynamic\ncorrelation functions of conserved densities, and serve as a guide for\ngeneralizations to low temperature transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N1cehlcbQ71CQOGQfHk9_FfTP7miKHkoaMXkg1mKeyQ","pdfSize":"1538587"}
