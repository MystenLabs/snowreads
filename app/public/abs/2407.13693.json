CBFkit is optimized for speed using JAX for automatic differentiation\nand jaxopt for quadratic program solving. The toolbox supports various robotic\napplications, including autonomous navigation, human-robot interaction, and\nmulti-robot coordination. The toolbox also offers a comprehensive library of\nplanner, controller, sensor, and estimator implementations. Through a series of\nexamples, we demonstrate the enhanced capabilities of CBFkit in different\nrobotic scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
