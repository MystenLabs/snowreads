However, the complexity of AI systems has also exposed their\nvulnerabilities, necessitating robust methods for failure analysis (FA) and\nfault injection (FI) to ensure resilience and reliability. Despite the\nimportance of these techniques, there lacks a comprehensive review of FA and FI\nmethodologies in AI systems. This study fills this gap by presenting a detailed\nsurvey of existing FA and FI approaches across six layers of AI systems. We\nsystematically analyze 160 papers and repositories to answer three research\nquestions including (1) what are the prevalent failures in AI systems, (2) what\ntypes of faults can current FI tools simulate, (3) what gaps exist between the\nsimulated faults and real-world failures. Our findings reveal a taxonomy of AI\nsystem failures, assess the capabilities of existing FI tools, and highlight\ndiscrepancies between real-world and simulated failures. Moreover, this survey\ncontributes to the field by providing a framework for fault diagnosis,\nevaluating the state-of-the-art in FI, and identifying areas for improvement in\nFI techniques to enhance the resilience of AI systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
