The non-crossing property of shortest paths in planar\ngraphs gives rise to Monge matrices; the min-plus product of $n\\times n$ Monge\nmatrices can be computed in $O(n^2)$ time. Grid graphs arising in sequence\nalignment problems, such as longest common subsequence or longest increasing\nsubsequence, are even more structured. Tiskin [SODA'10] modeled their behavior\nusing simple unit-Monge matrices and showed that the min-plus product of such\nmatrices can be computed in $O(n\\log n)$ time. Russo [SPIRE'11] showed that the\nmin-plus product of arbitrary Monge matrices can be computed in time\n$O((n+\\delta)\\log^3 n)$ parameterized by the core size $\\delta$, which is\n$O(n)$ for unit-Monge matrices.\n  In this work, we provide a linear bound on the core size of the product\nmatrix in terms of the core sizes of the input matrices and show how to solve\nthe core-sparse Monge matrix multiplication problem in $O((n+\\delta)\\log n)$\ntime, matching the result of Tiskin for simple unit-Monge matrices. Our\nalgorithm also allows $O(\\log \\delta)$-time witness recovery for any given\nentry of the output matrix. As an application of this functionality, we show\nthat an array of size $n$ can be preprocessed in $O(n\\log^3 n)$ time so that\nthe longest increasing subsequence of any sub-array can be reconstructed in\n$O(l)$ time, where $l$ is the length of the reported subsequence; in\ncomparison, Karthik C. S. and Rahul [arXiv'24] recently achieved\n$O(l+n^{1/2}\\log^3 n)$-time reporting after $O(n^{3/2}\\log^3 n)$-time\npreprocessing. Our faster core-sparse Monge matrix multiplication also enabled\nreducing two logarithmic factors in the running times of the recent algorithms\nfor edit distance with integer weights [Gorbachev & Kociumaka, arXiv'24].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
