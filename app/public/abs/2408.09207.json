Traditional models predominantly focus on\npristine conditions, an idealisation that overlooks common environmental\nirregularities such as the presence of particulate matter on water surfaces. To\naddress this shortfall, our research examines the dynamic interactions between\nsurface particulate matter and cavitation bubbles using floating spheres and\nspark bubbles. We unveil five novel jet modes, charting a new trajectory away\nfrom classical models and demonstrating the enhanced variability in jet\ndynamics. We observe that particulates significantly lower the energy threshold\nfor jet formation, showing enhanced sensitivity to the presence of\nparticulates. The phase diagram and analyses illustrate how the interplay\nbetween the dimensionless spark bubble depth and the dimensionless chasing time\nbetween water and particulate influences the jet modes development, from\nsingular streams to complex cavity forms. These insights not only advance our\nunderstanding of jet formation, but also unlock the potential for refined jet\nmanipulation across a broad range of physical, environmental, and medical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
