We begin with\na systematic study of p.d. B(H)-valued kernels and the associated of H-valued\nGaussian processes, together with their correlation and transfer operators. In\nour consideration of B(H)-valued kernels, we drop the p.d. assumption. We show\nthat input-output models can be computed for systems of signed kernels taking\nthe precise form of realizability via associated transfer block matrices (of\noperators analogous to the realization transforms in systems theory), i.e.,\nrepresented via 2\\times2 operator valued block matrices. In the context of\nB(H)-valued kernels we present new results on regression with H-valued Gaussian\nprocesses.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uRNqv3FrR-af26ltsmiNZydw2Z4vpM0yp922kIcZ-PA","pdfSize":"262693"}
