This work presents a novel Bayesian nowcasting model\ndesigned to accurately model and predict the number of IBNR data breach\nincidents. Leveraging a Bayesian modeling framework, the model integrates time\nand heterogeneous effects to enhance predictive accuracy. Synthetic and\nempirical studies demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model,\nhighlighting its efficacy in addressing the complexities of IBNR estimation.\nFurthermore, we examine reserve estimation for IBNR incidents using the\nproposed model, shedding light on its implications for actuarial practice.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XhkL9RWF6Vb_4C0CFPEljtIXNFNQqn22sAHnybWtrIY","pdfSize":"1146911"}
