We decided to\nlimit the article to 1-sided CAD to make it more accessible, but the proof can\neasily extended to more general setting as long as we have a rich elliptic\ntheory and the domain is 1-sided NTA.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
