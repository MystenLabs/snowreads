In particular, spin-polarized antiferromagnetic metals can be\nuseful as active spintronics materials because of their high electrical and\nthermal conductivities and their ability to host strong interactions between\ncharge transport and magnetic spin textures. We review spin and charge\ntransport phenomena in spin-polarized antiferromagnetic metals, in which the\ninterplay of metallic conductivity and spin-split bands offers novel practical\napplications and new fundamental insights into antiferromagnetism. We focus on\nthree types of antiferromagnets: canted antiferromagnets, noncollinear\nantiferromagnets, and collinear altermagnets. We also discuss how the\ninvestigation of spin-polarized antiferromagnetic metals can open doors to\nfuture research directions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
