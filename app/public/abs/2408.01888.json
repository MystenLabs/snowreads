Two data\nsources are combined in the proposed transit equity analysis: on-board\nridership surveys and passenger origin-destination data. The spatial unit of\nour proposed transit equity analysis is census blocks, which are relatively\nstable over time and allows an exploration of the data that is granular enough\nto make conclusions about the service convenience various communities are\nfacing. A case study in the Greater Boston area using real data from the\nMassachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) bus network demonstrates a\nsignificant difference in transit service convenience, measured by number of\ntransfers per unit distance, transfer wait time and travel time per unit\ndistance, between low-income riders and high income riders. Implications of\nanalysis results to transit agencies are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yztMcn8AW4sTs60zHZxemutukU75OF3fwbbBuNmY8xE","pdfSize":"7886165"}
