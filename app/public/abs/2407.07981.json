Its\ndegree-one part is well-understood by D. Johnson's seminal works on the\nabelianization of the Torelli group. The knowledge of the degree-two part\n$(\\Gamma_2 \\mathcal{I} / \\Gamma_3 \\mathcal{I})\\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ with rational\ncoefficients arises from works of S. Morita on the Casson invariant and R. Hain\non the Malcev completion of $\\mathcal{I}$. Here, we prove that the abelian\ngroup $\\Gamma_2 \\mathcal{I} / \\Gamma_3 \\mathcal{I}$ is torsion-free, and we\ndescribe it as a lattice in a rational vector space. As an application, the\ngroup $\\mathcal{I}/\\Gamma_3 \\mathcal{I}$ is computed, and it is shown to embed\nin the group of homology cylinders modulo the surgery relation of\n$Y_3$-equivalence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
