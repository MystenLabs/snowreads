We extend this concept to\nuniform hypergraphs, find necessary conditions for $n$-e.c. hypergraphs to\nexist, and prove that random uniform hypergraphs are asymptotically\n$n$-existentially closed. We then provide constructions to generate infinitely\nmany examples of $n$-e.c. hypergraphs. In particular, these constructions use\ncertain combinatorial designs as ingredients, adding to the ever-growing list\nof applications of designs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
