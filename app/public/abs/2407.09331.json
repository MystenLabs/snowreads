The mechanism relies on a novel cooperation\nbetween light-matter coupling enhancement and frequent measurements. We\ndemonstrate that, in the presence of the cooperation, the system dynamics can\nbe completely dominated by the effective system-cavity interaction and the\ndissipative effects from the system-environment coupling can be surprisingly\nignored. This work provides a generic method of dissipation suppression in a\nvariety of quantum mechanical platforms, including natural atoms and\nsuperconducting circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
