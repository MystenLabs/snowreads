Current spoofing detectors, referred to as spoofing\ncountermeasures (CM), are mainly trained and focused on audio waveforms with a\nsingle speaker and short duration. This study explores spoofing detection in\nmore realistic scenarios, where the audio is long in duration and features\nmultiple speakers and complex acoustic conditions. We test the widely-acquired\nAASIST under this challenging scenario, looking at the impact of multiple\nvariations such as duration, speaker presence, and acoustic complexities on CM\nperformance. Our work reveals key issues with current methods and suggests\npreliminary ways to improve them. We aim to make spoofing detection more\napplicable in more in-the-wild scenarios. This research is served as an\nimportant step towards developing detection systems that can handle the\nchallenges of audio spoofing in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
