Improved denoising quality has come at the\ncost of denoising speed, where modern transformer networks are far slower to\nrun than smaller denoising networks such as FastDVDnet and classic Bayesian\ndenoisers such as the Wiener filter.\n  In this paper, we implement a hybrid Wiener filter which leverages small\nancillary networks to increase the original denoiser performance, while\nretaining fast denoising speeds. These networks are used to refine the Wiener\ncoring estimate, optimise windowing functions and estimate the unknown noise\nprofile. Using these methods, we outperform several popular denoisers and\nremain within 0.2 dB, on average, of the popular VRT transformer. Our method\nwas found to be over x10 faster than the transformer method, with a far lower\nparameter cost.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
