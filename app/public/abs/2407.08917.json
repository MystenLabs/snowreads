PIH asserts that given as input a 2-CSP on\n$k$ variables and alphabet size $n$, it is W[1]-hard parameterized by $k$ to\ndistinguish if the input is perfectly satisfiable or if every assignment to the\ninput violates 1% of the constraints.\n  An important implication of PIH is that it yields the tight parameterized\ninapproximability of the $k$-maxcoverage problem. In the $k$-maxcoverage\nproblem, we are given as input a set system, a threshold $\\tau>0$, and a\nparameter $k$ and the goal is to determine if there exist $k$ sets in the input\nwhose union is at least $\\tau$ fraction of the entire universe. PIH is known to\nimply that it is W[1]-hard parameterized by $k$ to distinguish if there are $k$\ninput sets whose union is at least $\\tau$ fraction of the universe or if the\nunion of every $k$ input sets is not much larger than $\\tau\\cdot\n(1-\\frac{1}{e})$ fraction of the universe.\n  In this work we present a gap preserving FPT reduction (in the reverse\ndirection) from the $k$-maxcoverage problem to the aforementioned 2-CSP\nproblem, thus showing that the assertion that approximating the $k$-maxcoverage\nproblem to some constant factor is W[1]-hard implies PIH. In addition, we\npresent a gap preserving FPT reduction from the $k$-median problem (in general\nmetrics) to the $k$-maxcoverage problem, further highlighting the power of gap\npreserving FPT reductions over classical gap preserving polynomial time\nreductions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
