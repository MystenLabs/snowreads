Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their\ngenerally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic\nprinciples, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a\npolar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic\ncharge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the\nrelative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms)\nto the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings\nbetween ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
