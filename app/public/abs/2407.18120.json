The diffeomorphism-invariant\nobservable that allows us to compare the averaged curvature of highly\nquantum-fluctuating geometries with that of classical spaces is the so-called\ncurvature profile. A Monte Carlo analysis on three geometric ensembles, which\nare physically equivalent but differ by the inclusion of local degeneracies,\nleads to new insights on the influence of finite-size effects. After\neliminating them, we find strong evidence that the curvature profile of 2D\nEuclidean quantum gravity is best matched by that of a classical round\nfour-sphere, rather than the five-sphere found in previous work. Our analysis\nsuggests the existence of a well-defined quantum Ricci curvature in the scaling\nlimit.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
