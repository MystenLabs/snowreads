That is, it requires any no-signaling theory an unbounded number of\nmeasurements to reproduce the predictions of quantum theory. We prove our\nresults by showing that there exists Bell inequalities that have to be obeyed\nby any no-signaling theory involving only $n-1$ measurements and show\nexplicitly how these can be violated in quantum theory. Finally, we discuss the\nrelation of our work to previous works ruling out alternatives to quantum\ntheory with some kind of bounded degree of freedom and consider the\nexperimental verifiability of our results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TmX_7BSLjRzLxdvGhhWfzWlBb4ORG_nGTwghZ08nN0E","pdfSize":"527616"}
