Our main objective is to study the unique determination of\ngeneral class of time-dependent and vector-valued source terms with potentially\nunknown divergence. Taking into account the challenges inherent in this class\nof inverse source problems, we aim to identify the most precise conditions that\nensure their resolution. Motivated by various fluid motion problems, we explore\nseveral class of boundary measurements. Our proofs are based on different\narguments, including unique continuation properties for Stokes systems,\napproximate controllability, complex analysis, and the application of explicit\nharmonic functions and explicit solutions for Stokes systems. This analysis is\ncomplemented by a reconstruction algorithm and examples of numerical\ncomputations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
