This\ncharacterization involves Fourier coefficients and Fourier-Jacobi expansions of\nthe cuspidal modular forms. The main component of the proof of the algebraic\ncharacterization is to show that certain infinite sums, which are potentially\nthe Fourier expansion of a cuspidal modular form, converge absolutely. As a\nconsequence of the algebraic characterization, we deduce that the cuspidal\nquaternionic modular forms have a basis consisting of forms all of whose\nFourier coefficients are algebraic numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
