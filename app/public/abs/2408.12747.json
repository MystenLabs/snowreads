We\nintroduce a novel pipeline that decouples 3D detection from 2D detection and\ndepth prediction, using a diffusion-based approach to improve accuracy and\nsupport category-agnostic detection. Additionally, we introduce the Normalised\nHungarian Distance (NHD) metric for an accurate evaluation of 3D detection\nresults, addressing the limitations of traditional IoU and GIoU metrics.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy and strong generalisation across various object categories and\ndatasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
