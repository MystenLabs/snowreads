Results show that particle shape significantly impacts the aerodynamic\nforces on a particle in a compressible flow, with oblate spheroids exhibiting\nthe highest drag, lift, and torque values. Correlations for these aerodynamic\ncoefficients of the particles in a compressible flow are developed and\nvalidated. These correlations advance multiphase flow modeling by improving the\naccuracy of point-particle simulations for non-spherical particles in\ncompressible flows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
