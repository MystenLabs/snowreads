The P, Q, and R branches of the band are detected\nin 13 out of 20 analyzed regions within these U/LIRGs, which increases the\nnumber of extragalactic H3+ detections by a factor of 6. For the first time in\nthe ISM, the H3+ band is observed in emission in 3 of these regions. In the\nremaining 10 regions, the band is seen in absorption. The absorptions are\nproduced toward the 3.4-4.4$\\mu$m hot dust continuum rather than toward the\nstellar continuum, indicating that they likely originate in clouds associated\nwith the dust continuum source. The H3+ band is undetected in Seyfert-like\nU/LIRGs where the mildly obscured X-ray radiation from the AGN might limit the\nabundance of this molecule. For the detections, the H3+ abundances, N(H3+)/N_H\n= (0.5-5.5)x10^-7, imply relatively high ionization rates between 3x10^-16 and\n>4x10^-15 s^-1, which are likely associated with high-energy cosmic rays. In\nhalf of the targets the absorptions are blue-shifted by 50-180 km/s, which are\nlower than the molecular outflow velocities measured using other tracers such\nas OH 119$\\mu$m or rotational CO lines. This suggests that H3+ traces gas close\nto the outflow launching sites before it has been fully accelerated. We used\nnonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium models to investigate the physical\nconditions of these clouds. In 7 out of 10 objects, the H3+ excitation is\nconsistent with inelastic collisions with H2 in warm translucent molecular\nclouds (T_kin ~ 250-500 K and n(H2) ~ 10^(2-3) cm^-3). In three objects,\ndominant infrared pumping excitation is required to explain the absorptions\nfrom the (3,0) and (2,1) levels of H3+ detected for the first time in the ISM.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
