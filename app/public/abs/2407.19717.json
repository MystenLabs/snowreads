In the case of\n$\\mathcal{W}(\\overline{\\mathfrak{gl}}(n|n))$ (resp.\n$\\mathcal{W}(\\overline{\\mathfrak{gl}}(n+1|n))$) this operator is even (resp.\nodd). We show that the supersymmetric Poisson vertex algebra bracket on these\nsupersymmetric W-algebras is the supersymmetric analogue of the quadratic\nGelfand-Dickey bracket associated to the operator $L$. Finally, we construct\nintegrable hierarchies of evolutionary Hamiltonian PDEs on both W-algebras. A\nkey observation is that to construct these hierarchies on the algebra\n$\\mathcal{W}(\\overline{\\mathfrak{gl}}(n+1|n))$ one needs to introduce a new\nconcept of even supersymmetric Poisson vertex algebras.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Rkn_5kGN2Dod_mv7rlDlyArcZEu07KT_8vtHQDI1qNw","pdfSize":"430467"}
