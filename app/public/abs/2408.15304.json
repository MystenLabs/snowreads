The result is shown to be unique up\nto external phase shifts. Unlike traditional passive linear-optical one-way\nsplitters, coupling light into the conventional output ports of the Y-coupler\nresults in strong coherent back-reflections, making the device a hybrid between\nfeed-forward devices like the beam splitter, which do not reverse the direction\nof light, and a recently considered class of directionally unbiased multiport\nscatterers (with dimension greater than two) which do. While the device could\nimmediately find use as a novel scattering vertex for the implementation of\nquantum walks, we also design a few simple but nonetheless useful optical\nsystems that can be constructed by taking advantage of the symmetry of the\nscattering process. This includes an interference-free, resource-efficient\nimplementation of the Grover four-port and a higher-dimensional Fabry-Perot\ninterferometer with tunable finesse. Symmetry-breaking generalizations are also\nconsidered.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sU0-4UNsoQFPBZYqETkweuNBIiKGEW_QvB7_NVWQZVc","pdfSize":"541893"}
