This\nmodel features a slim disk geometry where the inner disk thickness is\nproportional to radius, becoming thicker as the mass accretion rate increases.\nThe slim disk profile reduces the brightness of the blue horn in the Fe K\nemission line for a fixed emissivity and significantly changes the intensity\nprofile for a lamppost geometry. The model is constructed assuming a\nspherically symmetric spacetime. It can be used for any kind of sources showing\nfluorescent reflection features and predicted to have slim accretion disks,\nlike slow rotating black holes in X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei, tidal\ndisruption events, and neutron star X-ray binaries. To show the capability of\nthe model, we use the 2017 \\textit{NICER} and \\textit{NuSTAR} data of the\nultraluminous X-ray transient Swift~J0243.6+6124.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
