Here we show that every PTA source will be diffractively lensed by\npotentially hundreds of galactic disks transverse to its line of sight, leading\nto modest modulations in the strain, $\\Delta h / h \\sim 10^{-3} \\lambda^{-1}_{1\n\\rm pc.}$, due to wave lensing effects. The induced interference, or\nscintillation, pattern will be resolvable by coherent PTAs and may be\nleveraged, alongside fore-ground redshift information, to make precise\nmeasurements of cosmic expansion. If future PTA experiments can achieve enough\nsignal-to-noise to detect these small modulations, hundreds of\nredshift-distance pairs may be inferred from the diffractive lensing of an\nindividual PTA source.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
