Krasnov, this is a theory in which\nthe scalar constraint of the Ashtekar's formalism is modified in such way that\nthe cosmological constant is replaced by a cosmological function that depends\nof the canonical variables $A_{a}{}^{i}$ and $E_{i}{}^{a}$, the General\nRelativity (GR) is the particular case when the cosmological function is a\nconstant. Some years ago inspired by this theory Rosas-Rodr\\'iguez proposed two\ncosmological functions, one for the Ashtekar's formalism and the other for the\nADM formalism. In this paper we show that this cosmological functions are\nrelated thought the three-dimensional Ricci scalar.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
