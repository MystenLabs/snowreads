Their\nunique electronic structure and highly oscillatory potential energy curves\nsupport a rich variety of dynamical effects yet to be explored. We analyze the\nvibrational motion of these molecules using a framework of adiabatic wavepacket\npropagation dynamics and observe that for appropriate initial states, the\ntrilobite potential acts as molecular diffraction grating. The quantum dynamic\neffects observed are explained using a Fourier analysis of the scattering\npotential and the associated scattered wavepacket. Furthermore, vibrational\nground-states of the low angular momentum ultralong-range Rydberg molecules are\nfound to be particularly suitable to prepare the relevant wavepackets. Hence,\nwe propose a time resolved pump-probe scheme designed for the realization of\nthe effect in question, and advertise the utilization of a single diatomic\nRydberg molecule as a testbed for the study of exaggerated quantum dynamical\nphenomena.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
