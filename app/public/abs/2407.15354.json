To address this limitation, we present a new camera-based 3D object\ndetector with high-resolution vector representation: VectorFormer. The\npresented high-resolution vector representation is combined with the\nlower-resolution BEV representation to efficiently exploit 3D geometry from\nmulti-camera images at a high resolution through our two novel modules: vector\nscattering and gathering. To this end, the learned vector representation with\nricher scene contexts can serve as the decoding query for final predictions. We\nconduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance in NDS and inference time. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate query-BEV-based methods incorporated with our proposed vector\nrepresentation and observe a consistent performance improvement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
