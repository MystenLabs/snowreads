We characterize them\nusing B\\\"uchi games on finite graphs and give a complete axiomatization that\nderives them. The term signature and the axiomatization are reminiscent of\nKleene algebras, except that we additionally have meets and the lattice\noperations do not fully distributes over composition. The game characterization\nalso implies that it is decidable whether an equation is universally valid. We\ngive some complexity bounds; in particular, the problem is Pspace-hard in\ngeneral and we conjecture that it is solvable in Pspace.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"zid1O9vCuuM2L1Ww5YGdtOAA-itZZGKotse05wKgNZs","pdfSize":"660084"}
