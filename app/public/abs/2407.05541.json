We explore the notions of left and right\nsymmetric elements w.r.t. the notion of $T$-orthogonality. We characterize\nbounded linear operators on $\\mathbb{X}$ preserving $T$-orthogonality. Finally\nwe characterize Hilbert spaces among all Banach spaces using $T$-orthogonality.\n\\end{abstract}\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
