We show that these\noperators of order -(N-1)/2 are bounded from classical, atom decomposable\nH^1-Hardy space to L^1(R^N). Consequently, we obtain a sharp L^p-regularity\nresult due to Seeger, Sogge and Stein.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
