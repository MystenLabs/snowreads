We show that, assuming certain simple\ndegree and codegree conditions on the hypergraph $ \\mathcal{H} $ and the\nconflicts to be avoided, a conflict-free almost-perfect matching can be\nextended to one covering all of the vertices in a particular subset of $\nV(\\mathcal{H}) $, by using an additional set of edges; in particular, we ensure\nthat our matching avoids all of a further set of conflicts, which may consist\nof both old and new edges. This setup is useful for various applications, and\nour main theorem provides a black box which encapsulates many long and tedious\ncalculations, massively simplifying the proofs of results in generalised Ramsey\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bAU7o7leG4viKj-pHNJFZ5C46zVS-9oNgDDV13fIDrQ","pdfSize":"394236"}
