The advanced in-situ plasma measurements and\nsimulations enabled scientists to gain a novel understanding of magnetic\nreconnection. Still, outstanding questions remain on the complex dynamics and\nstructures in the diffusion region, on the cross-scale and regional couplings,\non the onset of magnetic reconnection, and on the details of energetics. Future\ndirections of the magnetic reconnection research in terms of new observations,\nnew simulations and interdisciplinary approaches are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
