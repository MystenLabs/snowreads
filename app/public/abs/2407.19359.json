This meta-objective directly targets the usefulness of a\nrepresentation generated from unlabeled clinical measurement forecast for later\nsupervised tasks.\n  The meta-learned can then be directly used in target risk prediction, and the\nlimited available samples can be used for further fine-tuning the model\nperformance. The effectiveness of our approach is tested on a real open source\npatient EHR dataset MIMIC-III. We are able to demonstrate that our\nattention-based patient state representation approach can achieve much better\nperformance for predicting target risk with low resources comparing with both\ndirect supervised learning and pretraining with all-observation trajectory\nforecast.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mtuwYvuLtEBBDZbm51ILyrCSqKKvfqojYFVING_pbyI","pdfSize":"613688"}
