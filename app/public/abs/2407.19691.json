For these\ninvestigations, detailed information of the interactions, e.g. the number of\nspins and their interaction strengths, is often required. In this study, we\npresent the identification and characterization of a single nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) center coupled to two electron spins. In the experiment, we first identify\na well isolated single NV center, and characterize its spin decoherence time.\nThen we perform NV-detected electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy\nto detect surrounding electron spins. From the analysis of the NV-EPR signal,\nwe determine the number of detected spins and their interaction strengths\nprecisely. Moreover, the spectral analysis indicates candidates of the detected\nspins to be diamond surface spins. This study demonstrates a promising approach\nfor the identification and characterization of an interacting spin system for\nrealizing entangled sensing, using the electron spin as quantum reporters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"riFEDRZ2WSPn7_JpTO3zMsJHd9uIjccFR122Oe9yrUI","pdfSize":"366731"}
