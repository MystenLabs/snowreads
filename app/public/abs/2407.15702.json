Here we\nstudy the two-site hopper within the context of QMT; and in an optical\nexperiment, we determine the measure of a specific hopper event, using an\nancilla based event filtering scheme. For this measure we report a value of\n$1.172$, which exceeds the maximum value permissible for a classical\nprobability (namely $1$) by $13.3$ standard deviations. If an unconventional\ntheoretical concept is to play a role in meeting the foundational challenges of\nquantum theory, then it seems important to bring it into contact with\nexperiment as much as possible. Our experiment does this for the quantum\nmeasure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
