Unlike previous model, the proposed model\npropagates volume and covered area based on height difference between adjacent\ndrops. Height profile is then calculated from the propagated volume and area.\nMeasurements of 2-drop and 3-drop patterns are used to experimentally compute\nmodel parameters. The parameters are used to predict and validate height\nprofiles of 4 and more drops in a straight line. Using the same root mean\nsquare (RMS) error as benchmark, this model achieves 5.9% RMS height profile\nerror on 4-drop lines. This represents more than 60% reduction from graph-based\nmodel and an improvement from our previous effort.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Lw_q7s9PkS2XDncKKCBw7-4lrXXyB8ZLOK3LyhkA7y0","pdfSize":"1320059"}
