We introduce a new\nmethod that exploits (increasingly available) data on a firm's expectations of\nits future output and inputs that allows us to obtain consistent production\nfunction parameter estimates while relaxing these input demand assumptions. In\ncontrast to dynamic panel methods, our proposed estimator can be implemented on\nvery short panels (including a single cross-section), and Monte Carlo\nsimulations show it outperforms alternative estimators when firms' material\ninput choices are subject to optimization error. Implementing a range of\nproduction function estimators on UK data, we find our proposed estimator\nyields results that are either similar to or more credible than commonly-used\nalternatives. These differences are larger in industries where material inputs\nappear harder to optimize. We show that TFP implied by our proposed estimator\nis more strongly associated with future jobs growth than existing methods,\nsuggesting that failing to adequately account for input endogeneity may\nunderestimate the degree of dynamic reallocation in the economy.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hZhu3NzUkeaMx-oez5Kr9-anK2P500EwgW0FnGpmfA8","pdfSize":"1076675"}
