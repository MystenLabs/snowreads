Through a unified framework,\nPartGLEE accomplishes detection, segmentation, and grounding of instances at\nany granularity in the open world scenario. Specifically, we propose a Q-Former\nto construct the hierarchical relationship between objects and parts, parsing\nevery object into corresponding semantic parts. By incorporating a large amount\nof object-level data, the hierarchical relationships can be extended, enabling\nPartGLEE to recognize a rich variety of parts. We conduct comprehensive studies\nto validate the effectiveness of our method, PartGLEE achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across various part-level tasks and obtain\ncompetitive results on object-level tasks. The proposed PartGLEE significantly\nenhances hierarchical modeling capabilities and part-level perception over our\nprevious GLEE model. Further analysis indicates that the hierarchical cognitive\nability of PartGLEE is able to facilitate a detailed comprehension in images\nfor mLLMs. The model and code will be released at\nhttps://provencestar.github.io/PartGLEE-Vision/ .\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
