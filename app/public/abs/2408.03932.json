Recent work has shown that such patterns\narise generically from forces that violate Newton's third law, known as\nnon-reciprocal interactions. These non-equilibrium phenomena are challenging\nfor modern theories. Here, we introduce a model mixture of active\n(self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles with non-reciprocal\neffective interactions, which is amenable to exact mathematical analysis. We\nexploit state-of-the-art methods to derive exact hydrodynamic equations for the\nparticle densities. We study the resulting collective behavior, including the\nlinear stability of homogeneous states and phase coexistence in large systems.\nThis reveals a novel phase diagram with the spinodal associated with active\nphase separation protruding through the associated binodal, heralding the\nemergence of dynamical steady states. We analyze these states in the\nthermodynamic limit of large system size, showing, for example, that sharp\ninterfaces may travel at finite velocities, but traveling phase-separated\nstates are forbidden. The model's mathematical tractability enables precise new\nconclusions beyond those available by numerical simulation of particle models\nor field theories.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
