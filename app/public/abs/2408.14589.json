In particular, our design aims to improve upon\nprior designs by reducing information overload, by better supporting the\nexploration of recommendations, and by making more efficient use of screen\nspace. During our design process, we developed a set of design dimensions to\naid others in the design of code recommenders. To validate our design, we\nimplemented a prototype of our design as an Atom code editor extension with\nsupport for the Java programming language, and conducted an empirical user\nevaluation comparing our graph-based Wandercode design to a control design\nrepresentative of prior list-based interaction designs for code recommenders.\nThe results showed that, compared with the control design, Wandercode helped\nparticipants complete tasks more quickly, reduced their cognitive load, and was\nviewed more favorably by participants.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
