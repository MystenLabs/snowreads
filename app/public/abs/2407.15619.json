It is defined as a process whose one dimensional distribution\nis the solution of a system of fractional partial differential equations. A\ntime-changed representation for the FPRF is given in terms of the composition\nof Poisson random field with a bivariate random process. Some integrals of the\nFPRF are introduced and studied. Using the Adomian decomposition method, a\nclosed form expression for its probability mass function is obtained in terms\nof the generalized Wright function. Some results related to the order\nstatistics of random numbers of random variables are presented. Also, we\nintroduce a generalization of Poisson random field on $\\mathbb{R}^d_+$, $d\\ge1$\nwhich reduces to the Poisson random field in a special case. For $d=1$, it\nfurther reduces to a generalized Poisson process (GPP). A time-changed\nrepresentation for the GPP is established. Moreover, we construct a\ntime-changed linear and planer random motions of a particle driven by the GPP.\nThe conditional distribution of the random position of particle is derived.\nLater, we define the compound fractional Poisson random field via FPRF. Also, a\ngeneralized version of it on $\\mathbb{R}^d_+$, $d\\ge1$ is discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
