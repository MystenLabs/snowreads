We\naccomplish this by combining the $\\phi$-model of the cymetric package with\nnon-trainable, $G$-invariant, canonicalization layers that project the\n$\\phi$-model's input data (i.e. points sampled from the CY geometry) to the\nfundamental domain of a given symmetry group $G$. These $G$-invariant layers\nare easy to concatenate, provided one compatibility condition is fulfilled, and\ncombine well with spectral $\\phi$-models. Through experiments on different CY\ngeometries, we find that, for fixed point sample size and training time,\ncanonicalized models give slightly more accurate metric approximations than the\nstandard $\\phi$-model. The method may also be used to compute Ricci-flat metric\non smooth CY quotients. We demonstrate this aspect by experiments on a smooth\n$\\mathbb{Z}^2_5$ quotient of a 5-parameter quintic CY manifold.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
