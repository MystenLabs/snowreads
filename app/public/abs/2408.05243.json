We introduce personalized GPT and Context-based Social Media LLM\nmodels, utilizing federated learning for privacy and security. Four client\nentities receive a base GPT-2 model and locally collected social media data,\nwith federated aggregation ensuring up-to-date model maintenance. Subsequent\nmodules focus on categorizing user posts, computing user persona scores, and\nidentifying relevant posts from friends' lists. A quantifying social engagement\napproach, coupled with matrix factorization techniques, facilitates\npersonalized content suggestions in real-time. An adaptive feedback loop and\nreadability score algorithm also enhance the quality and relevance of content\npresented to users. Our system offers a comprehensive solution to content\nfiltering and recommendation, fostering a tailored and engaging social media\nexperience while safeguarding user privacy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
