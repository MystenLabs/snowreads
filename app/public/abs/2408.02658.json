We prove that when $X$ is a birationally ruled\nsurface and $\\phi_1$ has no superattracting cycles, then we can always find a\nsmooth surface $\\hat X$ and an algebraic stabilisation $\\pi : (\\hat \\phi, \\hat\nX) \\to (\\phi, X)$ which is a birational morphism. We provide an example of a\nskew product $\\phi$ where $\\phi_1$ has a superattracting fixed point and $\\phi$\nis not algebraically stable on any model.\n  Our techniques involve transforming the stabilisation issue into a\ncombinatorial dynamical problem for a 'non-Archimedean skew product' $\\phi_*:\n\\mathbb P^1_{\\text{an}}(\\mathbb K) \\to \\mathbb P^1_{\\text{an}}(\\mathbb K)$ on\nthe Berkovich projective line over the Puiseux series, $\\mathbb K$. The\nFatou-Julia theory for $\\phi_*$ is instrumental to our approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
