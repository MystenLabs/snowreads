We treat the core and halo as inert objects in a two-cluster\nmodel. The relative wave function is a combination of simple harmonic\noscillator states with a size that is determined from a relation between the\nnuclear radius and separation energy. Since these wave functions lack the\nexpected exponential decay, we apply a multiplicative renormalization to the\nradial part of the operators, determined from the nuclear root-mean-square\nradius. This combination of oscillator wavefunctions and renormalized operators\nis then applied to the calculation of dipole strength distributions\n$dB(E1,\\varepsilon)/d\\varepsilon$ for several $1n$- and $2n$-halo nuclei. By\nfitting a single free parameter, the results show excellent agreement with the\navailable experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"feXdVfAK9U58mLzw5V_YZ0mrUJNz9P6gsM-8bgiY9es","pdfSize":"1287743"}
