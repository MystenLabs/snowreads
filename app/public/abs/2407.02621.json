The latter was extracted from the number of remaining atoms,\nwhich featured oscillatory fringes stemming from the superposition of trimers\nwith atom-dimers. Subsequent theoretical investigations utilizing the\ntime-dependent three-body problem revealed additional association mechanisms,\nmanifested as superpositions of the Efimov state with the trap states and the\nlatter with atom-dimers. The three atoms were initialized in a way to emulate a\nthermal gas with uniform density. Here, this analysis is extended by taking\ninto account the effects of the density profile of a semi-classical thermal\ngas. The supersposition of the Efimov trimer with the first atom-dimer remains\nthe same, while the frequencies of highly oscillatory fringes shift to lower\nvalues. The latter refer to the frequencies of trimers and atom-dimers in free\nspace since the density profile smears out the contribution of trap states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
