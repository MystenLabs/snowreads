Unlike traditional neural\nnetworks, which ignore physical laws and result in inconsistent predictions,\nour model is designed to strictly adhere to all thermodynamic consistency\ncriteria. By leveraging deep-set neural networks, HANNA maintains symmetry\nunder the permutation of the components. Furthermore, by hard-coding physical\nconstraints in the network architecture, we ensure consistency with the\nGibbs-Duhem equation and in modeling the pure components. The model was trained\nand evaluated on 317,421 data points for activity coefficients in binary\nmixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, achieving significantly higher prediction\naccuracies than the current state-of-the-art model UNIFAC. Moreover, HANNA only\nrequires the SMILES of the components as input, making it applicable to any\nbinary mixture of interest. HANNA is fully open-source and available for free\nuse.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zQijUAo-rr5VXXcANCGUhOld_d2yCoFeNm8bs-Eac7k","pdfSize":"4513669"}
