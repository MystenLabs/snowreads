The Hesse derivative of a curve $V(f)$\ngiven by the homogeneous polynomial $f$ is $V(\\mathcal{H}(f))$ where\n$\\mathcal{H}(f)$ is a the determinant of the Hesse matrix of $f$. In this\npaper, we compute the $j$-invariant of the Hesse derivative of a cubic curve\n$C$ in terms of the $j$-invariant of $C$, getting a rational function on the\nRiemann sphere. We then analyze the dynamics of this rational function, and\ninvestigate when a cubic curve is isomorphic to its $n$-fold Hesse derivative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
