Several options for this redefinition are\ncurrently under consideration. Among them, a definition based on several\ntransitions would take advantage of the variety of high performance optical\nfrequency standards. In this paper, we review practical aspects such a\ndefinition entails, and propose a detailed analysis of its strengths and\nweaknesses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
