Inspired by climate model hierarchies, we propose\nthat a full hierarchy of Pareto-optimal models, defined within an appropriately\ndetermined error-complexity plane, can guide model development and help\nunderstand the models' added value. We demonstrate the use of Pareto fronts in\natmospheric physics through three sample applications, with hierarchies ranging\nfrom semi-empirical models with minimal tunable parameters (simplest) to deep\nlearning algorithms (most complex). First, in cloud cover parameterization, we\nfind that neural networks identify nonlinear relationships between cloud cover\nand its thermodynamic environment, and assimilate previously neglected features\nsuch as vertical gradients in relative humidity that improve the representation\nof low cloud cover. This added value is condensed into a ten-parameter equation\nthat rivals the performance of deep learning models. Second, we establish a ML\nmodel hierarchy for emulating shortwave radiative transfer, distilling the\nimportance of bidirectional vertical connectivity for accurately representing\nabsorption and scattering, especially for multiple cloud layers. Third, we\nemphasize the importance of convective organization information when modeling\nthe relationship between tropical precipitation and its surrounding\nenvironment. We discuss the added value of temporal memory when high-resolution\nspatial information is unavailable, with implications for precipitation\nparameterization. Therefore, by comparing data-driven models directly with\nexisting schemes using Pareto optimality, we promote process understanding by\nhierarchically unveiling system complexity, with the hope of improving the\ntrustworthiness of ML models in atmospheric applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ERlm5M9TKwkIdBUtdnUrg8SE9_ggS5_AalZcYArFyEc","pdfSize":"2234614"}
