A heavy mass loss via the stellar wind or during the the\nroche-lobe overfilling (RLOF) mass-transfer may happen at the late evolutionary\nphase of ONeMg WD - red giant (or asymptotic giant branch) star binaries, and\nit might form nebulae with central accreting WD binaries. The nebulae might be\nionized the hot cores of giant stars or accreting WDs. Therefore, the accreting\nWD inside the symbiotic nebulae might grow in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit\nmass and collapse. Peculiar NSs born via the AIC of WDs inside the symbiotic\nnebulae (PNe) may finally have WD companions and become the NS-WD systems, and\nthe Milky Way may contain tens of such kind of systems. Second, I introduce\nanother possibility for the formation of PNe (or pulsar wind nebulae) with\nnewborn NS via the core-merger-induced collapse during the common envelope\nevolution of ONeMg WD binaries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
