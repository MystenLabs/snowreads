By\nre-simulating 45 MW-mass zoom-in halos from the N-body Symphony compilation\nwith embedded disk potentials, which evolve according to star formation\nhistories predicted by the UniverseMachine model, we self-consistently tie disk\ngrowth to halo accretion rate and significantly expand the range of disk masses\nand formation histories studied. We use the particle-tracking-based subhalo\nfinder Symfind to enhance the robustness of subhalo tracking. We find that\ndisks near the median disk-to-halo mass ratio of our sample ($M_{\\ast, \\rm\nDisk}/M_{\\rm vir, host} = 2\\%$) reduce subhalo peak mass functions within 100\nkpc by about $10\\%$ for peak masses above $ 10^8\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. Heavier,\nMW/M31-like disks ($M_{\\ast, \\rm Disk}/M_{\\rm vir, host} \\gtrsim 5\\%$) lead to\na reduction of more than $40\\%$. Subhalo abundance suppression is more\npronounced near halo centers, with particularly enhanced stripping for subhalos\naccreted over 8 Gyr ago on orbits with pericenters < 100 kpc. Suppression is\nfurther amplified when disk mass is increased within fixed halo and disk\nassembly histories. In all cases, the suppression we measure should be\ninterpreted as stripping below the mass resolution limit rather than complete\nsubhalo disruption. This study reshapes our understanding of the MW's impact on\nits satellites, suggesting it strips subhalos more efficiently than typical\nMW-mass galaxies due to its larger disk-to-halo mass ratio and earlier disk\nformation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
