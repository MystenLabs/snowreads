We investigate different materials for the non-magnetic layer,\nfocusing on the experimentally realized Co/Ag/Co system. We laterally shift the\natoms in the non-magnetic layer to achieve the symmetry breaking required for\nthe interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We compare the resulting\ninteractions with the L\\'evy-Fert model and observe a good overall agreement\nbetween the model and the ab initio calculations for the dependence on the\natomic positions. Additionally, we derive a formula for the strength of the\ninterlayer isotropic exchange interaction depending on the position of the\natoms in the non-magnetic layer and compare it to the first-principles results.\nWe investigate the limitations of the L\\'evy-Fert model by turning off the\nspin-orbit coupling separately on the non-magnetic and magnetic atoms and by\nstudying the effect of band filling. Our work advances the understanding of the\nmicroscopic mechanisms of the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and\ngives insight into possible new material combinations with strong interlayer\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
