Different from\nprevious literature surveys, this review article re-examines the\ncharacteristics of the YOLO series from the latest technical point of view. At\nthe same time, we also analyzed how the YOLO series continued to influence and\npromote real-time computer vision-related research and led to the subsequent\ndevelopment of computer vision and language models.We take a closer look at how\nthe methods proposed by the YOLO series in the past ten years have affected the\ndevelopment of subsequent technologies and show the applications of YOLO in\nvarious fields. We hope this article can play a good guiding role in subsequent\nreal-time computer vision development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
