Achieving high-quality and\ncontrollable LiDAR data generation is urgently needed, controlling with text is\na common practice, but there is little research in this field. To this end, we\npropose Text2LiDAR, the first efficient, diverse, and text-controllable LiDAR\ndata generation model. Specifically, we design an equirectangular transformer\narchitecture, utilizing the designed equirectangular attention to capture LiDAR\nfeatures in a manner with data characteristics. Then, we design a\ncontrol-signal embedding injector to efficiently integrate control signals\nthrough the global-to-focused attention mechanism. Additionally, we devise a\nfrequency modulator to assist the model in recovering high-frequency details,\nensuring the clarity of the generated point cloud. To foster development in the\nfield and optimize text-controlled generation performance, we construct\nnuLiDARtext which offers diverse text descriptors for 34,149 LiDAR point clouds\nfrom 850 scenes. Experiments on uncontrolled and text-controlled generation in\nvarious forms on KITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nour approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
