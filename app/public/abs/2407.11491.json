Coulomb interaction\nbetween copropagating integer quantum Hall edge channels causes the TL liquid\nnature of charge excitations, resulting in the splitting of an electronic state\ninto bosonic eigenmodes. We investigate the single-electron coherence under the\nsplitting process by calculating the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in an\nelectronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer employing copropagating spin-up and\nspin-down edge channels as the interference paths. We investigate the voltage\nbias dependence of the AB oscillations at zero temperature, taking the\ninter-channel interaction into account using the bosonization technique. The\ncalculation results of the visibility and the phase of the AB oscillations show\nnon-monotonical bias dependence when the copropagating channels are\nelectrostatically asymmetric. These observations are interpreted as the\nsignatures of the second-order interference between the fractionalized spin\nexcitations with different phase evolutions. We also report finite entanglement\nentropy between the bosonic eigenmodes split from an electron, which presents\nan analogy between the `electron splitting' in a TL liquid and the Cooper-pair\nsplitting at a superconducting junction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
