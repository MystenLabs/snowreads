The\nextension retains all of the 1D SSH model's symmetries on the global level. We\ndiscovered that when individual SSH chains are in a non-trivial topological\nphase and introduce a staggering amplitude between chains with a scenario $t<\nv+w/2$, the system exhibits four zero energy modes that are confined to two of\nthe four corners of the system. Interestingly, two out of the four zero modes\nare found to be associated with trimmers. No zero energy modes arise when the\nchains are in the trivial topological phase with $t< v+w/2$. Further with a\ncritical look at the phase evolution of the Bloch states of the system we\nidentified a set of closed paths to define a winding number to characterize the\ntopological nature of the system. The Bulk-Corner correspondence is established\nby calculating the winding number, varying between 2 and 1 in non-trivial\ntopological phase and found to be 0 in the trivial topological phase. Based of\nthis study we characterize the system with four localized corner modes and a\nbulk winding number 2 appears to be a Second-order topological insulator.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
