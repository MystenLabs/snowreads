Inconsistency index is a mathematical function which maps every pairwise\ncomparison matrix (PCM) into a real number. An inconsistency index can be\nconsidered more trustworthy when it satisfies a set of suitable properties.\nTherefore, the research community has been trying to postulate a set of\ndesirable rules (axioms, properties) for inconsistency indices. Subsequently,\nmany axiomatic frameworks for these functions have been suggested\nindependently, however, the literature on the topic is fragmented and missing a\nbroader framework. Therefore, the objective of this article is twofold.\nFirstly, we provide a comprehensive review of the advancements in the\naxiomatization of inconsistency indices' properties during the last decade.\nSecondly, we provide a comparison and discussion of the aforementioned\naxiomatic structures along with directions of the future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n4TSAvrKXluH7iMUqnB7fuqJ5hglr4neQM1zxN1MANI","pdfSize":"1158484"}
