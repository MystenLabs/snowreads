The electronic and transport properties are explored\nas a function of the interlayer twist angle using an atomistic tight-binding\nmodel combined with non-equilibrium Green's functions. At small twist angles\n($\\theta \\lesssim 10^\\circ$), NPG and graphene are strongly coupled, as\nrevealed by the hybridization of their electronic bands. As a result, when\nelectrons are point-injected in NPG, a substantial interlayer transmission\noccurs and an electronic Talbot-like interference pattern appears in the\ncurrent flow on both layers. Besides, the twist-induced\nmirror-symmetry-breaking leads to chiral features in the injected current. Upon\nincreasing the twist angle, the coupling is weakened and the monolayer\nelectronic properties are restored. Furthermore, we demonstrate the emergence\nof resonant peaks in the electronic density of states for small twist angles,\nallowing to probe the twist-dependent interlayer coupling via scanning\ntunneling microscopy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d6GkR4hPrlvcoA0MkBxciAOaU1n6oeRxEdixqjDx5Uo","pdfSize":"16386963"}
