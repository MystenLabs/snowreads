Meanwhile, such a progress\nbrought with it the expectation that one can either understand the role of\ndimensionality in the World or disclose how certain physical phenomena depend\non it. Some of these issues are sketched throughout the text, as well as those\nremarkable moments in the History of Science where important contributions were\nmade in order to give a satisfactory answer to the following inescapable\nquestion: -- How many dimensions does time have?\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
