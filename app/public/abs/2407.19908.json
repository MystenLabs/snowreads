Our method\nintegrates the Liouville 1-form of the Marsden-Weinstein structure with\nRiemannian structures that have been introduced in mathematical shape analysis.\nWe also derive Hamiltonian vector fields for several classical Hamiltonian\nfunctions with respect to these new symplectic structures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
