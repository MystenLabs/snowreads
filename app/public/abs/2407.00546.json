Specifically, we show that Visscher's construction minimally resolves\nall edge ideals of undirected vertex-weighted complete bipartite graphs, and we\ncharacterize the edge-weighted complete bipartite graphs whose edge ideals are\nminimally resolved by Visscher's construction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
