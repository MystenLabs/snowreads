A\nprominent example is the use of eigenvectors of a Laplacian, constructed from\ndata affinities, to identify natural data groupings or clusters, or to produce\na simplified representation of data lying on a manifold. This tutorial concerns\nthe dynamic Laplacian, which is a natural generalisation of the Laplacian to\nhandle data that has a time component and lies on a time-evolving manifold. In\nthis dynamic setting, clusters correspond to long-lived ``coherent''\ncollections. We begin with a gentle recap of spectral geometry before\ndescribing the dynamic generalisations. We also discuss computational methods\nand the automatic separation of many distinct features through the SEBA\nalgorithm. The purpose of this tutorial is to bring together many results from\nthe dynamic Laplacian literature into a single short document, written in an\naccessible style.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
