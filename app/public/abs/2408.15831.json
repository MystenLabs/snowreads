However, the parallel leg\nchains increase the risks of collision and clamping. In this work, these\nhazards are described by kinematics and kinetostatics models to minimize them\nas objective functions by a combined structural and dimensional synthesis in a\nparticle-swarm optimization. In addition to the risk of clamping within and\nbetween kinematic chains, the back-drivability is quantified to theoretically\nguarantee detectability via motor current. Another HRC-relevant objective\nfunction is the largest eigenvalue of the mass matrix formulated in the\noperational-space coordinates to consider collision effects. Multi-objective\noptimization leads to different Pareto-optimal PR structures. The results show\nthat the optimization leads to significant improvement of the HRC criteria and\nthat a Hexa structure (6-RUS) is to be favored concerning the objective\nfunctions and due to its simpler joint structure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
