We systematically investigate the electronic and optical\nproperties of graphene/hBN under the application of strain, considering various\nstacking geometries within the framework of density-functional theory. The\nsemimetallic graphene layer upon aligning on the insulating hexagonal boron\nnitride sheet opens a few tens of meV band gap at the Dirac point due to the\ninduced on-site energy differences on the two sublattices of graphene. Here, we\ndemonstrate that by simultaneously tuning the interlayer distance and lattice\nconstant, this band gap can be significantly increased to 1 eV. Interestingly,\nin both scenarios (small and large band gaps), the material undergoes a\ntransition from a semiconductor to a semimetallic state. Importantly, the\ntunability of this band gap is strongly influenced by the specific stacking\nconfiguration. We further explored the optical properties across a broad\nspectrum, revealing that the presence of a strain-induced band gap\nfundamentally alters how light interacts with the system.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
