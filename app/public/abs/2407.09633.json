An example is the glycocalyx which\nrefers to hair-like negatively charged sugar molecules that coat the outside\nmembrane of all cells. We consider the transport and equilibrium distribution\nof ions, and the resulting electrical potential, when such a brush is immersed\nin a salt buffer containing monovalent cations (sodium and/or potassium). The\nGouy-Chapman model for ion screening at a charged surface captures the effects\nof the Coulombic force that drives ion electrophoresis and diffusion, but\nneglects non-Coulombic forces and ion pairing. By including the distinct\nbinding affinities of these counter-ions with the brush, and their so-called\nBorn radii, which account for Born forces acting on them when the permittivity\nis non-uniform, we propose modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck continuum models that\nshow the distinct profiles that may result depending on those ion-specific\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
