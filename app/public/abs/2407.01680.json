Our key findings are: (1)\nBesides the expected hole to electron-like behavior change around half filling,\nwe show that the additional sign change at an electronic density $n_s$ (and\ncorrespondingly a hole density $p_s$) is controlled by the opening of a charge\ngap in the thermodynamic density of states or compressibility and not by the\npseudogap scale in the single particle density of states. (2) We find that\n$n_s(T,U)$ depends strongly on the interaction $U$ and shows an unusual\nnon-monotonic dependence on temperature with a maximum at a temperature\n$T\\approx t$, on the order of the hopping scale. (3) We identify local moment\nformation close to half filling as the main driver for the anomalous behavior\nof the thermoelectric transport coefficient.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
