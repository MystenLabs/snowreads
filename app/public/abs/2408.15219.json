However, high\nand unpredictable performance degradation remains a primary challenge.\n  Recognizing that it is extremely difficult to achieve complete system\ncorrectness for production deployment, researchers make trade-offs between\nperformance, detection coverage, interoperability, precision, and detection\ntiming.\n  This research strikes a balance between comprehensive system protection and\nthe costs required to obtain it, identifies the desirable roles of software and\nhardware, and presents a tagged pointer-based capability system as a\nstand-alone software solution and a prototype for future hardware design. This\npaper presents follow-up plans for the FRAMER/Miu generic framework to achieve\nthese goals.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"W8F4LgDpuo3bGYQM6q4sg10G4Ns1_dYoSX2tEWHqZG8","pdfSize":"1744030"}
