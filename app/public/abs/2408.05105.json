While such\nasymmetric settings have been examined in social platforms, significant\nquestions around layout dimensionality in data-driven decision-making remain\nunderexplored. A crucial inquiry arises: although presenting a consistent 3D\nvirtual world on both immersive and non-immersive platforms has been a common\npractice in social applications, does the same guideline apply to lay out data?\nOr should data placement be optimized locally according to each device's\ndisplay capacity? This study aims to provide empirical insights into the user\nexperience of asymmetric collaboration in data-driven decision-making. We\ntested practical dimensionality combinations between PC and VR, resulting in\nthree conditions: PC2D+VR2D, PC2D+VR3D, and PC3D+VR3D. The results revealed a\npreference for PC2D+VR3D, and PC2D+VR2D led to the quickest task completion.\nOur investigation facilitates an in-depth discussion of the trade-offs\nassociated with different layout dimensionalities in asymmetric collaborations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
