In our construction,\nthe space is reconstructed from nodal values by solving a local least squares\nfitting problem per element. It is shown that the space can achieve an\narbitrarily high-order accuracy and share the same nodal degrees of freedom\nwith the $C^0$ linear space. The interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin scheme\ncan be directly applied to the reconstructed space for solving the biharmonic\nequation. We prove that the numerical solution converges with optimal orders\nunder error measurements. More importantly, we establish a norm equivalence\nbetween the reconstructed space and the continuous linear space. This property\nallows us to precondition the linear system arising from the high-order space\nby the linear space on the same mesh. This preconditioner is shown to be\noptimal in the sense that the condition number of the preconditioned system\nadmits a uniform upper bound independent of the mesh size. Numerical examples\nin two and three dimensions are provided to illustrate the accuracy of the\nscheme and the efficiency of the preconditioning method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
