This is a function field version of a conjecture of\nCoates--Sujatha. We further prove that the fine Selmer group is finite\n(respectively zero) if the separable $p$-primary torsion of the abelian variety\nis finite (respectively zero).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
