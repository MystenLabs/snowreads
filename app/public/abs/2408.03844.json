As a\ncorollary, it follows that the Stokes operator generates a uniformly bounded\nanalytic semigroup in the spaces of bounded solenoidal functions in $\\Omega$.\nThe smoothness conditions on $\\Omega$ are sharp. The case of exterior domains\nwith nonsmooth boundaries is also studied.The key step in the proof involves\nnew estimates which connect the pressure to the velocity in the $L^q$ average,\nbut only on scales above certain level.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JgH2T6oWpk8o-4e1fM8nmbZr1Po7hY8ol0yUhwknQzY","pdfSize":"433803"}
