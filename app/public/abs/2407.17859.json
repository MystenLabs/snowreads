Here, by\nconsidering both spin and alloy degrees of freedom, we develop a magnetic\ncluster expansion method, which considers all symmetry allowed interactions.\nApplying such method, we not only obtain realistic spin model that can\ncorrectly reproduce observations for both CuFeO$_2$ and\nCuFe$_{1-x}$Al$_x$O$_2$, but also revisit well-known theories of the original\nspin-current (SC) model and $p$-$d$ hybridization model. Specifically, we find\nthat (i) a previously overlooked biquadratic interaction is critical to\nreproduce the $\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\downarrow$ ground state and excited\nstates of CuFeO$_2$; (ii) the combination of absent biquadratic interaction and\nincreased magnetic frustration around Al dopants stabilizes the proper screw\nstate; and (iii) it is the generalized spin-current (GSC) model that can\ncorrectly characterize the multiferroicity of CuFeO$_2$. These findings have\nbroader implications for understanding novel magnetoelectric couplings in,\ne.g., monolayer multiferroic NiI$_2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
