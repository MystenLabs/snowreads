In\nthis work, we use exact diagonalization to go beyond the ultra-short range to\nfind the different phases for $\\nu=2/3$. We model the interaction as Yukawa so\nthat we can control the range as a proof of concept. Even in this simple\nsetting, we discovered how dropping the USR condition shifts the transition\nborders in favour of certain phases, leads to a new bond-ordered phase\nappearing, and breaks the ferromagnetic phase in two competing states as a\nresult of lifting the USR-driven degeneracy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"RFT4VJ-lYhQBMbr9qAZT-GPgyohTWbMmgIvMVY0C6rs","pdfSize":"3387235"}
