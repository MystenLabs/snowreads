Recent works have led to explicit computations of this weight system\non chord diagrams with complete and complete bipartite intersection graphs\nusing $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ weight systems on shares, i.e., on chord diagrams on\ntwo strands.\n  In this paper, we continue our study of shares. We prove a conjecture by\nLando about a duality of values of the $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ weight system on chord\ndiagrams whose intersection graphs are joins of complementary graphs with\ndiscrete ones. To achieve this, we introduce the two-colored intersection graph\nof shares, define the inner product of shares, and use chord-adding operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
