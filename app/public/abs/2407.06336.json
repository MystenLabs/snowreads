We confirm the existence of a ``cocoon'' which is broad\n(FWHM~2.932deg~460pc) and kinematically hot (velocity dispersion,\nsigma~5-8km/s) component that surrounds a narrower (FWHM~0.353deg~55pc) and\ncolder (sigma~ 2.2-2.6km/s) thin stream component (based on a median per star\nvelocity precision of 2.7km/s). The cocoon extends over at least a ~ 20deg\nsegment of the stream observed by DESI. The thin and cocoon components have\nsimilar mean values of [Fe/H]: -2.54+/- 0.04dex and -2.45+/-0.06dex suggestive\nof a common origin. The data are consistent with the following scenarios for\nthe origin of the cocoon. The progenitor of the GD-1 stream was an accreted\nglobular cluster (GC) and: (a) the cocoon was produced by pre-accretion tidal\nstripping of the GC while it was still inside its parent dwarf galaxy; (b) the\ncocoon is debris from the parent dwarf galaxy; (c) an initially thin GC tidal\nstream was heated by impacts from dark subhalos in the Milky Way; (d) an\ninitially thin GC stream was heated by a massive Sagittarius dwarf galaxy; or a\ncombination of some these. In the first two cases the velocity dispersion and\nmean metallicity are consistent with the parent dwarf galaxy having a halo mass\nof ~0^9\\msun. Future DESI spectroscopy and detailed modeling may enable us to\ndistinguish between these possible origins.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
