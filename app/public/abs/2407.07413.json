This makes human form unique\nlanguage systems within social groups. Aligning with this, we focus on a gap\nremaining in addressing translation challenges within social groups, where\nin-group members utilize unique terminologies. We propose KpopMT dataset, which\naims to fill this gap by enabling precise terminology translation, choosing\nKpop fandom as an initiative for social groups given its global popularity.\nExpert translators provide 1k English translations for Korean posts and\ncomments, each annotated with specific terminology within social groups'\nlanguage systems. We evaluate existing translation systems including GPT models\non KpopMT to identify their failure cases. Results show overall low scores,\nunderscoring the challenges of reflecting group-specific terminologies and\nstyles in translation. We make KpopMT publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"oSgObwJxwJpL-F6sCTntZP9pOMDnaHVcgdUujd10EVI","pdfSize":"1329418"}
