However, these works are generally restricted to the\nassumption of independence and/or stationarity at its best. The main obstacle\nis that the existing Gaussian approximation results for non-stationary\nprocesses only provide an existential proof and thus they are difficult to\napply. In this paper, we provide two clear paths to construct such a Gaussian\napproximation for non-stationary series. While the first one is theoretically\nmore natural, the second one is practically implementable. Our Gaussian\napproximation results are applicable for a very large class of non-stationary\ntime series, obtain optimal rates and yet have good applicability. Building on\nsuch approximations, we also show theoretical results for change-point\ndetection and simultaneous inference in presence of non-stationary errors.\nFinally we substantiate our theoretical results with simulation studies and\nreal data analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
