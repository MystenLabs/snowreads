Olson","authorsParsed":[["Batra","Kyle",""],["Olson","Stephanie L.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2024 20:46:11 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-12","timestamp":1723149971000,"abstract":"  Ocean salinity is known to dramatically affect the climates of Earth-like\nplanets orbiting Sun-like stars, with high salinity leading to less ice and\nhigher surface temperature. However, how ocean composition impacts climate\nunder different conditions, such as around different types of stars or at\ndifferent positions within the habitable zone, has not been investigated. We\nused ROCKE-3D, an ocean-atmosphere general circulation model, to simulate how\nplanetary climate responds to ocean salinities for planets with G-star vs.\nM-dwarf hosts at several stellar fluxes. We find that increasing ocean salinity\nfrom 20 to 100 g/kg in our model results in non-linear ice reduction and\nwarming on G-star planets, sometimes causing abrupt transitions to different\nclimate states. Conversely, sea ice on M-dwarf planets responds more gradually\nand linearly to increasing salinity. Moreover, reductions in sea ice on M-dwarf\nplanets are not accompanied by significant surface warming as on G-star\nplanets. High salinity can modestly bolster the resilience of M-dwarf planets\nagainst snowball glaciation and allow these planets to retain surface liquid\nwater further from their host star, but the effects are muted compared to\nG-star planets that experience snowball bifurcation and climate hysteresis due\nto the ice-albedo feedback.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
