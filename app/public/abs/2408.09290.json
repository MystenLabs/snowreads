With optical clocks now operating on\nmobile platforms, free-space synchronization networks with compatible\nperformance and the ability to operate under platform motion are essential to\nexpand the reach of precision timing. Recently, femtosecond (fs)-level optical\ntime-transfer techniques have been developed that can operate over hundreds of\nkilometers despite atmospheric turbulence, signal fade, and dropouts. Here we\nreport a two-tone optical time transfer scheme with comparable performance that\nreduces hardware requirements and can support both fiber and free-space\nnetworks. Using this technique, sub-fs synchronization was demonstrated over a\n$\\sim$100 m free-space link for several hours. In addition, the link was used\nto syntonize two iodine optical clocks and then compare them over four days.\nThe set-up employs an integrated photonics transceiver and telecom-band lasers\nthat are compatible with full photonic integration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
