This can be interpreted as each vertex $v$ of $T$ sending\n$\\max(t-\\text{d}(u,v),0)$ signal to vertices within a distance of $t-1$ away\nfrom $v$. The signal is additive and we require that every vertex of the graph\nreceives a minimum reception $r$ from all vertices in $T$. For a finite graph\nthe smallest cardinality among all $(t,r)$ broadcast dominating sets of a graph\nis called the $(t,r)$ broadcast domination number. We remark that the $(2,1)$\nbroadcast domination number is the domination number and the $(t,1)$ (for\n$t\\geq 1$) is the distance domination number of a graph.\n  We study a family of graphs that arise as a finite subgraph of the truncated\nsquare titling, which utilizes regular squares and octagons to tile the\nEuclidean plane. For positive integers $m$ and $n$, we let $H_{m,n}$ be the\ngraph consisting of $m$ rows of $n$ octagons (cycle graph on $8$ vertices). For\nall $t\\geq 2$, we provide lower and upper bounds for the $(t,1)$ broadcast\ndomination number for $H_{m,n}$ for all $m,n\\geq 1$. We give exact $(2,1)$\nbroadcast domination numbers for $H_{m,n}$ when\n$(m,n)\\in\\{(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,2)\\}$. We also consider the infinite\ntruncated square tiling, denoted $H_{\\infty,\\infty}$, and we provide\nconstructions of infinite $(t,r)$ broadcasts for\n$(t,r)\\in\\{(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(4,1)\\}$. Using these constructions we\ngive upper bounds on the density of these broadcasts i.e., the proportion of\nvertices needed to $(t,r)$ broadcast dominate this infinite graph. We end with\nsome directions for future study.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dxFIUHu0JMhjxF1rvMkLiw0eA4soJhnW0KBFmsEHpM4","pdfSize":"8381976"}
