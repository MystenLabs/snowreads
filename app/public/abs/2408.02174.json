DDUs refer to the uncertainties impacted by the leader's\nstrategy, while the leader cannot capture their exact probability\ndistributions. To address such problems, we first use decision-dependent\nambiguity sets under moment information and Cantelli's inequality to transform\nDDCCs into second-order cone constraints. This simplifies the game model by\neliminating the probability distributions. We further prove that there exists\nat least one equilibrium point for this game by applying Kakutani's fixed-point\ntheorem. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the impact of DDUs on\nthe equilibrium of such game models.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
