While its\nrelevance in our own Solar System remains in question, the fact that the Masset\nand Snellgrove mechanism is a general hydrodynamical effect implies that it may\nhave occurred in another planetary system. In this study I searched through\nexoplanet data for evidence of the Masset and Snellgrove mechanism, which\nrequires that (1) the inner of the two planets is more massive than the outer\nplanet; (2) the planets are sufficiently massive that their gravity-induced gap\noverlaps; and (3) they orbit at sufficiently close radii that their co-rotation\nregions also overlap. The last two requirements are met when the planets orbit\nwith a 3:2 mean motion resonance. I do not find conclusive evidence for a grand\ntack-like system, but find some evidence for planet formation at the edge of a\nplanet-induced protoplanetary disk gap in three systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
