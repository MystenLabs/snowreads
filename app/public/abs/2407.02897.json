Previous studies on this apparently 'familiar' structural problem\nhave yielded controversial results, necessitating a comprehensive\nclarification. This study shows that results previously labelled as 'correct'\nor 'wrong' simply refer to different external constraints, whose presence\nbecomes necessary only for the two latter loads, (ii.) and (iii.). Moreover,\nthe paper presents the first experimental realization of a circular rod\nsubjected to centrally-directed loads. The experimental findings align with the\ntheoretical predictions and show the exploitation of a new type of load acting\non a continuous structural element. The feasibility of this load is\ndemonstrated through the use of inextensible cables and opens the way to\napplications in flexible robotics when cables are used for actuation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
