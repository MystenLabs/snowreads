The ability to track a user's motion\nand infer the identity or characteristics of the user poses a privacy risk that\nhas received significant attention. Existing deep-network-based defenses\nagainst this risk, however, require significant amounts of training data and\nhave not yet been shown to generalize beyond specific applications. In this\nwork, we study the effect of signal degradation on identifiability,\nspecifically through added noise, reduced framerate, reduced precision, and\nreduced dimensionality of the data. Our experiment shows that state-of-the-art\nidentification attacks still achieve near-perfect accuracy for each of these\ndegradations. This negative result demonstrates the difficulty of anonymizing\nthis motion data and gives some justification to the existing data- and\ncompute-intensive deep-network based methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
