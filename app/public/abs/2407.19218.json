Given the wide availability\nof numerical algorithms and high-speed computers, researchers and practitioners\noften model these separate (although possibly statistically dependent) random\nvariables by fitting a large number of parametric probability distributions to\nhistorical data and then comparing goodness-of-fit statistics. However, this\napproach is highly susceptible to problems of overfitting because it gives\ninsufficient weight to fundamental considerations of functional simplicity and\nadaptability. To address this shortcoming, we propose a formal mathematical\nmeasure for assessing the versatility of frequency and severity distributions\nprior to their application. We then illustrate this approach by computing and\ncomparing values of the versatility measure for a variety of probability\ndistributions commonly used in risk analysis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
