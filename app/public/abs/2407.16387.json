One of the reasons is the ability to\nachieve accurate navigation by using low-cost sensors. To this end, inertial\nsensors are fused with global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals. GNSS\noutages during platform operation can result in pure inertial navigation,\ncausing the navigation solution to drift. In such situations, periodic\ntrajectories with dedicated algorithms were suggested to mitigate the drift.\nWith periodic dynamics, inertial deep learning approaches can capture the\nmotion more accurately and provide accurate dead-reckoning for drones and\nmobile robots. In this paper, we propose approaches to extend deep\nlearning-assisted inertial sensing and fusion capabilities during periodic\nmotion. We begin by demonstrating that fusion between GNSS and inertial sensors\nin periodic trajectories achieves better accuracy compared to straight-line\ntrajectories. Next, we propose an empowered network architecture to accurately\nregress the change in distance of the platform. Utilizing this network, we\ndrive a hybrid approach for a neural-inertial fusion filter. Finally, we\nutilize this approach for situations when GNSS is available and show its\nbenefits. A dataset of 337 minutes of data collected from inertial sensors\nmounted on a mobile robot and a quadrotor is used to evaluate our approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
