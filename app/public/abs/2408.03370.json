An\nabundance of non-relativistic ALPs will convert to dark photons with momentum\nof order the inhomogeneities in the background field; therefore a highly\nhomogeneous field will produce non-relativistic dark photons without relying on\nany redshifting of their momenta. Taking hidden sector magnetic fields produced\nby a first order phase transition, the mechanism can reproduce the relic\nabundance of dark matter for a wide range of dark photon masses down to\n$10^{-13}$ eV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
