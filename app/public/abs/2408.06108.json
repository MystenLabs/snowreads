Gas-filled microbubbles are\ninjected into the body, where they undergo compression and rarefaction and\ninteract nonlinearly with the ultrasound waves. Therefore, the propagation of\nsound through a bubbly liquid is a strongly nonlinear problem that can be\nmodeled by a nonlinear acoustic wave equation for the propagation of the\npressure waves coupled via the source terms to a nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equation of Rayleigh-Plesset type for the bubble dynamics. In this\nwork, we first derive a hierarchy of such coupled models based on constitutive\nlaws. We then focus on the coupling of Westervelt's acoustic equation to\nRayleigh-Plesset type equations, where we rigorously show the existence of\nsolutions locally in time under suitable conditions on the initial\npressure-microbubble data and final time. Thirdly, we devise and discuss\nnumerical experiments on both single-bubble dynamics and the interaction of\nmicrobubbles with ultrasound waves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
