Further, we show that if a system has mean\nstability, then (1) for each $z\\in \\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence\n$\\gamma =(\\gamma _{n})_{n=1}^{\\infty }$ of maps, the Lyapunov exponents of\n$\\gamma $ at $z$ are negative, (2) there are only finitely many minimal sets of\nthe system, (3) each minimal set is attracting, and (4) for each $z\\in\n\\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\\gamma $ of maps, the orbit $\\{\n\\gamma _{n}\\cdots \\gamma _{1}(z) \\} _{n=1}^{\\infty }$ tends to one of the\nminimal sets of the system. Note that (1)--(4) cannot hold for any\ndeterministic iteration dynamical system of a single complex generalized\nH\\'{e}non map. We observe many new phenomena in random dynamical systems of\npolynomial automorphisms of $\\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and observe the mechanisms. We\nprovide new strategies and methods to study higher-dimensional random\nholomorphic dynamical systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
