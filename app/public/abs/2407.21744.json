This work demonstrates the need for\ndetailed reliability assessment for quantitative comparison of the reliability\nbenefits of energy storage and traditional transmission investments. First, a\nmixed-integer linear programming expansion planning model considering candidate\ntransmission lines and storage technologies is solved to find the least-cost\ninvestment decisions. Next, operations under the resulting system configuration\nare simulated in a probabilistic reliability assessment which accounts for\nweather-dependent forced outages. The outcome of this work, when applied to\nTPPs, is to further equalize the consideration of energy storage compared to\ntraditional transmission assets by capturing the value of storage for system\nreliability.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
