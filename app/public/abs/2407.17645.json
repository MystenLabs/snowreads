We performed an extensive study based on\ncombinatorial purged cross-validation over several datasets and compared our\nresults to both traditional and deep-learning-based methods for portfolio\nselection. Compared to state-of-the-art deep-learning methods such as\nLong-Short Term Memory networks and Transformers, we find that the proposed\napproach performs on par or better, while providing faster training times and\nbetter stability. Our results show that Modern Hopfield Networks represent a\npromising approach to portfolio optimization, allowing for an efficient,\nscalable, and robust solution for asset allocation, risk management, and\ndynamic rebalancing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B8mAc5h9Dt8VQRlZqF49NvwQpGz5WN9KKZQ6xDTqo4c","pdfSize":"3962366","objectId":"0x4b0101ffc857573caaf4a54b30b849727d01b1403345a0985d52c1006be4e9d8","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
