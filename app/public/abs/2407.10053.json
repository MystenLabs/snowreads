We currently do not fully know the factors that drive\nolder adults to either engage in or abstain from exergaming. Large-scale\nstudies investigating this are still scarce, particularly those studying East\nAsian older adults. To address this, we interviewed 64 older adults from China,\nJapan, and South Korea about their attitudes toward exergames. Most\nparticipants viewed exergames with a positive inquisitiveness. However,\nsocio-cultural factors can obstruct this curiosity. Our study shows that\nperceptions of aging, lifestyle, the presence of support networks, and the\ncultural relevance of game mechanics are the crucial factors influencing their\nexergame engagement. Thus, we stress the value of socio-cultural sensitivity in\ngame design and urge the HCI community to adopt more diverse design practices.\nWe provide several design suggestions for creating more culturally approachable\nexergames.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
