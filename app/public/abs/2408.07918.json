However, guaranteeing the stability of the estimated system matrix\nis a major issue. Existing stability-guaranteed algorithms are computationally\nexpensive, require several tuning parameters, and scale badly to high state\ndimensions. Here, we develop a new algorithm that is closed-form and requires\nno tuning parameters. It is thus computationally cheap and scales easily to\nhigh state dimensions. We also prove its consistency under reasonable\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
