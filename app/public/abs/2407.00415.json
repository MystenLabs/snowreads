In both cases, our analysis considers two scenarios: one in\nwhich the torsion vector transforms in an affine way, i.e., it is a gauge\npotential for Weyl transformations, and the other in which it is invariant\nunder the Weyl group. An important outcome for the former case in both $d=2,4$\nis the presence of anomalies of a \"mixed\" nature in relation to the\nclassification of Deser and Schwimmer. For invariant torsion in $d=4$, we also\nfind a new type of anomaly which we dub $\\Psi$-anomaly. Taking these results\ninto account, we integrate the different anomalies to obtain renormalized\nanomalous effective actions. Thereafter, we recast such actions in the\ncovariant nonlocal and local forms, the latter being easier to work with. Along\nthe way, we pause to comment on the physical usefulness of these effective\nactions, in particular to obtain renormalized energy-momentum tensors and\nthermodynamics of $2d$ black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
