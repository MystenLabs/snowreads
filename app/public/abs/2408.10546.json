The\nmain aim of this article is to find the linear equations for these three\ndifferential forms. Then we define a map which is called \"differential version\"\nof Fontaine's map to express the equations in a computable way. Finally, we\nprove that the coefficients in the equation can be expressed in some polynomial\nforms and compute some examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
