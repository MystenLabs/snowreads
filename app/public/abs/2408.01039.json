In particular, we are\ninterested in the real-time dynamics of the reduced density operator. In our\nalgorithm, we use frozen Gaussian approximation to approximate the wave\nfunction as a wave packet in integral form. The desired reduced density\noperator is then written as a Dyson series, which is the series expression of\npath integrals in quantum mechanics of interacting systems. To compute the\nDyson series, we further approximate each term in the series using Gaussian\nwave packets, and then employ the idea of the inchworm method to accelerate the\nconvergence of the series. The inchworm method formulates the series as an\nintegro-differential equation of \"full propagators\", and rewrites the infinite\nseries on the right-hand side using these full propagators, so that the number\nof terms in the sum can be significantly reduced, and faster convergence can be\nachieved. The performance of our algorithm is verified numerically by various\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
