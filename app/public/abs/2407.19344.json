Let $P_{m\n\\times n}(z)$ denote its domination polynomial, i.e., $\\sum_{S \\subseteq V}\nz^{|S|}$ where the sum is over all dominating sets $S$. We prove that $P_{m\n\\times n}(-1) = (-1)^{\\lceil m/2\\rceil \\lceil n/2\\rceil}$. In particular, the\nnumber of dominating sets of even size and the number of odd size differs by\n$\\pm 1$. %The numbers can not be equal because the total number of dominating\nsets is always odd. This property does not hold for king graphs on a cylinder\nor a torus, or for the grid graph. But it holds for $d$-dimensional kings,\nwhere $P_{n_1\\times n_2\\times\\cdots\\times n_d}(-1) = (-1)^{\\lceil n_1/2\\rceil\n\\lceil n_2/2\\rceil\\cdots \\lceil n_d/2\\rceil}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CTTqPpwK7ztXC6gtcERsLYd-PS1Ye1d2kfvDZuNbslU","pdfSize":"306453"}
