Lattice studies of the SU(2)\nYang--Mills theory determined the corresponding (Coulomb) string tension for\nsources in the fundamental representation, $\\sigma_{C}$, to be about three\ntimes larger than the Wilson loop string tension, $\\sigma_F$. It is far above\nthe Zwanziger variational bound, $\\sigma_C \\geq \\sigma_F$. We argue that the\nvalue established in the literature is artificially inflated. We examine the\nlattice definition of the instantaneous potential, find the source of the\nstring tension's enhancement, and perform its improved determination in SU(2)\nlattice gauge theory. We report our conservative estimate for the value of the\nCoulomb string tension as $\\sigma_C/\\sigma_F = 2.0 \\pm 0.4$ and discuss its\nphenomenological implications.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JEJuZbS0HXv_Br70bPjkczmOf-BuABlZHQmao_HuNYs","pdfSize":"5174698"}
