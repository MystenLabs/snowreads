A\nmodified stochastic convex integration scheme, using Beltrami flows as building\nblocks and propagating inductive estimates both pathwise and in expectation,\nplays a pivotal role to improve the regularity of H\\\"older continuous solutions\nfor the underlying equations. As a main novelty with respect to the related\nliterature, our result produces solutions with noteworthy H\\\"older exponents.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
