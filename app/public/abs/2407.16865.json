For\none-dimensional cases where the bifurcation creates or destroys only fixed\npoints and period-two orbits, we show that the standard local equivalence of\nnormal forms, topological conjugacy, can be replaced by differentiable\nconjugacy provided an extra term is added to the normal form. In these cases\ntopological conjugacy is so weak that a range of values can be used for the\ncoefficients in the normal form. The extension to differentiable conjugacy\nexplains why the usual choice of slopes in the standard normal form is\nprivileged. This highlights the importance of differentiable conjugacies and\nthe need for extended normal forms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
