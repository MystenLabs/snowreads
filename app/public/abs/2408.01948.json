Our\nhybrid-particle-in-cell simulations, incorporating the newly-developed model of\nlarge-angle collisions, suggest this could be attributed to the increased\nsignificance of large-angle collisions among DT ions and \\(\\alpha\\)-particles\nin the burning plasma. Extensive investigations into the implications of\nlarge-angle collisions in the burning plasma have yield several key findings,\nincluding an ignition moment promotion by \\(\\sim 10\\, {\\rm ps}\\), the presence\nof supra-thermal ions below an energy threshold, and a hotspot expansion rate\nabout six times faster than expected. Furthermore, we have established the\ncongruency between the NIF neutron spectral moment analysis and our\nsimulations. Our researches on large-angle collisions in burning plasmas offer\nnew insights for experiment interpretation and update our understanding for new\ndesigns of inertial confinement fusions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
