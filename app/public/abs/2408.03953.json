The sampling strategy of the calibration plots may\ndirectly affect predictions and map qualities. The aim of this manuscript is to\nevaluate models transferability at different spatial scales according to the\nsampling efforts and the calibration domain of these models. Forest inventory\nplots from locals and regionals networks were used to calibrate randomForest\n(RF) models for stand basal area predictions. Auxiliary data from ALS flights\nand a Sentinel-2 image were used. Model transferability was assessed by\ncomparing models developed over a given area and applied elsewhere.\nPerformances were measured in terms of precision (RMSE and bias), coefficient\nof determination (R2) and the proportion of extrapolated predictions. Regional\nnetworks were also thinned to evaluate the effect of sampling efforts on\nmodels' performances. Local models showed large bias and extrapolation issues\nwhen applied elsewhere. Local issues of regional models were also observed,\nraising transferability and extrapolation concerns. An increase in sampling\nefforts was shown to reduce extrapolation issues. The outcoming results of this\nstudy underline the importance of considering models' validity domain while\nproducing forest attribute maps, since their transferability is of crucial\nimportance from a forest management perspective.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
