The tadpole forming\nclimate records the poorly understood drying of Mars since the Early Hesperian.\nA third of tadpole craters have multiple breaches, therefore a process is\nneeded that was able to generate crater rim incision in multiple locations. We\nuse HiRISE data for four multiple breach tadpole craters to measure their\ncrater fill, rims, and exit breaches. We compare these measurements and other\ndata to our calculations of liquid water supply by rain, surface melting,\ngroundwater discharge, and basal ice sheet melting to discriminate between four\nproposed formation hypotheses for tadpole breaches, favoring scenarios with\nice-filled craters and supraglacial melting. We conclude that multiple breach\ntadpole craters record hundreds of meters of mid-latitude ice and climate\nconditions enabling intermittent melting in the Late Hesperian and Amazonian,\nsuggesting that liquid water on Mars has been available in association with\nwater ice for billions of years.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sD4kdJYj3hGyseGMIuGcuxV-pCWZzSylBgVA5uQ3Cx4","pdfSize":"82215777"}
