However, these instruments are heavily impacted by small\nwavefront aberrations and require the minimization of starlight residuals\ndirectly in the focal plane. State-of-the art wavefront control methods suffer\nfrom errors in the underlying physical models, and often require several\niterations to minimize the intensity in the dark hole, limiting performance and\nreducing effective observation time. This study aims at developing a\ndata-driven method to create a dark hole in post-coronagraphic images. For this\npurpose, we leverage the model-free capabilities of reinforcement learning to\ntrain an agent to learn a control strategy directly from phase diversity images\nacquired around the focal plane. Initial findings demonstrate successful\naberration correction in non-coronagraphic simulations and promising results\nfor dark hole creation in post-coronagraphic scenarios. These results highlight\nthe potential of model-free reinforcement learning for dark-hole creation,\njustifying further investigation and eventually experimental validation on a\ndedicated testbed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
