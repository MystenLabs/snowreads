This prompts us to make a conjecture\nrelating finite nuclear dimension of group C*-algebras and finite Hirsch\nlength, which we then verify for a class of elementary amenable groups beyond\nthe virtually polycyclic case. In particular, we give the first examples of\nfinitely generated, non-residually finite groups with finite nuclear dimension.\nA parallel conjecture on finite decomposition rank is also formulated and an\nanalogous result is obtained. Our method relies heavily on recent work of\nHirshberg and the second named author on actions of virtually nilpotent groups\non $C_0(X)$-algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"a2qwkFFZ9gyUmgHp-6_xj4XVUJZGQXMYHRAakPwI5gA","pdfSize":"472427"}
