To analyze this problem, we\nhave developed a new dataset consisting of more than 750,000 human-written\nparagraphs, with a corresponding chatbot-generated paragraph for each. Based on\nthis dataset, we apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to determine the origin\nof text (human or chatbot). Specifically, we consider two methodologies for\ntackling this issue: feature analysis and embeddings. Our feature analysis\napproach involves extracting a collection of features from the text for\nclassification. We also explore the use of contextual embeddings and\ntransformer-based architectures to train classification models. Our proposed\nsolutions offer high classification accuracy and serve as useful tools for\ntextual analysis, resulting in a better understanding of chatbot-generated text\nin this era of advanced AI technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wbVEMuAX5QWqstCva1ChxYY5Ez3Jj6RTUhxgzfFK_zU","pdfSize":"1296131"}
