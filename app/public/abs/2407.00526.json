We provide evidence that this\nis part of a general phenomenon in which minimal free resolutions, for distinct\nBetti tables, contain subcomplexes depending on wall-crossing. From this\nviewpoint, we provide new computations of the movable cones and Mori\ndecompositions of some moduli spaces of sheaves using syzygies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
