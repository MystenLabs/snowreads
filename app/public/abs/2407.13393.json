We uncover the properties of this NESS via direct\nnumerical simulations (DNSs) of cellular flows in the\nCahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations for binary fluids. We show that,\nin this NESS, the shell-averaged energy spectrum $E(k)$ is spread over several\ndecades in the wavenumber $k$ and it exhibits a power-law region, indicative of\nturbulence but without a conventional inertial cascade. To characterize the\nstatistical properties of this turbulence, we compute, in addition to $E(k)$,\nthe time series $e(t)$ of the kinetic energy and its power spectrum,\nscale-by-scale energy transfer as a function of $k$, and the energy dissipation\nresulting from interfacial stresses. Furthermore, we analyze the mixing\nproperties of this low-Reynolds-number turbulence via the mean-square\ndisplacement (MSD) of Lagrangian tracer particles, for which we demonstrate\ndiffusive behavior at long times, a hallmark of strong mixing in turbulent\nflows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IScHADxatPbrbGzgQaQ41yKApsNGIDDazKdYL3Mk1vU","pdfSize":"10501003"}
