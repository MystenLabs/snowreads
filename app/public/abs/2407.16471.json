We show that both requirements are\naccomplished in the paradigmatic model of a harmonic oscillator strongly\ncoupled to a highly non-Markovian thermal reservoir. At short times, a\ndynamical blockade of the reservoir prevents the leakage of energy towards its\ndegrees of freedom, promoting a significant accumulation of energy in the\nbattery with high efficiency. The possibility of implementing these conditions\nin $LC$ quantum circuits opens up new avenues for solid-state quantum\nbatteries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
