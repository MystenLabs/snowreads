The magnetic field is measured with the\nmagnetic sensor of a smartphone together with a suitable app, using the Android\noperating system. The main objective is to determine the dependence of the\nx-component of the magnetic field with distance and compare with the\ntheoretical result that tells us that this dependence is a quintic decrease.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
