The coordinates enable the\ntransformation of the input polynomial curves into polynomial curves of any\norder. We extend the classical 2D Green coordinates to define our coordinates,\nthereby leading to cage-aware conformal harmonic deformations. We extensively\ntest our method on various 2D deformations, allowing users to manipulate the\n\\Bezier control points to easily generate the desired deformation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
