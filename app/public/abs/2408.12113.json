To enhance risk analysis in CRM, this paper\ncombines the advantages of quantile region convolutional neural network-long\nshort-term memory (QRCNN-LSTM) and cross-attention mechanisms for modeling. The\nQRCNN-LSTM model combines sequence modeling with deep learning architectures\ncommonly used in natural language processing tasks, enabling the capture of\nboth local and global dependencies in sequence data. The cross-attention\nmechanism enhances interactions between different input data parts, allowing\nthe model to focus on specific areas or features relevant to CRM risk analysis.\nBy applying QRCNN-LSTM and cross-attention mechanisms to CRM risk analysis,\nempirical evidence demonstrates that this approach can effectively identify\npotential risks and provide data-driven support for business decisions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
