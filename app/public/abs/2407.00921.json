These limitations restrict the practical\ndeployment of GNNs, notably in resource-constrained environments. To address\nthese issues, this study introduce <b>Point<\\b> <b>Vi<\\b>sion <b>G<\\b>NN\n(PointViG), an efficient framework for point cloud analysis. PointViG\nincorporates a lightweight graph convolutional module to efficiently aggregate\nlocal features and mitigate over-smoothing. For large-scale point cloud scenes,\nwe propose an adaptive dilated graph convolution technique that searches for\nsparse neighboring nodes within a dilated neighborhood based on semantic\ncorrelation, thereby expanding the receptive field and ensuring computational\nefficiency. Experiments demonstrate that PointViG achieves performance\ncomparable to state-of-the-art models while balancing performance and\ncomplexity. On the ModelNet40 classification task, PointViG achieved 94.3%\naccuracy with 1.5M parameters. For the S3DIS segmentation task, it achieved an\nmIoU of 71.7% with 5.3M parameters. These results underscore the potential and\nefficiency of PointViG in point cloud analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
