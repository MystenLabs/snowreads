Hence, efficient trajectory adjustment is needed to ensure successful\ntravel. However, it is often prohibitive or impossible to recalculate the\noptimal control in-transit due to strict time constraints or limited onboard\ncomputing resources. Thus, we propose a framework for quick and accurate\ntrajectory approximations by using post-optimality sensitivity information.\nThis allows the reduction of uncertain parameter space and an instantaneous\napproximation of the new optimal controller while using sensitivity data\ncomputed and stored pretransit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
