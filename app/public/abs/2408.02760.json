In recent years, Random Convolutional\nKernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective\ntime series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art\naccuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these\ntypes of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1)\nthey struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2)\nthey are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based\nalgorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to\naddress these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide\nan integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better\naccuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time\nseries classification dataset in which we control the amount of information\ncarried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to\ncorrectly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two\nreal-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that\nDetach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance\nand competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw\nbrain data, without the need for feature engineering.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
