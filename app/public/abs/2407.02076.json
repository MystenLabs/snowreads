The basis of master\nintegrals contains both (modified) Bessel functions, and solutions of\ninhomogeneous Bessel equations with Bessel-function sources. We show how to\nexpress the latter in terms of Meijer G functions. The low-frequency expansion\nof our results is checked againg existing classical soft theorems. We also\ncomplete our previous results on the $O(G^2)$ bremsstrahlung waveform by\ncomputing the $O(G^3)$ spectral densities of radiated energy and momentum, in\nthe rest frame of one body, at the thirtieth order in velocity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
