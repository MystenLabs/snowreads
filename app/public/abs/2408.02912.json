Inspired\nby the findings from cognitive neuroscience that task decomposition could\nfacilitate cognitive processing for efficient learning, we hypothesize that an\nagent could estimate precise task-aware imitation rewards for efficient online\nexploration by decomposing the target task into the objectives of \"what to do\"\nand the mechanisms of \"how to do\". In this work, we introduce the hybrid\nKey-state guided Online Imitation (KOI) learning approach, which leverages the\nintegration of semantic and motion key states as guidance for task-aware reward\nestimation. Initially, we utilize the visual-language models to segment the\nexpert trajectory into semantic key states, indicating the objectives of \"what\nto do\". Within the intervals between semantic key states, optical flow is\nemployed to capture motion key states to understand the process of \"how to do\".\nBy integrating a thorough grasp of both semantic and motion key states, we\nrefine the trajectory-matching reward computation, encouraging task-aware\nexploration for efficient online imitation learning. Our experiment results\nprove that our method is more sample efficient in the Meta-World and LIBERO\nenvironments. We also conduct real-world robotic manipulation experiments to\nvalidate the efficacy of our method, demonstrating the practical applicability\nof our KOI method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
