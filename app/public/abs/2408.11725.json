Inference is often carried out within a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework. Nonetheless, it is well-known that\nthe computational time for this set of models increases quadratically with the\nnumber of nodes. In this work, we build on the Random-Scan (RS) approach to\npropose an MCMC strategy that alleviates the computational burden for LS models\nwhile maintaining the benefits of a general-purpose technique. We call this\nnovel strategy Multiple RS (MRS). This strategy is effective in reducing the\ncomputational cost by a factor without severe consequences on the MCMC draws.\nMoreover, we introduce a novel adaptation strategy that consists of a\nprobabilistic update of the set of latent coordinates of each node. Our\nAdaptive MRS adapts the acceptance rate of the Metropolis step to adjust the\nprobability of updating the latent coordinates. We show via simulation that the\nAdaptive MRS approach performs better than MRS in terms of mixing. Finally, we\napply our algorithm to a multi-layer temporal LS model and show how our\nadaptive strategy may be beneficial to empirical applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
