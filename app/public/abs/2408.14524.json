Let $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\theta)$\nbe a number field and $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ be the ring of integers of $K.$ In this\narticle, we characterize all the prime divisors of the discriminant of $f(x)$\nwhich do not divide the index of $f(x).$ As a fascinating corollary, we deduce\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the monogenity of the field\n$K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\theta),$ where $\\theta$ is associated with certain\nquadrinomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FIljmXJSekzkME-InJYWcVSJHgxrops0T3Wii37Z46Q","pdfSize":"191565"}
