Here\nwe report on first time, RPJs formed with vacuum-evaporated carbon (eC)\nfollowed by Au as top electrode set on a single bilayer of bacteriorhodopsin\n(bR), self-assembled from so-lution on an Au substrate. The light-induced\nphotocycle of bR, as well as the amide I & II vibrational frequencies of bR,\nwere unchanged upon eC deposition; the yield of the resulting junctions was\nreproducible ~ 90 % (non-shorted), and they were stable between ~ 10 and 300K.\nThe current-voltage characteristics of these junc-tions were\ntemperature-independent and the junctions were stable for several months.\nHence, such robust all-solid-state protein junctions provide valuable tools for\ninvestigating the potential use of proteins in future bio-molecular electronic\nde-vices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
