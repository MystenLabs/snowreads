However, it has\nreceived inadequate scholarly attention, leading to limited exploration. This\npaper introduces Self-Initiated Explorable (SelfIE) instructions, a new design\nconcept aiming at enabling users to navigate instructions flexibly by blending\nlinear and non-linear access according to individual needs and situations\nduring tasks. Using a Wizard-of-Oz protocol, we initially embodied SelfIE\ninstructions within a toy-block assembly context and compared it with baseline\ninstructions offering linear-only access (N=21). Results show a 71% increase in\nuser preferences due to its ease of reflecting individual differences,\nempirically supporting the prior proposal. Besides, our observations identify\nthree strategies for flexible access and suggest the potential of enhancing the\nuser experience by considering cognitive processes and implementing flexible\naccess in a wearable configuration. Following the design phase, we translated\nthe WoZ-based design embodiment as working prototypes on the tablet and OHMD to\nassess usability and compare user experience between the two configurations\n(N=8). Our data yields valuable insights into managing the trade-offs between\nthe two configurations, thereby facilitating more effective flexible access\ndevelopment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
