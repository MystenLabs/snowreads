Properly selecting components for verification is important for\nefficiency, yet has received comparatively less attention. In this paper, we\naddress this gap with a novel compositional verification framework that focuses\non component selection as an explicit, first-class concept. The framework\ndecomposes a system into components, which we then recompose into new\ncomponents for efficient verification. At the heart of our technique is the\nrecomposition map that determines how recomposition is performed; the component\nselection problem thus reduces to finding a good recomposition map. However,\nthe space of possible recomposition maps can be large. We therefore propose\nheuristics to find a small portfolio of recomposition maps, which we then run\nin parallel. We implemented our techniques in a model checker for the TLA+\nlanguage. In our experiments, we show that our tool achieves competitive\nperformance with TLC-a well-known model checker for TLA+-on a benchmark suite\nof distributed protocols.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PefxCERFDh5FMbuVnkT9GK59wa7RZIVJYAdEeif8IoI","pdfSize":"555223"}
