Although some\nprobabilistic models are known to exhibit positive or negative dependence, it\nis challenging to seamlessly bridge them with a practicable probabilistic\nmodel. In this study, we introduce a new family of distributions, named the\ndiscrete kernel point process (DKPP), which includes determinantal point\nprocesses and parts of Boltzmann machines. We also develop some computational\nmethods for probabilistic operations and inference with DKPPs, such as\ncalculating marginal and conditional probabilities and learning the parameters.\nOur numerical experiments demonstrate the controllability of positive and\nnegative dependence and the effectiveness of the computational methods for\nDKPPs.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KsyuToc2KqBsHeJ1_GvMsOx9B4WTWX1_AYDNo2k2T8E","pdfSize":"1791275","txDigest":"44Gt6w6H4J85w1d2a26SNdFZMwo8dTGtQxekGv8pUFU4","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
