We introduce\ninteger invariants of almost embeddings: winding number, cyclic and triodic Wu\nnumbers. We construct almost embeddings realizing some values of these\ninvariants. We prove some relations between the invariants. We study values\nrealizable as invariants of some almost embedding, but not of any embedding.\n  This paper is expository and is accessible to mathematicians not specialized\nin the area (and to students). However elementary, this paper is motivated by\nfrontline of research.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
