Previous\napproaches have predominantly focused on either replaying object relationships\nor actor trajectories. The former often struggles to generalize across diverse\ntasks, while the latter suffers from data inefficiency. Moreover, both\nmethodologies encounter challenges in capturing invisible physical attributes,\nsuch as forces. In this paper, we propose to interpret video demonstrations\nthrough Parameterized Symbolic Abstraction Graphs (PSAG), where nodes represent\nobjects and edges denote relationships between objects. We further ground\ngeometric constraints through simulation to estimate non-geometric, visually\nimperceptible attributes. The augmented PSAG is then applied in real robot\nexperiments. Our approach has been validated across a range of tasks, such as\nCutting Avocado, Cutting Vegetable, Pouring Liquid, Rolling Dough, and Slicing\nPizza. We demonstrate successful generalization to novel objects with distinct\nvisual and physical properties.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1JpKQyiCOwibZuIVyJpgkzum0_vOdh2gSq4nSYdFfdo","pdfSize":"22720766"}
