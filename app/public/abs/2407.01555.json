This study delves into the\nfactors influencing Airbnb pricing in major European cities, employing a\ncomprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. We utilize advanced regression\ntechniques, including linear, polynomial, and random forest models, to analyze\na diverse array of determinants, such as location characteristics, property\ntypes, and host-related factors. Our findings reveal nuanced insights into the\nvariables most significantly impacting pricing, highlighting the varying roles\nof geographical, structural, and host-specific attributes. This research not\nonly sheds light on the complex pricing landscape of Airbnb accommodations in\nEurope but also offers valuable implications for hosts seeking to optimize\npricing strategies and for travelers aiming to understand pricing trends.\nFurthermore, the study contributes to the broader discourse on pricing\nmechanisms in the shared economy, suggesting avenues for future research in\nthis rapidly evolving sector.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
