Our approach relies on generating many candidate coordinates by\nsubsampling the data and varying hyperparameters of the embedding algorithm\n(e.g., manifold learning). We then identify a subset of representative\nembeddings by clustering the collection of candidate coordinates and using\nshape descriptors from topological data analysis. The final output is the\nembedding obtained as an average of the representative embeddings using\ngeneralized Procrustes analysis. We validate our algorithm on both synthetic\ndata and experimental measurements from genomics, demonstrating robustness to\nnoise and outliers.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
