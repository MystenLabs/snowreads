Although recent works have\nshown the existence of differentially private sublinear algorithms for many\nproblems including graph parameter estimation and clustering, little is known\nregarding hardness results on these algorithms. In this paper, we initiate the\nstudy of lower bounds for problems that aim for both differentially-private and\nsublinear-time algorithms. Our main result is the incompatibility of both the\ndesiderata in the general case. In particular, we prove that a simple problem\nbased on one-way marginals yields both a differentially-private algorithm, as\nwell as a sublinear-time algorithm, but does not admit a ``strictly''\nsublinear-time algorithm that is also differentially private.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
