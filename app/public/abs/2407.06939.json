To this\nend, we proposed Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation as a key benchmark task\nfor robotics: finding any object in a novel environment and placing it on any\nreceptacle surface within that environment. We organized a NeurIPS 2023\ncompetition featuring both simulation and real-world components to evaluate\nsolutions to this task. Our baselines on the most challenging version of this\ntask, using real perception in simulation, achieved only an 0.8% success rate;\nby the end of the competition, the best participants achieved an 10.8\\% success\nrate, a 13x improvement. We observed that the most successful teams employed a\nvariety of methods, yet two common threads emerged among the best solutions:\nenhancing error detection and recovery, and improving the integration of\nperception with decision-making processes. In this paper, we detail the results\nand methodologies used, both in simulation and real-world settings. We discuss\nthe lessons learned and their implications for future research. Additionally,\nwe compare performance in real and simulated environments, emphasizing the\nnecessity for robust generalization to novel settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
