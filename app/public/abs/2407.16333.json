By extending our prior result for $\\Gamma$ of the first kind to\narbitrary Fuchsian group $\\Gamma$, we obtain that a measured foliation\n$\\mathcal{F}$ is realized by the horizontal foliation of a finite-area\nholomorphic quadratic differential on $X$ if and only if $\\mathcal{F}$ has\nfinite Dirichlet integral. We determine the image of this correspondence when\nthe infinite Riemann surface has bounded geometry -- an extension of the\nrealization result of Hubbard and Masur for compact surfaces. A corollary is\nthat a planar surface $X$ with bounded pants decomposition and with (at most)\ncountably many ends is parabolic, i.e., does not support Green's function, in\nnotation $X\\in O_G$ where $G$ is Green's function. The class of harmonic\nfunctions with finite Dirichlet integral is denoted by $HD$. We give a\ngeometric proof that the class $O_{HD}$ of the Riemann surfaces (that do not\nsupport non-constant $HD$-functions) is invariant under quasiconformal maps.\nLyons proved that the $O_{HB}$ class (surfaces that do not support non-constant\nbounded harmonic functions) is not invariant under quasiconformal maps, and it\nis well-known that the $O_G$ class is invariant. Therefore, the noninvariant\nclass $O_{HB}$ is between two invariant classes: $O_G\\subset O_{HB}\\subset\nO_{HD}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
