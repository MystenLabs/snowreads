The photon energy of the two spectral\nregions can, in principle, be separated by several orders of magnitude.\nHowever, quantum imaging with undetected photons has so far only been\ndemonstrated in spectral regions of similar order of magnitude in frequency\n(and for which cameras are commercially available). Here, we demonstrate\namplitude- and phase-sensitive imaging in the terahertz spectral region (1.5\nTHz center frequency) by detecting only visible photons (center wavelength\n662.2 nm, 452.7 THz center frequency) more than two orders of magnitude apart.\nAs a result, terahertz spectral information can be reliably detected with a\nstandard CMOS camera without cooling, achieving a spatial resolution close to\nthe wavelength. By taking advantage of quantum distillation in a nonlinear\ninterferometer, the influence of ubiquitous thermal terahertz photons can be\nneglected. Our results are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the\nimaging process and demonstrate the huge potential of this method to address\notherwise challenging spectral regions where cameras do not exist.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
