Building on previous comprehensive assessments of\nefficient methods for infrared (IR) spectroscopy, this study investigates the\npredictive accuracy and computational efficiency of gas-phase IR spectra\ncalculations, accessible through a combination of modern semiempirical quantum\nmechanical and transferable machine learning potentials. A composite approach\nfor IR spectra prediction based on the doubly-harmonic approximation, utilizing\nharmonic vibrational frequencies in combination squared derivatives of the\nmolecular dipole moment, is employed. This approach allows for methodical\nflexibility in the calculation of IR intensities from molecular dipoles and the\ncorresponding vibrational modes. Various methods are systematically tested to\nsuggest a suitable protocol with an emphasis on computational efficiency. Among\nthese methods, semiempirical extended tight-binding (xTB) models, classical\ncharge equilibrium models, and machine learning potentials trained for dipole\nmoment prediction are assessed across a diverse dataset of organic molecules.\nWe particularly focus on the recently reported machine learning potential\nMACE-OFF23 to address the accuracy limitations of conventional low-cost quantum\nmechanical and force-field methods. This study aims to establish a standard for\nthe efficient computational prediction of IR spectra, facilitating the rapid\nand reliable identification of unknown compounds and advancing automated\nanalytical workflows in chemistry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
