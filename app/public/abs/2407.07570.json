Similarly as \\'Esik and Kuich, we\nassume that the finite semiring of weights is commutative, partially ordered\nand zero-bounded, but we also assume that it is integral. We argue that\nfinitely weighted Kleene algebra with tests is a natural framework for\nequational reasoning about weighted programs in cases where an upper bound on\nadmissible weights is assumed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
