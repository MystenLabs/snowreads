Frequently these constitute the most\nsignificant or least significant part of the value, for example when computing\ninitial values or refinement steps in iterative approximation schemes. Other\nsituations require the middle portion. In this paper we provide algorithms for\nthe general problem of computing a given span of coefficients within a product,\nthat is the terms within a range of degrees for univariate polynomials or range\ndigits of an integer. This generalizes the \"middle product\" concept of Hanrot,\nQuercia and Zimmerman. We are primarily interested in problems of modest size\nwhere constant speed up factors can improve overall system performance, and\ntherefore focus the discussion on classical and Karatsuba multiplication and\nhow methods may be combined.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
