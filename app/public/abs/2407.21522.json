We do not assume that the\nequipotential photon surface is outward directed or non-degenerate and hence\ncover not only the positive but also the negative and the zero mass case which\nhas not yet been treated in the literature. Our results partially reproduce and\nextend beyond results by Cederbaum and by Cederbaum and Galloway. In the\npositive and negative mass cases, we give three proofs which are based on the\napproaches to proving black hole uniqueness by Israel, Robinson, and\nAgostiniani--Mazzieri, respectively. In the zero mass case, we give four\nproofs. One is based on the positive mass theorem, the second one is inspired\nby Israel's approach and in particular leads to a new proof of the Willmore\ninequality in $(\\mathbb{R}^3, \\delta)$, under a technical assumption. The\nremaining two proofs are inspired by proofs of the Willmore inequality by\nCederbaum and Miehe and by Agostiniani and Mazzieri, respectively. In\nparticular, this suggests to view the Willmore inequality and its rigidity case\nas a zero mass version of equipotential photon surface uniqueness.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
