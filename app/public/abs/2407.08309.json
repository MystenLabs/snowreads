We show it to be mild. We also\nrevisit the launch power optimization 3-dB rule. We find that using it is\npossible but not advisable due to increased GSNR non-uniformity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SVz89FfZ_1wpH_J5kvl1J3iolZs8mSx9maFcF0_nyog","pdfSize":"473761"}
