We establish that all derivations of these algebras are automatically\ncontinuous. By introducing a novel computational approach, we demonstrate that\nthe first Hochschild cohomology group of $\\mathfrak{A}_{\\Lambda}$ with\ncoefficients in $\\mathfrak{L}_{\\Lambda}$ is zero. Utilizing the Ces\\`aro\noperators and conditional expectations, we show that the first normal\ncohomology group of $\\mathfrak{L}_{\\Lambda}$ is trivial. Finally, we prove that\nthe higher cohomology groups of the non-commutative disc algebras with\ncoefficients in the complex field vanish when $|\\Lambda|<\\infty$. These methods\nextend to compute the cohomology groups of a specific class of operator\nalgebras generated by the left regular representations of cancellative\nsemigroups, which notably include Thompson's semigroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
