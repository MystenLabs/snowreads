This paper describes a\ntechnology probe, Hug Reports, that provides users a communication affordance\nwithin their code editors, through which users can convey appreciation to\ncontributors of packages they use. In our field study, 18 users interacted with\nthe probe for 3 weeks, resulting in messages of appreciation to 550\ncontributors, 26 of whom participated in subsequent research. Our findings show\nhow locating a communication affordance within the code editor, and allowing\nusers to express appreciation in terms of the abstractions they are exposed to\n(packages, modules, functions), can support exchanges of appreciation that are\nmeaningful to users and contributors. Findings also revealed the moments in\nwhich users expressed appreciation, the two meanings that appreciation took on\n-- as a measure of utility and as an act of expressive communication -- and how\ncontributors' reactions to appreciation were influenced by their perceived\nlevel of contribution. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities and\nchallenges for designing appreciation systems for open source in particular,\nand peer production communities more generally.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"S9o_80ym6aTUjYEbZ4qkgZ4xXWuU4AjudaG_BK-G4DI","pdfSize":"2499645"}
