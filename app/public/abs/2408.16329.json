Predicated on the comparative analysis between estimated and actual\nproperties, the study strives to validate the efficacy of this proposed\ntechnique; focusing notably on the computation of bandgap energy. It is\nobserved that preceding methodologies offered a restricted accuracy when\npredicting complex structures like super-lattices and quantum wells. To address\nthis gap, we propose a methodology involving three distinct phases using\norbital interaction parameters (OIPs) and the TB theory. The research employed\nAluminium Arsenide (AlAs) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) as the primary bulk\nmaterials. Our novel approach introduces a computation framework that first\nfocuses on bulk computation, subsequently expanding to super-lattice\nstructures. The findings of this research demonstrate promising results\nregarding the accuracy of predicated optoelectronic properties, particularly\nthe cut-off wavelength. This study paves the way for future research,\npotentially enhancing the precision of the proposed methodology and its\napplication scope within the field of quantum optoelectronics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
