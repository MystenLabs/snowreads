In the literature,\nsolutions are problem-dependent, inconsistent, and use different entropy\nmeasures. We propose a new unified approach that not only specializes to the\nexisting approaches, but offers solutions to new cases, such as when data\nvalues are constrained to [0, 1], which has new applications in machine\nlearning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
