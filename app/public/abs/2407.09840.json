The model considered has\ntwo non-degenerate minima at $\\phi_{\\pm}$, instead of one degenerate minimum at\n$\\pm\\phi_{min}$. The component fields of one SU(2) doublet ($\\phi_1$) act as\nthe standard model (SM) Higgs, while the component fields of the second doublet\n($\\phi_2$) are taken to be the dark energy candidates (lying in the true\nvacuum). It is found that one \\emph{can} arrange for late time acceleration\n(dark energy) by using an SU(2) Higgs doublet, whose vacuum expectation value\nis zero, in the quintessential regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
