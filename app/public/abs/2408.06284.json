The magnetization is\ndominated by a temperature-independent diamagnetic component and a field- and\ntemperature-dependent paramagnetic contribution $M_\\mu(H,T)$ from a\n$\\sim$1000~ppm concentration of local moments, an order of magnitude higher\nthan can be accounted for by measured rare-earth impurity concentrations.\n$M_\\mu(H,T)$ can be fit by the Brillouin function $B_J(x)$ or, perhaps more\nrealistically, a two-level $\\tanh(x)$ model for magnetic Bi $6p$ ions in defect\ncrystal fields. Both fits require a phenomenological Curie-Weiss argument $x =\n\\mu_\\mathrm{eff}H/(T + T_W)$, $T_W \\approx 1.7$ K. There is no evidence for\nmagnetic order down to 2 K, and the origin of $T_W$ is not clear. $^{19}$F\nfrequency shifts, linewidths, and spin-lattice relaxation rates are consistent\nwith purely dipolar $^{19}$F/defect-spin interactions. The defect-spin\ncorrelation time $\\tau_c(T)$ obtained from $^{19}$F spin-lattice relaxation\nrates obeys the Korringa relation $\\tau_cT = \\text{const.}$, indicating the\nrelaxation is dominated by conduction-band fluctuations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
