However, materials with rare earths ($R$) have\nremained a notable exception. The most vital rare-earth magnetic properties,\nsuch as magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MA), have been notoriously elusive due\nto the ubiquitous self-interaction error present in nearly all available DFT\nflavors. In this work, we show explicitly how the orbital dependence of\nself-interaction error may contradict Hund's rules and plague MA calculations,\nand how analyzing DFT metastable states that respect Hund's rules can alleviate\nthe problem. We systematically investigate and discuss several\nrare-earth-containing families, $R$Co$_5$, $R_2$Fe$_{14}$B, $R$Fe$_{12}$, and\n$R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$, to benchmark the MA calculations in DFT+$U$. For all compounds\nwe investigated, we found that our methodology reproduces the magnetic\neasy-axis, easy-plane, and non-trivial easy-cone anisotropies in full agreement\nwith low-temperature experimental measurements. Besides the fully-numerical ab\ninitio approach, we further illustrate an efficient semi-analytical\nperturbation method that treats the crystal field as a perturbation in the\nlimit of large spin-orbit coupling. This approach evaluates the rare-earth\nanisotropy by assessing the dependence of crystal-field energy on\nspin-quantization axis rotation using $4f$ crystal-field levels obtained from\nnon-spin-orbit calculations. Our analytical method provides a quantitative\nmicroscopic understanding of the factors that control MA and can be used for\npredicting new high-MA materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
