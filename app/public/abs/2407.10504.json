This fact can be detected bybasic ML models, that can\nbe used to predict how previously won auctionsdecrease the current opportunity\nvalue. However, learning is not enough toproduce a bid that correctly accounts\nfor how winning the current auctionimpacts the future values. Indeed, a policy\nthat uses this prediction tomaximize the expected payoff of the current auction\ncould be dubbedimpatient because such policy does not fully account for the\nrepeatednature of the auctions. Under this perspective, it seems that most\nbiddersin the literature are impatient. Unsurprisingly, impatience induces a\ncost.We provide two empirical arguments for the importance of this cost\nofimpatience. First, an offline counterfactual analysis and, second, a\nnotablebusiness metrics improvement by mitigating the cost of impatience\nwithpolicy learning\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
