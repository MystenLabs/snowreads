In particular, we will give counting formulae for the roots of the\ncontinuant over the local rings $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\\mathbb{Z}$\nand $\\frac{\\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]}{<X^{m}>}$. To conclude, the methods used for the\ncontinuant will allow us to give a new and short proof of the counting formulae\nfor $\\lambda$-quiddities (which are the solutions of a matrix equation\nappearing in the study of Coxeter's friezes) over the rings\n$\\mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\\mathbb{Z}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
