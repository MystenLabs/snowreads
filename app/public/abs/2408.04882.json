By leveraging a recent Lie-bracket averaging result\nfor hybrid dynamic inclusions introduced in \\cite{abdelgalil2023lie}, we\npropose a novel universal hybrid feedback law that induces robust global\npractical stability by seeking the minimum point of a collection of suitable\nsynergistic Lyapunov functions. As concrete applications of our results, we\npresent novel hybrid high-frequency high-amplitude feedback laws for the\nsolution of robust global stabilization problems on different types of\nmanifolds under unknown control directions, as well as controllers for obstacle\navoidance problems in vehicles characterized by kinematic models describing\nboth holonomic and non-holonomic models. By leveraging Lie-bracket averaging\nfor hybrid systems, we show how the proposed hybrid minimum-seeking feedback\nlaws can overcome lack of controllability during persistent (bounded) periods\nof time. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the main\nresults.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
