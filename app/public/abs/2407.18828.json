In order to constrain the impact and nature of the binary interaction\nin the RW Aur system (bound or unbound), we analyzed the circumstellar material\nat 1.3 mm wavelengths, as observed at multiple epochs by ALMA. We analyzed the\ndisk properties through parametric visibility modeling, and we used this\ninformation to constrain the dust morphology and the binary orbital period. We\nimaged the dust continuum emission of RW Aur with a resolution of 3 au, and we\nfind that the radius enclosing 90% of the flux (R90%) is 19 au and 14 au for RW\nAur A and B, respectively. By modeling the relative distance of the disks at\neach epoch, we find a consistent trend of movement for the disk of RW Aur B\nmoving away from the disk of RW Aur A at an approximate rate of 3 mas/yr (about\n0.5 au/yr in sky-projected distance). By combining ALMA astrometry, historical\nastrometry, and the dynamical masses of each star, we constrain the RW Aur\nbinary stars to be most likely in a high-eccentricity elliptical orbit with a\nclockwise prograde orientation relative to RW Aur A, although low-eccentricity\nhyperbolic orbits are not ruled out by the astrometry. Our analysis does not\nexclude the possibility of a disk collision during the last interaction, which\noccurred $295_{-74}^{+21}$ yr ago relative to beginning of 2024. Evidence for\nthe close interaction is found in a tentative warp of 6 deg in the inner 3 au\nof the disk of RW Aur A, in the brightness temperature of both disks, and in\nthe morphology of the gas emission. A narrow ring that peaks at 6 au around RW\nAur B is suggestive of captured material from the disk around RW Aur A.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QAxrpRqhsF3Iwua0Nnf04DI5onKZOtEZ4qHZ-lG9214","pdfSize":"5931971","objectId":"0x81474b539c2b7b3abef423d8eb1afbfcb74470c4254a5d870a1419568a4c9c50","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
