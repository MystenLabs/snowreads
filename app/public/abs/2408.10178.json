Although promising,\nSDF-based methods often fail to capture detailed geometric structures,\nresulting in visible defects. By comparing SDF-based volume rendering to\ndensity-based volume rendering, we identify two main factors within the\nSDF-based approach that degrade surface quality: SDF-to-density representation\nand geometric regularization. These factors introduce challenges that hinder\nthe optimization of the SDF field. To address these issues, we introduce\nNeuRodin, a novel two-stage neural surface reconstruction framework that not\nonly achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction but also retains the\nflexible optimization characteristics of density-based methods. NeuRodin\nincorporates innovative strategies that facilitate transformation of arbitrary\ntopologies and reduce artifacts associated with density bias. Extensive\nevaluations on the Tanks and Temples and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of NeuRodin, showing strong reconstruction capabilities for both\nindoor and outdoor environments using solely posed RGB captures.
