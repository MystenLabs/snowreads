However, we\nstill lack a clear picture of what happens in the highly deformed region around\na moving crack tip. Consequently, we still cannot link nano to atomic-scale\nphenomena with the macroscopic toughness of materials. The unsolved challenge\nis to observe the movement of the crack front at the nanoscale while extracting\nquantitative information. Here we address this challenge by monitoring stable\ncrack growth inside a TEM. Our analysis demonstrates how phase transformation\ntoughening, previously thought to be effective at the microscale and above,\npromotes crack deflection at the nano-level and increases the fracture\nresistance by ~50%. The work will help to connect the atomistic and continuous\nview of fracture in a way that can guide the design of the next generation of\nstrong and tough materials demanded by technologies as diverse as healthcare,\nenergy generation or transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
