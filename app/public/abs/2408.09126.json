Despite the plausible\ngenerated appearance, existing methods cannot achieve fine-grained\ndisentanglement or high-fidelity modeling between inner body and outfit. In\nthis paper, we propose Barbie, a novel framework for generating 3D avatars that\ncan be dressed in diverse and high-quality Barbie-like garments and\naccessories. Instead of relying on a holistic model, Barbie achieves\nfine-grained disentanglement on avatars by semantic-aligned separated models\nfor human body and outfits. These disentangled 3D representations are then\noptimized by different expert models to guarantee the domain-specific fidelity.\nTo balance geometry diversity and reasonableness, we propose a series of losses\nfor template-preserving and human-prior evolving. The final avatar is enhanced\nby unified texture refinement for superior texture consistency. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Barbie outperforms existing methods in both\ndressed human and outfit generation, supporting flexible apparel combination\nand animation. The code will be released for research purposes.
