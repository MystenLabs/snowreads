We show that these modified\ngravity theories alter the inner structure of the star leading to\nsub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. This further results in a modification of\nDebye temperature, ion and electron specific heats. Finally, we find that the\ncooling process is significantly shortened in scalar-tensor theories leading to\nreduced cooling ages.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
