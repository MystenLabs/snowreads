This effect has raised a great curiosity since\nlong time and has been studied extensively in many classical and quantum\nsystems. Here it is shown that the Mpemba effect can be observed in optics as\nwell. Specifically, the process of light diffusion in finite-sized photonic\nlattices under incoherent (dephasing) dynamics is considered. Rather\nsurprisingly, it is shown that certain highly-localized initial light\ndistributions can diffuse faster than initial broadly delocalized\ndistributions. The effect is illustrated by considering random walk of optical\npulses in fiber-based temporal mesh lattices, which should provide an\nexperimentally-accessible setup for the demonstration of the Mpemba effect in\noptics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
