Here, we report the experimental\nimplementation of a sequential two-photon resonant excitation process of a\nsolid-state 3-level system, constituted by the biexciton-, exciton-, and\nground-state of a semiconductor quantum dot. The resulting light state exhibits\nentanglement in time and energy, encoded in the photon-number basis, which\ncould be used in quantum information applications, e.g., dense information\nencoding or quantum communication protocols. Performing energy- and\ntime-resolved correlation experiments in combination with extensive theoretical\nmodelling, we are able to partially retrieve the entanglement structure of the\ngenerated state.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
