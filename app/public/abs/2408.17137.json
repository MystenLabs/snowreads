Consequently, simplified physics models prevail in\ngeophysics, using a much faster but approximate (1D) forward model. We propose\nto join the accuracy of a 1D simplified physics model with the flexibility of\ncoarse grids to reduce the modelling errors, thereby avoiding the full 3D\naccurate simulations. We exemplify our approach on airborne time-domain\nelectromagnetic data, comparing the modelling error with the standard 3%\nmeasurement noise. We find that the modelling error depends on the specific\nsubsurface model (electrical conductivity values, angle representing the\ndeviation of the 1D assumption) and the specific (temporal) discretization. In\nour example, the computation time is decreased by a factor of 27. Our approach\ncan offer an alternative for surrogate models, statistical relations derived\nfrom large 3D datasets, to replace the full 3D simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vzjHE2duTHKTe3ZK6-qpRUbb66Y4qN8Jl6Cv16J2_2w","pdfSize":"358858"}
