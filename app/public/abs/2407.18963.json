The adjoint-enabled\ngradients based on different CFD solvers or solution representations are\nderived in detail, and the potential advantage of DG representations is\ndiscovered that the adjoint gradient computed by the DGMs contains a\nmodification term which implies information of higher-order moments of the\nsolution as compared with finite volume methods (FVMs). A number of numerical\ncases are tested for investigating the impact of different CFD solvers\n(including DGMs and FVMs) on the evaluation of the adjoint-enabled gradients.\nThe numerical results demonstrate that the DGMs can provide more precise\nadjoint gradients even on a coarse mesh as compared with the FVMs under coequal\ncomputational costs, and extend the capability to explore the design space,\nfurther leading to acquiring the aerodynamic shapes with more superior\naerodynamic performance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
