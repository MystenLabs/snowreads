The system can\naccommodate up to two tricritical points where the three regions meet, with one\ntricritical point being intrinsic and the other being conditional. Strikingly,\nwe show that the sound velocity vanishes as the AMSF phase touches on the\nborder of phase separation lines. We find that quantum fluctuations correction\nto the ground-state energy and quantum depletion of the condensates vary\nnonmonotonically with Feshbach coupling strength as well as molecular\npercentage. Correlation functions such as pairing amplitudes, density structure\nfactor and spin density structure factor show characteristic behaviors when the\nsystem crosses phase transitions. Our work paves the way for future advancement\ntoward understanding salient physics of atom-molecular mixtures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
