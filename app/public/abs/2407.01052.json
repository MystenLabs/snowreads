As their extension, nondeterministic fuzzy transition\nsystems (NFTSs) have been studied in a considerable number of works. Wu et al.\n(2018) provided an algorithm for computing the greatest crisp bisimulation of a\nfinite NFTS $\\mathcal{S} = \\langle S, A, \\delta \\rangle$, with a time\ncomplexity of order $O(|S|^4 \\cdot |\\delta|^2)$ under the assumption that\n$|\\delta| \\geq |S|$. Qiao {\\em et al.} (2023) provided an algorithm for\ncomputing the greatest fuzzy bisimulation of a finite NFTS $\\mathcal{S}$ under\nthe G\\\"odel semantics, with a time complexity of order $O(|S|^4 \\cdot\n|\\delta|^2 \\cdot l)$ under the assumption that $|\\delta| \\geq |S|$, where $l$\nis the number of fuzzy values used in $\\mathcal{S}$ plus 1. In this work, we\nprovide efficient algorithms for computing the partition corresponding to the\ngreatest crisp bisimulation of a finite NFTS $\\mathcal{S}$, as well as the\ncompact fuzzy partition corresponding to the greatest fuzzy bisimulation of\n$\\mathcal{S}$ under the G\\\"odel semantics. Their time complexities are of the\norder $O((size(\\delta) \\log{l} + |S|) \\log{(|S| + |\\delta|)})$, where $l$ is\nthe number of fuzzy values used in $\\mathcal{S}$ plus 2. When $|\\delta| \\geq\n|S|$, this order is within $O(|S| \\cdot |\\delta| \\cdot \\log^2{|\\delta|})$. The\nreduction of time complexity from $O(|S|^4 \\cdot |\\delta|^2)$ and $O(|S|^4\n\\cdot |\\delta|^2 \\cdot l)$ to $O(|S| \\cdot |\\delta| \\cdot \\log^2{|\\delta|})$ is\na significant contribution of this work. In addition, we introduce\nnondeterministic fuzzy labeled transition systems, which extend NFTSs with\nfuzzy state labels, and we define and provide results on simulations and\nbisimulations between them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
