Back in\nearly 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the \"tunneling from\nnothing\" and \"no boundary\" proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest\nin this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral\nfor Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at\ngoing beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform\nMonte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to\novercome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or\nHartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary\ncondition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues\nin quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the\nlapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the\ncomplex geometry obtained at the saddle point.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LGbnpT8_bgrsoNgRseMSJtyb9VB-W7f5bkeuXF8AEu0","pdfSize":"2912926"}
