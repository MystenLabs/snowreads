We use Dirichlet characters\nand the cycle form to find a new upper bound on the number of unlabelled\nbicolored graphs with $p$ red vertices and $q$ blue vertices. We use this bound\nto calculate the asymptotic growth rate of the number of such graphs as\n$p,q\\rightarrow\\infty$, answering a 1973 question of Harrison in the case where\n$q-p$ is fixed. As an application, we show that, in an asymptotic sense, \"most\"\nelements of the power set $P(\\{ 1, \\dots ,p\\} \\times \\{ 1, \\dots ,q\\})$ are in\nfree $\\Sigma_p\\times \\Sigma_q$-orbits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
