Among the models\nevaluated, the YOLOv8m model, consisting of 25.9 million parameters and 79.1\nGFLOPs, demonstrated a respectable balance between computational efficiency and\ndetection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.971 at 50%\nIntersection over Union (IoU) across both \"Fall Detected\" and \"Human in Motion\"\ncategories. Although the YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x models presented higher precision\nand recall, particularly in fall detection, their higher computational demands\nand model size make them less suitable for resource-constrained environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
