Originally\nmotivated by some challenges in Computer Science related to robot navigation,\nthe problem seeks to ensure unobstructed communication channels between\nnavigating entities. The mutual-visibility problem involves determining a\nlargest mutual-visibility set in a graph. The mutual-visibility number of a\ngraph represents the cardinality of the largest mutual-visibility set. This\nconcept has sparked significant research interest, leading to connections with\nclassical combinatorial problems like the Zarankiewicz problem and Tur\\'an-type\nproblems. In this paper, we consider practical limitations in network\nvisibility and our investigation extends the original concept to $k$-distance\nmutual-visibility. In this case, a pair of vertices is considered $S$-visible\nif a shortest path of length at most $k$ exists, excluding internal vertices\nbelonging to the set $S$. The $k$-distance mutual-visibility number represents\nthe cardinality of a largest $k$-distance mutual-visibility set. We initiate\nthe study of this new graph parameter. We prove that the associate decision\nproblem belongs to the NP-complete class. We also give some properties and\ntight bounds, as well as, the exact value of such parameter for some particular\nnon trivial graph classes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
