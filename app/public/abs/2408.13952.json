We are primarily concerned\nwith the associated production processes with a fermion pair: $\\ell^+ \\ell^-\n\\to \\tau^+ \\nu_{\\tau }H^-$ and $\\ell^+ \\ell^- \\to t \\bar{b} H^-$, as well as\nwith the W boson and a neutral Higgs boson: $\\ell^+ \\ell^- \\to W^\\pm H^\\mp S$\n($S=h,\\,H,\\, A$) and $\\ell^+ \\ell^- \\to W^\\pm H^\\mp Z$. We first update the\nresults for $e^+e^- \\to \\{ \\tau^+ \\nu_{\\tau }H^-\\ , \\ t \\bar{b} H^-\\}$ and then\ndiscuss our findings for $e^+e^- \\to \\{ W^\\pm H^\\mp S\\}$ for various center of\nmass energies 500 GeV, 1 TeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV. In the case of muon collider,\nwe show that the new s-channel and t-channel diagrams can increase the cross\nsections by virtue of their Yukawa couplings. We systematically compare our\nresults for the muon collider with those obtained at the International Linear\n(ILC) and Compact Linear (CLIC) colliders. We select benchmark points and\nconduct signal-background analyses, incorporating detector simulations. For a 3\nTeV muon collider, our results show an exclusion region at the 2$\\sigma$ level\nand a discovery region at the 5$\\sigma$ level.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
