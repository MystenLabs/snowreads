However, sharing\nraw data from independent studies presents significant challenges, primarily\ndue to the need to safeguard sensitive participant information and the\ncumbersome paperwork involved in data sharing. In this article, we first\nprovide a selective review of recent methodological developments in information\nintegration via empirical likelihood, wherein only summary information is\nrequired, rather than the raw data. Following this, we introduce a new insight\nand a potentially promising framework that could broaden the application of\ninformation integration across a wider spectrum. Furthermore, this new\nframework offers computational convenience compared to classic empirical\nlikelihood-based methods. We provide numerical evaluations to assess its\nperformance and discuss various extensions in the end.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
