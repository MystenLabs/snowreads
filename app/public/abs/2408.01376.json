Then, we investigate\nthe particular case of a single emitter and we demonstrate that the external\nfield can induce both an amplification of the heat exchanged between emittter\nand substrate and a focusing of the Poynting field at the substrate interface\nat deep sub-wavelength scale. These effects open up promising perspectives for\nthe development of heat-assisted magnetic-recording technology.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N4oUUQE0Gz9hpH_ATAvhpOZPvZTfs9WSO4bUj-foq1Y","pdfSize":"2924472","txDigest":"CNUCnAhvK67JbGxC5NSBiccxpNWpggDf34qXt4q6MZ6f","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
