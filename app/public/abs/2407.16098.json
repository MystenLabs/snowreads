The motivation is to provide a powerful radiation source\nwhich could benefit fundamental science research and industry applications. Our\nstudy shows that such a compact OSC-SSMB storage ring using present technology\ncan deliver EUV light with an average power of kilowatt, and spectral flux\n$>10^{20}$ phs/s/0.1\\%b.w., which is four orders of magnitude higher than\nexisting synchrotron sources. It is expected that the presented work is of\nvalue for the development of both OSC and SSMB.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Optics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
