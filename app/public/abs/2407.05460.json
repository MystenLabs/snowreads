Each game in this class admits at least one\npure Nash equilibrium and the best-response dynamics converges to one of these\npure Nash equilibria; which one depends on the starting point. So, each pure\nNash equilibrium has a basin of attraction.\n  We pick uniformly at random one game from this class and we study the joint\ndistribution of the sizes of the basins of attraction. We provide an asymptotic\nexact value for the expected basin of attraction of each pure Nash equilibrium,\nwhen the number of actions $K$ goes to infinity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/Theoretical Economics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CnFtGrZbZ0HgVV2F6g6iy0ln2P5wYBRZ8jksIECYoGs","pdfSize":"672071"}
