First, we construct universal objects on the two sides of mirror\nsymmetry, focusing on the exact symplectic setting: a smooth complex scheme\n$U_\\mathrm{univ}$ and a Weinstein manifold $M_\\mathrm{univ}$, both of infinite\ntype; and we prove homological mirror symmetry for them. Second, we consider\nautoequivalences. We prove that automorphisms of $U_\\mathrm{univ}$ are given by\na natural discrete subgroup of $\\operatorname{Bir} (\\mathbb{P}^2, \\pm \\Omega)$;\nand that all of these automorphisms are mirror to symplectomorphisms of\n$M_\\mathrm{univ}$. We conclude with some applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
