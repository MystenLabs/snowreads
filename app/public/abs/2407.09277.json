To\nthis end we introduce coherence (auto-concordance) of ensembles of quantum\ntrajectories in the space-time. The coherence condition accounts phases\nproportional to classical action, which are in foundation of the Feynman path\nintegral technique. Therefore, our interpretation is entirely based on\nwell-known and tested concepts and methods of wave mechanics. Similarly to\nother ensemble interpretations our approach allows us to avoid all problems and\nparadoxes related to wave function collapse during a measurement process.\nAnother consequence is that no quantum computation or quantum cryptography\nmethod will ever work if it assumes that a particular q-bit represents the\nentire wave function.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"TabSTaVCpfEnCiMxDMppQV6NoYadLIGwbhBb1bEgBck","pdfSize":"233121"}
