While limited in degrees of\nfreedom (DOF), malleable robots still provide versatility across operations\ntypically served by systems using higher DOF than required by the tasks. In\nthis paper, we present the creation of a 2-DOF malleable robot, detailing the\ndesign of joints and malleable link, along with its modelling through forward\nand inverse kinematics, and a reconfiguration methodology that informs\nmorphology changes based on end effector location -- determining how the user\nshould reshape the robot to enable a task previously unattainable. The\nrecalibration and motion planning for making robot motion possible after\nreconfiguration are also discussed, and thorough experiments with the prototype\nto evaluate accuracy and reliability of the system are presented. Results\nvalidate the approach and pave the way for further research in the area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
