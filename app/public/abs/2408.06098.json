The solution of the Dirichlet problem at infinity\nfor $M$ leads to the construction of a family of mutually absolutely continuous\nprobability measures $\\{\\mu_x\\}_{x \\in M}$ called the harmonic measures. Fixing\na basepoint $o \\in M$, the Poisson kernel of $M$ is the function $P : M \\times\n\\partial M \\to (0, \\infty)$ defined by \\begin{equation*} P(x, \\xi) =\n\\frac{d\\mu_x}{d\\mu_o}(\\xi) \\ , \\ x \\in M, \\xi \\in \\partial M. \\end{equation*}\nWe prove the following global upper and lower bounds for the Poisson kernel:\n\\begin{equation*} \\frac{1}{C}\\: e^{-2K{(o|\\xi)}_x}\\: e^{a d(x, o)} \\le P(x,\\xi)\n\\le C\\: e^{2K{(x|\\xi)}_o}\\: e^{-a d(x,o)} \\:, \\end{equation*} for some positive\nconstants $C \\geq 1, K > 0$ depending solely on $a, b$ and $n$. The above\nestimates may be viewed as a generalization of the well-known formula for the\nPoisson kernel in terms of Busemann functions for the special case of Gromov\nhyperbolic harmonic manifolds. These estimates do not follow directly from\nknown estimates on Green's functions or harmonic measures. Instead we use\ntechniques due to Anderson-Schoen for estimating positive harmonic functions in\ncones. As applications, we obtain quantitative estimates for the convergence\n$\\mu_x \\to \\delta_{\\xi}$ as $x \\in M \\to \\xi \\in \\partial M$, and for the\nconvergence of harmonic measures on finite spheres to the harmonic measures on\nthe boundary at infinity as the radius of the spheres tends to infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QzGLeiyNcujY2zpN7AERrbMAkOEvJ9S58DSOzKIDLRM","pdfSize":"545818"}
