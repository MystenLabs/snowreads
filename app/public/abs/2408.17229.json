For\n$3a<b+c$ and $2b \\le c$, this value is $c-1$, for $3a<b+c$ and $2b > c$, it is\n$\\left \\lfloor \\frac{2}{3}(b+c-1) \\right \\rfloor$, and for $3a=b+c$, it is\n$\\left \\lfloor \\frac{a+b+c}{2} \\right \\rfloor -1 $. The only open case is\n$3a>b+c$, where two values are possible, namely $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{a+b+c}{2}\n\\right \\rfloor -1 $ and $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{a+b+c}{2} \\right \\rfloor $. This\nresult extends previous results of C\\'acere et al., who computed the metric\ndimension of $ K_a \\times K_b$, and of Drewes and J\\\"ager, who computed the\nmetric dimension of $ K_a \\times K_a \\times K_a$.\n  We prove our result by introducing and analyzing a new variant of Static\nBlack-Peg Mastermind, in which each peg has its own permitted set of colors.\nFor all cases, we present strategies which we prove to be both feasible and\noptimal. Our main result follows, as the number of questions of these\nstrategies is equal to the metric dimension of $K_a \\times K_b \\times K_c$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
