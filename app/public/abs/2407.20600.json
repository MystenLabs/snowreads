Effective fusion of hierarchical knowledge about image classes\nto enhance image recognition remains a challenging topic to advance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep metric learning based method to effectively fuse\nhierarchical prior knowledge about image classes and enhance image recognition\nperformances in an end-to-end supervised regression manner. Existing deep\nmetric learning incorporated image classification mainly exploits qualitative\nrelativity between image classes, i.e., whether sampled images are from the\nsame class. A new triplet loss function term that exploits quantitative\nrelativity and aligns distances in model latent space with those in knowledge\nspace is also proposed and incorporated in the proposed dual-modality fusion\nmethod. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method enhanced image\nrecognition performances and outperformed baseline and existing methods on\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Mini-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
