However,\nthere are few existing works that explore the potential utilization of\ndeveloped dexterous manipulation controllers for downstream tasks. In this\nstudy, we focus on constrained dexterous manipulation for food peeling. Food\npeeling presents various constraints on the reorientation controller, such as\nthe requirement for the hand to securely hold the object after reorientation\nfor peeling. We propose a simple system for learning a reorientation controller\nthat facilitates the subsequent peeling task.
