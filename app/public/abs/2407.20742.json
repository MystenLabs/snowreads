The multi-$Z'$ signatures can then be obtained via the decays of\nthe discovered (extra) Higgs boson $h$ ($\\phi$), i.e., $h\\to Z'Z'$, $\\phi \\to\nZ'Z'$ and/or $h \\to \\phi\\phi \\to 4Z'$ as far as kinematically allowed. We give\nthe upper limit on the branching ratios of $h$ into $Z'Z'$ and $4Z'$ from the\ncurrent experimental data in each model. We also show the deviation in the\n$hhh$ coupling from the standard model prediction at one-loop level, and find\nthat its amount is typically smaller than 1\\%.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
