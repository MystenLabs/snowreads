Hyperspectral line-scan\ncameras are a low-cost solution that enhance confidence in anomaly detection\nover RGB and multispectral imagery. However, real-time algorithms for these\ncameras must be fast when using small computers (e.g., those onboard a drone or\nsmall satellite), scalable to high dimensions, adaptable to changing scenery,\nand robust against geometric and radiometric distortions. This paper introduces\nthe Exponentially moving RX algorithm (ERX) and compares it to existing\nRX-based anomaly detection methods for real-time line-scanning. ERX was tested\nusing a Jetson Xavier NX compute module, achieving the best combination of\nspeed and detection across three novel datasets compared to the other\nalgorithms. This research paves the way for future studies in grouping and\nlocating anomalous objects, adaptive and automatic threshold selection, and\nreal-time field tests.
