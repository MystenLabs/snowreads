Although such threats are a classical research topic, the\nsystematization of existing knowledge is still limited particularly with\nrespect to non-technical research approaches. To this end, this paper presents\na systematic literature review on the psychology of insider threats. According\nto the review results, the literature has operated with multiple distinct\ntheories but there is still a lack of robust theorization with respect to\npsychology. The literature has also considered characteristics of a person, his\nor her personal situation, and other more or less objective facts about the\nperson. These are seen to correlate with psychological concepts such as\npersonality traits and psychological states of a person. In addition, the\nreview discusses gaps and limitations in the existing research, thus opening\nthe door for further psychology research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
