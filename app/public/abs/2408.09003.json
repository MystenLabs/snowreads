The analyzed foreshock ULF wave events are observed in the\n0.008-0.086 Hz frequency range, with nearly circular and elliptical left-handed\npolarization in the spacecraft reference frame. These waves are propagated\nquasi-parallel to the ambient magnetic field, with a moderate wave amplitude.\nAll these properties are consistent with fast magnetosonic waves, most likely\ngenerated through the ion-ion right-hand resonant instability. In addition, our\nresults suggest that the associated resonant backstreaming protons' velocities\nparallel to the mean magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame is $1.33\n\\pm 0.40$ times the solar wind velocity. The similarity between our results and\nprevious reports at other foreshocks may indicate the presence of a common\nacceleration process acting in planetary bow shocks and that is responsible for\nthis particular backstreaming population.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
