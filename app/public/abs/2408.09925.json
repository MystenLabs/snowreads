Magnetic tunnel junctions or vertical\ndevices were also made out of graphene by exposing the graphene layer to\nlocalised pattern of strong magnetic field created by hard ferromagnetic\nmaterial. By combining the essence of these different methods for constructing\ngraphene based junctions, in this work we propose that the\ntemperature-dependent Josephson current in such junctions can be tuned by\nexposing the graphene regions to a combination of highly localised non-uniform\nmagnetic field, dubbed as magnetic barrier, and spatially modulated gate\nvoltage. Within the framework of Dirac-Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (DBDG) theory, we\nshow by explicit calculation that in such magnetically modulated Josephson\nJunctions, the band structure of graphene gets significantly altered, which\nresults in the change of the Andreev reflections in such junctions. This leads\nto a significant modulation of the Josephson current. We numerically evaluated\nthe Josephson current as a function of the strength of the magnetic barrier and\nthe gate voltage and discussed the practical consequences of such controlling\nof Josephson currents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
