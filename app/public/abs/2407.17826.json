The sign patterns satisfying this rule are equivalent\nto uniform oriented Lagrangian matroids. We first discuss their structure and\nsymmetries and then study their asymptotics, proving that almost all of them\nare not representable by real symmetric matrices. We offer several conjectures\nand experimental results concerning representable sign patterns and the\ntopology of their representation spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
