By\nintegrating this tool within research practices, we aim to enhance data\nreproducibility and utility in social science research. Our approach draws on\nDesign Science Research, proposing that MaskAnyone can facilitate safer data\nsharing and potentially reduce the storage of fully identifiable data. We\ndiscuss the development and capabilities of MaskAnyone, explore its integration\ninto ethical research practices, and consider the broader implications of\naudio-visual data masking, including issues of consent and the risk of misuse.\nThe paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation framework for assessing the\neffectiveness and ethical integration of masking tools in such research\nsettings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
