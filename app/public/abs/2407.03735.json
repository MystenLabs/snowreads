Power dynamics have been\nidentified as a recurrent ethical challenge in the design and development\nprocess. As designers, participants, and project stakeholders engage in the\nprocess, potential conflicts, power imbalances, and ethical challenges emerge.\nThis requires that awareness is raised on these imbalances and that teams\nproactively act on them. To address this issue, we propose the\nParticipant-Designer Journey Map (PDJM), a tool to assist designers in\nconducting an ethical design process, aware of power imbalances. The proposal\nfor the PDJM was evaluated, based on a set of criteria derived from the\nliterature, by three design professionals, against nine other alternative\ntools. The PDJM was identified as the tool with the most potential to\nfacilitate a structured approach to navigating ethical dilemmas, particularly\nthose related to power dynamics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
