Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous\northogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical\ncalculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the\nnegativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central\ncharge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in\nthe Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime\nwhere each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to\nextract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity\ndecays as $d^{-4 \\Delta_f}$ with $\\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation\nbetween the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free\nDirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the\nboundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site\n$m=0,1,2,\\dots$, with $\\Delta_f^{\\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and\n$\\Delta_f^{\\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and\nanalytical calculations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
