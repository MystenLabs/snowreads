However, I find that the energy conservation law requires these\nmass eigenstates, if they exist, to be entangled with distinct joint energy\neigenstates of the other particles produced by the same weak interaction as the\nneutrino. This entanglement destroys the quantum coherence among the neutrino's\nmass eigenstates, which is responsible for flavor oscillations under the\naforementioned postulation. I reveal that the neutrino oscillations actually\noriginate from virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the\nspace. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then\nimmediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation\nproduces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three\nflavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by\nthe competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence\neffect resulting from scatterings.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
