This method associates\na given poset with its spectrum, which is a compact T_1 topological space.\n  In this paper, we focus on the case where such finite sets have a graph\nstructure and the relations belong to a given graph category. We relate\ntopological properties of the spectrum to combinatorial properties of the graph\ncategories involved. We then utilise this to exhibit elementary combinatorial\nconstructions of well-known continua as Fra\\\"iss\\'e limits of finite graphs in\ncategories with relational morphisms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
