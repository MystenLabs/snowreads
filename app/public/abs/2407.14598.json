In many\nlight DM-electron interactions the energy and momentum deposited is much\nsmaller than the electron mass, motivating a non-relativistic (NR) description\nof the electron. Thus, for any target, light DM-electron phenomenology relies\non understanding the interactions between the DM and electron in the NR limit.\nIn this work we derive the NR effective field theory (EFT) of general\nDM-electron interactions from a top-down perspective, starting from general\nhigh-energy DM-electron interaction Lagrangians. This provides an explicit\nconnection between high-energy theories and their low-energy phenomenology in\nelectron excitation based experiments. Furthermore, we derive Feynman rules for\nthe DM-electron NR EFT, allowing observables to be computed diagrammatically,\nwhich can systematically explain the presence of in-medium screening effects in\ngeneral DM models. We use these Feynman rules to compute absorption,\nscattering, and dark Thomson scattering rates for a wide variety of high-energy\nDM models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
