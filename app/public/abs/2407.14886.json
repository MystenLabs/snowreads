We carefully derived the\ngeneralized Langevin Equation (GLE) that governs the motion of a tagged central\nmonomer. This derivation involves integrating out all the other degrees of\nfreedom within the polymer chain, thereby yielding an effective description of\nthe viscoelastic motion of the tagged monomer. A critical component of our\nanalysis is the memory kernel that appears in the GLE. By examining this\nkernel, we characterized the impact of bending rigidity on the non-Markovian\ndiffusion dynamics of the tagged monomer. Furthermore, we calculated the\nmean-squared displacement of the tagged monomer using the derived GLE. Our\nresults not only show remarkable agreement with previously known results in\ncertain limiting cases but also provide dynamic features over the entire\ntimescale.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7rn-_bid8ke2lGJBSLdsjXIzQw40P6UjfZRSjWAJ0hI","pdfSize":"724577"}
