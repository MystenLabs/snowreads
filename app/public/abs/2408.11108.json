With these new rate coefficients, we have modeled the C$_2$ rotational\ndistributions inferred from visible and ultraviolet absorption observations of\nelectronic transitions of C$_2$ towards a collection of 46 nearby background\nsources. The inferred gas densities in the foreground interstellar clouds\nresponsible for the observed C$_2$ absorption are a factor 4 to 7 smaller than\nthose inferred previously, a direct reflection of the larger collisional rate\ncoefficients computed by Najar and Kalugina (2020). These lower density\nestimates are generally in good agreement with the peak densities inferred from\n3D extinction maps for the relevant sightlines. In cases where H$_3^+$\nabsorption has also been observed and used to estimate the cosmic-ray\nionization rate (CRIR), our estimates of the latter will also decrease\naccordingly because the H$_3^+$ abundance is a function of the ratio of the\nCRIR to the gas density.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W8HYW2uciEkw3ZzaUrnf8S2CzGQ0tEXF5DnQFPbvg3E","pdfSize":"4512855"}
