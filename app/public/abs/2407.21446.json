The\nHirano-Utsu law is widely used in studying the relaxation of earthquake source\nafter the main shock of an earthquake. The prevailing view in the literature is\nthat the Hirano-Utsu law is an improved version of Omori's hyperbolic law,\nformulated in 1894. The author disagrees with this notion. The paper proposes\nan axiomatic approach to the study of aftershocks. A phenomenological parameter\nof the source, called the deactivation coefficient, was introduced. The theory\nis based on axioms that do not contain any a priori statements regarding the\nform of the law of aftershock evolution. Formulas for the deactivation\ncoefficient are derived from the axioms, allowing one to experimentally\nestablish the truth or falsity of the Hirano-Utsu and Omori laws. A two-stage\nmode of source relaxation was discovered. In the first stage, called the Omori\nepoch, the Omori law is strictly followed. The Omori epoch ends with a\nbifurcation, after which aftershock activity becomes unpredictable. Omori's law\nis not fulfilled at the second stage of evolution. The Hirano-Utsu law is not\nfulfilled either at the first or second stage. Keywords: earthquake source,\nmain shock, relaxation, deactivation coefficient, evolution equation, inverse\nproblem, Omori epoch, bifurcation, two-stage relaxation mode.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
