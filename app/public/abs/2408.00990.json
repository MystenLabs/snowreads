A semi-implicit\nfinite difference method for 3D hydrostatic primitive equations is presented in\nthis paper. The governing equations are time-discretized with an implicit\ntreatment of barotropic pressure gradient and vertical viscosity. The\ndiscretized momentum equations along a water column are coupled with the\ndepth-integrated continuity equation of the column to construct a linear system\nfor free-surface elevations. The novelty of this work lies in formulating an\nefficient method with the order of complexity O(N) for coupling the momentum\nand the continuity equations. In this method, the horizontal velocity\ncomponents are expressed in terms of neighbor free-surface elevations by some\nsimple recursive formulas and then are substituted in the integrated continuity\nequation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vTLpFtqleTmt6g1R2eYN4biiZlbagDqVbWU3sylfb2U","pdfSize":"6664310","txDigest":"EKCC7bCbVixJUjvWGgAkNxkmh1nGa5crJTt6gNxR57DX","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
