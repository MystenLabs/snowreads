The seminal result by Shi et\nal. establishes that nonlinear optical devices relying on the\nintensity-dependent refractive index obey dynamic reciprocity for small signals\nwith spectrally distinct fields. However, it has also been recognized that it\nis possible to violate dynamic reciprocity by exploiting frequency mixing\nprocesses. In this paper, we establish a rigorous upper bound on this violation\nthat is independent of device geometry. We demonstrate that this bound captures\nthe parameter scalings of realizable physical systems, and that under some\nconditions dynamic reciprocity violation can grow unbounded to achieve\narbitrary nonlinear isolation. These results provide an analytically robust\nversion of dynamic reciprocity, as well as theoretical guidance for the\ndevelopment of power efficient nonlinear optical isolators and circulators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
