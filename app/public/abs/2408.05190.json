To\nthis end, we first consider disjunctive timed networks (DTNs), i.e., networks\nof TAs that communicate via location guards that enable a transition only if\nthere is another process in a certain location. We solve for the first time the\ngeneral case with clock invariants, and establish the decidability of the\nparameterized verification problem for local trace properties and for\nreachability of global configurations; Moreover, we prove that, surprisingly\nand unlike in other settings, this model is equivalent to lossy broadcast\nnetworks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HkZbA7WHVXaOGzqgZHyrDsLlpB1lOt4EAxOsYrxifgc","pdfSize":"948639"}
