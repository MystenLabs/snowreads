Preece gave two talks in 2013, in which he introduced the notion of\ntredoku patterns. These are certain configurations of diamond-shaped tiles,\ninspired by the sukodu-like puzzle that appears in newspapers. Very sadly,\nProf. Preece died in January 2014, before he was able to complete his work on\nthis problem. This paper reconstructs his work, and settles (in the\naffirmative) the conjectures he proposed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
