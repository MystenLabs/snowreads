After\nreviewing the results from the past and present experiments, and discussing the\nnear-future sensitivities from the IceCube Upgrade and KM3NeT/ORCA, we study\nthe expected improvements in the precision of 2-3 oscillation parameters that\nthe next-generation long-baseline experiments, DUNE and T2HK, can bring either\nin isolation or combination. We highlight the relevance of the possible\ncomplementarities between these two experiments in obtaining the improved\nsensitivities in determining the deviation from maximal mixing of\n$\\theta_{23}$, excluding the wrong-octant solution of $\\theta_{23}$, and\nobtaining high precision on 2-3 oscillation parameters, as compared to their\nindividual performances. We observe that for the current best-fit values of the\noscillation parameters and assuming normal mass ordering (NMO), DUNE + T2HK can\nestablish the non-maximal $\\theta_{23}$ and exclude the wrong octant solution\nof $\\theta_{23}$ at around 7$\\sigma$ C.L. with their nominal exposures. We find\nthat DUNE + T2HK can improve the current relative 1$\\sigma$ precision on\n$\\sin^{2}\\theta_{23}~(\\Delta m^{2}_{31})$ by a factor of 7 (5) assuming NMO.\nAlso, we notice that with less than half of their nominal exposures, the\ncombination of DUNE and T2HK can achieve the sensitivities that are expected\nfrom these individual experiments using their full exposures. We also portray\nhow the synergy between DUNE and T2HK can provide better constraints on\n($\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$ - $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CP}}$) plane as compared to their\nindividual reach.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
