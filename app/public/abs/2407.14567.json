Our exploration focuses on the symbiotic relationship between AI\nand OS, emphasizing how AI-driven tools enhance OS performance, security, and\nefficiency, while OS advancements facilitate more sophisticated AI\napplications. We delve into various AI techniques employed to optimize OS\nfunctionalities, including memory management, process scheduling, and intrusion\ndetection. Simultaneously, we analyze the role of OS in providing essential\nservices and infrastructure that enable effective AI application execution,\nfrom resource allocation to data processing. The article also addresses\nchallenges and future directions in this domain, emphasizing the imperative of\nsecure and efficient AI integration within OS frameworks. By examining case\nstudies and recent developments, our review provides a comprehensive overview\nof the current state of AI-OS integration, underscoring its significance in\nshaping the next generation of computing technologies. Finally, we explore the\npromising prospects of Intelligent OSes, considering not only how innovative OS\narchitectures will pave the way for groundbreaking opportunities but also how\nAI will significantly contribute to advancing these next-generation OSs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Operating Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
