It turns out that they must be associated with a rich set of\ngeometric data, on the one hand, and that on the other hand, all such operators\ncan be locally conjugated in some sense.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
