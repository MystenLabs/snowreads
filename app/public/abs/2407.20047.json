This paper explores the application of established\nmachine learning techniques for imputing missing data in a real-world ESG\ndataset, emphasizing the quantification of uncertainty through prediction\nintervals. By employing multiple imputation strategies, this study assesses the\nrobustness of imputation methods and quantifies the uncertainty associated with\nmissing data. The findings highlight the importance of probabilistic machine\nlearning models in providing better understanding of ESG scores, thereby\naddressing the inherent risks of wrong ratings due to incomplete data. This\napproach improves imputation practices to enhance the reliability of ESG\nratings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EhNKWlOUUV7sGmX7QDpnBKFvz3q-r9kq7h8DOwHLYo4","pdfSize":"1043974"}
