Supercontinuum high harmonic\n(HH) spectrum was generated in argon (80 eV - 160 eV) and neon (150 eV - 270\neV). The experimental spectra reasonably agree with those calculated by the\nstrong-field approximation model and Maxwell's equations. In addition,\nsimulation results indicate that the dispersion of HHs in argon can be\ncompensated using a 207-nm Zr filter to obtain 40 as pulses (1.1 cycles at 118\neV). For neon, a 278-nm Sn filter can compensate for dispersion of HH and\ncreate 23 as pulses (1.1 cycles at 206 eV). This soft X-ray single-cycle\nattosecond pulse is expected to be highly valuable for ultrafast science and\napplications in quantum information science.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
