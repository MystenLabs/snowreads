By adopting the spectral\ndecomposition technique, a linear regression equation is constructed to collect\npreviously appeared excitation information, establishing a relationship between\nunknown parameters and the system's historical data. A composite learning term,\ndeveloped using the linear regression equation, is incorporating into the\nLyapunov-based parameter update law. In comparison to the existing results, all\nspectrums of previously appeared excitation information are collected, with the\nmatrices in linear regression equation guaranteed to be bounded. This paper\nintroduces concepts of excited and unexcited subspaces for analyzing the\nparameter estimation errors, and a novel Lyapunov function is developed for\nstability analysis. It is demonstrated that, without imposing any excitation\ncondition, the state and excited parameter estimation error component converge\nto zero, while the unexcited component remains unchanged. Simulation results\nare provided to validate the theoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
