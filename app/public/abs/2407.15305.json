This paper addresses these\nproblems by tying the SLAM system with a global loop closure detection\napproach, which intrinsically handles these situations. However, online\nprocessing for global loop closure detection approaches is generally influenced\nby the size of the environment. The proposed graph-based SLAM system uses a\nmemory management approach that only consider portions of the map to satisfy\nonline processing requirements. The approach is tested and demonstrated using\nfive indoor mapping sessions of a building using a robot equipped with a laser\nrangefinder and a Kinect.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
