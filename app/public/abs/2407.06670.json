The out-of-plane\nfield-dependent magnetoresistance (MR) is positive and is huge to the order of\n~104% at 2 K and 10 T. On the other hand, the longitudinal (in-plane)\nfield-dependent MR is relatively small and is negative. The thermal activation\nenergy is also estimated by using the Boltzmann formula from resistivity vs\ntemperature measurement under applied transverse magnetic fields. The\ntopological nature of Bi is confirmed by Z2 invariant calculation using Density\nfunctional theory. PBESol bands show trivial but Hybrid functional (HSE) bands\nshow non-trivial topology being present in Bismuth. This article\ncomprehensively studies the dependence of MR oscillations upon the angle\nbetween the applied field and the current. The observed oscillations fade away\nas the angle is increased. This article is an extension of our previous work on\nBismuth [1], in which we conducted a comprehensive analysis of its structural\nand micro-structural properties along with its transport behavior in an applied\ntransverse magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
