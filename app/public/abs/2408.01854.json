In particular, the\ndifferences between the basic notion of number of $e$-folds ($N_e$), total\nnumber of $e$-folds ($N_T$) and number of $e$-folds before the end of inflation\n($N$), are outlined. The proper application of the number of $e$-folds before\nthe end of inflation is discussed both as a time-like variable for the scalar\nfield evolution and as a key parameter for computing inflationary predictions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
