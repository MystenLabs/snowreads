This graph is an analogue of the curve graph of\nmapping class groups but in the context of Artin groups. As an application, we\ndeduce a number of rigidity and classification results for these groups,\nincluding computation of outer automorphism groups, commensurability\nclassification, quasi-isometric rigidity, measure equivalence rigidity, orbit\nequivalence rigidity, rigidity of lattice embedding, and rigidity of\ncross-product von Neumann algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
