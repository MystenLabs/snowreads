Under the assumption of diluteness, we show that the discrete\nenergy converges, in the sense of $\\Gamma$-convergence, to a line-tension\nenergy defined on Volterra line dislocations, regarded as integral\nvector-valued currents supported on rectifiable curves. Remarkably, the\nline-tension limit is of the same form as that derived from semi-discrete\nmodels of linear elastic dislocations based on a core cutoff regularization. In\nparticular, the line-tension energy follows from a cell relaxation and differs\nfrom the classical ansatz, which is quadratic in the Burgers vector.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
