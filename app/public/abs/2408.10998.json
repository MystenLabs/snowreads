Although\nmatch cuts are often visual, certain match cuts involve the fluid transition of\naudio, where sounds from different sources merge into one indistinguishable\ntransition between two shots. In this paper, we explore the ability to\nautomatically find and create \"audio match cuts\" within videos and movies. We\ncreate a self-supervised audio representation for audio match cutting and\ndevelop a coarse-to-fine audio match pipeline that recommends matching shots\nand creates the blended audio. We further annotate a dataset for the proposed\naudio match cut task and compare the ability of multiple audio representations\nto find audio match cut candidates. Finally, we evaluate multiple methods to\nblend two matching audio candidates with the goal of creating a smooth\ntransition.
