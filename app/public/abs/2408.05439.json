For example, users may want to search data\nusing queries like ``find the tables created by Alex and endorsed by Mike that\ncontain sales numbers.'' They may also want to see how the data they view\nrelates to other data, its lineage, or the quality and compliance of its\nupstream datasets, all metadata. Yet, effectively surfacing metadata through\ninteractive user interfaces (UIs) to augment data discovery poses challenges.\nConstantly revamping UIs with each update to metadata sources (or providers)\nconsumes significant development resources and lacks scalability and\nextensibility. In response, we introduce Humboldt, a new framework enabling\ninteractive data systems to effectively leverage metadata for data discovery\nand rapidly evolve their UIs to support metadata changes. Humboldt decouples\nmetadata sources from the implementation of data discovery UIs that support\nsearch and dataset visualization using metadata fields. It automatically\ngenerates interactive data discovery interfaces from declarative\nspecifications, avoiding costly metadata-specific (re)implementations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
