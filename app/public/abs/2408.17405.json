However, the superconducting (superfluid)\ncritical temperatures, $T_c$'s, are still somewhat smaller than the lowest\ntemperatures achieved in experiments. Here we consider two possible routes,\ngenerically called layering, to increase $T_c$: a bilayer and a simple cubic\nlattice, both with tunable hopping, $t_z$, between attractive Hubbard planes.\nWe have performed minus-sign--free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations\nto calculate response functions such as pairing correlation functions, uniform\nspin susceptibility, and double occupancy, through which we map out some\nphysical properties. We have found that by a judicious choice of fillings and\nintensity of on-site attraction, a bilayer can exhibit $T_c$'s between 1.5 and\n1.7 times those of the single layer; for the simple-cubic lattice the\nenhancement can be 30\\% larger than the maximum for the single layer. We also\ncheck the accuracy of both a BCS-like estimate for $T_c$ in the attractive\nHubbard model, as well as of an upper bound for $T_c$ based on the superfluid\ndensity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
