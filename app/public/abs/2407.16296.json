Quantum computing (QC) has emerged as a promising tool\nwith the potential to revolutionize these critical areas. This review explores\nthe application of quantum machine learning and optimization techniques for\nclimate change prediction and enhancing sustainable development. Traditional\ncomputational methods often fall short in handling the scale and complexity of\nclimate models and natural resource management. Quantum advancements, however,\noffer significant improvements in computational efficiency and problem-solving\ncapabilities. By synthesizing the latest research and developments, this paper\nhighlights how QC and quantum machine learning can optimize\nmulti-infrastructure systems towards climate neutrality. The paper also\nevaluates the performance of current quantum algorithms and hardware in\npractical applications and presents realistic cases, i.e., waste-to-energy in\nanaerobic digestion, disaster prevention in flooding prediction, and new\nmaterial development for carbon capture. The integration of these quantum\ntechnologies promises to drive significant advancements in achieving climate\nresilience and sustainable development.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O6SA1GJyLKq7AwEqL20pIiIAK8io1qUirDrxCtCjm-k","pdfSize":"498298"}
