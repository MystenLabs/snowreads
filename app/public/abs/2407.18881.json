We give a\ndefinition of freeness associated to a collection of tensors of possibly\ndifferent orders. Our definition reduces to the usual freeness when only\ntensors of order 2 are concerned. We define the free cumulants which are\nassociated to this notion of tensor freeness. We prove that the basic models of\nrandom tensors are asymptotically free as the dimension goes to infinity. On\nthe way, we establish Schwinger-Dyson loop equations associated to random\ntensors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
