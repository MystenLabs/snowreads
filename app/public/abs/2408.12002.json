It is part of the folklore of mathematics\nthat the genesis of this argument was motivated by physical analogy involving\nelectrostatic fields. The story goes something like this: If an electrostatic\npotential is prescribed on the boundary of a region, it will extend to a\npotential in the interior of the region which is harmonic when the electric\nfield is in stable equilibrium, and that electrostatic field has minimum\nDirichlet energy. The details of this argument are seldom given and where they\nare, they are typically scant, redacted, and speculative while often omitting\neither physics details or mathematics details. The purpose of this article is\nto give a detailed reconstruction of the electrostatic argument by combining\naccounts in several contemporary and historical disparate sources. Particular\nattention is given to explaining the frequently omitted physics and\nmathematical details and how they fit together to give the physical motivation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
