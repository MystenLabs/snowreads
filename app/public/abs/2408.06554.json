We show here that the shift-invert Lanczos\nmethod can dramatically reduce the computational effort. We apply the method to\ntwo test problems, namely a simple model Hamiltonian and to a more realistic\nHamiltonian for nuclear fission. For a Hamiltonian of dimension 66103 we find\nthat the computation time is reduced by a factor of 33 compared to the direct\ncalculation of the Green's function.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
