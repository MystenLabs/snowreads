Given\nuncalibrated natural images, Splatt3R can predict 3D Gaussian Splats without\nrequiring any camera parameters or depth information. For generalizability, we\nbuild Splatt3R upon a ``foundation'' 3D geometry reconstruction method, MASt3R,\nby extending it to deal with both 3D structure and appearance. Specifically,\nunlike the original MASt3R which reconstructs only 3D point clouds, we predict\nthe additional Gaussian attributes required to construct a Gaussian primitive\nfor each point. Hence, unlike other novel view synthesis methods, Splatt3R is\nfirst trained by optimizing the 3D point cloud's geometry loss, and then a\nnovel view synthesis objective. By doing this, we avoid the local minima\npresent in training 3D Gaussian Splats from stereo views. We also propose a\nnovel loss masking strategy that we empirically find is critical for strong\nperformance on extrapolated viewpoints. We train Splatt3R on the ScanNet++\ndataset and demonstrate excellent generalisation to uncalibrated, in-the-wild\nimages. Splatt3R can reconstruct scenes at 4FPS at 512 x 512 resolution, and\nthe resultant splats can be rendered in real-time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qi93E4t_4VI9hOoPwOvfketaUIck4ljEEeU2zckibpw","pdfSize":"28948930"}
