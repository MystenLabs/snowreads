We compare\nmethods of classification in the application of audio analysis with machine\nlearning and identify optimal models. We then analyze the significant audio\nfeatures present in and most effective in categorizing rage music, while also\nidentifying key audio features as well as broader separating sonic variations\nand trends.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
