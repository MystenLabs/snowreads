To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose a representation of HEAs as a collection of local environment (LE)\ngraphs. Based on this representation, we introduce the LESets machine learning\nmodel, an accurate, interpretable GNN for HEA property prediction. We\ndemonstrate the accuracy of LESets in modeling the mechanical properties of\nquaternary HEAs. Through analyses and interpretation, we further extract\ninsights into the modeling and design of HEAs. In a broader sense, LESets\nextends the potential applicability of GNNs to disordered materials with\ncombinatorial complexity formed by diverse constituents and their flexible\nconfigurations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
