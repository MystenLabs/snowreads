Here, we demonstrate that a\nsquare cellular skyrmion on an artificial grid pinning pattern can be\nmanipulated by programmed current pulses. We find that parallel short pulses\ncould result in the elongation of the skyrmion mainly in the current direction,\nwhile parallel long pulses are able to induce the elongation in the direction\nperpendicular to the current due to the intrinsic skyrmion Hall effect.\nConsequently, a programmed sequence of parallel pulses could lead to the\ntransformation of the skyrmion to I-, L-, and Z-shaped polyomino-like\nstructures without affecting the topological charge. In addition, we find that\northogonal pulses could lead to the transformation to more complex\npolyomino-like structures, including the T-shaped and irregular ones.\nParticularly, when a small T-shaped structure is formed, the topological charge\nof the system is found to be non-integer due to incomplete compensation of\nlocal topological charge densities; however, the T-shaped structure is stable\non the attractive pinning pattern. Our results offer an effective way to create\npolyomino-like spin structures toward functional applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
