By suitably defining curvature on\nnetworks, the study of this theme has been extended into the domain of network\nanalysis as well. In particular, this has led to curvature-based community\ndetection algorithms. In this paper, we reveal the relation between community\nstructure of a network and the curvature of its edges. In particular, we give\napriori bounds on the curvature of intercommunity edges of a graph.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
