This gives a topological extension of\nDirac's theorem and asymptotically confirms a conjecture of Georgakopoulos,\nHaslegrave, Montgomery, and Narayanan.\n  Unlike typical results in the area, our proof does not rely on the Absorption\nMethod, the Regularity Lemma or the Blow-up Lemma. Instead, we use a recently\nintroduced framework that is based on covering the vertex set of the host graph\nwith a family of complete blow-ups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
