Under mild conditions, we establish the\nexistence of two positive normalized solutions provided the prescribed mass is\nsufficiently small: one is a local minimizer and the second one is of mountain\npass type. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions approaching\nthe zero mass case, namely when $c\\to 0^+$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
