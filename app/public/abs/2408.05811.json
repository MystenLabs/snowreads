This means that the vehicle has to reliably know its position and\norientation with an accuracy of a few centimeters and degrees, respectively.\nThis paper presents a radar-based approach to self-localization, which exploits\nfully polarimetric scattering information for robust landmark detection. The\nproposed method requires no input from sensors other than radar during\nlocalization for a given map. By association of landmark observations with map\nlandmarks, the vehicle's position is inferred. Abstract point- and line-shaped\nlandmarks allow for compact map sizes and, in combination with the factor graph\nformulation used, for an efficient implementation. Evaluation of extensive\nreal-world experiments in diverse environments shows a promising overall\nlocalization performance of $0.12 \\text{m}$ RMS absolute trajectory and $0.43\n{}^\\circ$ RMS heading error by leveraging the polarimetric information. A\ncomparison of the performance of different levels of polarimetric information\nproves the advantage in challenging scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
