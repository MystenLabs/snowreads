Despite their success in a variety of inverse problems in\nimaging, these models require many steps to converge, leading to slow inference\ntime. Recently, there has been a trend in diffusion models for employing\nsophisticated noise schedules that involve more frequent iterations of\ntimesteps at lower noise levels, thereby improving image generation and\nconvergence speed. However, application of these ideas for solving inverse\nproblems with diffusion models remain challenging, as these noise schedules do\nnot perform well when using empirical tuning for the forward model\nlog-likelihood term weights. To tackle these challenges, we propose zero-shot\napproximate posterior sampling (ZAPS) that leverages connections to zero-shot\nphysics-driven deep learning. ZAPS fixes the number of sampling steps, and uses\nzero-shot training with a physics-guided loss function to learn log-likelihood\nweights at each irregular timestep. We apply ZAPS to the recently proposed\ndiffusion posterior sampling method as baseline, though ZAPS can also be used\nwith other posterior sampling diffusion models. We further approximate the\nHessian of the logarithm of the prior using a diagonalization approach with\nlearnable diagonal entries for computational efficiency. These parameters are\noptimized over a fixed number of epochs with a given computational budget. Our\nresults for various noisy inverse problems, including Gaussian and motion\ndeblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution show that ZAPS reduces inference\ntime, provides robustness to irregular noise schedules and improves\nreconstruction quality.
