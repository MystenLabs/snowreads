The manual creation of new categories can be laborious and\ntime-intensive. To tackle this issue, we built language models to translate\nWikipedia categories from English to Vietnamese with a dataset containing\n15,000 English-Vietnamese category pairs. Subsequently, small to medium-scale\nTransformer pre-trained models with a sequence-to-sequence architecture were\nfine-tuned for category translation. The experiments revealed that\nOPUS-MT-en-vi surpassed other models, attaining the highest performance with a\nBLEU score of 0.73, despite its smaller model storage. We expect our paper to\nbe an alternative solution for translation tasks with limited computer\nresources.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vB50yVDbuhWrtHlylh7v2DuTu5cx57jVa1BIsAqvAr8","pdfSize":"348946"}
