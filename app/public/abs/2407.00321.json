We prove that travelling wave solutions\nconstructed by ground states are stable if $p$ is $L^{2}$-subcritical and\nspeeds of waves are sufficiently small by showing the coercivity of the\nlinearized operator around ground states, which is introduced by\nGrillakis-Shatah-Strauss (1987).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
