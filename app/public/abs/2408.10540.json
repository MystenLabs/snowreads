Acting on the Dirac spinor representation, the eigenvalues of the\nfield position operator correspond to the spatial components of the\nLorentz-covariant space-time coordinate $4$-vector. We show that the field\nposition operator preserves the particle and the antiparticle character of the\nstates. Thus, the field position operator can serve as a one-particle position\noperator for both particles and antiparticles, thereby avoiding an unusual\nfast-oscillating term, known as the Zitterbewegung, associated with the Dirac\nposition operator. We show that the field position operator yields the same\nvelocity as a classical free particle. The eigenstates of the field position\noperator satisfy the Newton-Wigner locality criteria and transform in a\nLorentz-covariant manner. The field position operator becomes particle position\nand antiparticle position operators when acting on the particle and the\nantiparticle subspaces, both of which are Hermitian. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that within the particle subspace of the Dirac spinor space, the\nfield position operator is equivalent to the Newton-Wigner position operator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
