We report our calculations of\nexchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ for SrCr$_2$As$_2$ using a static\nlinear-response method based on first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations. We find that the dominant nearest neighbor exchange coupling\n$J_{\\rm{1}} > 0$ is antiferromagnetic whereas the next-nearest neighbor\ninteraction $J_{\\rm{2}} < 0$ is ferromagnetic with\n$J_{\\rm{2}}$/$J_{\\rm{1}}$~=~$-0.68$, reinforcing the checkerboard in-plane\nstructure. Thus, unlike other transition-metal arsenides based on Mn, Fe, or\nCo, we find no competing magnetic interactions in SrCr$_2$As$_2$, which aligns\nwith experimental findings. Moreover, the orbital resolution of exchange\ninteractions shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct exchange\nmediated by the Cr $d$ orbitals. To validate the calculations we conduct\ninelastic neutron-scattering measurements on powder samples that show steeply\ndispersive magnetic excitations arising from the magnetic $\\Gamma$ points and\npersisting up to energies of at least 175 meV. The spin-wave spectra are then\nmodeled using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the theoretically calculated\nexchange couplings. The calculated neutron scattering spectra are in good\nagreement with the experimental data.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
