We perform a detailed study of such a system to explore the features\nof the prompt emission spectra from the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Particularly,\nwe address the effect of optical opacity and its dependence on the density\nprofile between the expanding gas and the observer. This results in a\nnontrivial shape of the photospheric radius which in combination with the\nconstraints derived from the equal-arrival-time can result in a mild broader\nspectrum compared to the Planck function. Further, we show the time-integrated\nspectrum from the expanding fireball deviates significantly from the\ninstantaneous emission and is capable of explaining the observed broad spectral\nwidth of the GRBs. We also show, that the demand of the spectral width of the\norder of unity, obtained through statistical analysis, is consistent with the\nscenario where the dynamics of the expanding fireball are governed\npredominantly by the energy content of the matter.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rhJVhILdkDuvDtpiryhgnekK6ytymF6vsfKacVFn1t4","pdfSize":"1028881"}
