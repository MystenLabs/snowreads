Given a query\nand a set of completeness rules (a special kind of tuple generating\ndependencies) that specify which parts of the database are complete, we\ninvestigate whether the query can be fully answered, as if all data were\navailable. If not, we explore reformulating the query into either Maximal\nComplete Specializations (MCSs) or the (unique up to equivalence) Minimal\nComplete Generalization (MCG) that can be fully answered, that is, the best\ncomplete approximations of the query from below or above in the sense of query\ncontainment. We show that the MSG can be characterized as the least fixed-point\nof a monotonic operator in a preorder. Then, we show that an MCS can be\ncomputed by recursive backward application of completeness rules. We study the\ncomplexity of both problems and discuss implementation techniques that rely on\nan ASP and Prolog engines, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pqexXJVSHj58ctsfPft41c0qnkMs0rXRqxMkr0FEE6g","pdfSize":"464480"}
