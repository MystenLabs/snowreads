This novel approach leverages the natural efficiency of ant colony\npheromone trails to find optimal routes, balancing both environmental and\neconomic objectives. By integrating sustainability into transportation models,\nCAACS provides a powerful tool for real-world applications, including network\ndesign, delivery route planning, and commercial aircraft logistics. Our\nalgorithm's unique bi-objective optimization advances the study of sustainable\ntransportation solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
