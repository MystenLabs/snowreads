As compared to BPs with\ncontinuous (linear/convex) optimization problems in both levels, the BPs with\ndiscrete decision variables have received much less attention, largely due to\nthe ensuing computational intractability and the incapability of gradient-based\nalgorithms for handling discrete optimization formulations. In this paper, we\ndevelop deep learning techniques to address this challenge. Specifically, we\nconsider a BP with binary tender, wherein the upper and lower levels are linked\nvia binary variables. We train a neural network to approximate the optimal\nvalue of the lower-level problem, as a function of the binary tender. Then, we\nobtain a single-level reformulation of the BP through a mixed-integer\nrepresentation of the value function. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative\nanalysis between two types of neural networks: general neural networks and the\nnovel input supermodular neural networks, studying their representational\ncapacities. To solve high-dimensional BPs, we introduce an enhanced sampling\nmethod to generate higher-quality samples and implement an iterative process to\nrefine solutions. We demonstrate the performance of these approaches through\nextensive numerical experiments, whose lower-level problems are linear and\nmixed-integer programs, respectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
