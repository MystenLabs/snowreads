The final stage of lyophilization,\nnamely secondary drying, entails bound water removal via desorption, in which\naccurate prediction of bound water concentration is vital to ensuring the\nquality of the lyophilized product. This article proposes a novel technique for\nreal-time estimation of the residual moisture during secondary drying in\nlyophilization. A state observer is employed, which combines temperature\nmeasurement and mechanistic understanding of heat transfer and desorption\nkinetics, without requiring any online concentration measurement. Results from\nboth simulations and experimental data show that the observer can accurately\nestimate the concentration of bound water in real time for all possible\nconcentration levels, operating conditions, and measurement noise. This\nframework can also be applied for monitoring and control of the residual\nmoisture in other desorption-related processes.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"8WxEqdw0CcWzW8ENodaHfDq5i4MiyfvvEJy2jMHDTqQ","pdfSize":"5391506"}
