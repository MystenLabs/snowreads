The existing pairwise kSZ\nmethod involves pairing clusters with other clusters and stacking them. In the\ncross-pairwise method, we propose to pair clusters with galaxies from a\nspectroscopic survey and then do the stacking. Cross-pairing decreases the\nmeasurement, instrumentation, and statistical noise, thus boosting the\nsignal-to-noise ratio. However, we also need data from a galaxy survey in\naddition to the CMB temperature maps and a cluster catalog in order to use this\nmethod. We do a Fisher matrix analysis for the optimised pairwise and\ncross-pairwise estimators and forecast the ability of future Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) experiments and galaxy surveys to measure cosmological\nparameters with the kSZ effect when combined with primary CMB and Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. We show that using the cross-pairwise kSZ\nestimator (CMB-S4 clusters with DESI galaxies) leads to a factor of 3\nimprovement in the $1-\\sigma$ error of the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and\n$w_a$ and a factor of 6 improvement for the growth rate index $\\gamma$ compared\nto the pairwise estimator for the same CMB dataset and cluster catalog.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
