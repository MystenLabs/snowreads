This field now includes the\nintegration of Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicles (MRAVs) into cellular networks, with\na specific focus on under-actuated MRAVs. These vehicles face challenges in\nindependently controlling position and orientation due to their limited control\ninputs, which adversely affects communication metrics such as Signal-to-Noise\nRatio. In response, a newer class of omnidirectional MRAVs has been developed,\nwhich can control both position and orientation simultaneously by tilting their\npropellers. However, exploiting this capability fully requires sophisticated\nmotion planning techniques. This paper presents a novel application of\nomnidirectional MRAVs designed to enhance communication security and thwart\neavesdropping. It proposes a strategy where one MRAV functions as an aerial\nBase Station, while another acts as a friendly jammer to secure communications.\nThis study is the first to apply such a strategy to MRAVs in scenarios\ninvolving eavesdroppers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
