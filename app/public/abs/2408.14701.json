To do so, we translate these programs into a graphical syntax\nof probabilistic circuits, formalised as string diagrams, the two-dimensional\nsyntax of symmetric monoidal categories. We then prove a first completeness\nresult for the equational theory of the conditioning-free fragment of our\nsyntax. Finally, we extend this result to a complete equational theory for the\nentire language. Note these developments are also of interest for the\ndevelopment of probability theory in Markov categories: our first result gives\na presentation by generators and equations of the category of Markov kernels,\nrestricted to objects that are powers of the two-elements set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
