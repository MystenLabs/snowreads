We investigate low complexity/latency multi-input\nstructures that can be adopted by the node for computing outgoing messages y =\n(y1, y2, . . . , yn) from incoming messages x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn), where\neach yj , j = 1, 2, . . . , n is computed via a multi-way tree with leaves x\nexcluding xj . Specifically, we propose two classes of structures for different\nscenarios. For the scenario where complexity has a higher priority than\nlatency, the star-tree-based structures are proposed. The complexity-optimal\nones (as well as their lowest latency) of such structures are obtained, which\nhave the near-lowest (and sometimes the lowest) complexity among all\nstructures. For the scenario where latency has a higher priority than\ncomplexity, the isomorphic-directed-rooted-tree-based structures are proposed.\nThe latency-optimal ones (as well as their lowest complexity) of such\nstructures are obtained, which are proved to have the lowest latency among all\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
