This paper introduces a novel\nDynamic Gap Reduction Algorithm (DGRA), which is a crowdsensing-based approach\naimed at addressing this question through parking detection data collected by\nsensors on moving vehicles. The algorithm's efficacy is validated through real\ndrive tests and simulations. We also present a Driver-Side and Traffic-Based\nModel (DSTBM), which incorporates drivers' parking decisions and traffic\nconditions to evaluate DGRA's performance. Results highlight DGRA's significant\npotential in reducing the mobile sensing accuracy gap, marking a step forward\nin efficient urban parking management.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Other Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
