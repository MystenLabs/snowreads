For intelligent internet of things\nsensors and devices, which often have non-constant power requirements, an\nadditional power management stage with energy storage is needed to temporarily\nprovide a higher power output than the power being harvested. This paper\nproposes an RF wireless power energy conversion system for miniaturized IoT\ncomposed of an impedance matching network, a rectifier, and power management\nwith energy storage. The proposed sub-system has been experimentally validated\nand achieved an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 30 % for an\ninput power of -10 dBm and a peak efficiency of 57 % at 3 dBm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
