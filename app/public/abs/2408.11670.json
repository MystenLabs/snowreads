Eyring revised the\nreverberation theory to resolve this contradiction. However, Eyring's theory is\ninconsistent in its formulation of the steady state and decay processes.\nTherefore, the author has revised Sabine's theory (Hanyu, Acoustical Science &\nTechnology 45, 3, 2024), taking a different approach from that of Eyring. This\nrevised theory was constructed by introducing the concept of \"reverberation of\na direct sound\". In this paper, a new mathematical model of reverberation using\nreflection orders is proposed. This means that the revised theory already\nproposed by the author is reconstructed to include the temporal energy\ndistributions in each reflection order. The new mathematical model also uses\nthe concept of \"reverberation of a direct sound\" but describes the\nreverberation of only reflected sounds without the direct sound. This means\nthat the concept of \"reverberation of a direct sound\" is essential also to the\nentire reverberation process. Reverberation decay of the new model is\nconsistent with that of the already proposed revised theory. The new model\nshowed good correspondence with the simulation results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lgNIlAMfMzXAFyhBTw1qHgu5PUHaEnlPGnNzN_xRaiU","pdfSize":"1059822"}
