A notion of a generalised eigenvector is\nintroduced to discuss this kind of stability and prove it exists at most in the\norder of $1,p/2,p$, where $p$ is the period of the corresponding matrix. Thus\ncharacterizing the generalised eigenvectors of all powers of the matrix. Also,\na sufficient condition is proved for the exponential of a matrix to be robust.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"acL8V7KVf1BXOu4OylsLLXsbFlXSb9EcFDi3qjW2FjI","pdfSize":"453555"}
