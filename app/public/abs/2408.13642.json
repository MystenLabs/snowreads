By partitioning the data into distinct, stationary\nsegments, the PS-CARE model adeptly detects temporal shifts in item rankings,\nknown as change points, whose number and positions are initially unknown.\nLeveraging the minimum description length (MDL) principle, this paper\nestablishes a statistically consistent model selection criterion to estimate\nthese unknowns. The practical optimization of this MDL criterion is done with\nthe pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm. Empirical evaluations reveal the\nmethod's promising performance in accurately locating change points across\nvarious simulated scenarios. An application to an NBA dataset yielded\nmeaningful insights that aligned with significant historical events,\nhighlighting the method's practical utility and the MDL criterion's\neffectiveness in capturing temporal ranking changes. To the best of the\nauthors' knowledge, this research pioneers change point detection in pairwise\ncomparison data with covariate information, representing a significant leap\nforward in the field of dynamic ranking analysis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rx48LDjzNXAnt8Iw5Ugo7riUZ8DA_9vD3DbHpiAny_A","pdfSize":"356940"}
