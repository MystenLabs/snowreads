Leveraging the power of advanced large language models (LLMs),\ncosmosage has learned from a vast corpus of open-access source texts, including\ntextbooks and papers. cosmosage is found to be state-of-the-art on the narrow\ntask of answering questions about cosmology, outperforming all general-purpose\nmodels. The model parameters and code are publicly available.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
