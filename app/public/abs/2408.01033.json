In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations\ninto a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is\nessential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a\npower-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel\napproach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies\nthe computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us\nto evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity\ncan be accurately described as linear. We develop a python code and compute a\ncomprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering\nmain-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white\ndwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available at\nhttp://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13049419.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
