An interesting topic closely related to the origins\nof FRBs is their classifications. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a\npromising probe to study cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications\nof FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were suggested, and some\ntight empirical relations have been found for them. In particular, Guo and Wei\nsuggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young\npopulations, which have also some new empirical relations. They also proposed\nto use one of the empirical relations without dispersion measure (DM) to\ncalibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of\nthe new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more\nthan 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are\nobservationally known. Thus, it is time to check the empirical relations with\nthe current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold,\nand in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for\ncosmology stands firm.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
