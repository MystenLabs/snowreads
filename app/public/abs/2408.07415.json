Here, we present a novel coarse-grained approach in modeling\nG-quadruplexes which accounts for their structural flexibility. We apply it to\nstudy the polymeric properties of G-quadruplex multimers, with and without\ncrowder particles, to mimic in-vivo conditions. We find that, contrary to some\nsuggestions found in the literature, long G-quadruplex multimers are rather\nflexible polymeric macromolecules, with a local persistence length comparable\nto monomer size, exhibiting chain stiffness variation profile consistent with a\nreal polymer in good solvent. Moreover, in a crowded environment (up to 10%\nvolume fraction), we report that G-quadruplex multimers exhibit an increased\npropensity for coiling, with a corresponding decrease in the measured chain\nstiffness. Accurately accounting for the polymeric properties of G4 multimers\nis crucial for understanding their interactions with anticancer G4-targeting\ndrugs, thereby significantly enhancing the design and effectiveness of these\ndrugs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
