Initially, as is typical in our context, we\nintroduce the wormholes by embedding a curved surface into a higher dimensional\nflat Minkowski spacetime. Subsequently, we derive the spacetime metric that\ncharacterizes the rotating frame of these wormholes. We then investigate\nanalytical solutions of the generalized Dirac equation within this framework.\nThrough exploring a second-order nonperturbative wave equation, we seek exact\nsolutions for fermions within the rotating frame of hyperbolic and elliptic\nwormholes, also known as negative curvature wormholes. Our analysis provides\nclosed-form energy expressions, and we generalize our findings to Weyl\nfermions. By considering the impact of the rotating frame and curvature radius\nof wormholes, we discuss how these factors affect the evolution of fermionic\nfields, offering valuable insights into their behavior.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L_VLQPyXwsfW2P-mZGl7raT4OfsX0bB_8q-jNrppdrM","pdfSize":"463740","txDigest":"3vRkr1CDQQMutKLv6AbwmxBiWeJL2joFrDm6mQA33VrU","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
