Experiments show that their\nautomatic separation, made easy with methods like Segment Anything, together\nwith independent foreground and background-related modeling, improves results.\nThe two predictions are combined in a principled way, thanks to novel\nPer-Instance Temperature Scaling that helps the classifier to deal with\nappearance ambiguities in training and to produce calibrated outputs in the\ninference phase. For identity prediction from the background, we propose novel\nspatial and temporal models. On two problems, the relative error w.r.t. the\nbaseline was reduced by 22.3% and 8.8%, respectively. For cases where objects\nappear in new locations, an example of background drift, accuracy doubles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
