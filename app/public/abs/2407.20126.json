A specialized, physics-inspired\narchitecture is proven to provide close accordance between the predicted\nevolutions and the ground truth ones obtained via conventional integration\nschemes. The method can closely reproduce the evolution of microstructures not\nrepresented in the training set at a fraction of the computational costs.\nExtremely long-time extrapolation capabilities are achieved, up to reaching the\ntheoretically expected equilibrium state of the system, despite the training\nset containing only relatively-short, initial phases of the evolution.\nQuantitative accordance with the decay rate of the Free energy is also\ndemonstrated up to late coarsening stages, providing an example of a\ndata-driven, physically consistent and high-accuracy Machine Learning method\nfor the long timescale simulation of materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
