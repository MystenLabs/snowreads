The NSs\naccreted from the progenitors of the WDs and their spin periods were\naccordingly accelerated to the equilibrium periods of order milliseconds. Thus,\nthe initial spin periods of the ``recycled\" NSs are critically determined by\nthe mass transfer rate in the LMXB phase. However, the standard picture\nneglects the possible spin-down of the NSs when the donor star decouples from\nits Roche lobe at the end of the mass transfer, as well as the transient\nbehavior of most LMXBs. Both imply more complicated spin evolution during the\nrecycling process. In this work, we perform detailed calculations of the\nformation of MSP+He WD binaries. We take into account three magnetic braking\n(MB) prescriptions proposed in the literature, and examine the effects of both\npersistent and transient accretion. We find that the spin periods are not\nsensitively dependent on the efficiency of MB, but are considerably influenced\nby the accretion mode. In comparison with persistent accretion, transient\naccretion leads to shorter and longer spin periods of the NSs in narrow and\nwide systems, respectively. This may help account for the measured spin periods\nof MSPs in wide binaries, which seem to be longer than predicted by the\npersistent accretion model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
