However,\ntheir storage efficiency is constrained by the fixed compression ratio, which\nsubstantially increases storage size when hundreds of high-quality textures are\nrequired. In this paper, we propose a novel block texture compression method\nwith neural networks, Neural Texture Block Compression (NTBC). NTBC learns the\nmapping from uncompressed textures to block-compressed textures, which allows\nfor significantly reduced storage costs without any change in the shaders.Our\nexperiments show that NTBC can achieve reasonable-quality results with up to\nabout 70% less storage footprint, preserving real-time performance with a\nmodest computational overhead at the texture loading phase in the graphics\npipeline.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
