In this work, we investigate the spin-$3/2$ chain with\nnearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and uniaxial single-ion\nanisotropy $D$ terms in the absence of a magnetic field. For positive values of\n$J_2/J_1$ and $D/J_1$, we find seven different phases in a rich phase diagram.\nWithout frustration $J_2=0$, a gapless Luttinger liquid phase remains stable\nfor all $D>0$. As $J_2$ increases, we observe three phases with distinct\ndimerized valence bond orders, which show an intricate competition with vector\nchiral order and incommensurate correlations. For large $J_2$, regions of phase\ncoexistence between the dimerized and vector chiral orders emerge. We present\nlarge-scale numerical data for the determination of transition lines, order\nparameters, and the nature of the phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gORNE9mLrTKVTFSAZ13bd9u5Ukevz3GJuGUM3iOPipU","pdfSize":"499781"}
