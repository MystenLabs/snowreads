Our ReRamp algorithm utilizes reversible\nside-ramps to generate construction plans for ramped block structures higher\nand larger than was previously possible using state-of-the-art planning\nalgorithms, given the same building area. We compare the ReRamp algorithm to\nsimilar state-of-the-art algorithms on a set of benchmark instances, where we\ndemonstrate its superior computational speed. We also establish in our\nexperiments that the ReRamp algorithm is capable of generating plans for a\nsingle-story house, an important milestone on the road to real-world\nmulti-agent construction applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
