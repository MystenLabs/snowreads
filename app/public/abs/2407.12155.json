For these theories in general, the scalar\nGauss-Bonnet coupling function $\\xi (\\phi)$ is arbitrary and unrelated to the\nscalar potential. We develop the inflationary formalism of this theory, and\npresent analytic forms for the slow-roll indices, the observational indices and\nthe $e$-foldings number, assuming solely a slow-roll era and also that the\nconstraints imposed by the GW170817 event hold true. We present in detail an\ninteresting class of models that produces a viable inflationary era. Finally,\nwe investigate the behavior of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet coupling function\nduring the reheating era, in which case the evolution of the Hubble rate\nsatisfies a constant-roll-like relation $\\dot{H}=\\delta H^2$. As we show, the\nbehavior of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet coupling during the reheating is different\nfrom that of the inflationary era. This is due to the fact that the evolution\ngoverning the reheating is different compared to the inflationary era.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
