With the recent success of large\nlanguage models(LLMs), it is appealing to apply the emerging intelligence of\nLLM agents in this competitive arena and understanding if they can outperform\nprofessional traders. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the\ncurrent research on using LLMs as agents in financial trading. We summarize the\ncommon architecture used in the agent, the data inputs, and the performance of\nLLM trading agents in backtesting as well as the challenges presented in these\nresearch. This survey aims to provide insights into the current state of\nLLM-based financial trading agents and outline future research directions in\nthis field.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
