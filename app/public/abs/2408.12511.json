We find that the distribution functions of\nsheet length $\\ell$ (longest scale of the analyzed structure in the direction\nperpendicular to the dominant guide field) and curvature $r_c$ (radius of a\ncircle fitted to the structures) can be well-approximated by power-law\ndistributions, indicating self-similarity of the structures. The distribution\nfor the sheet width $w$ (shortest scale of the structure) peaks at the kinetic\nscales and decays exponentially at larger values. The data shows little or no\ncorrelation between $w$ and $\\ell$, as expected from theoretical\nconsiderations. The typical $r_c$ depends linearly on $\\ell$, which indicates\nthat the sheets all have a similar curvature relative to their sizes. We find a\nweak correlation between $r_c$ and $w$. Our results can be used to inform\nrealistic magnetohydrodynamic sub-grid models for plasma turbulence in\nhigh-energy astrophysics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
