In contrast, \"textless\"\nmethods process speech representations without ASR systems, enabling the direct\nuse of acoustic speech features. Although their effectiveness is shown in\ncapturing acoustic features, it is unclear in capturing lexical knowledge. This\npaper proposes a textless method for dependency parsing, examining its\neffectiveness and limitations. Our proposed method predicts a dependency tree\nfrom a speech signal without transcribing, representing the tree as a labeled\nsequence. scading method outperforms the textless method in overall parsing\naccuracy, the latter excels in instances with important acoustic features. Our\nfindings highlight the importance of fusing word-level representations and\nsentence-level prosody for enhanced parsing performance.
