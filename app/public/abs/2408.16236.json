Unlike previous methods, we\nconsider the entire dataset as a high-dimensional observation that is low-rank\nacross all dimensions. We aim to discover the low-rank representation of the\nentire dataset and perform distillation efficiently. Toward this end, we learn\na set of spectrum tensors and transformation matrices, which, through simple\nmatrix multiplication, reconstruct the data distribution. Specifically, a\nspectrum tensor can be mapped back to the image space by a transformation\nmatrix, and efficient information sharing during the distillation learning\nprocess is achieved through pairwise combinations of different spectrum vectors\nand transformation matrices. Furthermore, we integrate a trajectory matching\noptimization method guided by a real distribution. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nbenchmarks, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Tiny Imagenet, and ImageNet Subset.\nOur code are available at \\url{https://github.com/slyang2021/NSD}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
