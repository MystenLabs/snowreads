A Van der Pol- Duffing oscillator with a one-sided barrier,\nsubjected to harmonic excitations, has been considered an archetypical\nlow-order model, whose response is weak. It is shown that the system response\ncan be significantly enhanced by applying an additional harmonic excitation but\nwith much higher frequencies. The reasons for the underlying physics are\ninvestigated analytically using multiple-scale analysis and the Blekham\nperturbation approach (direct partition motion). The analytical predictions are\nqualitatively validated using numerical simulations. This approach yields\nvaluable insights into the intricate interplay between fast and slow\nexcitations in non-smooth systems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
