A strongly connected nonlinear distributed observer is designed\nunder the assumption of global observability. By proper parameter tuning with\nlinear matrix inequalities, the observer error equation possesses\nfinite/fixed-time stability in the perturbation-free case and input-to-state\nstability with respect to bounded perturbations. Numerical simulations are\nperformed to validate this design.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
