It\nprovides several uncertainty propagation methods to predict stochastic moments\nof the system state and can consider unknown parts of the system dynamics using\nGaussian process regression. These methods are used to reformulate a stochastic\nMPC formulation as a deterministic one that is solved with GRAMPC. The\nperformance of the presented framework is evaluated using examples from a wide\nrange of technical areas. The experimental evaluation shows that GRAMPC-S can\nbe used in practice for the control of nonlinear uncertain systems with\nsampling times in the millisecond range.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
