Previous studies focused on the linewidth of\nalkali metal atoms within the spin-exchange relaxation-free regime near zero\nmagnetic field and in strong magnetic fields where Zeeman resonances are well\nresolved due to the quadratic Zeeman effect. However, the linewidth in the\nunresolved Zeeman resonance regime, which is prevalent in various magnetometer\nand comagnetometer applications, is not well understood. To address this, we\ndeveloped a theoretical framework based on the master equation for alkali metal\natoms and solved it under the rotating wave approximation and weak driving\nconditions. Our numerical calculations and analytical expressions reveal that\nthe light-narrowing effect occurs only when the ratio of the spin exchange rate\nto the spin destruction rate exceeds a critical value. Additionally, we show\nthat the linewidth in the unresolved Zeeman resonance regime is significantly\ninfluenced by the mutual coupling of quantum coherence between different Zeeman\nsublevels. These findings provide a theoretical tool for understanding spin\nrelaxation in alkali-metal atoms and optimizing the performance of atomic\nmagnetometers and comagnetometers operating in this regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
