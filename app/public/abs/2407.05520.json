We show that this theory challenges common assumptions\nin the statistical and the computational learning theories, for it implies that\nlearning true probabilities is equivalent neither to obtaining a correct\ncalculation of the true probabilities nor to obtaining an almost-sure\nconvergence to them. We also briefly discuss some case studies from natural\nlanguage processing and macroeconomics from the perspective of the new theory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
