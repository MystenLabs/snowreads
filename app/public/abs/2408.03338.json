The dataset covers diverse spaces within the W7 faculty buildings\nof Lodz University of Technology, characterised by high-resolution laser-based\npoint clouds and manual labelling. Alongside the dataset, we propose metrics\nand benchmarking guidelines essential for ensuring trustworthy and reproducible\nresults in algorithm evaluation. We anticipate that the introduction of the\nInLUT3D dataset and its associated benchmarks will catalyse future advancements\nin 3D scene understanding, facilitating methodological rigour and inspiring new\napproaches in the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
