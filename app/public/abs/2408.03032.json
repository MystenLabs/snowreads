A novel flexible quaternion generalized minimal\nresidual method is presented to quickly solve this model. An improved\nconvergence theory is established to obtain a sharp upper bound of the residual\nnorm of quaternion minimal residual method (QGMRES). The convergence theory is\nalso presented for preconditioned QGMRES. Numerical experiments indicate the\nsuperiority of the proposed model and algorithms over the state-of-the-art\nmethods in terms of iteration steps, CPU time, and the quality criteria of\nrestored color images.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
