The induced\ndomain walls arise because the effective $\\theta$ parameter changes across the\nheavy axion domain walls, shifting the potential minimum of the QCD axion. When\nthe heavy axion domain walls collapse, the induced QCD axion domain walls\ncollapse as well. This novel mechanism for producing the QCD axions can explain\ndark matter even with the axion decay constant as small as ${\\cal O}(10^{9})$\nGeV. In particular, this scenario requires domain wall collapse near the QCD\ncrossover, potentially accounting for the stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground suggested by recent pulsar timing array observations, including\nNANOGrav. Using this mechanism, it is also possible to easily create induced\ndomain walls for string axions or axions with a large decay constant, which\nwould otherwise be challenging. We also comment on the implications for cosmic\nbirefringence using induced axion domain walls.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
