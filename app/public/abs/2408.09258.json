Previous studies have identified a\ncontagion effect in gun violence, characterized by bursts of diffusion across\nurban environments, which can be effectively represented using the\nself-excitatory spatiotemporal Hawkes process. The Hawkes process and its\nvariants have been successful in modeling self-excitatory events, including\nearthquakes, disease outbreaks, financial market movements, neural activity,\nand the viral spread of memes on social networks. However, existing Hawkes\nmodels applied to gun violence often rely on simplistic stationary kernels,\nwhich fail to account for the complex, non-homogeneous spread of influence and\nimpact over space and time. To address this limitation, we adopt a\nnon-stationary spatiotemporal point process model that incorporates a neural\nnetwork-based kernel to better represent the varied correlations among events\nof gun violence. Our study analyzes a comprehensive dataset of approximately\n16,000 gunshot events in the Atlanta metropolitan area from 2021 to 2023. The\ncornerstone of our approach is the innovative non-stationary kernel, designed\nto enhance the model's expressiveness while preserving its interpretability.\nThis approach not only demonstrates strong predictive performance but also\nprovides insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of gun violence and its\npropagation within urban settings.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
