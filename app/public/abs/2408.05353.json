In this paper, we introduce IntentRec,\na novel recommendation framework based on hierarchical multi-task neural\nnetwork architecture that tries to estimate a user's latent intent using their\nshort- and long-term implicit signals as proxies and uses the intent prediction\nto predict the next item user is likely to engage with. By directly leveraging\nthe intent prediction, we can offer accurate and personalized recommendations\nto users. Our comprehensive experiments on Netflix user engagement data show\nthat IntentRec outperforms the state-of-the-art next-item and next-intent\npredictors. We also share several findings and downstream applications of\nIntentRec.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
