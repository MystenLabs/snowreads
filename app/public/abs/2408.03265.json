These learning-based methods typically\nrequire diverse and representative training material for optimization in order\nto achieve model generalization and optimal coding performance. However,\nexisting datasets either offer limited content variability or come with\nrestricted licensing terms constraining their use to research purposes only. To\naddress these issues, we propose a new training dataset, named BVI-AOM, which\ncontains 956 uncompressed sequences at various resolutions from 270p to 2160p,\ncovering a wide range of content and texture types. The dataset comes with more\nflexible licensing terms and offers competitive performance when used as a\ntraining set for optimizing deep video coding tools. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that when used as a training set to optimize two popular network\narchitectures for two different coding tools, the proposed dataset leads to\nadditional bitrate savings of up to 0.29 and 2.98 percentage points in terms of\nPSNR-Y and VMAF, respectively, compared to an existing training dataset,\nBVI-DVC, which has been widely used for deep video coding. The BVI-AOM dataset\nis available for download under this link: (TBD).\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
