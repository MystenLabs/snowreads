This study\nintroduces a customized ConvNeXt architecture, a powerful convolutional neural\nnetwork, specifically adapted for EEG analysis. ConvNeXt addresses traditional\nEEG challenges like high dimensionality, noise, and variability, enhancing the\nprecision of mental workload classification. Using the STEW dataset, the\nproposed ConvNeXt model is evaluated alongside SVM, EEGNet, and TSception on\nbinary (No vs SIMKAP task) and ternary (SIMKAP multitask) class mental workload\ntasks. Results demonstrated that ConvNeXt significantly outperformed the other\nmodels, achieving accuracies of 95.76% for binary and 95.11% for multi-class\nclassification. This demonstrates ConvNeXt's resilience and efficiency for EEG\ndata analysis, establishing new standards for mental workload evaluation. These\nfindings represent a considerable advancement in EEG-based mental workload\nestimation, laying the foundation for future improvements in cognitive state\nmeasurements. This has broad implications for safety, efficiency, and user\nexperience across various scenarios. Integrating powerful neural networks such\nas ConvNeXt is a critical step forward in non-invasive cognitive monitoring.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
