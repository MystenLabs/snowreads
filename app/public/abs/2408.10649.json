While numerous\nmodels have emerged from both physics and machine learning (ML) communities,\nthere is a growing trend towards integrating these approaches to develop hybrid\narchitectures known as physics-aware machine learning models. Among these, the\nfinite volume neural network (FINN) has emerged as a recent addition. FINN has\nproven to be particularly efficient in uncovering latent structures in data. In\nthis study, we explore the capabilities of FINN in tackling the shallow-water\nequations, which simulates wave dynamics in coastal regions. Specifically, we\ninvestigate FINN's efficacy to reconstruct underwater topography based on these\nparticular wave equations. Our findings reveal that FINN exhibits a remarkable\ncapacity to infer topography solely from wave dynamics, distinguishing itself\nfrom both conventional ML and physics-aware ML models. Our results underscore\nthe potential of FINN in advancing our understanding of spatiotemporal\nphenomena and enhancing parametrization capabilities in related domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"p32RBysCk3iDRj1MyUhcxzOgPUEfcCJrg5tQw1zWPRo","pdfSize":"8473246"}
