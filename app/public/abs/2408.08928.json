This problem is interesting because belief fusion is an inherent part\nof dealing with situations where available information is imprecise, as often\noccurs in Artificial Intelligence. We managed to identify an isomorphism betwin\nthe DST formal apparatus into that of a Probabilistic Logic. Thus, we solved\nthe problematic inputs affair by replacing the DST combination rule with a new\nfusion process aiming at eliminating anomalies proposed by that rule. We apply\nthe new fusion method to the DST paradox Problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MNw2mvzFcfSv_jYrXyx5g8uP32nH_9TtnmAoS3UhmCg","pdfSize":"247073"}
