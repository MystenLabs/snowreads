Two global PDF\ndeterminations at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy have been recently\npresented, MAPPDFpol1.0 and BDSSV24. I review the former and I provide a\ncomparative discussion of other PDF sets accurate to next-to-leading order. I\nshow that differences between these PDF sets, due to the choice of experimental\nand methodological input, exceed differences due to perturbative accuracy.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
