One user-friendly approach is natural language\nprogramming. However, it encounters challenges such as an expansive user\nexpression space and limited support for debugging and editing, which restrict\nits application in end-user programming. The emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) offers promising avenues for the translation and interpretation between\nhuman language instructions and the code executed by robots, but their\napplication in end-user programming systems requires further study. We\nintroduce Cocobo, a natural language programming system with interactive\ndiagrams powered by LLMs. Cocobo employs LLMs to understand users' authoring\nintentions, generate and explain robot programs, and facilitate the conversion\nbetween executable code and flowchart representations. Our user study shows\nthat Cocobo has a low learning curve, enabling even users with zero coding\nexperience to customize robot programs successfully.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
