BMTI\nestimates the logarithm of the density by initially computing log-density\ndifferences between neighbouring data points. Subsequently, such differences\nare integrated, weighted by their associated uncertainties, using a\nmaximum-likelihood formulation. This procedure can be seen as an extension to a\nmultidimensional setting of the thermodynamic integration, a technique\ndeveloped in statistical physics. The method leverages the manifold hypothesis,\nestimating quantities within the intrinsic data manifold without defining an\nexplicit coordinate map. It does not rely on any binning or space partitioning,\nbut rather on the construction of a neighbourhood graph based on an adaptive\nbandwidth selection procedure. BMTI mitigates the limitations commonly\nassociated with traditional nonparametric density estimators, effectively\nreconstructing smooth profiles even in high-dimensional embedding spaces. The\nmethod is tested on a variety of complex synthetic high-dimensional datasets,\nwhere it is shown to outperform traditional estimators, and is benchmarked on\nrealistic datasets from the chemical physics literature.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
