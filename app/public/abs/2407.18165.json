We suggest to probe the physical phenomena taking\nplace close to the singularity in the interior of a $2+1$D analogue black hole\narising from a polytropic, inviscid, irrotational, and axisymmetric steady\nflow, and propose to this end an experimental setup in a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. Our study provides concrete evidence, for a well understood\ndynamical system, that the Einstein equations are not necessary for a\nsingularity to form, demonstrating that Penrose-type spacetime singularities\ncan potentially also exist in non-Einsteinian theories of gravity. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how the singularity is physically avoided in our proposed\nlaboratory setup.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
