In this work, we calculate the moderate-$x$\ninitial conditions in the regime, $\\alpha_s \\ln^2(1/x)\\sim 1$, for the\nsmall-$x$ helicity evolution using a light-front valence quark model of the\nproton, which provides additional physical information about the target. The\nperturbative emission and absorption of a gluon by the valence quarks are also\nincluded. The results, given in Eqs. (35), provide a new set of initial\nconditions with a significantly reduced number of free parameters than\nconventional models. Consequently, the predictive power of small-$x$ helicity\nevolution is expected to improve once the initial conditions from this work are\nincorporated.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
