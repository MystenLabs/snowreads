We\nfirst establish the results on a stationary surface and then extend them, via a\nperturbation argument, to the case where the underlying surface is evolving\nunder a prescribed velocity field. The proof combines techniques in evolving\nfinite element method, properties of Green's functions on (discretised) closed\nsurfaces, and local energy estimates for finite element methods\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
