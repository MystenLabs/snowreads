The first-class and second-class constraints\nfor arbitrary values of $\\lambda$ are presented, and one physical degree of\nfreedom is reported. The second-class constraints are removed, and the\ncorresponding generalized Dirac brackets are constructed; then, the difference\nbetween theories with different values of $\\lambda$ is remarked.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
