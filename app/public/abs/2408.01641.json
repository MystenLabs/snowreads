The problem involves scheduling\nand balancing jobs on different machines, with a non-linear objective function.\nWe first present the motivation and the problem description, along with\ndifferent modeling techniques for classical and quantum computing. The modeling\nfor classical solvers has been done as a mixed-integer convex program, while\nfor the quantum-classical solver we model the problem as a binary quadratic\nprogram, which is best suited to the D-Wave Leap's Hybrid Solver. This ensures\nthat all the solvers we use are fetched with dedicated and most suitable\nmodel(s). Henceforth, we carry out benchmarking and comparisons between\nclassical and quantum-classical methods, on problem sizes ranging till\napproximately 150000 variables. We utilize an industry grade classical solver\nand compare its results with D-Wave Leap's Hybrid Solver. The results we obtain\nfrom D-Wave are highly competitive and sometimes offer speedups, compared to\nthe classical solver.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v_5vhEFdFaFqXzn605sIzvUm9_mLhreI78E2zeoZ798","pdfSize":"560587","txDigest":"C1TDCjrpFAJKXvus81qaz4ajXcvnPbBcSPcBmJkdRWub","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
