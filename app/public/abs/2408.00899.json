While we dispose of quite efficient algorithms\nfor this ordinary problem (like the Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford algorithms), some\nslight variations in the problem statement can quickly lead to computationally\nhard problems. This article focuses specifically on two of these variants,\nnamely the constrained shortest paths problem and the k shortest paths problem.\nBoth problems are NP-hard, and thus it's not sure we can conceive a polynomial\ntime algorithm (unless P = NP), ours aren't for instance. Moreover, across this\narticle, we provide ILP formulations of these problems in order to give a\ndifferent point of view to the interested reader. Although we did not try to\nimplement these on modern ILP solvers, it can be an interesting path to\nexplore.\n  We also mention how these algorithms constitute essential ingredients in some\nof the most important modern applications in the field of data science, such as\nIsomap, whose main objective is the reduction of dimensionality of\nhigh-dimensional datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
