We prove that for any graph $H$, a graph\nobtained from replacing edges of $H$ by generalized theta graphs consisting of\neven paths satisfies Sidorenko's conjecture, provided a certain divisibility\ncondition on the number of paths. To achieve this, we prove unconditionally\nthat bipartite graphs obtained from replacing each edge of a complete graph\nwith a generalized theta graph satisfy Sidorenko's conjecture, which extends a\nresult of Conlon, Kim, Lee and Lee [J. Lond. Math. Soc., 2018].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
