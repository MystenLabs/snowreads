We show that\nuncertainty in access to credit pushes voters toward more conservative\ncandidates in US elections. Using a 1% sample of the US population with valid\ncredit reports, we relate access to credit to voting outcomes in all\ncounty-by-congressional districts over the period 2004-2016. Specifically, we\nconstruct exogenous measures of uncertainty to credit access, i.e. credit score\nvalues around which individual total credit amount jumps the most (e.g. around\nwhich uncertainty on access to credit is the highest). We then show that a 10pp\nincrease in the share of marginal voters located just around these thresholds\nincreases republican votes by 2.7pp, and reduces that of democrats by 2.6pp.\nFurthermore, winning candidates in more uncertain constituencies tend to follow\na more conservative rhetoric.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Nfc_XxDKwKRKQUNLI-jJO3fpzD5B5PenC5wWJfW5c-k","pdfSize":"2229693"}
