However, due to the complexity and subtlety of disordered syestems,\nnew localization phenomena always emerge unexpectedly. For example, it is\ngenerally believed that the phase of the hopping term does not affect the\nlocalization properties of the system, so the calculation of the phase is often\nignored in the study of localization. Here, we introduce a quasiperiodic model\nand demonstrate that the phase change of the hopping term can significantly\nalter the localization properties of the system through detailed numerical\nsimulations such as the inverse participation ratio and multifractal analysis.\nThis phase-induced localization transition provides valuable information for\nthe study of localization physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oMfWNfU0KiXJjuBB4Usvek6TmSRBqRX65OM3qsnhmC8","pdfSize":"1220207"}
