This app provides users with\nthe opportunity to develop some intuition about the inner workings of MPI as it\nis being researched through NIST's Thermal MagIC project in an interactive and\nfun way. Users can vary different experimental and post-processing parameters\nto see how the image quality and particle reconstruction changes for different\nmeasurement conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XNDv87RZKqyWXLYyGZwZQBIIyM2eZJCfAr7KywC9cuA","pdfSize":"777863"}
