We primarily focus on the distribution of Yang-Lee zeros and its\nassociated Yang-Lee edge singularity of two prototypical models: the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the XXZ spin chain. By taking the\nzero-temperature limit, we show how the Yang-Lee zeros approach the quantum\nphase transition points on the complex plane of parameters. To characterize the\nedge singularity induced by Yang-Lee zeros in quantum phase transition, we\nintroduce the entanglement entropy of the ground state to show the edges of\nYang-Lee zeros lead to the entanglement transition. We further show our results\nare also applicable to the general non-interacting parity-time-symmetric\nHamiltonians.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R3wZ3fYTq1jZYYbPAExxVs697diTlK-lx509sMj0aag","pdfSize":"631724"}
