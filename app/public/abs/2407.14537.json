Our study embarks on a\nrevolutionary journey by genetically representing products, extracting their\nchromosomal data, and constructing a comprehensive phylogenetic network of\nautomobiles. We delve deep into the technological features that shape\ninnovation, pinpointing the ancestral roots of products and mapping out\nintricate product-family triangles. By leveraging the similarities within these\ntriangles, we introduce a pioneering \"Product Disruption Index\"-inspired by the\nCD index (Funk and Owen-Smith, 2017)-to quantify a product's disruptiveness.\nOur approach is rigorously validated against the scientifically recognized\ntrend of decreasing disruptiveness over time (Park et al., 2023) and through\ncompelling case studies. Our statistical analysis reveals a fascinating\ninsight: disruptive product innovations often stem from minor, yet crucial,\nmodifications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
