Sixty scientists directly involved in the calibration of\noperational and future high-energy missions gathered for 3.5 days to discuss\nthe status of the cross-calibration between the current international\ncomplement of X-ray observatories and the possibilities to improve it. This\nsummary consists of reports from the Working Groups with topics ranging across\nthe identification and characterization of standard calibration sources,\nmulti-observatory cross-calibration campaigns, appropriate and new statistical\ntechniques, calibration of instruments and characterization of background,\npreservation of knowledge, and results for the benefit of the astronomical\ncommunity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
