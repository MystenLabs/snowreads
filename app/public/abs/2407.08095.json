Access to effective counseling remains\nlimited, particularly for substance abuse, and virtual agents offer a promising\nsolution by leveraging LLM capabilities to simulate nuanced communication\ntechniques inherent in MI. Our approach combines prompt engineering and\nintegration into a user-friendly virtual platform to facilitate realistic,\nempathetic interactions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our virtual agent\nthrough a series of studies focusing on replicating MI techniques and human\ncounselor dialog. Initial findings suggest that our LLM-powered virtual agent\nmatches human counselors' empathetic and adaptive conversational skills,\npresenting a significant step forward in virtual health counseling and\nproviding insights into the design and implementation of LLM-based therapeutic\ninteractions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
