We begin by introducing central extensions and proving the\nintegrability of the Roger Lie algebra cocycle $\\omega_\\alpha$, which is used\nto model the QGS on the torus. Incorporating stochastic perturbations, we\nformulate two specific semi-martingales on the central extension and study the\nstochastic Euler-Poincar\\'e reduction. Specifically, we add stochastic\nperturbations to the $\\mathfrak{g}$ part of the extended Lie algebra\n$\\widehat{\\mathfrak{g}} = \\mathfrak{g} \\rtimes_{\\omega_\\alpha} \\mathbb{R}$ and\nprove that the resulting critical points of the stochastic right-invariant\nLagrangian solve the viscous QGS equation, with and without Rayleigh friction\nterm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
