For instance, we prove that\nFujita's conjecture holds for irregular varieties of dimension $n$ with nef\nanticanonical bundle, assuming it holds for lower-dimensional varieties and\nunder mild conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
