The general understanding of such a process is limited. To this\nend, we present a general expression that captures fluctuations of a system\nexhibiting a switching mechanism. Specifically, we obtain an exact expression\nof the Laplace-transformed characteristic function of the particle's position.\nThen, the characteristic function is used to compute the effective diffusion\ncoefficient of a system performing intermittent dynamics. Further, we employ\ntwo examples: 1) Generalized run-and-tumble active particle, and 2) an active\nparticle switching its dynamics between generalized active run-and-tumble\nmotion and passive Brownian motion. In each case, explicit computations of the\nspatial cumulants are presented. Our findings reveal that the particle's\nposition probability density function exhibit rich behaviours due to\nintermittent activity. Numerical simulations confirm our findings.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
