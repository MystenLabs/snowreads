We prove the GCM conjecture for\norders up to $m=5$, assuming that the initial measure is log-concave, in any\ndimension. Our proof differs significantly from previous approaches to the GCM\nconjecture: it is based on Otto calculus and on the interpretation of the heat\nflow as the Wasserstein gradient flow of the entropy. Crucial to our\nmethodology is the observation that the convective derivative behaves as a flat\nconnection over probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular we prove\na form of the univariate Faa di Bruno's formula on the Wasserstein space\n(despite it being curved), and we compute the higher-order Wasserstein\ndifferentials of internal energy functionals (including the entropy), both of\nwhich are of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
