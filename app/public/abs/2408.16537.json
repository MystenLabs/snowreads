Yet, GNNs are often vulnerable to adversarial structural\nattacks as embedding generation relies on graph topology. Existing efforts are\ndedicated to purifying the maliciously modified structure or applying adaptive\naggregation, thereby enhancing the robustness against adversarial structural\nattacks. It is inevitable for a defender to consume heavy computational costs\ndue to lacking prior knowledge about modified structures. To this end, we\npropose an efficient defense method, called Simple and Fast Robust Graph Neural\nNetwork (SFR-GNN), supported by mutual information theory. The SFR-GNN first\npre-trains a GNN model using node attributes and then fine-tunes it over the\nmodified graph in the manner of contrastive learning, which is free of\npurifying modified structures and adaptive aggregation, thus achieving great\nefficiency gains. Consequently, SFR-GNN exhibits a 24%--162% speedup compared\nto advanced robust models, demonstrating superior robustness for node\nclassification tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
