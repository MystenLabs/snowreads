When a\nNN's structure (Model) is given, during the training steps, the parameters of\nthe model are determined using an appropriate criterion and an optimization\nalgorithm (Training). Then, the trained model can be used for the prediction or\ninference step (Testing). As there are also many hyperparameters, related to\nthe optimization criteria and optimization algorithms, a validation step is\nnecessary before its final use. One of the great difficulties is the choice of\nthe NN's structure. Even if there are many \"on the shelf\" networks, selecting\nor proposing a new appropriate network for a given data, signal or image\nprocessing, is still an open problem. In this work, we consider this problem\nusing model based signal and image processing and inverse problems methods. We\nclassify the methods in five classes, based on: i) Explicit analytical\nsolutions, ii) Transform domain decomposition, iii) Operator Decomposition, iv)\nOptimization algorithms unfolding, and v) Physics Informed NN methods (PINN).\nFew examples in each category are explained.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-fGVc4TTNtgLWC38EmJq3dGAtq-WTVuUesOf_vvEZTU","pdfSize":"1543601"}
