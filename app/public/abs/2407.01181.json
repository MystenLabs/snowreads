New bounds on the coupling strengths of the\naxion/ALP with quarks and of pseudoscalar mesons $P = \\pi, \\eta, \\eta'$ with\ndark fermions are obtained by using existing upper bounds on invisible decay\nmodes of $P$s including those recently derived by NA64. We also study a\nscenario when the $a$ plays the role of a messenger in the communication\nbetween our world and the dark sector.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
