This result is based on the assumption that interthermometer\ncorrelations are induced exclusively by low-frequency noise in the common bath,\na condition achievable in practical experimental scenarios. The underlying\nphysical mechanism is clarified, revealing that the Heisenberg scaling arises\nfrom the intrinsic nature of the temperature, which is associated solely with\nthe fluctuation of thermal noise. In contrast to the paradigm of independent\nthermometers, our proposed scheme demonstrates a significant enhancement in\nprecision for low-temperature measurement, making it suitable for precisely\nmeasuring the temperature of ultracold systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
