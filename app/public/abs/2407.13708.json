Recently,\nsubstantial insight and methods on OOD detection were presented by the ML\ncommunity, but how do they fare in DP applications? To this end, we establish a\nbenchmark study, our highlights being: 1) the adoption of proper evaluation\nprotocols, 2) the comparison of diverse detectors in both a single and\nmulti-model setting, and 3) the exploration into advanced ML settings like\ntransfer learning (ImageNet vs. DP pre-training) and choice of architecture\n(CNNs vs. transformers). Through our comprehensive experiments, we contribute\nnew insights and guidelines, paving the way for future research and discussion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
