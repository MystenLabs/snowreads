In this article, we are going to employ this tool to study hoop\nalgebras. To do so, we define square root and make the first attempt to explore\nthe significance properties of this concept in this setting. Then, due to the\nkey role of square roots in obtaining new hoop algebras, we apply them on the\nfilters of hoop algebras, and show that the formation of square roots on\nquotient structures of hoop algebras by their filters is well-behaved. In\naddition, a new class of hoop algebras having square roots, so called good hoop\nalgebras, is introduced and its relationships with other classes of ordered\nalgebras such as Boolean algebras and Godel algebras are explored. Several\nexamples are provided as well. Ultimately, it is shown that the class of all\nbounded hoop algebras with square roots is a variety.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
