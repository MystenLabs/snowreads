In this paper, we present AUTOE2E, a novel\napproach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation\nof semantically meaningful feature-driven E2E test cases for web applications.\nAUTOE2E intelligently infers potential features within a web application and\ntranslates them into executable test scenarios. Furthermore, we address a\ncritical gap in the research community by introducing E2EBENCH, a new benchmark\nfor automatically assessing the feature coverage of E2E test suites. Our\nevaluation on E2EBENCH demonstrates that AUTOE2E achieves an average feature\ncoverage of 79%, outperforming the best baseline by 558%, highlighting its\neffectiveness in generating high-quality, comprehensive test cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
