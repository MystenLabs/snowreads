The Bakry-\\'Emery $\\Gamma_2$ criterion\ninequality was crucially used to prove the monotonicty of the Fisher\ninformation for the Landau equation by Guillen and Silvestre recently.\nTherefore, a better bound on the optimal constant $\\Lambda_d$ expands the range\nof interaction potentials that exhibits the monotonicity of the Fisher\ninformation. In particular, we compute that $\\Lambda_3$ is between $5.5$ and\n$5.739$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
