As a first step, the problem is\nreduced to a single first-order integro-differential equation by defining a\ngeneralized ansatz function. Then, we employ contraction mapping to show that\nthere exists the unique fixed point of the problem. For a given small initial\ndata, we prove the existence of a global classical solution. Finally, by\nintroducing local mass and local charge functions in higher dimensions, we also\nshow the completeness property of the spacetimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
