The DCGAN was trained on\nthe Richers \\textit{et al.~}\\cite{richers:2017} waveform catalogue to learn the\nstructure of rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-wave signals and\ngenerate realistic waveforms. We show that the DCGAN learns the distribution of\nthe training data reasonably well, and that the waveform emulator produces\nsignals that appear to have the key features of core-collapse, bounce, early\npost-bounce, and ringdown oscillations of the early proto-neutron star. The\npre-trained DCGAN can therefore be used as a phenomenological model for\nrotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
