In particular,\nmetal-poor accreted star candidates offer a unique opportunity to better\nunderstand the accretion history of the Milky Way. In this work, we aim to\nexplore the assembly history of the Milky Way by investigating accreted stars\nin terms of their ages, dynamical properties, and chemical abundances. We also\naim to better characterize the impact of incorporating asteroseismic\ninformation on age and chemical abundance calculations of metal-poor accreted\nstars for which TESS data is available. In this study, we conducted an in-depth\nexamination of 30 metal-poor accreted star candidates, using TESS and Gaia\ndata, as well as MIKE spectra. We find satisfactory agreement between seismic\nand predicted/spectroscopic surface gravity (log g) values, demonstrating the\nreliability of spectroscopic data from our methodology. We found that while age\ndetermination is highly dependent on the log g and asteroseismic information\nused, the overall chemical abundance distributions are similar for different\nlog g. However, we found that calcium (Ca) abundances are more sensitive to the\nadopted log g. Our study reveals that the majority of our stars have properties\ncompatible to those reported for the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, with a minority of\nstars that might be associated to Splash. We found an age distribution with a\nmedian of 11.3 Gyr with lower and upper uncertainties of 4.1 and 1.3 Gyr\nrespectively when including asteroseismic information. As regarding some key\nchemical signatures we note that these stars are metal-poor ([Fe/H]) < -0.8),\nalpha-rich ([alpha]/Fe] > 0.2), copper-poor ([Cu/Fe] < 0 ) and with chemical\nabundances typical of accreted stars. These findings illustrate the importance\nof multi-dimensional analyses in unraveling the complex accretion history of\nthe Milky Way.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
