In this work we aim to show that it is\npractical to instead use the optimal multivariate Epanechnikov kernel. We make\nuse of this optimal Epanechnikov mixture kernel density estimate for the\nsequential filtering scenario through what we term the ensemble Epanechnikov\nmixture filter (EnEMF). We provide a practical implementation of the EnEMF that\nis as cost efficient as the comparable ensemble Gaussian mixture filter. We\nshow on a static example that the EnEMF is robust to growth in dimension, and\nalso that the EnEMF has a significant reduction in error per particle on the\n40-variable Lorenz '96 system.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
