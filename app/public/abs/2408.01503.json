This problem is NP-hard and arises in\nvarious practical applications. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that\nleverages graph neural networks to tackle the problem efficiently, particularly\nfor large graphs. We propose a physics-inspired approach that leverages tools\nused in statistical mechanics to improve the training and performance of the\nalgorithm. The scaling of our method is evaluated for different connectivities\nand graph sizes. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a\ndataset of Erdos-Renyi graphs, showing its applicability also in hard-to-solve\nconnectivity regions where traditional methods struggle.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5sg3ru_51htCHjTbd-qMLOnpIV76RyRzYcxFdhV0Qk4","pdfSize":"12195863","txDigest":"6RQLkQLDjHij1D5BEjC633YsBp5xhn6BSuFSWGPD2F3N","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
