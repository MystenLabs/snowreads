Recent studies have highlighted\nthe limitations of LLMs in low-resource languages, primarily focusing on binary\nclassification tasks and giving minimal attention to South Asian languages.\nThese limitations are primarily attributed to constraints such as dataset\nscarcity, computational costs, and research gaps specific to low-resource\nlanguages. To address this gap, we present datasets for sentiment and hate\nspeech tasks by translating from English to Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu,\nfacilitating research in low-resource language processing. Further, we\ncomprehensively examine zero-shot learning using multiple LLMs in English and\nwidely spoken South Asian languages. Our findings indicate that GPT-4\nconsistently outperforms Llama 2 and Gemini, with English consistently\ndemonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks compared to\nlow-resource languages. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that natural language\ninference (NLI) exhibits the highest performance among the evaluated tasks,\nwith GPT-4 demonstrating superior capabilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ObImKSvbUQ4FMyTm1XADdoBndr02VaReRbIUohp7lto","pdfSize":"482426","txDigest":"Zy9vHivGjaiC8zUCv1vk6dQ9pFpmrXuJurEg69GUNig","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
