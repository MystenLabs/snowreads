For a half-space geometry, we determine the low-energy\nquantum eigenstates for a four-band model of a WSM in a magnetic field\nperpendicular to the surface. The eigenstates correspond to in- and out-going\nchiral Landau level (LL) states, propagating (anti-)parallel to the field\ndirection near different Weyl nodes, which are coupled by evanescent\nsurface-state contributions generated by all other LLs. These replace the Fermi\narc in a magnetic field. Computing the phase shift accumulated between in- and\nout-going chiral LL states, we compare our quantum-mechanical results to\nsemiclassical predictions. We find quantitative agreement between both\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5sspfEsEN9rvGRAJsvM1sUGBDwu36KM449jHCj0rJLc","pdfSize":"1517761"}
