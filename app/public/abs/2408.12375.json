A psychophysical characterization involving\nten able-bodied participants is performed to compute the Just Noticeable\nDifference (JND) related to the discrimination of vibrotactile cues delivered\non the skin in two forearm positions, with the goal of optimising vibrotactile\nactuator position to maximise perceptual response. Furthermore, system\nperformance is validated and tested both with ten able-bodied participants and\none prosthesis user considering three tasks. More specifically, in the Active\nTexture Identification, Slippage and Fragile Object Experiments, we investigate\nif the VIBES could enhance users' roughness discrimination and manual usability\nand dexterity. Finally, we test the effect of the vibrotactile system on\nprosthetic embodiment in a Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) task. Results show the\nsystem's effectiveness in conveying contact and texture cues, making it a\npotential tool to restore sensory feedback and enhance the embodiment in\nprosthetic users.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1W5vR0Vpxs0WTT8hDueGBQh2ob56MtiZAPxrlb7exA8","pdfSize":"1062105"}
