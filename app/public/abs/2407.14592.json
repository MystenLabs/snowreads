Seeking for\na dark matter energy density in agreement with observations, we study different\nnon-renormalizable interactions between the dark matter species and the field\nundergoing the transition. The resulting relic abundance is shown to display a\nstrong dependence on the Lorentz boost factor associated to the bubble wall\nmotion, with this dependence becoming more significant the higher the dimension\nof the non-renormalizable interaction. This allows for observational\ncompatibility across a wide range of dark matter masses and transition\ntemperatures, typically excluded in renormalizable scenarios. For a transition\naround the electroweak scale, the associated gravitational wave spectrum is\nalso within the reach of future detectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
