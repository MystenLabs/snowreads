This paper introduces DASH, a bimodal data exploration\ntool that supports integrating semantic levels into the interactive process of\nvisualization and text-based analysis. DASH operationalizes a modified version\nof Lundgard et al.'s semantic hierarchy model that categorizes data\ndescriptions into four levels ranging from basic encodings to high-level\ninsights. By leveraging this structured semantic level framework and a large\nlanguage model's text generation capabilities, DASH enables the creation of\ndata-driven narratives via drag-and-drop user interaction. Through a\npreliminary user evaluation, we discuss the utility of DASH's text and chart\nintegration capabilities when participants perform data exploration with the\ntool.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
