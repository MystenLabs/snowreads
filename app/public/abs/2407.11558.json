We present a distributed learning\nframework tailored to O-RAN network architectures. Leveraging a Thompson\nsampling-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, our approach\nprovides real-time resource allocation decisions, aligning with evolving\nnetwork structures. The proposed approach facilitates online decision-making\nfor resource allocation by deploying trained execution agents at Near-Real Time\nRadio Access Network Intelligent Controllers (Near-RT RICs) located at network\nedges. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in meeting\nQuality of Service (QoS) requirements for both eMBB and URLLC users, offering\ninsights into optimising resource utilisation in dynamic wireless environments.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
