This may not only\nlead to uncertainty in the reconstructed image but also in downstream tasks\nsuch as semantic segmentation. This uncertainty, however, is mostly not\nanalyzed in the literature, even though probabilistic reconstruction models are\ncommonly used. These models can be prone to ignore plausible but unlikely\nsolutions like rare pathologies. Building on MRI reconstruction approaches\nbased on diffusion models, we add guidance to the diffusion process during\ninference, generating two meaningfully diverse reconstructions corresponding to\nan upper and lower bound segmentation. The reconstruction uncertainty can then\nbe quantified by the difference between these bounds, which we coin the\n'uncertainty boundary'. We analyzed the behavior of the upper and lower bound\nsegmentations for a wide range of acceleration factors and found the\nuncertainty boundary to be both more reliable and more accurate compared to\nrepeated sampling.
