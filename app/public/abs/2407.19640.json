In this work we extend SINDy to\nidentify delay differential equations by using an augmented library that\nincludes delayed samples and Bayesian optimization. To identify a possibly\nunknown delay we minimize the reconstruction error over a set of candidates.\nThe resulting methodology improves the overall performance by remarkably\nreducing the number of calls to SINDy with respect to a brute force approach.\nWe also address a multivariate setting to identify multiple unknown delays and\n(non-multiplicative) parameters. Several numerical tests on delay differential\nequations with different long-term behavior, number of variables, delays, and\nparameters support the use of Bayesian optimization highlighting both the\nefficacy of the proposed methodology and its computational advantages. As a\nconsequence, the class of discoverable models is significantly expanded.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"2dbJT28udCrkaWhv6AJywyfsZ8EAWwWo85eGFdYiJGk","pdfSize":"1147108"}
