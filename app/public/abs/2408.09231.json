The\nDWBA analysis of the differential cross section of the\n$^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B ground state (g.s.) transition and excited\n($J^\\pi$ = 0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state of $^{6}$Li transition was\nperformed. The optical model potentials were obtained by fitting of measured\nelastic scattering data and evaluating parameters for the output reaction\nchannels. Phenomenological approaching based on solving an approximate equation\nfor the reaction form factor was used to determine its radial dependence and\nempirical values of asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). Obtained values\nof ANCs for the $^{6}$Li$_\\text{g.s.}$ and $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) states are\nsimilar to literature one. Comparison of the radial dependences of form factors\nshows that the wave function of the $^{6}$Li nucleus in excited ($J^\\pi$ =\n0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state has increased spatial dimension compared\nto the ground state, and in both cases some larger spatial size than the ground\nstates of the $^{11}$B and $^{10}$B. Within the framework of our analysis, we\ncan confirm that the radius of the $^{6}$Li nucleus in the 3.56 MeV state is\nlarger than in the ground state. This result is an argument in favor of a halo\nexistence in $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) state, while the question of a halo in\n$^{6}$Li$_\\text{g.s.}$ still leaves open.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
