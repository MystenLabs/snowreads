In the agnostic setting,\nwe have access to a hypothesis set $\\mathcal{H}$ and a training set of labeled\nsamples $(x_1,y_1),\\dots,(x_n,y_n) \\in \\mathcal{X} \\times \\{-1,1\\}$ drawn\ni.i.d. from an unknown distribution $\\mathcal{D}$. The goal is to produce a\nclassifier $h : \\mathcal{X} \\to \\{-1,1\\}$ that is competitive with the\nhypothesis $h^\\star_{\\mathcal{D}} \\in \\mathcal{H}$ having the least probability\nof mispredicting the label $y$ of a new sample $(x,y)\\sim \\mathcal{D}$.\n  Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is a natural learning algorithm, where one\nsimply outputs the hypothesis from $\\mathcal{H}$ making the fewest mistakes on\nthe training data. This simple algorithm is known to have an optimal error in\nterms of the VC-dimension of $\\mathcal{H}$ and the number of samples $n$.\n  In this work, we revisit agnostic PAC learning and first show that ERM is in\nfact sub-optimal if we treat the performance of the best hypothesis, denoted\n$\\tau:=\\Pr_{\\mathcal{D}}[h^\\star_{\\mathcal{D}}(x) \\neq y]$, as a parameter.\nConcretely we show that ERM, and any other proper learning algorithm, is\nsub-optimal by a $\\sqrt{\\ln(1/\\tau)}$ factor. We then complement this lower\nbound with the first learning algorithm achieving an optimal error for nearly\nthe full range of $\\tau$. Our algorithm introduces several new ideas that we\nhope may find further applications in learning theory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
