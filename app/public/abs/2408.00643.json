Assuming X is projective, we describe the\ncorrespondence between irreducible components of its moduli space, and those of\nthe resolution of singularities of its quotients: this being the first\ndescription of this correspondence for a non-cyclic action, we see new\nphenomena, of which we provide explicit examples assuming $X$ has a\npolarization of degree 4.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
