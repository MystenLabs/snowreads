Utilizing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as a threshold criterion, we\naim to enhance prediction accuracy by excluding returns that are smaller than\nthis threshold, thus mitigating errors associated with minor returns. The\nsubsequent evaluation focuses on the accuracy of predicted returns that exceed\nthis threshold. We compare four sequence lengths 168 hours (7 days), 72 hours\n(3 days), 24 hours, and 12 hours each with a return prediction interval of 2\nhours. Our findings reveal the influence of sequence length on prediction\naccuracy and underscore the potential for optimized sequence configurations in\nfinancial forecasting models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sq3pSIKGNSpVWsNu9t78GLwEqdi16JHkFwOTrQu-XZg","pdfSize":"634291"}
