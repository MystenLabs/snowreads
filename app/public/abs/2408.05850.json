Defects\nassociated with the layer-by-layer process, introduce considerable random\nvariability to the local elastic modulus of the print. The elastic modulus\nalong the fusion layers connecting bulk materials differs from that of the bulk\nareas. Accurate quantitative measurements of variations in both areas are\nessential to achieve robust optimized designs. This study aims to quantify the\nparameters of the random distributions given the surface strain field of the\nprint measured by digital image correlation (DIC). Two statistical properties,\nmean and standard deviation, are sufficient to characterize the stochastic\nelastic modulus fields in each region. An efficient neural network model is\ndeveloped to estimate spatial variations in the local elastic modulus within\nboth bulk and fusion layers. This model is trained on a dataset of synthetic\nstrain fields with known distributions in the elastic modulus fields. It\nperforms well in correlating the elastic modulus with the input strain, as long\nas the standard deviation is below 60% of the mean of the random field. The\npredictive accuracy of the model on testing data, measured by the R2 score, is\n0.99 and 0.95 for mean and standard deviation in the fusion material. The\nscores for the bulk material are 0.97 each. The trained model is implemented to\npredict the elastic modulus distribution of an FFF-printed material at a print\nspeed of 30 mm/s and an extrusion temperature of 493.15 K, based on its\nDIC-measured surface strain data. The model predicts a mean and standard\ndeviation of 1.2 GPa and 1 GPa for the bulk material and 400 MPa and 430 MPa\nfor the fusion region. Validation of predictions confirms the reliability of\nthis approach in measuring uncertainty in the local properties of the prints.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
