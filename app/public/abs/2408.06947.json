Our inference is optimized through a pre-trained\nembedding network that marginalizes the time of arrival and the luminosity\ndistance of the signal. We find that parameter inference utilizing a\npre-trained embedding outperforms the use of likelihood-free inference alone,\nreducing training time and offering the capability to marginalize over certain\nnuisance parameters. The model is capable of retrieving the intrinsic\nparameters of the kilonova light curves with a comparable accuracy and\nprecision to nested sampling methods while taking significantly less\ncomputational time. This framework has been integrated into the publicly\navailable Nuclear Multi-Messenger Astronomy codebase so users can leverage the\nmodel for their inference purposes. This algorithm is broadly applicable to\nparameterized or simulated light curves of other transient objects.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
