Each pair of particles interacts via a force that is proportional\nto the product of their masses and their separation distance, with the force\ndirected radially. We show that, despite the N-body interaction, each particle\nbehaves as if it interacts only with the center of mass of the system. This\neffective two-body interaction behaves as Hooke's Law with a common frequency\nfor all particles, with the familiar analytic solutions for the trajectories.\nWith these analytic solutions, it is possible to efficiently simulate a\ncollection of these particles and incorporate other external forces. As an\nexample, we simulate the particles within an adiabatically expanding container\nand calculate pressure and temperature in both the attractive and repulsive\ncases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
