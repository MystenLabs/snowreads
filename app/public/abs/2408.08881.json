However, accurately assessing the\nuncertainty of their predictions remains a significant challenge. To address\nthis, we propose a new model, U-MedSAM, which integrates the MedSAM model with\nan uncertainty-aware loss function and the Sharpness-Aware Minimization\n(SharpMin) optimizer. The uncertainty-aware loss function automatically\ncombines region-based, distribution-based, and pixel-based loss designs to\nenhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. SharpMin improves generalization\nby finding flat minima in the loss landscape, thereby reducing overfitting. Our\nmethod was evaluated in the CVPR24 MedSAM on Laptop challenge, where U-MedSAM\ndemonstrated promising performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9VCx--a_XI2o7fRTBZ2jt51a2uMTbxxFA7rH-f6jZOo","pdfSize":"2073880"}
