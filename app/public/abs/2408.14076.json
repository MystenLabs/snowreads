This approach conceptually resembles quantum teleportation, where\nquantum information is transferred between different nodes without directly\ntransmitting carrier photons. In contrast to the discrete operations of\nentanglement and Bell-state measurement in teleportation, our scheme is\nsymmetric and continuous. We experimentally realize coherent and bidirectional\ntransfer of arbitrary quantum states, including bosonic quantum error\ncorrection codes. Our results offer new insights into the quantum state\ntransfer and quantum teleportation. In particular, our demonstration validates\na new approach to realize quantum transducers, and might find applications in a\nwide range of physical platforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
