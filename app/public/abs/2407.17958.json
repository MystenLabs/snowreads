In all known\nexamples of infinite structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, there is in\nfact a single expansion of the structure, called a big Ramsey structure, which\ncorrectly encodes the exact big Ramsey degrees of every finite substructure\nsimultaneously. The first half of the article collects facts about this\nphenomenon that have appeared in the literature into a single cohesive\nframework, thus offering a conceptual survey of big Ramsey structures. We\npresent some original results indicating that the standard methods of proving\nfinite big Ramsey degrees automatically yield big Ramsey structures, often with\ndesirable extra properties. The second half of the article is a survey in the\nmore traditional sense, discussing numerous examples from the literature and\nshowing how they fit into our framework. We also present some general results\non how big Ramsey degrees are affected by expanding structures with unary\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
