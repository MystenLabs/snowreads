Such MZMs can be detected by e.g., tunneling conductance between each\nQD and normal leads [Dvir et al, Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. We here discuss how\nthe seemingly trivial substitution of one of the normal leads by a\nsuperconducting (SC) one gives rise to a plethora of new effects. In\nparticular, the coupling to the SC lead induces non-local Majorana effects upon\nvariations of the QDs' energies. Furthermore, the lowest excitation of the\nchain is no longer determined by the bulk gap but rather by the energy of an\nemergent subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state coexisting with the MZMs. The YSR\nstate hybridizes with the MZMs when the coupling between the SC and the QD is\nlarger than the spin splitting, spoiling the Majorana properties, including the\nquantized conductance.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
