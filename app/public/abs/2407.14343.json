In fact, we prove that a generalised ideal arc system\nfor the surface also induces a left-ordering on the big mapping class group. We\nthen prove that two generalised ideal arc systems determine the same\nleft-ordering if and only if they are loosely isotopic. Finally, we prove that\nthe topology on the big mapping class group is the same as the order topology\ninduced by a left-ordering corresponding to an inductively constructed ideal\narc system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
