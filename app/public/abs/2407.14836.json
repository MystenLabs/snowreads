Applying a magnetic field to a magneto-optical\nphotonic crystal slab lifts doubly degenerate BICs into a pair of chiral BICs\ncarrying opposite pseudo-spins and orbital angular momenta. Multipole analysis\nverifies the non-zero angular momenta and reveals the spin-orbital-locking\nbehaviors. In momentum space, we observe ultrahigh quality factors and\nnear-circular polarization surrounding chiral BICs, enabling potential\napplications in spin-selective nanophotonics. Compared to conventional BICs,\nthe magnetically-induced chiral BICs revealed here exhibit distinct properties\nand origins, significantly advancing the topological photonics of BICs by\nincorporating broken time-reversal symmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
