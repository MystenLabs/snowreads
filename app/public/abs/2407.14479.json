Both numerical\nand analytical methods were used to investigate The kink-antikink(KAK) and\nantikink-kink(AKK) collision. In the numerical analysis, we found the critical\nvelocities in both collisions increased with $n$. We also found a finite\nlifetime oscillon window in KAK collision for $n=2$. In the analytical part, we\nfound a family of shock wave solutions that describes radiation in the kink\ncollision perfectly. Moreover, an analytical AKK solution at\n$n\\rightarrow\\infty$ and $v=1$ was found by considering a certain limit of\nthese solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
