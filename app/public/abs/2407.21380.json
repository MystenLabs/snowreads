We define a constraint on the Brans-Dicke\nparameter $\\omega_{BD}^*$ identifying two stability groups,\n$\\omega_{BD}>\\omega_{BD}^*$ and $0<\\omega_{BD}<\\omega_{BD}^*$. The first group\nachieves stability with both appropriate eigenvalues and a density profile\nconsistent with dark energy dominance. The second exhibits eigenvalue stability\nbut contradicts conditions for a stable universe. We explore the impact of\nvariations in the scalar field potential and matter coupling by analyzing\ndifferent parameter sets. Each unique set of parameters results in a distinct\n$\\omega_{BD}^*$. Dynamic analysis reveals that stability is achieved when the\nscalar field dominates, highlighting the importance of the kinetic and\npotential terms while minimizing the influence of matter density. In high\nmatter density regions, the scalar field's negligible presence aligns with\nstandard gravitational behavior, whereas in low matter density regions, the\nscalar field grows exponentially, driving dark energy and cosmic acceleration.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
