We show how classical dynamics\ndescribes resonance states of all decay rates in the semiclassical limit. This\nresult for chaotic scattering systems corresponds to the well-established\nquantum ergodicity for closed chaotic systems. Specifically, we generalize\nUlam's matrix approximation of the Perron-Frobenius operator, giving rise to\nconditionally invariant measures of various decay rates. There are many matrix\napproximations leading to the same decay rate and we conjecture a criterion for\nselecting the one relevant for resonance states. Numerically, we demonstrate\nthat resonance states in the semiclassical limit converge to the selected\nmeasure. Example systems are a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering\nsystem, and open quantum maps.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
