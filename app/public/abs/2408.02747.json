With the help of\nCasimir differential equations we develop efficient algorithms to compute the\nrelevant conformal blocks for an external field of arbitrary spin and with any\nspin exchange along the thermal circle, at least in three dimensions. This is\nachieved by identifying solutions to the Casimir equations with a special class\nof spherical functions in the harmonic analysis of the conformal group. The\nresulting blocks are then applied to study the decomposition of one-point\nfunctions of the scalar $\\phi^2$ and the stress tensor $T$ for a\nthree-dimensional free scalar field $\\phi$. We are able to read off averaged\nOPE coefficients into exchanged fields of high weight and spin for a complete\nset of tensor structures. We also extract an asymptotic behaviour of conformal\nblocks and use it to analyse the density of heavy-heavy-light OPE coefficients\nfor spinning operators, comparing it with semi-classical predictions, such as\nthe dimensions of operators at large charge.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
