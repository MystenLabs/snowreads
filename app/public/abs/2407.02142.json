In particular, quantum chains with magnetic molecular units\nsynthesized by on-surface reactions provide an ideal playground for\ninvestigating magnetic exchange interactions between localized spin components.\nHere, we present an extensive study of antiferromagnetic nanographene chains\nwith the diazahexabenzocoronene molecule as the repeating unit. A combination\nof bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, density functional theory and\nquantum spin models revealed their detailed structures and electronic and\nmagnetic properties. We found that the antiferromagnetic chains host a\ncollective state featuring gapped excitations for an even number of repeating\nunits and one featuring a Kondo excitation for an odd number. Comparing with\nexact many-body quantum spin models, our molecular chains provide the\nrealization of an entangled quantum Heisenberg model. Coupled with the\ntunability of the molecular building blocks, these systems can act as an ideal\nplatform for the experimental realization of topological spin lattices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
