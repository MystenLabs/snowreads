While\nthis structure has been explored through atomic crystals and metamaterials, the\npossibility of forming a Kekul\\'e lattice from topological solitons in magnetic\nsystems has remained elusive. Here, we propose twisted bilayer easy-plane\nN\\'eel antiferromagnets as a promising platform for achieving a \"Meron Kekul\\'e\nlattice\" -- a distorted topological soliton lattice comprised of\nantiferromagnetic merons as its lattice elements. Using atomistic spin\nsimulations on these magnets, we demonstrate that due to the moir\\'e-induced\nintricate pattern of interlayer exchange coupling, the cores of these merons\nare stabilized into the Kekul\\'e-O pattern with different intracell and\nintercell bond lengths across moir\\'e supercells, hence forming a Meron\nKekul\\'e lattice. Furthermore, we showcase that the two bond lengths of the\nMeron Kekul\\'e lattice can be fine-tuned by adjusting the twist angle and\nspecifics of the interlayer exchange coupling, suggesting extensive control\nover the meron lattice configuration in contrast to conventional magnetic\nsystems. These discoveries pave the way for exploring topological solitons with\ndistinctive Kekul\\'e attributes, offering intriguing opportunities at the\nintersection of topological solitons and Kekul\\'e physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
