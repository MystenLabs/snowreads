We prove that if $E$ is Ahlfors 1-regular and it\nhas large Favard length, then it contains a big piece of a Lipschitz graph.\nThis gives a quantitative version of the Besicovitch projection theorem. As a\ncorollary, we answer questions of David and Semmes and of Peres and Solomyak.\nWe also make progress on Vitushkin's conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
