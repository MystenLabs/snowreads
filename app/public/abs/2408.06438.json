The cutoff of the theory is\nprovided by the lattice spacing chosen for our numerical simulations. As a\nconsequence, observables become dependent on that scale. We consider a possible\nfirst-order phase transition and an evolution close to a critical point. We\ndemonstrate that using a lattice counterterm restores the expected behavior of\nthe mean, variance and kurtosis: the mean and the variance become lattice\nspacing independent, and we recover the correct expectation value of the mean,\nthe growth of the variance with the correlation length and the expected minimum\nin the kurtosis. Our findings hold true in equilibrium and during the dynamical\nrelaxation, and therefore mark an important step towards a fully fluctuating\nfluid dynamical setup.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ONqQpe5ZowPsm-9IHyRc_pSHHemWU_0ZT9CKl63LBt8","pdfSize":"443340"}
