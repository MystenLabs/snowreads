From\nan unbiased leading-order (one-loop) renormalization group analysis, controlled\nby a suitable $\\epsilon$ expansion, we show that this system develops strong\npropensity toward the nucleation of scalar $s$-wave and odd-parity pseudoscalar\n$p$-wave pairings, favored by repulsive $U_1$ and $U_2$ interactions,\nrespectively, irrespective of the underlying FS topology. Our results can be\npertinent for the observed superconductivity in various doped narrow gap\nsemiconductors, and the theoretical foundation can readily be applied to\ninvestigate similar phenomenon in various doped topological materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
