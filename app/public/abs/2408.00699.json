However, its performance\ntends to degrade when samples are affected by noise. The granular-ball fuzzy\nsupport vector machine (GBFSVM) classifier partly alleviates the adverse\neffects of noise, but it relies solely on the distance between the\ngranular-ball's center and the class center to design the granular-ball\nmembership function. In this paper, we first introduce the granular-ball twin\nsupport vector machine (GBTWSVM) classifier, which integrates granular-ball\ncomputing (GBC) with the twin support vector machine (TWSVM) classifier. By\nreplacing traditional point inputs with granular-balls, we demonstrate how to\nderive a pair of non-parallel hyperplanes for the GBTWSVM classifier by solving\na quadratic programming problem. Subsequently, we design the membership and\nnon-membership functions of granular-balls using Pythagorean fuzzy sets to\ndifferentiate the contributions of granular-balls in various regions.\nAdditionally, we develop the granular-ball fuzzy twin support vector machine\n(GBFTSVM) classifier by incorporating GBC with the fuzzy twin support vector\nmachine (FTSVM) classifier. We demonstrate how to derive a pair of non-parallel\nhyperplanes for the GBFTSVM classifier by solving a quadratic programming\nproblem. We also design algorithms for the GBTSVM classifier and the GBFTSVM\nclassifier. Finally, the superior classification performance of the GBTWSVM\nclassifier and the GBFTSVM classifier on 20 benchmark datasets underscores\ntheir scalability, efficiency, and robustness in tackling classification tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
