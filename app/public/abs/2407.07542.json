We\nestablish sufficient conditions under which these mappings achieve fixed points\nin a complete metric space. Notably, the classical Banach contraction principle\nemerges as a special case of our results. To illustrate our theoretical\nfindings, we present several non-trivial examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
