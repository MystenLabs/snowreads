More precisely, we use high order in time AMFR-W methods, which\nbelong to a class of W-methods based on Approximate Matrix Factorization (AMF)\nand are especially suitable in the presence of mixed spatial derivatives.\nHigh-order convergence in time allows larger time steps which combined with the\nsplitting of the involved operators, highly reduces the computational time for\na given accuracy. Moreover, the consideration of a large number of underlying\nforward rates makes the PDE problem high dimensional in space, so the use of\nAMFR-W methods with a sparse grids combination technique represents another\ninnovative aspect, making AMFR-W more efficient than with full grids and\nopening the possibility of parallelization. Also the consideration of new\nhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions provides another original feature to\navoid the difficulties associated to the presence of boundary layers when using\nDirichlet ones, especially in advection-dominated regimes. These Neumann\nboundary conditions motivate the introduction of a modified combination\ntechnique to overcome a decrease in the accuracy of the standard combination\ntechnique.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
