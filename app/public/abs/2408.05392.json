For sparsity level greater than $2$, we show\nthat a finite list of disjunctions with this property cannot exist. This leads\nto the definition of covering number for a list of splits disjunctions. Given a\nfinite list of split sets $\\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-sparsity, and a given $k$-sparse\nsplit set $S$, let $\\mathcal{F}(S)$ be the minimum number of split sets from\nthe list $\\mathcal{F}$, whose union contains $S \\cap [0, \\ 1]^n$. Let the\ncovering number of $\\mathcal{F}$ be the maximum value of $\\mathcal{F}(S)$ over\nall $k$-sparse split sets $S$. We show that the covering number for any finite\nlist of $k$-sparse split sets is at least $\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor $ for $k \\geq 4$.\nWe also show that the covering number of the family of $k$-sparse split sets\nwith coefficients in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ is upper bounded by $k-1$ for $k \\leq 4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vzh2CHo7a5yqXYV2T0qiOPPT0T_T90rsMd_61nX2_eE","pdfSize":"171048"}
