This\npopulation likely existed at high redshifts (z$\\sim$10), relics of which we\nposit exist today as dwarf galaxies. Previous work argues that the initial mass\nfunction (IMF) of the EEP must be flatter than those found at lower redshifts,\nbut with considerable uncertainties. In this work, we present a more\nquantitative model for the EEP and demonstrate how observational constraints\ncan be applied to the IMF using supernova Type Ia (SNIa) rates, delay time\ndistribution (DTD), and the luminosity function (LF) of galaxy clusters. We\ndetermine best-fit values for the slope and mass break of the IMF by comparing\nIMFs from literature with observed DTDs and the low-luminosity component\n($M(R)< -12$) of the Coma LF. We derive two best-fit IMFs: (1) $\\alpha_{lo} =\n-0.13 \\pm 0.24$ for $0.07 < M/M_\\odot < 1.75$ and $\\alpha_{hi} = 0.53 \\pm 0.01$\nfor $1.75 < M/M_\\odot < 150$, and (2) $\\alpha_{lo} = 1.06 \\pm 0.11$ for $0.07 <\nM/M_\\odot < 6$ and $\\alpha_{hi} = 0.53 \\pm 0.01$ for $6 < M/M_\\odot < 150$. We\nalso compare these with sl-5 from Loewenstein (2013) with $\\alpha=0.5$ for\n$0.07 < M/M_\\odot < 8$ and $\\alpha=0.3$ for $8 < M/M_\\odot < 150$. This EEP\nmodel, along with stars formed at later times, can produce the observed\nmetallicity, is consistent with other observations, and predicts a significant\nrise in the SNIa rate at increasing redshift.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
