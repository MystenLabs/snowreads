Although there are several public datasets, especially for\nmetropolitan areas, these datasets may not be applicable to practical scenarios\ndue to insufficiency in the scale of data (i.e. number of sensors and road\nlinks) and several external factors like different characteristics of the\ntarget area such as urban, highways and the data collection location. To\naddress this, this paper introduces a novel IBB Traffic graph dataset as an\nalternative benchmark dataset to mitigate these limitations and enrich the\nliterature with new geographical characteristics. IBB Traffic graph dataset\ncovers the sensor data collected at 2451 distinct locations. Moreover, we\npropose a novel Road Traffic Prediction Model that strengthens temporal links\nthrough feature engineering, node embedding with GLEE to represent\ninter-related relationships within the traffic network, and traffic prediction\nwith ExtraTrees. The results indicate that the proposed model consistently\noutperforms the baseline models, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement\nof 4%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
