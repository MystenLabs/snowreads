The\nobtained results show remarkable broadband microwave absorption, which make\nthese materials suitable for stealth technology. The experimentally measured\nabsorptions reach -40 dB, while model-based predictions suggest that these\nsystems could overpass the barrier of -50 dB. The experimental results are\nsupported by models, both for single and bilayer systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"l5UDUwubEkPe8cVuzGk2Mu34tOt9NVGU0s2aMNH3FU8","pdfSize":"774008"}
