This\nanswers a question posed by Nadler in 1972, which has become known as the\nNadler-Quinn problem in continuum theory. Towards this end, we develop the\ntheories of truncations and contour factorizations of interval maps. As a\ncorollary, we answer a question of Mayer from 1982 about inequivalent plane\nembeddings of indecomposable arc-like continua.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
