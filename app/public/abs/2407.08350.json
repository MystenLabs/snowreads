In particular, we consider a complete\ndissolution model accounting for both surface kinetics and convective\ndiffusion, for three drugs with different solubility and wettability:\ntheophylline, griseofulvin, and nimesulide. The possible subsequent\nrecrystallization process in the bulk fluid is also considered. The governing\ndifferential equations are revisited in the context of the level-set method and\nHamilton-Jacobi equations, then they are solved numerically. This choice allows\nus to deal with the simultaneous dissolution of hundreds of different\npolydisperse particles. We show the results of many computer simulations which\ninvestigate the impact of the particle size, shape, area/volume ratio, and the\ndependence of the interfacial mass transport coefficient on the surface\ncurvature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
