Cells can\ncontrol the emergence of these condensates by affecting compartment size, the\namount of the involved molecules, and their physical interactions. While\nphysical interactions directly affect compartment binding and phase separation,\nthey can also cause oligomerization, which has been suggested as a control\nmechanism. Analyzing an equilibrium model, we illustrate that oligomerization\namplifies compartment binding and phase separation, which reinforce each other.\nThis nonlinear interplay can also induce multistability, which provides\nadditional potential for control. Our work forms the basis for deriving\nthermodynamically consistent kinetic models to understand how biological cells\ncan regulate phase separation in their compartments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
