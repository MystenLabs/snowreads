Previous X-ray observations\nof PG 1448 with XMM-Newton in 2017 and NuSTAR in 2022 revealed the presence of\nan ultra fast outflow, as seen through its blueshifted iron K absorption\nprofile, where the outflow velocity appeared to vary in the range $0.1-0.3c$.\nIn this work, new X-ray observations of PG 1448 are presented, in the form of\nfour simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations performed in July and\nAugust 2023. The X-ray spectra appeared at a similar flux in each observation,\nmaking it possible to analyze the mean 2023 X-ray spectrum at high signal to\nnoise. A broad ($\\sigma=1$ keV) and highly blue-shifted ($E=9.8\\pm0.4$ keV)\niron K absorption profile is revealed in the mean spectrum. The profile can be\nmodeled by a fast, geometrically thick accretion disk wind, which reveals a\nmaximum terminal velocity of $v_{\\infty}=-0.43\\pm0.03c$, one of the fastest\nknown winds in a nearby AGN. As a result, the inferred mass outflow rate of the\nwind may reach a significant fraction of the Eddington accretion rate.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
