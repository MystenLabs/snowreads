We find that such mixtures support a rich variety of multipole\nquantum droplets, where the macroscopic wavefunction of one component changes\nits sign and features distinctive multipole structure, while the wavefunction\nof another component does not have zeros. Such multipole droplets have no\ncounterparts in the reduced single-component model frequently used to describe\nsymmetric one-dimensional mixtures. We study transformations of multipole\nstates upon variation of the chemical potential of each component and\ndemonstrate that quantum droplets can split into separated fundamental states,\ntransform into flat-top multipoles, or into multipole component coupled to\nflat-top state with several humps on it, akin to anti-dark solitons. Multipole\nquantum droplets described here are stable in large part of their existence\ndomain. Our findings essentially broaden the family of quantum droplet states\nemerging in the beyond-meanfield regime and open the way for observation of\nsuch heterostructured states in Bose-Bose mixtures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
