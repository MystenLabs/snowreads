Our\nidentified price patterns lead to the construction of image-induced importance\n(triple-I) weights, which are applied to weighted moving average the existing\nprice trend trading signals according to their level of importance in\npredicting price movements. From an extensive empirical analysis on the Chinese\nstock market, we show that the triple-I weighting scheme can significantly\nenhance the price trend trading signals for proposing portfolios, with a\nthoughtful robustness study in terms of network specifications, image\nstructures, and stock sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the triple-I\nweighting scheme is able to propose long-term portfolios from a time-scale\ntransfer learning, enhance the news-based trading strategies through a\nnon-technical transfer learning, and increase the overall strength of numerous\ntrading rules for portfolio selection.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
