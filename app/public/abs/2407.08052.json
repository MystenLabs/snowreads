In addition, there are few studies that can\nhandle deformable tools. In this study, we develop a method for estimating the\nposition of a tool-tip, controlling the tool-tip, and handling online\nadaptation to changes in the relationship between the body and the tool, using\na neural network including parametric bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method for online change in grasping state and for deformable tools, in\nexperiments using two different types of robots: axis-driven robot PR2 and\ntendon-driven robot MusashiLarm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
