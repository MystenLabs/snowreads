The most radical conceptual leap required is that there are\nmany coexisting classical worlds, but even this is justified by the necessity\nof objective probabilities. These baby steps lead to a version of the\nmany-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics with built-in probabilities,\nbuilt-in classicality at the macroscopic level, and an explanation of the\ncomplex numbers in quantum mechanics. Despite its simplicity and minimalism of\nradical concepts, this is not a toy model, being equivalent with quantum field\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
