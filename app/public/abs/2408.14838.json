The approach unites the ideal large-eddy simulation model and\ndata assimilation methods. The method requires a posteriori measured data to\ndefine stochastic flow perturbations, which are combined with a Bayesian\nstatistical correction enforcing user-specified statistics extracted from\nhigh-fidelity flow snapshots. Thus, it enables computationally cheap ensemble\nsimulations by combining knowledge of the local integration error and knowledge\nof desired flow statistics. A model example is given for two-dimensional\nRayleigh-B\\'enard convection at Rayleigh number $\\mathit{Ra}=10^{10}$,\nincorporating stochastic perturbations and an ensemble Kalman filtering step in\na non-intrusive way. Physical flow dynamics are obtained, whilst kinetic energy\nspectra and heat flux are accurately reproduced in long-time ensemble forecasts\non coarse grids. The model is shown to produce accurate results with as few as\n20 high-fidelity flow snapshots as input data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
