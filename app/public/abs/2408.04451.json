The former has been studied many times\nbecause it can be summarized as the correspondence between conformal field\ntheory and topological quantum field theory, but the latter has captured\nattention more recently because it suggests that one can deform the theories\nfrom one to another condensable or Witt equivalent. We reinterpret this\nphenomenon as the appearance of integrable flow at the edges of a topologically\nordered system. By revisiting the existing phenomena from this view, one can\nrelate the anyon condensation to the existing formalism of integrable models\nand their renormalization group flow. Moreover, we observe the robustness of\nthe bulk-edge correspondence even under the existence of irrelevant\nperturbations at the edges. This formulation can enable one to analyze edge\nmodes at the level of quantum fluid (non-linear) dynamics, or mixed state\ntopological order even in non-Hermitian systems. Moreover, especially in the\nstudy of a class of non-Hermitian systems, we show a fundamental necessity to\nrevisit Rogers-Ramanujan type identities as an appearance of the hidden\n(fractional) supersymmetric model which has a close relation to string field\ntheories. Our view can give a unified paradigm to study edge modes of\ntopologically ordered systems at the level of their dynamics potentially in\nboth Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
