In magic-angle\ntwisted bilayer graphene, van Hove singularities appear at low energies and are\nmalleable with density, leading to a sequence of Lifshitz transitions and\nresets observable in Hall measurements. However, without a magnetic field,\nlinear transport measurements have limited sensitivity to the band's topology.\nHere, we utilize nonlinear longitudinal and transverse transport measurements\nto probe these unique features in twisted bilayer graphene at zero magnetic\nfield. We demonstrate that the nonlinear responses, induced by the Berry\ncurvature dipole and extrinsic scattering processes, intricately map the Fermi\nsurface reconstructions at various fillings. Importantly, our experiments\nhighlight the intrinsic connection of these features with the moir\\'e bands.\nBeyond corroborating the insights from linear Hall measurements, our findings\nestablish nonlinear transport as a pivotal tool for probing band topology and\ncorrelated phenomena.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MzIlG9BRCM_L6Nwn0vJ12T53fOV8l-aNmwdosILzcig","pdfSize":"34262148"}
