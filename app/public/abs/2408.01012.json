The relevance of these\ntopics lies in the ability to identify regeneration points and the necessary\nconditions to ensure the stationarity of the process. The study begins with a\nreview of Markov chains and continues with the analysis of processes that\nsatisfy the strong Markov property. Subsequently, it delves into renewal\nprocesses, regenerative processes, and finally, stationary regenerative\nprocesses, highlighting the results presented by Thorisson [22]. This work is\nnot intended to be exhaustive but aims to provide a solid foundation for\nfurther deepening the knowledge of these processes, given their broad range of\napplications in cryptography [16], queueing theory [15], and Monte Carlo\nmethods [23]. Additionally, the importance of Poisson-type processes is\nemphasized due to their numerous applications (see [8]).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sodt-tQmPJyMTh7GC5hXSqpa0awSW9BQrRt_2Fx9p_E","pdfSize":"322925","txDigest":"6c6ozuguPyKzwZ4Nqt8H1aNuMPENp89deVaavH3msL4P","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
