It is known that the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain at the\nsupersymmetric point $\\Delta=-1/2$ possesses such a symmetry: it is given by\nthe supersymmetry generators, which change the length of the chain by one unit.\nWe show that volume changing symmetries exist also in other spin chain models,\nand that they can be constructed using a special tensor network, which is a\nsimple generalization of a Matrix Product Operator. As examples we consider the\nfolded XXZ model and its perturbations, and also a new hopping model that is\ndefined on constrained Hilbert spaces. We show that the volume changing\nsymmetries are not related to integrability: the symmetries can survive even\nnon-integrable perturbations. We also show that the known supersymmetry\ngenerator of the XXZ chain with $\\Delta=-1/2$ can also be expressed as a\ngeneralized Matrix Product Operator.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
