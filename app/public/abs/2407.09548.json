However, manual\ndataset construction for the task is costly, so human-AI collaboration is\npromissing. Toward the direction, in this paper, we investigate the ability of\nLarge-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to explain temporal changes between\nsatellite images. While LVLMs are known to generate good image captions, they\nreceive only a single image as input. To deal with a par of satellite images as\ninput, we propose three prompting methods. Through human evaluation, we found\nthe effectiveness of our step-by-step reasoning based prompting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
