The DR\ntechnique helps to identify target transitions in a forest of lines and the\nimplementation of a DM procedure (modulation of the pump and probe source)\nallows for confusion- and baseline-free spectra containing only the line(s) of\ninterest. In particular the unambiguous assignment of weak and blended\ntransitions in very dense MMW spectra is highlighted. Details of the observed\nAutler-Townes line splitting and possible future applications, such as\nautomated analyses and adaptions of DM-DR methods to other experimental setups,\nare discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
