We\nconstruct a surjective map from $\\tilde{A}$ to the set $\\mathscr{F}$ of\nequivalence classes of rational face cuboids, and prove that this map is a\n$32:1$-map. In this way, we show that the set $\\mathscr{F}$ has infinite\nelements. Also, we prove that there are infinitely many $s \\in \\mathbb{Q}\n\\setminus \\{ 0,\\pm 1 \\}$ with $\\mathrm{rank} E_{1,s} (\\mathbb{Q})>0$. In this\nproof, we construct pairs of $s$ and $(\\alpha, \\beta) \\in E_{1,s} (\\mathbb{Q})$\nwhich are not parametric solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
