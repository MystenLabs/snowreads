In cardiovascular diseases, heart\nfailure is one of the main causes of death and also long-term suffering in\npatients worldwide. Prediction is one of the risk factors that is highly\nvaluable for treatment and intervention to minimize heart failure. In this\nwork, an attention learning-based heart failure prediction approach is proposed\non EHR(electronic health record) cardiovascular data such as ejection fraction\nand serum creatinine. Moreover, different optimizers with various learning rate\napproaches are applied to fine-tune the proposed approach. Serum creatinine and\nejection fraction are the two most important features to predict the patient's\nheart failure. The computational result shows that the RMSProp optimizer with\n0.001 learning rate has a better prediction based on serum creatinine. On the\nother hand, the combination of SGD optimizer with 0.01 learning rate exhibits\noptimum performance based on ejection fraction features. Overall, the proposed\nattention learning-based approach performs very efficiently in predicting heart\nfailure compared to the existing state-of-the-art such as LSTM approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
