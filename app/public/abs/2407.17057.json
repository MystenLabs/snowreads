Performing clutter suppression before sensing parameter\nestimation is generally desirable as the number of sensing parameters can be\nsigniffcantly reduced. However, existing methods require high-complexity\nclutter mitigation and sensing parameter estimation, where clutter is ffrstly\nidentiffed and then removed. In this correspondence, we propose a much simpler\nbut more effective method by incorporating a clutter cancellation mechanism in\nformulating a sparse signal model for sensing parameter estimation.\n  In particular, clutter mitigation is performed directly on the received\nsignals and the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) is leveraged to\nexploit the common support for sensing parameter estimation in the formulated\nsparse signal recovery problem. Simulation results show that, compared to\nstate-of-theart methods, the proposed method delivers signiffcantly better\nperformance while with substantially reduced complexity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
