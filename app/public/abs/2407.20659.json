Highlights of our results include the\nfollowing:\n  * For $n$ axis-aligned boxes in any constant dimension $d$, we give an\n$O(\\log \\log n)$-approximation algorithm for MPS that runs in $O(n^{1+\\delta})$\ntime for an arbitrarily small constant $\\delta>0$. This significantly improves\nthe previous $O(\\log\\log n)$-approximation algorithm by Agarwal, Har-Peled,\nRaychaudhury, and Sintos (SODA~2024), which ran in $O(n^{d/2}\\mathop{\\rm\npolylog} n)$ time.\n  * Furthermore, we show that our algorithm can be made fully dynamic with\n$O(n^{\\delta})$ amortized update time. Previously, Agarwal et al.~(SODA~2024)\nobtained dynamic results only in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and achieved only\n$O(\\sqrt{n}\\mathop{\\rm polylog} n)$ amortized expected update time.\n  * For $n$ axis-aligned rectangles in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we give an\n$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for MIS that runs in $O(n^{1+\\delta})$ time. Our\nresult significantly improves the running time of the celebrated algorithm by\nMitchell (FOCS~2021) (which was about $O(n^{21})$), and answers one of his open\nquestions. Our algorithm can also be made fully dynamic with $O(n^{\\delta})$\namortized update time.\n  * For $n$ (unweighted or weighted) fat objects in any constant dimension, we\ngive a dynamic $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for MIS with $O(n^{\\delta})$\namortized update time.\n  * For disks in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ or hypercubes in any constant dimension, we\ngive the first fully dynamic $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for MVC\nand MCM with $O(\\mathop{\\rm polylog}n)$ amortized update time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rIZcMarNHUdHL1Jo6BitNyYPCKChjSvuNATg2stVyKM","pdfSize":"752923"}
