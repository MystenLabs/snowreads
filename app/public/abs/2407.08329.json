We find general formulas for the Fano factors of\nthese setups, assuming that temperature exceeds level spacing in the system. We\ndemonstrate that both in helical and in conventional case the interference\neffects dramatically change the Fano factor and its magnetic field dependence.\nFor weak tunneling coupling with leads, the Fano factors of both setups exhibit\na periodic series of sharp Aharonov-Bohm peaks with variation of magnetic flux\npiercing the system. Our key finding is that the Fano factor in the helical\ninterferometer provides information about the presence of backscattering\ndefects violating topological protection. In particular, the amplitude of\nAharonov-Bohm peaks in the helical setup is proportional to the strength of the\ndefect in contrast to conventional setup, where peaks have finite amplitude\neven in the ballistic case.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
