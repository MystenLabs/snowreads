The resulting energy modulation of these single photon sources\ncan be harnessed to achieve spectral overlap between two QDs otherwise emitting\nat different wavelengths. In this study, we integrate InAsP/InP nanowire\nquantum dots onto a thin-film lithium niobate platform, a strong piezoelectric\nmaterial, and embed them within Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$-loaded waveguides. We\ndemonstrate emission wavelength modulation of 0.70 nm at 13 dBm with a single\nfocused interdigital transducer (FIDT) operating at 400 MHz, and achieve twice\nthis modulation by using two FIDTs as an acoustic cavity. Additionally, we\nbring two QDs with an initial wavelength difference of 0.5 nm into resonance\nusing SAWs. This scalable strain-tuning approach represents a significant step\ntowards producing indistinguishable single photons from remote emitters\nheterogeneously integrated on a single photonic chip, and paves the way for\nlarge scale on-chip quantum information processing using photonic platforms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
