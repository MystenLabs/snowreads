All the $12$ subwavelength resonant frequencies are derived\nexplicitly for general convex resonators. In addition, the resonant modes are\ncategorized into dipolar, quadrupolar, and hybrid groups, facilitating the\neffective realization of negative mass density, negative shear modulus and\ndouble-negative properties (both mass density and shear modulus) in elastic\nmetamaterials. Moreover, we analyze the stress distribution between two hard\ninclusions when they are closely touching. We also precisely derive the sharp\nblow-up rates of the gradient estimates of the resonant modes. Our findings\nshow that certain resonant modes have bounded stress estimates when the\ncurvature of the hard inclusions is appropriately designed. These results\nprovide valuable insights into the stability of the design and fabrication of\nelastic metamaterials. Lastly, we express the scattering wave fields explicitly\nin terms of resonant modes, offering a clear understanding of their impact on\nthe overall scattering behavior.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
