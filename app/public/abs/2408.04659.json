Our goal is to study\nthe convergence of solutions in the inviscid (more generally, vanishing\nregularization) limit and explain the universality of both the limiting\nsolutions and the convergence process. We develop a renormalization group (RG)\nformalism representing this limit as dynamics in a space of flow maps. For the\ndyadic shell model, the RG dynamics has a fixed-point attractor, which\ndetermines universal limiting solutions. Deviations from the limiting solutions\nare also universal and given by a leading eigenmode (eigenvalue and\neigenvector) of the linearized RG operator. Application to the Gledzer and\nSabra shell models reveal the respective quasiperiodic and chaotic RG dynamics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
