The NA61\\SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS has a great potential to study\ntransverse polarization in p-p and p-A collisions. In this work, we discuss the\nimpact of magnetic field and limited detector acceptance on the possible\npolarization measurement by this experiment. Our analysis shows that the\nmagnetic field impact on the $\\Lambda$ polarization due to precession is one\norder of magnitude smaller than the detector acceptance-based polarization\nbias, and the identification of an experimental signal similar to that observed\nbefore by other experiments is possible.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
