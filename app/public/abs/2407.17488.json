Many of these\nprocesses have limited support from technology in the same way that physical\ntasks have been enabled through a host of tools from hammers to shovels and\nhydraulic lifts. To develop a suite of cognitive tools, we first need to\nunderstand which processes humans use to complete work tasks. In the past\ncentury several classifications (e.g., Blooms) of cognitive processes have\nemerged, and we assessed their viability as the basis for designing tools that\nsupport cognitive work. This study re-used an existing data set composed of\ninterviews of environmental scientists about their core work. While the\nclassification uncovered many instances of cognitive process, the results\nshowed that the existing cognitive process classifications do not provide a\nsufficiently comprehensive deconstruction of the human cognitive processes; the\nwork is quite simply too abstract to be operational.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"pZxXIaPACBNw_GlVC5l7e0cvpVCuoHgWgUSAvMp8CXs","pdfSize":"281701","objectId":"0xbc480bca83f4069217997cb0831f5e334b830f0f5fc538532ea01b627d3ac3dd","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
