We prove that every numerical semigroup is the exponent\nsemigroup of some rational matrix. We also obtain lower bounds on the size of\nsuch matrices and discuss the related class of power-integral matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
