How\nto cancel the interference between different users and enhance the\neffectiveness of multi-user transmissions is imperative for the practical\napplication of MI communication. In this paper, we use multi-frequency resonant\ncircuit to establish multiple resonant frequencies for MI communication. The\ntransmissions corresponding to different users operate at different resonant\nfrequencies and multi-user interferences can be naturally mitigated. Numerical\nresults verify our theoretical analyses and show that the proposed system can\nsignificantly enhance the performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
