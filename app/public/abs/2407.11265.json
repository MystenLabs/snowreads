This\nstructure enables multi-user scaling and requires fewer elements (i.e., a\ncompact structure) compared to standard RIS (S-RIS), which assumes no\ninterconnection between the elements. The I-RIS compact design makes it\npractical for deployment on space-limited nodes, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs). Hence, in this work, we propose a beamforming design based on I-RIS in\na multi-user network, where we use binary RF switches as RIS elements. We show\nthat our switch-based I-RIS offers a higher gain compared to an S-RIS using\nphase shifters. Finally, we introduce two optimization methods, sigmoid filled\nfunction (SFF) and semi-definite binary optimization (SBO), to optimize the RIS\nelements and evaluate their performance in terms of sum-rate and complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
