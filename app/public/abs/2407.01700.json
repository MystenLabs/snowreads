In low-demand areas, conventional PT\nis inefficient. Therein, Mobility on Demand (MoD) could serve users more\nefficiently and with an improved quality of service (QoS). The idea of\nintegrating MoD into PT is therefore abundantly discussed by researchers and\npractitioners, mainly in the form of adding MoD on top of PT. Efficiency can be\ninstead gained if also conventional PT lines are redesigned after integrating\nMoD in the first or last mile. In this paper we focus on this re-design\nproblem. We devise a bilevel optimization problem where, given a certain\ninitial design, the upper level determines stop selection and frequency\nsettings, while the lower level routes a fleet of MoD vehicles. We propose a\nsolution method based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for the upper level,\nwhile we adopt Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) in the lower level. Our solution\nmethod is computationally efficient and we test it in simulations with up to\n10k travel requests. Results show important operational cost savings obtained\nvia appropriately reducing the conventional PT coverage after integrating MoD,\nwhile preserving QoS.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
