The geometric measure of entanglement\nof the states is calculated for the quantum graph states corresponding to\narbitrary graphs. We find relationships between the entanglement and the\nproperties of the corresponding graphs. Namely, we obtain that the geometric\nmeasure of entanglement of a qubit with other qubits in the graph state is\nrelated to the weights of ingoing and outgoing arcs with respect to the vertex\nrepresenting the qubit, outdegree and indegree of the corresponding vertex in\nthe graph. For unweighted and undirected graphs, the entanglement depends on\nthe degree of the corresponding vertex. Quantum protocol for quantifying of the\nentanglement of the quantum graph states is constructed. As an example, a\nquantum graph state corresponding to a chain is examined, and the entanglement\nof the state is calculated on AerSimulator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
