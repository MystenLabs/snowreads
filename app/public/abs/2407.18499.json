Aiming at the problems of layout overlap, inferior\nperformance, and low optimization efficiency in existing chip design methods,\nthis paper proposes an end-to-end placement method, SRLPlacer, based on\nreinforcement learning. First, the placement problem is transformed into a\nMarkov decision process by establishing the coupling relationship graph model\nbetween macro cells to learn the strategy for optimizing layouts. Secondly, the\nwhole placement process is optimized after integrating the standard cell\nlayout. By assessing on the public benchmark ISPD2005, the proposed SRLPlacer\ncan effectively solve the overlap problem between macro cells while considering\nrouting congestion and shortening the total wire length to ensure routability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
