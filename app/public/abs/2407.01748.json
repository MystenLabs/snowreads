A comprehensive series of systematic experiments were conducted\nfor Reynolds numbers ($Re = U_{\\infty} d/\\nu$, where $U_{\\infty}$ is the fluid\nvelocity, $d$ is the sphere diameter, and $\\nu$ is the fluid kinematic\nviscosity) ranging from $6\\times10^4$ to $1.3\\times10^5$, and dimple depth\nratios ($k/d$, where $k$ is the dimple depth) from $0$ to $1\\times10^{-2}$\nusing a smart morphable sphere with one smooth and one dimpled side. The\nfindings show that an asymmetrically rough sphere can generate lift forces up\nto 80\\% of the drag, comparable to those produced by the Magnus Effect. The\ndimple depth ratio affects both the $Re$ at which lift generation begins and\nthe maximum lift coefficient ($C_L$) achievable. The optimal $k/d$ for maximum\nlift varies with $Re$: deeper dimples are needed at low $Re$, while shallower\ndimples are more effective at high $Re$. For a fixed $Re$, increasing $k/d$\nmonotonically increases lift until a critical $k/d$ is reached, beyond which\nlift decreases. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) revealed that dimples delay\nflow separation on the rough side while the smooth side remains unchanged,\nresulting in asymmetric boundary layer separation, leading to wake deflection\nand lift generation. Beyond the critical $k/d$, the flow separation location\nmoved upstream, increasing the size of the rear wake, reducing wake deflection,\nand thus decreasing lift. Overall, this study establishes the foundation for\nwake control over bluff bodies and paves the way for real-time manoeuvring\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
