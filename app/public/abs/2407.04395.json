In particular, we give the necessary\nconditions on a contact surgery diagram to become a potential candidate for\ncontact Kirby move of type 1. We prove that no other contact integral surgery\ndiagram satisfies those conditions except for contact $(+2)$-surgery on\nLegendrian unknot with Thruston--Bennequin number $-1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Oli5Xl27qSHv_FBHAY-NsFZPtq2b4S01wLamGObu1ow","pdfSize":"390494"}
