However many diffusion model\nbased any-to-any SVC methods, which have achieved impressive results, usually\nsuffered from low efficiency caused by a mass of inference steps. In this\npaper, we propose LCM-SVC, a latent consistency distillation (LCD) based latent\ndiffusion model (LDM) to accelerate inference speed. We achieved one-step or\nfew-step inference while maintaining the high performance by distilling a\npre-trained LDM based SVC model, which had the advantages of timbre decoupling\nand sound quality. Experimental results show that our proposed method can\nsignificantly reduce the inference time and largely preserve the sound quality\nand timbre similarity comparing with other state-of-the-art SVC models.
