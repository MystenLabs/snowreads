Our numerical experiment on a two-vertiport\nnetwork shows that spill in relatively inelastic to fleet size and that the\ndriving factor behind spill is the imbalance in demand.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ygPAwhPlU9EQCtA9oSeXi5TgLBAausm-2aw1KDZreh0","pdfSize":"1279789"}
