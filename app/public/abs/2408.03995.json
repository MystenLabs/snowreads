Here, we present a public numerical software for the\nmodeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray\nspectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological\nredshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original\n$\\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high\nredshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more\nextragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the\nuncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code\nto existing electromagnetic transport models.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
