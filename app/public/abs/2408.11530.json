To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce a constrained optimisation refactoring approach. Our\nfirst key idea is to encode the problem with decision variables based on\nliterals rather than rules. Our second key idea is to focus on linear invented\nrules. Our empirical results on multiple domains show that our approach can\nrefactor programs quicker and with more compression than the previous\nstate-of-the-art approach, sometimes by 60%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5B6JbgyRjKhk6Pla0r7yngJOvvgSn1iClOnAvC-UwKI","pdfSize":"222934"}
