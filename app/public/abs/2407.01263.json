We observe\nthat the resulting optimization problem is non-concave and non-submodular, and\nso generic methods for such cases do not have theoretical guarantees. We derive\nan analytical upper bound on the capacity loss when selecting a subset of input\nsymbols based only on the properties of the transition matrix of the channel.\nWe propose a selection algorithm that is based on input-symbols clustering, and\nan appropriate choice of representatives for each cluster, which uses the\ntheoretical bound as a surrogate objective function. We provide numerical\nexperiments to support the findings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
