This finding indicates the existence of\nsteady compressible Euler flows, either influenced by an external potential\nenergy or maintained by a density source in the continuity equation, that are\nfoliated by asymmetric nested toroidal surfaces. Our analysis suggests that the\nprimary obstacle in resolving Grad's conjecture regarding the existence of\nnontrivial magnetohydrodynamic equilibria arises from the incompressibility\nconstraint imposed on the magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
