In this\narticle, we introduce a class of equivariant representations of tensor-valued\nfunctions based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework that allows for\nefficient learning of such configuration-dependent friction and diffusion\ntensors from data. Besides satisfying the correct equivariance properties with\nrespect to the Euclidean group E(3), the resulting heat bath models satisfy a\nfluctuation-dissipation relation. Moreover, our models can be extended to\ninclude additional symmetries, such as momentum conservation, to preserve the\nhydrodynamic properties of the particle system. We demonstrate the capabilities\nof the model by constructing a model of configuration-dependent tensorial\nelectronic friction calculated from first principles that arises during\nreactive molecular dynamics at metal surfaces.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
