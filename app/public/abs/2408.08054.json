This additional cognitive burden\ncomplicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based\ndesign in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To\nfacilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose\nText2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building\nmodels from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple\nLLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into\nimperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating\neditable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic\ninformation directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker\nis introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge\nto guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and\niteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to\ncompare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed\nframework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively\ngenerate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned\nwith the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive\nsoftware prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM\nauthoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by\nchatting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"H1TsxgUY5xBsXcmhVpImNtJLJB5YH7Ms-daCS_Pi9qE","pdfSize":"9244034"}
