However, its practical use is currently\nlimited due to early-stage quantum software engineering and the constraints of\nNoisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. To address this issue, this\nchapter introduces the concept of serverless quantum computing with examples\nusing QFaaS, a practical Quantum Function-as-a-Service framework. This\nframework utilizes the serverless computing model to simplify quantum\napplication development and deployment by abstracting the complexities of\nquantum hardware and enhancing application portability across different quantum\nsoftware development kits and quantum backends. The chapter provides\ncomprehensive documentation and guidelines for deploying and using QFaaS,\ndetailing the setup, component deployment, and examples of service-oriented\nquantum applications. This framework offers a promising approach to overcoming\ncurrent limitations and advancing the practical software engineering of quantum\ncomputing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gRFoeengCdl0r1E9zT1KrRkM4GSB8bskItGKyRjsO7w","pdfSize":"10700259"}
