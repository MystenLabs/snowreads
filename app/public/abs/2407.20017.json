Various\ninterpretations, such as molecular states, compact tetraquark states, and\ncoupled-channel effects, have been proposed for these states. Of particular\ninterest is the ongoing search for the triple-$J/\\psi$ state--a fully-charmed\nhexaquark state. To deepen our understanding of the triple-$J/\\psi$ state and\nto guide future experimental searches, we study the triple-$J/\\psi$ system in\nthis work employing the Gaussian expansion method and the $J/\\psi J/\\psi$\npotential parameterized to yield a shallow bound state, as suggested in several\ntheoretical works. Our results support a triple-$J/\\psi$ bound state, even in\ncases where the attractive interaction between the two $J/\\psi$ mesons is very\nweak. Moreover, our analysis implies the Efimov effect in the triple-$J/\\psi$\nsystem. In addition, we extend our investigation to the triple-$\\Upsilon (1S)$\nsystem and obtain results similar to those for the triple-$J/\\psi$ system.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
