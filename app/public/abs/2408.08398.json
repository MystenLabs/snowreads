Our key observation is that the set of points where the\ndecrease condition of a control Lyapunov function (CLF) is feasible can be\nregarded as a safe set. By leveraging a nonsmooth version of control barrier\nfunctions (CBFs) and a weaker notion of CLF, we develop a control design that\nforces the system to converge to and remain in the region where the CLF\ndecrease condition is feasible. We characterize the conditions under which our\ncontroller asymptotically stabilizes the origin or a small neighborhood around\nit, even in the cases where it is discontinuous. We illustrate our design in\nvarious examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
