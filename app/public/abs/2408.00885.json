What is the role of first-nature geography in\ndetermining prosperity? This paper estimates the effect of randomly removing\nand introducing favorable first-nature geography to a specific region using a\ndifference in difference design. In 1825 a storm created a new natural\nnavigable waterway, bringing trade and prosperity to the otherwise relatively\nisolated northwestern Denmark. 700 years prior, the same event happened in\nreverse, when a previous channel closed up between 1086 and 1208. The\nelasticity of geography-induced market access is estimated to be 1.6,\ncorresponding to 26.7 percent population growth within a generation of the\nevent. Demonstrated mechanisms include trade, fertility, fishing, and the rise\nof manufacturing. The central finding is replicated in reverse in a register of\ndated archaeological sites. The 1086-1208 closing caused fewer buildings and\nsites containing coins. The general insight is the same: First-nature geography\ndetermines the levels and location of prosperity.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"NCjkOMGyW5mTLSVuOjOecREpH7yO32qO7Ziips5MMro","pdfSize":"4737136","txDigest":"DMSV6vu2zCdFZBtz1pGEWTioWdvT6cq9WBnc8VYc1wsX","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
