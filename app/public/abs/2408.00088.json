They exploit an\nadditional quantum system that is sequentially coupled to the system.\nEventually, by measuring the additional system, we can extract information\nabout temporal correlations developed by the quantum system dynamics with\nrespect to a given observable. This protocol leads to a quasi-probability\ndistribution for the measured observable outcomes, which can be negative. We\nprove that the presence of these negative regions is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the violation of macrorealism. This is a much stronger condition\nthan the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities commonly used for the same\ntask. Indeed, we show that there are situations in which Leggett-Garg\ninequalities are satisfied even if the macrorealism condition is violated. As a\nconsequence, the quantum non-demolition protocol is a privileged tool to\nidentify with certainty the quantum behavior of a system. As such, it has a\nvast number of applications to different fields from the certification of\nquantumness to the study of the quantum-to-classical transition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
