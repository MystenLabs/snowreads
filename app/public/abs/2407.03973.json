Recent\nadvancements have shown that qLDPC codes can outperform the quantum memory\ncapability of surface codes even with near-term hardware. The question of how\nto implement logical gates fault-tolerantly for these codes is still open. We\npresent new examples of high-rate bivariate bicycle (BB) codes with enhanced\nsymmetry properties. These codes feature explicit nice bases of logical\noperators (similar to toric codes) and support fold-transversal Clifford gates\nwithout overhead. As examples, we construct $[[98,6,12]]$ and $[[162, 8, 12]]$\nBB codes which admit interesting fault-tolerant Clifford gates. Our work also\nlays the mathematical foundations for explicit bases of logical operators and\nfold-transversal gates in quantum two-block and group algebra codes, which\nmight be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
