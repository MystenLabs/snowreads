We adopt an iterative smoothing technique to reconstruct the expansion\nhistory from SNIa data, which, when combined with BAO measurements, facilitates\na comprehensive test of the Universe's curvature and the nature of dark energy.\nThe analysis is conducted under three different mock true cosmologies: a flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM universe, a universe with a notable curvature ($\\Omega_{k,0} =\n0.1$), and one with dynamically evolving dark energy. Each cosmology\ndemonstrates different kinds and varying degrees of deviation from the standard\nmodel predictions. We forecast that our reconstruction technique can constrain\ncosmological parameters, such as the curvature ($\\Omega_{k,0}$) and $c/H_0\nr_\\mathrm{d}$, with a precision of approximately 0.5\\% for $c/H_0r_\\mathrm{d}$\nand 0.04 for $\\Omega_{k,0}$, competitive with current cosmic microwave\nbackground constraints, without assuming any form of dark energy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jmyt1gaCNGVIvfdDeLFDgLPIju89f87qlREkiJROHCo","pdfSize":"5038370"}
