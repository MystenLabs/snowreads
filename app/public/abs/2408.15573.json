It\nis known that low-speed collisions of dust aggregates result in either sticking\nor bouncing, and local and permanent compaction occurs near the contact area\nupon collision. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of collisions\nbetween two aggregates and investigate their compressive behavior. We find that\nthe maximum compression length is proportional to the radius of aggregates and\nincreases with the collision velocity. We also reveal that a theoretical model\nof contact between two elastoplastic spheres successfully reproduces the size-\nand velocity-dependence of the maximum compression length observed in our\nnumerical simulations. Our findings on the plastic deformation of aggregates\nduring collisional compression provide a clue to understanding the collisional\ngrowth process of aggregates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
