We propose to install two-layer scintillation\ndetectors made of plastic (such as EJ-200) or CeBr3 to search for mCPs.\nDedicated Geant4 detector simulations and in situ measurements have been\nconducted to obtain a preliminary determination of the background rate. The\ndominant backgrounds are beam-induced neutrons and coincident dark current\nsignals from the photomultiplier tubes, while beam-induced gammas and cosmic\nmuons are subdominant. We determined that LANSCE-mQ, the dedicated mCP\nexperiment, has the leading mCP sensitivity for mass between ~ 1 MeV to 300\nMeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
