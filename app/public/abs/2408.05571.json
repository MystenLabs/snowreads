We prove that\nthe $\\mathbb{G}$-inclusion $A\\subseteq B$ is strongly equivariantly amenable if\nand only if it is equivariantly amenable, using techniques from the theory of\nnon-commutative $L^p$-spaces. In particular, if $(A, \\alpha)$ is a\n$\\mathbb{G}$-dynamical von Neumann algebra with $A$ $\\sigma$-finite, the action\n$\\alpha: A \\curvearrowleft \\mathbb{G}$ is strongly (inner) amenable if and only\nif the action $\\alpha: A \\curvearrowleft \\mathbb{G}$ is (inner) amenable. By\nduality, we also obtain the same result for $\\mathbb{G}$ a discrete quantum\ngroup, so that, in particular, a discrete quantum group is inner amenable if\nand only it is strongly inner amenable. This result can be seen as a dynamical\ngeneralization of Tomatsu's result on the amenability/co-amenability duality.\nWe also provide the first explicit examples of amenable discrete quantum groups\nthat act non-amenably on a von Neumann algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ulOKnaL-4vI1Eyh84sWGF9yNMLJlzZ8RqwPLNu6tbJM","pdfSize":"347640"}
