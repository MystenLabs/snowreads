Additionally, we present an exact formula designed to\nincorporate nonadiabatic and correlation effects while ensuring the positivity\nof the linewidths. Finally, we extend the treatment to nonequilibrium scenarios\nand offer a rigorous justification for employing the phononic Boltzmann\nequation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
