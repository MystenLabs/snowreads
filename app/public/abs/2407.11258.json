We discuss and compare several choices for orbital localization,\nfragmentation, and LNO construction. By studying diamond and lithium, we\ndemonstrate that periodic LNO-CC theory can be applied with equal success to\nboth insulators and metals, achieving speedups of two to three orders of\nmagnitude even for moderately sized $k$-point meshes. Our final predictions of\nthe equilibrium cohesive energy, lattice constant, and bulk modulus for diamond\nand lithium are in good agreement with previous theoretical predictions and\nexperimental results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dSvJpRe2dw7p-Pmtg5DESRDa9FQcsoIsTda90crNWaM","pdfSize":"1592000"}
