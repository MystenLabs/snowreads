The kinematic and dynamic\nmoments of inertia of the rotational bands observed in the transfermium nuclei\n$^{252}$No, $^{254}$No, $^{254}$Rf, and $^{256}$Rf are well reproduced without\nany adjustable parameters using a well-determined universal density functional.\nIt is found for the first time that the emergence of the octupole deformation\nshould be responsible for the significantly different rotational behavior\nobserved in $^{252}$No and $^{254}$No. The present results provide a\nmicroscopic solution to the long-standing puzzle on the rotational behavior in\nNo isotopes, and highlight the risk of investigating only the hexacontetrapole\n($\\beta_{60}$) deformation effects in rotating transfermium nuclei without\nconsidering the octupole deformation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
