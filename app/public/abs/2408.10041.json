Nevertheless, the explicit\nnature of 3DGS data entails considerable storage requirements, highlighting a\npressing need for more efficient data representations. To address this, we\npresent Implicit Gaussian Splatting (IGS), an innovative hybrid model that\nintegrates explicit point clouds with implicit feature embeddings through a\nmulti-level tri-plane architecture. This architecture features 2D feature grids\nat various resolutions across different levels, facilitating continuous spatial\ndomain representation and enhancing spatial correlations among Gaussian\nprimitives. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a level-based\nprogressive training scheme, which incorporates explicit spatial\nregularization. This method capitalizes on spatial correlations to enhance both\nthe rendering quality and the compactness of the IGS representation.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel compression pipeline tailored for both point\nclouds and 2D feature grids, considering the entropy variations across\ndifferent levels. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our\nalgorithm can deliver high-quality rendering using only a few MBs, effectively\nbalancing storage efficiency and rendering fidelity, and yielding results that\nare competitive with the state-of-the-art.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
