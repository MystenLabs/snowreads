It is important to be able to acquire the\nknowledge needed for this understanding, though doing so is challenging. We\nargue that such knowledge can be elicited through a participant achievement\nlens. We analyze a complex event in a narrative according to the intended\nachievements of the participants in that narrative, the likely future actions\nof the participants, and the likelihood of goal success. We collect 6.3K high\nquality goal and action annotations reflecting our proposed participant\nachievement lens, with an average weighted Fleiss-Kappa IAA of 80%. Our\ncollection contains annotated alternate versions of each narrative. These\nalternate versions vary minimally from the \"original\" story, but can license\ndrastically different inferences. Our findings suggest that while modern large\nlanguage models can reflect some of the goal-based knowledge we study, they\nfind it challenging to fully capture the design and intent behind concerted\nactions, even when the model pretraining included the data from which we\nextracted the goal knowledge. We show that smaller models fine-tuned on our\ndataset can achieve performance surpassing larger models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2BLFhxmKoCo3d2LLgr4LcpSwBvCkZudVXZm9F--sA2E","pdfSize":"2456273"}
