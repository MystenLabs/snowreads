Building on the previous work of\n\\cite{guionnet:95,ben-arous-guionnet:95,guionnet:97} and\n\\cite{dembo_universality_2021} we establish for a large class of networks of\nHopfield-like neurons, i.e. rate neurons, the mean-field equations on a time\ninterval $[0,\\,T]$, $T>0$, of the thermodynamic limit of these networks, i.e.\nthe limit when the number of neurons goes to infinity. Unlike all previous\nwork, except \\cite{dembo_universality_2021}, we do not assume that the synaptic\nweights describing the connections between the neurons are i.i.d. as zero-mean\nGaussians. The limit equations are stochastic and very simply described in\nterms of two functions, a ``correlation'' function noted $K_Q(t,\\,s)$ and a\n``mean'' function noted $m_Q(t)$. The ``noise'' part of the equations is a\nlinear function of the Brownian motion, which is obtained by solving a Volterra\nequation of the second kind whose resolving kernel is expressed as a function\nof $K_Q$. We give a constructive proof of the uniqueness of the limit\nequations. We use the corresponding algorithm for an effective computation of\nthe functions $K_Q$ and $m_Q$, given the weights distribution. Several\nnumerical experiments are reported.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
