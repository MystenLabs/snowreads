These solutions\nare thus extremely time- and labor-expensive, but also may easily fail to\ngeneralize to unseen objects during training. To alleviate this issue, we\npresent MSFSeg, a novel few-shot 3D segmentation framework with a lightweight\nmulti-surrogate fusion (MSF). MSFSeg is able to automatically segment unseen 3D\nobjects/organs (during training) provided with one or a few annotated 2D slices\nor 3D sequence segments, via learning dense query-support organ/lesion anatomy\ncorrelations across patient populations. Our proposed MSF module mines\ncomprehensive and diversified morphology correlations between unlabeled and the\nfew labeled slices/sequences through multiple designated surrogates, making it\nable to generate accurate cross-domain 3D segmentation masks given annotated\nslices or sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework\nby showing superior performance on conventional few-shot segmentation\nbenchmarks compared to prior art, and remarkable cross-domain cross-volume\nsegmentation performance on proprietary 3D segmentation datasets for\nchallenging entities, i.e., tubular structures, with only limited 2D or 3D\nlabels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N7kTJrXRKhxO50ycopdi0p_tsrGEonH114rirAJyEjw","pdfSize":"1313081"}
