Freedman showed that every homology 3-sphere embeds as a locally flat\nsubmanifold of $S^4$. This is in striking contrast to the state of our\nknowledge of smooth embeddings of homology spheres. This book surveys what is\npresently known about the topic of its title, with emphasis on embeddings of\nSeifert fibred 3-manifolds and on distinguishing embeddings by properties of\nthe complementary regions. In the final chapters 4-dimension surgery is used to\nstudy embeddings in which the complementary regions have abelian or nilpotent\nfundamental groups, and the final appendix contains a number of open questions.\nWork on smooth embeddings is only described briefly, as current techniques in\nthis area are beyond the author's expertise.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
