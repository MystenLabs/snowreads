We bound\nthe order $n$ of a graph from below by its equator $q$, girth $g$ and minimum\ndegree $\\delta$ - and show that this bound is sharp when there exists a Moore\ngraph with girth $g$ and minimum degree $\\delta$. The extremal graphs that\nattain our bound give an analogue of Moore graphs. We prove that these extremal\n`Moore-like' graphs are regular, and that every one of their vertices is\ncontained in some maximum length isometric cycle. We show that these extremal\ngraphs have a highly structured partition that is unique, and easily derived\nfrom any of its maximum length isometric cycles. We characterize the extremal\ngraphs with girth 3 and 4, and those with girth 5 and minimum degree 3. We also\nbound the order of $C_4$-free graphs with given equator and minimum degree, and\nshow that this bound is nearly sharp. We conclude with some questions and\nconjectures further relating our extremal graphs to cages and Moore graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
