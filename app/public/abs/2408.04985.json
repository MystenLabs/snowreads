This effect is enhanced in nano-scale structures, where grain\nboundaries or dislocation cores induce the strain gradient. In this study, we\ntheoretically investigate the flexoelectric polarization induced by misfit\ndislocations in a thin film. A nano-scale dislocation structure is modeled in a\nperiodic SrTiO$_3$ supercell, and then the structure is optimized by using\nneural-network-potential and first-principles approaches. We point out that a\npyramidal TiO$_5$ coordination forms near the dislocation cores, which in turn\ndominantly causes the sizable flexoelectric polarization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
