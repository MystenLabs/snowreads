In this limit, the cross-section is dominated by aligned jet\nconfigurations, that is, quark-antiquark pairs in which one of the fermions --\nthe would-be struck quark in the Breit frame -- carries most of the\nlongitudinal momentum of the virtual photon. We show that physically meaningful\njet definitions in DIS are such that the effective axis of the jet sourced by\nthe struck quark is controlled by its virtuality rather than by its transverse\nmomentum. For such jet definitions, we show that the next-to-leading order\n(NLO) cross-section admits factorisation in terms of the (sea) quark transverse\nmomentum dependent (TMD) distribution, which in turn satisfies a universal\nDGLAP and Sudakov evolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
