This paper examines the conditions necessary for other\ntraditional sensors to admit eventified versions that provide adequate\ninformation despite outputting only changes. The requirements depend upon the\nregularity of the signal space, which we show may depend on several factors\nincluding structure arising from the interplay of the robot and its\nenvironment, the input-output computation needed to achieve its task, as well\nas the specific mode of access (synchronous, asynchronous, polled, triggered).\nFurther, there are additional properties of stability (or non-oscillatory\nbehavior) that can be desirable for a system to possess and that we show are\nalso closely related to the preceding notions. This paper contributes theory\nand algorithms (plus a hardness result) that addresses these considerations\nwhile developing several elementary robot examples along the way.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
