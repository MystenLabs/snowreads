The five-year survival rate for high-grade\nglioma in children is less than 20%. The development of new treatments is\ndependent upon multi-institutional collaborative clinical trials requiring\nreproducible and accurate centralized response assessment. We present the\nresults of the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, the first Brain Tumor Segmentation\n(BraTS) challenge focused on pediatric brain tumors. This challenge utilized\ndata acquired from multiple international consortia dedicated to pediatric\nneuro-oncology and clinical trials. BraTS-PEDs 2023 aimed to evaluate\nvolumetric segmentation algorithms for pediatric brain gliomas from magnetic\nresonance imaging using standardized quantitative performance evaluation\nmetrics employed across the BraTS 2023 challenges. The top-performing AI\napproaches for pediatric tumor analysis included ensembles of nnU-Net and Swin\nUNETR, Auto3DSeg, or nnU-Net with a self-supervised framework. The BraTSPEDs\n2023 challenge fostered collaboration between clinicians (neuro-oncologists,\nneuroradiologists) and AI/imaging scientists, promoting faster data sharing and\nthe development of automated volumetric analysis techniques. These advancements\ncould significantly benefit clinical trials and improve the care of children\nwith brain tumors.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bvBEm4ytGrDn_IWpdctUxIodkgt-vxbI1LtV_boOYp8","pdfSize":"1728377"}
