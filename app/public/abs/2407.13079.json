For the Kerr-Newman metric, this proves a recent numerical\nobservation by Hristov. We propose a new method to compute the sum of the\nentropies using a generalized Smarr formula. The higher-curvature corrections\nin Gauss-Bonnet gravity are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
