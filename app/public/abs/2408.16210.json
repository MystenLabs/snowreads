This\nnarrow-band 2D spin-orbit coupled attractive Fermi-Hubbard model can\npotentially be realized in cold atom systems in optical lattices with\nartificially engineered Rashba SOC and Zeeman field. Employing a\nself-consistent mean field approximation for the pairing potential, we uncover\na complex phase diagram featuring various topological superfluid (TS) phases,\ndependent on the chemical potential and the Zeeman field. We focus on the\npairing potential and the corresponding quasiparticle gap characterizing the TS\nphases, which are notably small for a wide-band model with quadratic dispersion\nnear the $\\Gamma$-point, as found in earlier work, and we identify the\nparameter regimes that maximize the gap. We find that, while generally the\nvalue of the pairing potential increases with the reduction of the fermionic\nbandwidth, as expected for narrow- or flat-band systems, the magnitude of the\ntopological gap characterizing the TS phases reaches a maximum of about\n$10-12.5\\%$ of the interaction strength at finite values of the hopping\namplitude, Rashba coupling, and Zeeman field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
