In particular, we customize the\ntree-growing algorithm to partition macroeconomic variables based on the DNS\nmodel's marginal likelihood, thereby identifying regime-shifting patterns in\nthe yield curve. Compared to traditional Markov-switching models, our model\noffers clear economic interpretation via macroeconomic linkages and ensures\ncomputational simplicity. In an empirical application to U.S. Treasury bond\nyields, we find (1) important yield curve regime switching, and (2) evidence\nthat macroeconomic variables have predictive power for the yield curve when the\nshort rate is high, but not in other regimes, thereby refining the notion of\nyield curve ``macro-spanning\".\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
