In practice,\nnot all measurements can be easily applied, even using unentangled measurements\nwhere each copy is measured separately. We develop an information-theoretic\nframework that yields unified copy complexity lower bounds for restricted\nfamilies of non-adaptive measurements through a novel measurement information\nchannel. Using this framework, we obtain the optimal bounds for a natural\nfamily of $k$-outcome measurements with fixed and randomized schemes. We\ndemonstrate a separation between these two schemes, showing the power of\nrandomized measurement schemes over fixed ones. Previously, little was known\nfor fixed schemes, and tight bounds were only known for randomized schemes with\n$k\\ge d$ and Pauli observables, a special class of 2-outcome measurements. Our\nwork bridges this gap in the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
