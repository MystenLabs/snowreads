We\nconsider systems described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) discretized\nwith structured or unstructured grids. The framework integrates multi-level\ninformation to generate high fidelity time sequences of the system dynamics. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our framework with two case\nstudies in incompressible, two dimensional, low Reynolds cylinder flow on an\nunstructured mesh and incompressible turbulent channel flow on a structured\nmesh, both parameterized by the Reynolds number. Our results illustrate the\nframework's robustness and ability to generate accurate flow sequences across\nvarious parameter settings, significantly reducing computational costs allowing\nfor efficient forecasting and reconstruction of flow dynamics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
