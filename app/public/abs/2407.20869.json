The Chaplygin gas\nis a fluid designed to accommodate measurements for the early universe and\nlate-time universal expansion while obeying the pressure-density-time relation.\nWe produce an explanation and description of the non-self-similar Riemann\nsolutions, including the non-classical singular solutions. We also find that\ndue to a direct dependence on time, a change in the regions allowing for\ncombinations of classical and non-classical singular solutions occurs,\ntherefore a Riemann solution can have different solutions over several time\nintervals. Our findings are confirmed numerically using the local\nLax-Friederichs scheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
