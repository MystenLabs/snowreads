Our approach addresses this by introducing a training-free\nframework that ensures the generated video sequence preserves the reference\nimage's subtleties, such as physique and proportions, through a dual alignment\nstrategy. We decouple skeletal and motion priors from pose information,\nenabling precise control over animation generation. Our method also improves\npixel-level alignment for conditional control from the reference character,\nenhancing the temporal consistency and visual cohesion of animations. Our\nmethod significantly enhances the quality of video generation without the need\nfor large datasets or expensive computational resources.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oQqKK6BgR8gBcgMg14aqufADKnhoXnFJ-lj7nVU59pQ","pdfSize":"3795488"}
