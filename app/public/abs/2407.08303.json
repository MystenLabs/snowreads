Their development for comprehensive\nvisual perception hinges on the availability of high-quality image-text\ndatasets that offer diverse visual elements and throughout image descriptions.\nHowever, the scarcity of such hyper-detailed datasets currently hinders\nprogress within the MLLM community. The bottleneck stems from the limited\nperceptual capabilities of current caption engines, which fall short in\nproviding complete and accurate annotations. To facilitate the cutting-edge\nresearch of MLLMs on comprehensive vision perception, we thereby propose\nPerceptual Fusion, using a low-budget but highly effective caption engine for\ncomplete and accurate image descriptions. Specifically, Perceptual Fusion\nintegrates diverse perception experts as image priors to provide explicit\ninformation on visual elements and adopts an efficient MLLM as a centric pivot\nto mimic advanced MLLMs' perception abilities. We carefully select 1M highly\nrepresentative images from uncurated LAION dataset and generate dense\ndescriptions using our engine, dubbed DenseFusion-1M. Extensive experiments\nvalidate that our engine outperforms its counterparts, where the resulting\ndataset significantly improves the perception and cognition abilities of\nexisting MLLMs across diverse vision-language benchmarks, especially with\nhigh-resolution images as inputs.
