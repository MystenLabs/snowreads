The performance of such\nmonolithically integrated approach is compared to heterogeneously integrated\nsolution designed in the same technology which requires wire-bonding to the\nbalanced photodetectors. The designed circuits are targeting bandwidth above 1\nGHz. The improved noise performance is leveraged against increased secure key\nrates and achievable reach in continuous-variable quantum key distribution\n(CV-QKD).\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
