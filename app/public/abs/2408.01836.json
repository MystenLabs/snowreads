By analyzing motion of massive\nparticles in these geometries, we found that: In the case of\nSchwarzschild-(A)dS, a (nearly) tangential particle from infinity will wind\naround the extremal surface with a finite number of windings depending on the\nimpact parameter and the cosmological constant. In Schwarzschild-Bach-(A)dS, a\nparticle passing close enough to the extremal surface will have an infinite\nnumber of windings; hence, it will not escape to asymptotic infinity as in\nSchwarzschild-(A)dS. We also calculate the thermodynamical quantities for such\nblack holes and argue that it is analogous to an incompressible thermodynamical\nsystem with divergent entropy when the temperature goes to zero (in the strict\nCarroll limit). We then define a divergent specific heat that can be positive,\nnegative, or zero.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
