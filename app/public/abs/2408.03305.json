However, most current\ntheoretical and experimental attempts focus on systems with low Chern number\nbands, in analogy to the Landau levels. Here we propose candidate material\nsystems for realizing fractional Chern insulators with higher Chern numbers.\nThe material setup involves $\\Gamma$-valley twisted homobilayer transition\nmetal dichalcogenides in proximity to a skyrmion lattice. The skyrmion exchange\npotential induces a flat band with a high Chern number $C = -2$. Using the\nmomentum-space projected exact diagonalization method, we perform a\ncomprehensive study at various filling factors, confirming the generalized Jain\nseries. Our research provides theoretical guidance on realizing unconventional\nfractional Chern insulators beyond the Landau level picture.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
