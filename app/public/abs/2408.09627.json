Big data and associated\nalgorithms, coalesced under the field of Machine Learning (ML), offer the\nopportunity to study the physics of the climate system in ways, and with an\namount of detail, infeasible few years ago. The inference provided by ML has\nallowed to ask causal questions and improve prediction skills beyond classical\nbarriers. Furthermore, when paired with modeling experiments or robust research\nin model parameterizations, ML is accelerating computations, increasing\naccuracy and allowing for generating very large ensembles at a fraction of the\ncost. In light of the urgency imposed by climate change and the rapidly growing\nrole of ML, we review its broader accomplishments in climate physics. Decades\nlong standing problems in observational data reconstruction, representation of\nsub-grid scale phenomena and climate (and weather) prediction are being tackled\nwith new and justified optimism. Ultimately, this review aims at providing a\nperspective on the benefits and major challenges of exploiting ML in studying\ncomplex systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
