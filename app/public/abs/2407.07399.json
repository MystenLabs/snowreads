Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to\nintegrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains\nunexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the\ntridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate\nrandom matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary\nexample, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized\nphases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors\nacross the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools\nto identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos\ncoefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full\nparameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical\nreasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the\nefficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
