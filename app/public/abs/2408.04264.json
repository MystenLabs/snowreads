Many algorithmic and combinatorial results are expressed in terms of the\ntreewidth. In this paper, we study the treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs,\nthat is, graphs that admit a straight-line drawing where all the vertices lie\non a circle, and every edge is crossed by at most $k$ other edges.\n  Wood and Telle [New York J. Math., 2007] showed that every outer $k$-planar\ngraph has treewidth at most $3k + 11$ using so-called planar decompositions,\nand later, Auer et al. [Algorithmica, 2016] proved that the treewidth of outer\n$1$-planar graphs is at most $3$, which is tight.\n  In this paper, we improve the general upper bound to $1.5k + 2$ and give a\ntight bound of $4$ for $k = 2$. We also establish a lower bound: we show that,\nfor every even $k$, there is an outer $k$-planar graph with treewidth $k+2$.\nOur new bound immediately implies a better bound on the cop number, which\nanswers an open question of Durocher et al. [GD 2023] in the affirmative.\n  Our treewidth bound relies on a new and simple triangulation method for outer\n$k$-planar graphs that yields few crossings with graph edges per edge of the\ntriangulation. Our method also enables us to obtain a tight upper bound of $k +\n2$ for the separation number of outer $k$-planar graphs, improving an upper\nbound of $2k + 3$ by Chaplick et al. [GD 2017]. We also consider outer\nmin-$k$-planar graphs, a generalization of outer $k$-planar graphs, where we\nachieve smaller improvements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
