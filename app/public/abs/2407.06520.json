Our\nstudy reveals distinct properties of vortex neutron decay, which deviate from\nthose of classical plane-wave neutron decay. We present the energy-angle\ndistributions of the final-state electron and antineutrino in unpolarized\nvortex neutrons, as well as angle distributions integrated over their energies.\nNotably, we provide theoretical calculations of the decay behavior of neutrons\nwith varying vortex cone angles and initial energies. We propose that\nidentifying the vortex state of the initial neutron can be achieved by\nanalyzing the angular and energy distributions of the final-state particles,\nintroducing new degrees of freedom for studying weak interactions and neutron\ndecay kinematics that have been previously overlooked in particle physics. This\ntimely investigation takes advantage of recent advancements in vortex neutron\npreparation and analysis, opening up new avenues for exploring the fundamental\nproperties of matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
