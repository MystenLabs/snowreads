We\nintroduce a novel approach using complex frequency signals to reveal hidden or\ninvisible poles--those with predominantly imaginary components--previously\nundetected in conventional scattering experiments. By employing a carefully\ntuned complex frequency excitation method, we demonstrate the efficient\nconversion of non-oscillating fields into oscillating ones. This effect is\nshown in both RF and optical domains, specifically within the C-band infrared\nspectral range, which is crucial for communications. This study enhances the\ntheoretical framework of wave interactions in photonic systems, paving the way\nfor innovative applications in invisibility cloaking, advanced photonic\ndevices, and the future of optical communication and quantum computing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
