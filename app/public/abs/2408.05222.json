Given a gauge function $h$ and a\npositive \"roof\" function $R$ compactly supported in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we are\ninterested in estimating the supremum of the $L^1$-norms of non-negative\nfunctions $f$ satisfying the pointwise bound $f \\leq R$ and the mass\ndistribution bound $\\int_c f \\, dV_n \\leq h(V_n(c))$, where $c$ is a cube and\n$V_n$ is the volume measure. We prove a duality theorem which states that the\noptimal value in this maximization problem is the minimum among certain\nquantities associated with semi-covers by cubes of the support of $R$. We use\nour theorem to solve the so-called \"splitting problem\" in the theory of\npolynomial approximations in the plane. As a result, we confirm an old\nconjecture of Kriete and MacCluer regarding an extension of Khrushchev's\noriginal splitting theorem to the weighted context, and explain the mechanics\nof an example in the research problem book by Havin, Khrushchev and Nikolskii.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
