In\nour model, we consider a network of individuals who share two opposing types of\ninformation on a specific topic (e.g., pro- vs. anti-vaccine stances), and the\naccumulation of evidence supporting either type of information is modelled by\nmeans of a drift-diffusion process. After formalising the model, we put forward\na campaign of Monte Carlo simulations to identify population-wide behaviours\nemerging from agents' exposure to different sources of information,\ninvestigating the impact of the number and persistence of such sources, and the\nrole of the network structure through which the individuals interact. We find\nsimilar emergent behaviours for all network structures considered. When there\nis a single type of information, the main observed emergent behaviour is\nconsensus. When there are opposing information sources, both consensus or\npolarisation can result; the latter occurs if the number and persistence of the\nsources exceeds some threshold values. Importantly, we find the emergent\nbehaviour is mainly influenced by how long the information sources are present\nfor, as opposed to how many sources there are.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
