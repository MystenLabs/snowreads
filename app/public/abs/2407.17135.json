These inverse problems are typically reconstructed via\nBayesian methods. A natural question then is whether and how the reconstruction\nconverges as the signal-to-noise ratio tends to infinity and how this\nconvergence interacts with other parameters such as the detector size. In this\narticle we carry out a corresponding variational analysis for the exemplary\nBayesian reconstruction functional from [arXiv:2311.17784,arXiv:1902.07521],\nwhich considers dynamic PET imaging (i.e.\\ the object to be reconstructed\nchanges over time) and uses an optimal transport regularization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
