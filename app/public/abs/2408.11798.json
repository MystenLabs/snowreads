We revisit the parameter spaces of TeV-scale vector LQs that\ncontribute to these observables and study how these models fare against the LHC\nbounds. We find that only $U_1$ and $V_2$ can explain the observed positive\nshift in $(a_\\mu^{\\rm exp} - a_\\mu^{\\rm SM})$ through a lepton\nchirality-flipping contribution with $\\mathcal O(1)$ LQ-quark-lepton coupling.\nWe also see how these two LQs can fit the electron dipole moment measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
