Besides non-relativistic EDFs, mostly of the\nSkyrme or Gogny type, relativistic EDFs of different types are in widespread\nuse. In these latter approaches, the effective in-medium interaction is\ndescribed by an exchange of mesons between nucleons. In most cases, only\nminimal meson-nucleon couplings are considered. The effects of additional\ntensor couplings were rarely investigated. In this work, a new relativistic EDF\nwith tensor couplings and density dependent minimal meson-nucleon couplings\nwill be presented. The parameters of the model are determined using a carefully\nselected set of experimental data with realistic uncertainties that are\ndetermined self-consistently. Predictions for various nuclear observables, the\nnuclear matter equation of state, and properties of neutron stars are\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gRVEMWcE2vvD6L3ZqdCUtc14ZzDl_AqSTrGR9AMNaGk","pdfSize":"810448"}
