However, complex model design and tedious clustering\nprocesses are typical in existing methods. Such limitations result in\ninfeasible clustering in real-world applications. Reasonable and efficient\nmodel design and training need to be taken into account. Besides, developing\nunsupervised face clustering algorithms is crucial, which are more realistic in\nreal-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised face\nclustering algorithm FC-ES and a novel supervised face clustering algorithm\nFC-ESER to address these issues. An efficient and effective neighbor-based edge\nprobability and a novel early stopping strategy are proposed in FC-ES,\nguaranteeing the accuracy and recall of large-scale face clustering\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, to take advantage of supervised learning, a novel\nedge recall strategy is proposed in FC-ESER to further recall the edge\nconnections that are not connected in FC-ES. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks for face, person, and vehicle clustering show that our proposed\nFC-ES and FC-ESER significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods.\nOur code will be available at https://github.com/jumptoliujj/FC-ESER.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
