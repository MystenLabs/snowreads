This\npaper presents a broad literature review of state-of-the-art applications of\ntensor networks and related topics across many research domains including:\nmachine learning, mathematical optimisation, materials science, quantum\nchemistry and quantum circuit simulation. This review aims to clarify which\nclasses of relevant applications have been proposed for which class of tensor\nnetworks, and how these perform compared with other classical or quantum\nsimulation methods. We intend this review to be a high-level tour on tensor\nnetwork applications which is easy to read by non-experts, focusing on key\nresults and limitations rather than low-level technical details of tensor\nnetworks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
