However, mapping rate-based RNNs to hardware-compatible\nspiking neural networks (SNNs) remains challenging. Here, we present a\n${\\Sigma}{\\Delta}$-low-pass RNN (lpRNN): an RNN architecture employing an\nadaptive spiking neuron model that encodes signals using\n${\\Sigma}{\\Delta}$-modulation and enables precise mapping. The\n${\\Sigma}{\\Delta}$-neuron communicates analog values using spike timing, and\nthe dynamics of the lpRNN are set to match typical timescales for processing\nnatural signals, such as speech. Our approach integrates rate and temporal\ncoding, offering a robust solution for the efficient and accurate conversion of\nRNNs to SNNs. We demonstrate the implementation of the lpRNN on Intel's\nneuromorphic research chip Loihi, achieving state-of-the-art classification\nresults on audio benchmarks using 3-bit weights. These results call for a\ndeeper investigation of recurrency and adaptation in event-based systems, which\nmay lead to insights for edge computing applications where power-efficient\nreal-time inference is required.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
