Ever since the commissioning\nof MIRC-X (J and H bands) in 2018 and MYSTIC (K bands) in 2021, they have been\nthe most popular and over-subscribed instruments at the array. Observers have\nbeen able to image stellar objects with sensitivity down to 8.1 mag in H and\n7.8 mag in K-band under the very best conditions. In 2022 MYSTIC was upgraded\nwith a new ABCD mode using the VLTI/GRAVITY 4-beam integrated optics chip, with\nthe goal of improving the sensitivity and calibration. The ABCD mode has been\nused to observe more than 20 T Tauri stars; however, the data pipeline is still\nbeing developed. Alongside software upgrades, we detail planned upgrades to\nboth instruments in this paper. The main upgrades are: 1) Adding a motorized\nfilter wheel to MIRC-X along with new high spectral resolution modes 2)\nUpdating MIRC-X optics to allow for simultaneous 6T J+H observations 3)\nRemoving the warm window between the spectrograph and the warm optics in MYSTIC\n4) Adding a 6T ABCD mode to MIRC-X in collaboration with CHARA/SPICA 5)\nUpdating the MIRC-X CRED-ONE camera funded by Prof. Kraus from U. Exeter 6)\nCarrying out science verification of the MIRC-X polarization mode 7) Developing\nnew software for ABCD-mode data reduction and more efficient calibration\nroutines. We expect these upgrades to not only improve the observing\nexperience, but also increase the sensitivity by 0.4 mag in J+H-bands, and 1\nmag in K-band.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
