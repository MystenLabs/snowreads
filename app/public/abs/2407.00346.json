The wQED ladder\nconsists of two one-dimensional lossless waveguides simultaneously and chirally\ncoupled with a chain of dipole-dipole interacting two-level quantum emitters\n(QEs) or atoms. In particular, we analyze how a departure from the periodic\nplacement of the QEs due to temperature-induced position disorder can impact\nthe routing probability. This involves analyzing how the interplay between the\ncollective atomic effects originating from the dipole-dipole interaction and\ndisorder in the atomic location leading to single-photon localization can\nchange the routing probabilities. As for some key results, we find that the\nrouting probability exhibits a considerable improvement (more than $90\\%$\nvalue) for periodic and disordered wQED ladders when considering lattices\nconsisting of twenty QEs. This robustness of collective effects against\nspontaneous emission loss and weak disorders is further confirmed by examining\nthe routing efficiency and localization length for up to twenty QE chains.\nThese results may find applications in quantum networking and distributed\nquantum computing under the realistic conditions of imperfect emitter\ntrappings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
