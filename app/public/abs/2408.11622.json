Here, we report on a design of a gel\nsubstrate with stiffness gradient, which can cause the spontaneous motion of a\ndroplet along (durotaxis) or to the opposite (antidurotaxis) direction of the\ngradient, depending on the droplet affinity to the substrate. By using\nextensive molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model, we find\nthat the mechanisms of the durotaxis and antidurotaxis droplet motion are\ndistinct, require the minimization of the interfacial energy between the\ndroplet and the substrate, and share similarities with those mechanisms\npreviously observed for brush substrates with stiffness gradient. Moreover,\ndurotaxis motion takes place over a wider range of affinities and is generally\nmore efficient (faster motion) than antidurotaxis. Thus, our study points to\nfurther possibilities and guidelines for realizing both antidurotaxis and\ndurotaxis motion on the same gradient substrate for applications in\nmicrofluidics, energy conservation, and biology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AxoIm9qVXyWIJAn_hWijErphFkab9HHo6y5Pyka92cM","pdfSize":"2739750"}
