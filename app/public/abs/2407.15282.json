We significantly\nenhanced the performance of Point Transformer V3 on the Waymo benchmark by\nimplementing cutting-edge, plug-and-play training and inference technologies.\nNotably, our advanced version, Point Transformer V3 Extreme, leverages\nmulti-frame training and a no-clipping-point policy, achieving substantial\ngains over the original PTv3 performance. Additionally, employing a\nstraightforward model ensemble strategy further boosted our results. This\napproach secured us the top position on the Waymo Open Dataset semantic\nsegmentation leaderboard, markedly outperforming other entries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
