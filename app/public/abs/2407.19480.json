This extrapolation problem\nin the frequency domain is well-known to be unstable. We propose the\nmodel-based super-resolution framework (Model-SR) to address this\nill-posedness. Within this framework, we can recover the signal by solving a\nnonlinear least square problem and achieve the super-resolution. Theoretically,\nthe resolution-enhancing map is proved to have Lipschitz continuity under mild\nconditions, leading to a stable solution to the super-resolution problem. We\napply the general theory to three concrete models and give the stability\nestimates for each model. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the\nsuper-resolution behavior of the proposed framework. The model-based\nmathematical framework can be extended to problems with similar structures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
