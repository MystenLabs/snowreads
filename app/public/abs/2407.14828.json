It is found that the critical electric field is smallest for Nf = 0,\nindicating that the Schwinger effect is more likely to occur than in systems\nwith Nf = 2 and Nf = 2+ 1. The critical electric field decreases with\nincreasing chemical potential and temperature across all systems. Additionally,\npotential analysis confirms that the maximum total potential energy increases\nwith the number of flavors, suggesting that existing particles may reduce the\nprobability of particle pair production.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
