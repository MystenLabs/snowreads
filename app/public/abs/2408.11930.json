The interaction between a qubit and a levitated mass is a convenient\nmethod to create such a cat state. The size of the superpositions is limited by\nweak mass-qubit interactions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nprotocol that exponentially expands an initially small superposition via\nGaussian dynamics and successfully recombines it to complete an interferometry.\nAn unknown force can be sensed by the superposition exponentially fast in the\nexpansion time. The entanglement between two such interferometers interacting\nvia a quantum force is -- for the first time in qubit-based non-Gaussian\nprotocols -- obtained by solving the full quantum dynamics using Gaussian\ntechniques. GIE grows exponentially, thereby making it closer to experimental\nfeasibility. Requirements of experimental precision and decoherence are\nobtained.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
