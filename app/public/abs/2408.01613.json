The Shkarofsky form of\nFokker-Planck-Rosenbluth collision operator is employed in the\nVlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. A relaxation model for homogeneous plasma could\nbe presented in closed form in terms of Gauss HyperGeometric2F1 functions. This\nhas been accomplished based on the Maxwellian mixture model. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that classic models such as two-temperature thermal equilibrium\nmodel, Braginskii model and thermodynamic equilibrium model are special cases\nof our relaxation model. The present relaxation model is a nonequilibrium model\nwhich is under the assumption that the plasma system possesses finitely\ndistinguishable independent features, but it is not relying on the conventional\nnear-equilibrium assumption.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
