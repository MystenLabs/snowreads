A layer of diluted syrup is placed\nbelow freshwater in a beaker and heated from below. The vertical temperature\nprofile in the experiment is analogous to the vapor mixing ratio in the\natmosphere while the vertical profile of freshwater concentration in the\nexperiment is analogous to the potential temperature profile in the atmosphere.\nBoiling starts when the bottom of the syrup layer reaches the boiling point,\nproducing bubbles and vortex rings that stir the two-layer density interface\nand bring colder fresh water into the syrup layer. When the syrup layer at the\nbeginning of the experiment is sufficiently thin and diluted, the vortex rings\nentrain more cold water than needed to remove superheating in the syrup layer,\nending the boiling. When the syrup layer is deep and concentrated, the boiling\nis steady since the entrained colder water instantaneously removes the\nsuperheating in the bottom syrup layer. A theory is derived to predict the\nentrainment rate and the transition between the intermittent and steady boiling\nregimes, validated by experimental data. We suggest that these dynamics may\nshare similarities with the mixing and lifecycle of cumulus convection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
