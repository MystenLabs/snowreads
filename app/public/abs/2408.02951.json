Dirac fermions derived from a\ntight-binding model naturally contains a mass term $m(k)$ with parabolic\ndispersion, $m(k)=$ $m+uk^{2}$. However, in the Chern insulator based on Dirac\nfermions, only the sign of the mass $m$ is relevant. Recently, it is reported\nthat the quantum metric is observable by means of the optical conductivity,\nwhich is significantly affected by the parabolic coefficient. We analytically\nobtain the quantum metric and the optical conductivity in the Dirac Hamiltonian\nin arbitrary dimensions, where the Dirac mass has parabolic dispersion. We also\nstudy the quantum metric and the optical conductivity in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model\nand the Haldane model. We find that the optical conductivity has a significant\ndependence on $u$ in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model, while it is not the case in the\nHaldane model. We also analytically study the quantum metric and the optical\nconductivity in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
