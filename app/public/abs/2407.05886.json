However, the\ncomplex mechanics exhibited by these robots pose diverse challenges in modeling\nand control. Reduced order continuum mechanical models based on rod theories\nhave emerged as a promising framework, striking a balance between accurately\ncapturing deformations of slender bodies and computational efficiency. This\nreview paper explores rod-based models and control strategies for continuum and\nsoft robots. In particular, it summarizes the mathematical background\nunderlying the four main rod theories applied in soft robotics. Then, it\ncategorizes the literature on rod models applied to continuum and soft robots\nbased on deformation classes, actuation technology, or robot type. Finally, it\nreviews recent model-based and learning-based control strategies leveraging rod\nmodels. The comprehensive review includes a critical discussion of the trends,\nadvantages, limits, and possible future developments of rod models. This paper\ncould guide researchers intending to simulate and control new soft robots and\nprovide feedback to the design and manufacturing community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
