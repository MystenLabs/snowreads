We\nwrite down the Bekenstein-Hawking(BH) entropy of the black hole in terms of the\nnon-extensive entropies namely: Kaniadakis entropy, Renyi entropy,\nSharma-Mittal entropy, Tsallis-Cirto and Barrow entropy. We investigate their\nimpact on the thermodynamic phase structure and geometry of the CR-BTZ black\nhole in four different ensembles namely: the fixed $(J,Q)$ ensemble, fixed\n$(\\Omega,\\Phi)$ ensemble, fixed $(J,\\Phi)$ ensemble and the fixed $(\\Omega,Q)$\nensemble where $ J, Q, \\Omega$ and $ \\Phi$ represent the angular momentum,\nelectric charge, angular velocity and electric potential of the CR-BTZ black\nhole respectively. We investigate the Ruppeiner and geometrothermodynamic(GTD)\ngeometries of the black hole for all the non-extensive entropy cases. We find\nthat there are Davies type phase transitions in the CR-BTZ black hole for the\nKaniadakis entropy case for all the above mentioned thermodynamic ensembles.\nThese Davies type phase transitions were not seen in the BH entropy case. We\nalso find that the Ruppeiner and the GTD scalar for the Kaniadakis entropy show\ncurvature singularities corresponding to these Davies type phase transitions in\nthe CR-BTZ black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-RGlyD-JGOzybeP-Nxq5T7w6wyjmOgeSx7FIOmwtxj4","pdfSize":"1295653"}
