We present\na model-independent study of the observed mass-radius relationship in WD\nbinaries of \\cite{Parsons_2017}, listing data over a broad temperature range up\nto about 60,000 K (5 eV). The data show an appreciable temperature sensitivity\nwith pronounced intrinsic scatter (beyond measurement uncertainty) for the\ncanonical He-models with proton-to-neutron ratio 1:1. We characterize\ntemperature sensitivity by a temperature scale $T_0$ in model-agnostic\npower-law relations with temperature normalized radius. For low-mass WDs, the\nresults identify a remarkably modest $T_0 = 1 \\sim 2 $ eV. We comment on a\npotential interpretation for atmospheres insulating super-Eddington temperature\ncores from the sub-Eddington photospheres of low-mass WDs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IFQjeDpaWRJvObwt6dIlcIVaCYwd45_QrNFWxXQaDnM","pdfSize":"1509839"}
