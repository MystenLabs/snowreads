We demonstrate that the composite waves\nconsisting of two viscous shocks achieve asymptotic nonlinear stability under\nthe condition of having two small, independent wave strengths and the presence\nof minor initial perturbations. Furthermore, the solutions of the relaxed\nsystem are observed to globally converge over time to those of the classical\nsystem as the relaxation parameter approaches zero. The methodologies are\ngrounded in relative entropy, the $a$-contraction with shifts theory and\nfundamental energy estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
