However, the dipole-dipole interaction between CRAs has not been\nobserved so far. We report the measurement and characterization of the resonant\ndipole-dipole interaction between two CRAs, individually trapped in optical\ntweezers, and find excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. We\ndemonstrate a dynamic control over the strength of the interaction by tuning\nthe orientation of an electric field. We use the interaction between the CRAs\nas a meter for the interatomic distance, and record the relative motion between\ntwo atoms in their traps. This motion, that we induce through the interaction\nbetween Rydberg levels with permanent electric dipoles, transiently populated\nduring the preparation of the circular states, is a signature of spin-motion\ncoupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YjNjFaGBAns1y5Bcw-jpR9bpJm1lXTYZCKXmuO9GcXw","pdfSize":"1074355"}
