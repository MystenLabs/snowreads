This study calculates the thermal dilepton\ninvariant mass spectra and thermal photon transverse momentum spectra in Au+Au\ncollisions at low beam energies from the Beam Energy Scan program, using a\n(3+1)-dimensional multistage hydrodynamic model calibrated by\nrapidity-dependent hadronic distributions. The effects of thermodynamic\nrapidity variation, baryon chemical potential, and fluid expansion on the\nspectra are explored. Methods for extracting temperature from photon and\ndilepton spectra are examined by comparison with the underlying hydrodynamic\ntemperature. The possibility of combining photon and dilepton spectra to\nextract radial flow is also investigated. This study provides insights into\nmeasuring the thermodynamic properties of the created systems in heavy-ion\ncollisions using multiple messengers through two fundamental interactions\nwithin the same framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
