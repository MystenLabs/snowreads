This is obtained from an\nexpression for the finite size scaling term in the free energy on a cylinder in\nperiodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in terms of Jacobi theta\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
