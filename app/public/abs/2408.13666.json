The starting point of Business Process\nSimulation (BPS) is a process model enriched with simulation parameters. To\ncope with the typically large parameter spaces of BPS models, several methods\nhave been proposed to automatically discover BPS models from event logs.\nVirtually all these approaches neglect the data perspective of business\nprocesses. Yet, the data attributes manipulated by a business process often\ndetermine which activities are performed, how many times, and when. This paper\naddresses this gap by introducing a data-aware BPS modeling approach and a\nmethod to discover data-aware BPS models from event logs. The BPS modeling\napproach supports three types of data attributes (global, case-level, and\nevent-level) as well as deterministic and stochastic attribute update rules and\ndata-aware branching conditions. An empirical evaluation shows that the\nproposed method accurately discovers the type of each data attribute and its\nassociated update rules, and that the resulting BPS models more closely\nreplicate the process execution control flow relative to data-unaware BPS\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
