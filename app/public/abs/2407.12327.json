An alternative\napproach involves training compressed models directly at a low bitwidth (e.g.,\nbinary or ternary models). However, the performance, training dynamics, and\nscaling trends of such models are not yet well understood. To address this\nissue, we train and openly release the Spectra LLM suite consisting of 54\nlanguage models ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters, trained on 300B tokens.\nSpectra includes FloatLMs, post-training quantized QuantLMs (3, 4, 6, and 8\nbits), and ternary LLMs (TriLMs) - our improved architecture for ternary\nlanguage modeling, which significantly outperforms previously proposed ternary\nmodels of a given size (in bits), matching half-precision models at scale. For\nexample, TriLM 3.9B is (bit-wise) smaller than the half-precision FloatLM 830M,\nbut matches half-precision FloatLM 3.9B in commonsense reasoning and knowledge\nbenchmarks. However, TriLM 3.9B is also as toxic and stereotyping as FloatLM\n3.9B, a model six times larger in size. Additionally, TriLM 3.9B lags behind\nFloatLM in perplexity on validation splits and web-based corpora but performs\nbetter on less noisy datasets like Lambada and PennTreeBank.\n  To enhance understanding of low-bitwidth models, we are releasing 500+\nintermediate checkpoints of the Spectra suite at\n\\href{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
