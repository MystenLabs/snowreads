We present conditions under which minimizing the\nworst-case, welfare-based regret among all nonrandom schemes that select k\nsites to experiment is approximately equal - and sometimes exactly equal - to\nfinding the k most central vectors of baseline site-level covariates. The\nk-median problem can be formulated as a linear integer program. Two empirical\napplications illustrate the theoretical and computational benefits of the\nsuggested procedure.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
