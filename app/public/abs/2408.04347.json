Here, each\nimage with a predefined rotation is considered as a new class for training. At\ninference, all image rotation predictions are aggregated for the final\nprediction, a strategy we term Aggregated Self-Supervision (AggSS). We observe\na shift in the deep neural network's attention towards intrinsic object\nfeatures as it learns through AggSS strategy. This learning approach\nsignificantly enhances class-incremental learning by promoting robust feature\nlearning. AggSS serves as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly\nincorporated into any class-incremental learning framework, leveraging its\npowerful feature learning capabilities to enhance performance across various\nclass-incremental learning approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on\nstandard incremental learning datasets CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Subset\ndemonstrate the significant role of AggSS in improving performance within these\nparadigms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RB2x5JmNVHZe9kRg-RzHUHCG5axn41CLM5Mv9cQdwbQ","pdfSize":"1281280"}
