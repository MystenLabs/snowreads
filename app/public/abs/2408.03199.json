In particular, we focus on approaches based on\nstochastic line searches and employing general search directions. We define\nconditions on the sequence of search directions that guarantee finite\ntermination and bounds for the backtracking procedure. Moreover, we shed light\non the additional property of directions needed to prove fast (linear)\nconvergence of the general class of algorithms when applied to PL functions in\nthe interpolation regime. From the point of view of algorithms design, the\nproposed analysis identifies safeguarding conditions that could be employed in\nrelevant algorithmic framework. In particular, it could be of interest to\nintegrate stochastic line searches within momentum, conjugate gradient or\nadaptive preconditioning methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
