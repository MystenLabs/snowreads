In the context of\ncontinuous-variable quantum systems, another necessary ressource for quantum\nadvantages is non-Gaussianity. In this work, we propose a witness, based on\npreviously known relations between metrological power and quantum correlations,\nto detect a strong form of entanglement that only non-Gaussian states possess\nand that cannot be undone by passive optical operations, i.e., entanglement in\nall mode bases. The strength of our witness is two-fold: it only requires\nmeasurements in one basis to check entanglement in any arbitrary mode basis; it\ncan be made applicable experimentally using homodyne measurements and without\nrequiring a full tomography of the state.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"011oXXpFeqGFEWTTBRrQPot1nO-D3xnEamH8R19PbAo","pdfSize":"1682332"}
