It is shown that thermal agitation enhances the apparent damping for\ncells smaller than about 55 nm. The effect is fundamental and does not reflect\na true damping increase. In addition to the thermal effect, it is still found\nthat device level damping is higher than film level damping and increases with\ndecreasing cell size. This is attributed to edge damage caused by device\npatterning.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
