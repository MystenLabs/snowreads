Observations of eruptions involving polar crown filaments,\nsituated in the polar regions of the Sun, are limited. In this study, we report\na polar crown filament eruption (SOL2023-06-12), characterized by fast\ndownflows below the filament. The downflows appear instantly after the onset of\nthe filament eruption and persist for approximately 2 hours, exhibiting\nplane-of-sky (POS) velocities ranging between 92 and 144 km s$^{-1}$. They\noriginate from the leading edge of the filament and no clear acceleration is\nobserved. Intriguingly, these downflows appear at two distinct sites,\nsymmetrically positioned at the opposite ends of the conjugate flare ribbons.\nBased on the observations, we propose that the filament might be supported by a\nmagnetic flux rope (MFR), and these downflows possibly occur along the legs of\nthe MFR. The downflows likely result from continuous reconnections between the\nMFR and the overlying magnetic field structures, and could either be\nreconnection outflows or redirected filament materials. We also observed\nhorizontal drifting of the locations of downflows, which might correspond to\nthe MFR's footpoint drifting. This type of downflows can potentially be\nutilized to track the footpoints of MFRs during eruptions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
