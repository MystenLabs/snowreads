In this\npaper, we conduct numerical benchmarking of this alternating unitary method in\na finite-parameter range against adiabatic driving in nonadiabatic timescale.\nWe find that the alternating unitary method results in broader distribution on\nenergy eigenstates than that obtained by adiabatic driving, but it has ability\nto sample low-energy eigenstates when an energy gap of a given Hamiltonian is\nsmall. It indicates that the alternating unitary method may be able to find\ngood approximate solutions in quantum annealing applied to hard instances.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
