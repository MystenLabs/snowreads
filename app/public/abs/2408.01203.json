The chaotic nature of its effects on\ntrain lateness is notoriously hard to predict. We use a stochastic\nMonte-Carto-style simulation of reactionary delay that produces whole\ndistributions of likely reactionary delay and delays this causes. We\ndemonstrate how Zoomable Level-of-Detail ChartTables - case-by-variable tables\nwhere cases are rows, variables are columns, variables are complex composite\nmetrics that incorporate distributions, and cells contain mini-charts that\ndepict these as different levels of detail through zoom interaction - help\ninterpret whole distributions of model outputs to help understand the causes\nand effects of reactionary delay, how they inform timetable robustness testing,\nand how they could be used in other contexts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
