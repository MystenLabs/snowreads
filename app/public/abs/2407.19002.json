Using the 1~second-long\nneutrino-radiation-GR-MHD simulation of coalescing neutron stars of Kiuchi et\nal. (2023) and following the semi-analytical estimates of Pais et al. (2023),\nwe inject a narrow, powerful, unmagnetized jet into the post-merger phase. We\nexplore different opening angles, luminosities, central engine durations, and\ntimes after the merger. We explore early ($0.1~$s following the merger) and\nlate ($1~$s) jet launches; the latter is consistent with the time delay of\n$\\approx 1.74~$s observed between GW 170817 and GRB 170817A. We demonstrate\nthat the semi-analytical estimates correctly predict the jets' breakout and\ncollimation conditions. When comparing our synthetic afterglow light curves to\nthe observed radio data of GW170807, we find a good agreement for a $3 \\times\n10^{49}$ ergs jet launched late with an opening angle in the range $\\simeq\n5${\\deg}-$7${\\deg}.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cHnbBIln1snsApH1nDnthTLdOumvpxEtVz49qya0xhc","pdfSize":"3191068"}
