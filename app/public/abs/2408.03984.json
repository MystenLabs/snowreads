The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective\ninteger filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which\nwe dub \"Quantum Charge Liquids\" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that\npreserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either\nhave gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order\nor have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on\ngapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological\norder. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is\nconsistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational\nfillings $\\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state\ndegeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that\nof the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical\nsystems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of\nthese phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4_MY1z8-GDjiwzsz6XVLG7YnUogT9R8uOnaW2tLtio4","pdfSize":"2799532"}
