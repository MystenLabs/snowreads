The guidance scheme ensures that consensus among the time-to-go\nestimates of the interceptors is achieved within a settling time whose upper\nbound can be pre-specified arbitrarily independent of the initial conditions or\ndesign parameters. The efficacy of the proposed guidance strategy is\ndemonstrated using numerical simulations with varied conditions of initial\nposition, velocities and heading angle errors of the interceptors as well as\ndifferent desired impact times.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gfjr0VElrQLvfrVZP-KIsR3i_22RfrMpk63MnTi5vR0","pdfSize":"8367293"}
