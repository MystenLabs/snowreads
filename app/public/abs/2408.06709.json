Existing all-in-one UHD\nimage restoration methods usually boost the model's performance by introducing\nprompt or customized dynamized networks for different degradation types. For\nthe inference stage, it might be friendly, but in the training stage, since the\nmodel encounters multiple degraded images of different quality in an epoch,\nthese cluttered learning objectives might be information pollution for the\nmodel. To address this problem, we propose a new training paradigm for general\nimage restoration models, which we name \\textbf{Review Learning}, which enables\nimage restoration models to be capable enough to handle multiple types of\ndegradation without prior knowledge and prompts. This approach begins with\nsequential training of an image restoration model on several degraded datasets,\ncombined with a review mechanism that enhances the image restoration model's\nmemory for several previous classes of degraded datasets. In addition, we\ndesign a lightweight all-purpose image restoration network that can efficiently\nreason about degraded images with 4K ($3840 \\times 2160$) resolution on a\nsingle consumer-grade GPU.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
