This letter introduces Orthogonal Mapping (OM), a simple\nyet effective method aimed at addressing the challenge of semantic confusion\ninherent in FGOD. OM introduces orthogonal constraints in the feature space by\ndecoupling features from the last layer of the classification branch with a\nclass-wise orthogonal vector basis. This effectively mitigates semantic\nconfusion and enhances classification accuracy. Moreover, OM can be seamlessly\nintegrated into mainstream object detectors. Extensive experiments conducted on\nthree FGOD datasets (FAIR1M, ShipRSImageNet, and MAR20) demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. Notably, with just one\nline of code, OM achieves a 4.08% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP)\nover FCOS on the ShipRSImageNet dataset.
