A provably convergent\noptimization algorithm is proposed which optimizes the user's transmit power,\nmetasurface reflection coefficients, and base station receive filters. The\ncomplexity of the proposed method is analyzed and numerical results are\nprovided to show the performance of the proposed optimization method.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
