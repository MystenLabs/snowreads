Here, we report the complex in-plane refractive index\nmeasurement of nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flake exfoliated from a single crystal\nFeTe$_{\\text{0.6}}$Se$_{\\text{0.4}}$ for photon wavelengths from 450 to 1100 nm\nover a temperature range from 4 K to 295 K. The results were obtained by\nemploying a two-Drude model for the dielectric function of Fe(Te,Se), a\nmultiband superconductor, and fitting the absolute optical reflection spectra\nusing the transfer matrix method. A high extinction coefficient in the visible\nto near-infrared range makes nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flakes a promising\nmaterial for photodetection applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
