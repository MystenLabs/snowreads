In order that this respects the gauge invariance of the\ntheory, the sum of the perturbative closed string field theory action and the\nD-instanton induced effective action must satisfy the quantum\nBatalin-Vilkovisky master equation. In a previous paper this was proved for the\neffective action induced by up to two instantons. We generalize the proof for\narbitrary number of D-instantons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
