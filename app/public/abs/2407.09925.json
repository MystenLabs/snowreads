To optimize traffic routing under\ndifferent failure scenarios, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is\ndeveloped and the power consumption and delay performance is assessed. The\nresults demonstrate that the two-tier AWGR architecture reduced the power\nconsumption and the delay compared to the AWGR-based architecture by up to 10%\nand 61%, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Zbt4YT1SbGuIV2qs-oq2mQ_ohKD2_vJxt1DY3jyTyBo","pdfSize":"1404006","objectId":"0xb720a59b27535f1767c2ded6d3da26c290743024700a800426ed58c276fa6f42","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
