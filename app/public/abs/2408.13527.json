Consequently, we provide a criterion for the\nisomorphism of $\\log$-algebras built on non-commutative von Neumann algebras\nwith different exact normal semifinite traces. Additionally, we demonstrate a\nconnection between the isomorphism of non-commutative $\\log$-algebras and the\nisomorphism of the corresponding $\\log$-algebras constructed on the center of\nthese von Neumann algebras. Furthermore, we present a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the isomorphism of $\\log$-algebras derived from different von\nNeumann algebras of type $I_n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w0O4auvmvRTIkUm6J7uJlni79dqQR-3mkiQ5lJF1dng","pdfSize":"159736"}
