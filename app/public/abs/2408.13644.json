Researchers have used various CNN models to learn audio features\nfrom different audio features like log mel spectrograms, gammatone spectral\ncoefficients, mel-frequency spectral coefficients, generated from the audio\nfiles, over the past years. In this paper, we propose a new methodology :\nTwo-Level Classification; the Level 1 Classifier will be responsible to\nclassify the audio signal into a broader class and the Level 2 Classifiers will\nbe responsible to find the actual class to which the audio belongs, based on\nthe output of the Level 1 Classifier. We have also shown the effects of\ndifferent audio filters, among which a new method of Audio Crop is introduced\nin this paper, which gave the highest accuracies in most of the cases. We have\nused the ESC-50 dataset for our experiment and obtained a maximum accuracy of\n78.75% in case of Level 1 Classification and 98.04% in case of Level 2\nClassifications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
