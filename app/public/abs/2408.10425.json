We use\nthe mass and radius data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer\n(NICER) for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, as well as the mass, radius, and\ndimensionless tidal deformability from the gravitational wave (GW) events\nGW190814 and GW170817. We use two distinct parameterizations of the extended\nnon-linear Walecka model (eNLW) with and without hyperons. The GTOV employed\nfor the study contains additional free parameters with different physical\nmotivations. Two possible scenarios are considered in our analysis:\nconservative and speculative. In the first case, we take into account the most\nreliable neutron star (NS) data from NICER and the GW170817 event. In the\nsecond case, we consider the possibility that the compact object with a mass of\n$2.54 M_{\\odot}$ in the GW190814 event is an NS. Our findings show significant\nimprovements in the physical quantities analyzed, leading to better agreement\nwith the observational data compared to the results obtained using the TOV\nequation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
