This space is parametrized by four\nunconstrained codimension-one functions that parameterize geometrical\ndeformations of the null infinity cylinder, known as Darboux soft hair. The\nsymplectic form of the theory in terms of these functions adopts a Darboux form\nat the corner, thereby yielding two copies of the Heisenberg algebra. Utilizing\na series of field redefinitions of boundary charges, we construct various Lie\nalgebras, including four Kac-Moody algebras, four Virasoro algebras, and two\ncentrally extended BMS$_3$ algebras. Intriguingly, we show that the bulk theory\npossesses a well-defined action principle without the need for any boundary\nLagrangian in the Darboux frame. Conversely, in the hydrodynamics frame, a\nwell-defined action principle with the Dirichlet boundary condition results in\ntwo Schwarzian actions at null infinity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
