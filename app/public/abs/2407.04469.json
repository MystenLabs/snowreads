Supporting density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations allow the determination of a single muon stopping\nsite whose magnetic environment is consistent with the proposed ground-state\nmagnetic structure. $\\mu^{+}$SR measurements of the dynamics reveal behavior\nconsistent with spin-wave excitations below $T_{\\mathrm{N2}}$, with an\nadditional contribution from a nonmagnetic component of the material. In the\nregion $T_{\\mathrm{N1}}<T<T_{\\mathrm{N2}}$ the system is magnetically ordered\nthroughout the bulk, but the character of the dynamics changes qualitatively,\nresulting in an unusual region of temperature-independent fluctuations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
