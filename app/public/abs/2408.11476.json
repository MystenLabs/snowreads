Contrary to the case of a single resistive half-plane, in the case\nof the impedance junction, both electric and magnetic fields' transverse\ncomponents simultaneously contain a logarithmic singularity. It is shown that a\nsurface current density has a finite jump that is proportional to the\ndifference between the inverse impedances.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ijSL5q_msbNhy8sK6K0JqwyIh9Qd4t-jT8QM-dkFrao","pdfSize":"129712"}
