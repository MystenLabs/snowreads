For example, economists\nmight wish to detect the presence of economic activity in satellite images, or\nto measure the topics or entities mentioned in social media, the congressional\nrecord, or firm filings. This review introduces deep neural networks, covering\nmethods such as classifiers, regression models, generative AI, and embedding\nmodels. Applications include classification, document digitization, record\nlinkage, and methods for data exploration in massive scale text and image\ncorpora. When suitable methods are used, deep learning models can be cheap to\ntune and can scale affordably to problems involving millions or billions of\ndata points.. The review is accompanied by a companion website, EconDL, with\nuser-friendly demo notebooks, software resources, and a knowledge base that\nprovides technical details and additional applications.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AGMWET_TnmfJLujhMX0ta9bnbhOxAhmzfL9Rqdsb76U","pdfSize":"19443431"}
