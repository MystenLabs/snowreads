In this\npaper, we realize a 60 ns direct CNOT-gate on two inductively-coupled fluxonium\nqubits using selective darkening approach, resulting in a gate fidelity as high\nas 99.94%. The fidelity remains above 99.9% for 24 days without any\nrecalibration between randomized benchmarking measurements. Compared with the\n99.96% fidelity of a 60 ns identity gate, our data brings the investigation of\nthe non-decoherence-related errors during gate operations down to $2 \\times\n10^{-4}$. The present result adds a simple and robust two-qubit gate into the\nstill relatively small family of \"the beyond three nines\" demonstrations on\nsuperconducting qubits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
