Model-based repetitive control employs knowledge of such periodicity\nto attenuate periodic disturbances and has seen a wide range of successful\nindustrial implementations. The aim of this paper is to develop a data-driven\nrepetitive control method. In the developed framework, linear periodically\ntime-varying (LPTV) behaviour is lifted to linear time-invariant (LTI)\nbehaviour. Periodic disturbance mitigation is enabled by developing an\nextension of Willems' fundamental lemma for systems with exogenous\ndisturbances. The resulting Data-enabled Predictive Repetitive Control (DeePRC)\ntechnique accounts for periodic system behaviour to perform attenuation of a\nperiodic disturbance. Simulations demonstrate the ability of DeePRC to\neffectively mitigate periodic disturbances in the presence of noise.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
