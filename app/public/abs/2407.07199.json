Four\nsuch approximations are discussed. While they are shown to work well with the\nrecently developed grid-over finite difference method (GoFD) for the numerical\nsolution of boundary value problems of the fractional Laplacian, they differ in\naccuracy, economics to compute, performance of preconditioning, and asymptotic\ndecay away from the diagonal line. In addition, two preconditioners based on\nsparse and circulant matrices are discussed for the iterative solution of\nlinear systems associated with the stiffness matrix. Numerical results in two\nand three dimensions are presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
