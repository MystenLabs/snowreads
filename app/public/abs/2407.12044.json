This approach lacks adequate precision to perform credit\nrisk analysis in practice. Related studies have shown that data-driven machine\nlearning algorithms outperform many conventional statistical approaches in\nsolving this type of problem, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The\npurpose of this paper is to construct and validate a credit risk assessment\nmodel using Linear Discriminant Analysis as a dimensionality reduction\ntechnique to discriminate good creditors from bad ones and identify the best\nclassifier for credit assessment of commercial banks based on real-world data.\nThis will help commercial banks to avoid monetary losses and prevent financial\ncrisis\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
