These generalizations allow for\nexogeneous jumps of the volatility at times of a regime switch. Both models are\nstudied within the framework of Markov-modulated generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocesses which allows to derive conditions for stationarity, formulas for\nmoments, as well as the autocovariance structure of volatility and price\nprocess. It turns out that both models inherit various properties of the\noriginal models and therefore are able to capture basic stylized facts of\nfinancial time-series such as uncorrelated log-returns, correlated squared\nlog-returns and non-existence of higher moments in the COGARCH case.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Pricing of Securities","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
