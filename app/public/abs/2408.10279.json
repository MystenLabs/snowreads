{"id":"2408.10279","title":"A new measure of risk using Fourier analysis","authors":"Michael Grabinski and Galiya Klinkova","authorsParsed":[["Grabinski","Michael",""],["Klinkova","Galiya",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2024 11:55:35 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-21","timestamp":1723982135000,"abstract":"  We use Fourier analysis to access risk in financial products. With it we\nanalyze price changes of e.g. stocks. Via Fourier analysis we scrutinize\nquantitatively whether the frequency of change is higher than a change in\n(conserved) company value would allow. If it is the case, it would be a clear\nindicator of speculation and with it risk. The entire methods or better its\napplication is fairly new. However, there were severe flaws in previous\nattempts; making the results (not the method) doubtful. We corrected all these\nmistakes by e.g. using Fourier transformation instead of discrete Fourier\nanalysis. Our analysis is reliable in the entire frequency band, even for\nfre-quency of 1/1d or higher if the prices are noted accordingly. For the\nstocks scrutinized we found that the price of stocks changes disproportionally\nwithin one week which clearly indicates spec-ulation. It would be an\ninteresting extension to apply the method to crypto currencies as these\ncurrencies have no conserved value which makes normal considerations of\nvolatility difficult.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2Wp1mb_QdYQDDRxh323LweUHEJ4Wa1LJOf2-SGeJCgs","pdfSize":"746485"}
