Subseasonal forecasts of prevailing weather regimes have\nproven skillful and valuable to energy applications. Previous studies have\nmainly focused on the mean surface weather associated with a regime. However,\nwe show in this paper that variability of surface weather within a regime\ncannot be ignored. These intra-regime variations, caused by different\n`subflavors' of the same regime, can be captured by continuous regime indices\nand allow a refined application of weather regimes. Here we discuss wintertime\ntemperature and wind speed regime anomalies for four selected countries, and\nprovide guidance on the operational use and interpretation of regime forecasts.\nIn an accompanying supplementary dataset we provide similar analysis for all\nEuropean countries, seasons and key energy variables, useful as an applied\nreference.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
