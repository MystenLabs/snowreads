The deformable nature of these objects poses unique\nchallenges that prior work on rigid objects cannot fully address. The\nincreasing interest within the community in textile perception and manipulation\nhas led to new methods that aim to address challenges in modeling, perception,\nand control, resulting in significant progress. However, this progress is often\ntailored to one specific textile or a subcategory of these textiles. To\nunderstand what restricts these methods and hinders current approaches from\ngeneralizing to a broader range of real-world textiles, this review provides an\noverview of the field, focusing specifically on how and to what extent textile\nvariations are addressed in modeling, perception, benchmarking, and\nmanipulation of textiles. We finally conclude by identifying key open problems\nand outlining grand challenges that will drive future advancements in the\nfield.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
