Therefore, a systematic framework to design\nhigh-fidelity gates becomes imperative. One type of two-qubit gate in\nsuperconducting qubits is the controlled-phase (CPHASE) gate, which utilizes a\nconditional interaction between higher energy levels of the qubits controlled\nby a baseband flux pulse on one of the qubits or a tunable coupler. In this\nwork, we study an adiabatic implementation of CPHASE gates and formulate the\ndesign of the control trajectory for the gate as a pulse-design problem. We\nshow in simulation that the Chebyshev-based trajectory can, in certain cases,\nenable gates with leakage error lower by an average of roughly 6% when compared\nto the widely used Slepian-based trajectory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
