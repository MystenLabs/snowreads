Using a data set of Middle High German charters from a digital\narchive, we evaluate various classifiers, including traditional and\ntransformer-based models, with and without normalization. Our results indicate\nthat the given normalization minimally improves locating tasks but reduces\naccuracy for dating, implying that original texts contain crucial features that\nnormalization may obscure. We find that support vector machines and gradient\nboosting outperform other models, questioning the efficiency of transformers\nfor this use case. Results suggest a selective approach to historical text\nnormalization, emphasizing the significance of preserving some textual\ncharacteristics that are critical for classification tasks in document\nanalysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eU9ChC8lUyCHR1iPrM6qO9a7KGJMmiKPqBR6uIt8q4Y","pdfSize":"134955"}
