In the case of an emergency, rescuers are dispatched with\nportable signal measurement equipment around the estimated location of the\nemergency caller. Each signal measurement device measures the uplink signal\nfrom the mobile phone of the caller. After calculating the rough location of\nthe caller's mobile phone based on these measurements, rescuers can efficiently\nsearch for the caller using the received uplink signal strength. Thus, the\npositioning accuracy in a conventional sense is not a limitation for rescuers\nin finding the caller. HELPS is not a traditional positioning system but rather\na system with humans in the loop designed to reduce search time in emergencies.\nHELPS can provide emergency location information even in environments where the\nGPS or Wi-Fi is not functional. Furthermore, for HELPS operation, no hardware\nchanges or software installations are required on the caller's mobile phone.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
