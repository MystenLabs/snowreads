Qubit control is\nan indispensable tool in this field, and most experiments have so far focused\non narrowband electromagnetic waves that interact with qubits at specific\nfrequencies. This interaction, however, changes significantly with fast,\nbroadband pulses, as waveguide properties like dispersion affect the pulse\nevolution and its impact on the qubit. Here, we use dispersion to achieve\nspatial addressing of superconducting qubits separated by a sub-wavelength\ndistance within a microwave waveguide. This novel approach relies on a\nself-focusing effect to create a position-dependent interaction between the\npulse and the qubits. This experiment emphasizes the importance of dispersion\nin the design and analysis of quantum experiments, and offers new avenues for\nthe rapid control of quantum states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MaDMhJIuUNCZpg6_eLJenM_6ZI6EeTpPfdnY8cvE1tY","pdfSize":"9400253","objectId":"0xfe4d1f4216d887f099b59fe3820101f8a36da013f83cc6551f340fe93684c596","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
