We explore the possibility that these fluctuations radiate\nHawking radiation dynamically. By studying the observed ringdowns after black\nhole mergers, we find that the amplitude of the horizon fluctuations should be\non the order of the Planck length, in order to emit the quantity of gravitons\ncorresponding to Hawking radiation. If the horizon fluctuations themselves are\nquasinormal modes, then the Hawking graviton spectrum is much more accurate\nthan the usual blackbody spectrum. Furthermore, it would only take one\nquasinormal mode, with its broad, damped spectrum, to emit the entire Hawking\nspectrum of gravitons. We check the dynamical Hawking radiation hypothesis by\nmeans of a sonic black hole; we induce additional fluctuations in the horizon,\nand observe enhanced Hawking radiation. As expected, we see that the\nspontaneous Hawking radiation is entangled, while the enhanced Hawking\nradiation is not, since we induce it deterministically.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
