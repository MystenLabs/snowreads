Suppose that the set of\nsingularities of the inverse of $f$ is finite and contained in the component\n$U$ of the Fatou set that contains $z_0$. Under an additional hypothesis we\nshow that the intersection of $\\partial U$ with the escaping set of $f$ has\nHausdorff dimension $1$. The additional hypothesis is satisfied for example if\n$f$ has the form $f(z)=\\int_0^z p(t)e^{q(t)}dt+c$ with polynomials $p$ and $q$\nand a constant $c$. This generalizes a result of Bara\\'nski, Karpi\\'nska and\nZdunik dealing with the case $f(z)=\\lambda e^z$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
