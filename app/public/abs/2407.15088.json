These models, models of the type with long-range\ninteractions were studied in various other contexts. In particular, it was\nshown that, if the interaction strength decays sufficiently slowly as a\nfunction of distance, it gives rise to bistability of solitons, which may find\napplications in their controllable switching. Dynamical lattices with\nlong-range interactions also serve as models for energy and charge transport in\nbiological molecules. Using a dynamical systems method we are able to\nconstruct, with great accuracy, stationary discrete solitons for our model, for\na large region of the parameter space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
