It means that the Hamiltonian structure of equations\ndescribing propagation of high-frequency wave packets is preserved by\nhydrodynamic evolution of the large-scale background wave, so that these\nequations have an additional integral of motion. This condition is expressed\nmathematically as a system of equations for the carrier wave number as a\nfunction of the background variables. We show that a solution of this system\nfor a given dispersion relation of linear waves is related with the\nquasiclassical limit of the Lax pair for the completely integrable equation\nhaving the corresponding dispersionless and linear dispersive behavior. We\nillustrate the theory by several examples.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SPafxR9XqME07QGxJTZ-03WPzhszJeaB-y8mEdhXCoI","pdfSize":"175498"}
