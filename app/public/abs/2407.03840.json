This\nis due to the intrinsic structure of the underlying reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace (RKHS). In fact, kernel-based interpolation has been applied to the\nreconstruction of bivariate functions from scattered Radon samples in\ncomputerized tomography (cf. Iske, 2018) and, moreover, to the numerical\nsolution of elliptic PDEs (cf. Wenzel et al., 2022). As shown in various\nprevious contributions, numerical algorithms and theoretical results from\nkernel-based Lagrange interpolation can be transferred to more general\ninterpolation problems. In particular, greedy point selection methods were\nstudied in (Wenzel et al., 2022), for the special case of Sobolev kernels. In\nthis paper, we aim to develop and analyze more general kernel-based\ninterpolation methods, for less restrictive settings. To this end, we first\nprovide convergence results for generalized interpolation under minimalistic\nassumptions on both the selected kernel and the target function. Finally, we\nprove convergence of popular greedy data selection algorithms for totally\nbounded sets of functionals. Supporting numerical results are provided for\nillustration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
