We show that the bound provided by Chen et al. is\nsharp up to a factor of $\\log\\log$ of the initial density. This result extends\nthe findings of Kozma, which showed the analogous result for the original\nspectral profile bound of Goel et al. for Markov chains on finite state spaces.\nKozma shows that the spectral profile bound is sharp up to a multiplicative\nfactor of $\\log(\\log(\\pi_{min}))$, where $\\pi_{\\min}$ is the smallest value of\nthe probability mass function of the stationary distribution. We discuss the\napplication of our primary finding to the comparison of Markov chains. Our main\nresult can be used as a comparison bound, indicating that it is possible to\ncompare chains even when only non-spectral bounds exist for a known chain.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
