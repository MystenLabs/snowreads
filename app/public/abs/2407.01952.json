We\nderive results for the homology of the topological full groups associated with\nrings of algebraic integers, and we use our groupoid homology calculation to\ncompute the K-theory for ring C*-algebras of rings of algebraic integers,\nrecovering the results of Cuntz and Li and of Li and L\\\"uck without using\nCuntz--Li duality. Moreover, we compute the K-theory for C*-algebras attached\nto integral dynamics, resolving the conjecture by Barlak, Omland, and Stammeier\nin full generality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
