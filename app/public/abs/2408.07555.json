Unlike prior work, we are able to\nleverage arbitrary representations of plasma quantities and easily incorporate\nthem into a non-linear optimisation framework. The efficiency of our method\nenables not only estimation of a physically plausible image of plasma, but also\nrecovery of the neutral Deuterium distribution from imaging and midplane\nmeasurements alone. We demonstrate our method with three different levels of\ncomplexity showing first that a poloidal neutrals density distribution can be\nrecovered from imaging alone, second that the distributions of neutral\nDeuterium, electron density and electron temperature can be recovered jointly,\nand finally, that this can be done in the presence of realistic imaging systems\nthat incorporate sensor cropping and quantisation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cxUlicTcrLv83mTWLrIcS0QEe73ItbaIeRnTQQp7wlk","pdfSize":"4546935"}
