Existing approaches\nface significant challenges, notably in utilizing feedback from physical\nmetrics to better adapt and refine synthesis operations, and in establishing a\nunified and comprehensive metric. This paper introduces a new Primitive logic\ngate placement guided technology MAPping (PigMAP) framework to address these\nchallenges. With approximating technology-independent spatial information, we\ndevelop a novel wirelength (WL) driven mapping algorithm to produce PD-friendly\nnetlists. PigMAP is equipped with two schemes: a performance mode that focuses\non optimizing the critical path WL to achieve high performance, and a power\nmode that aims to minimize the total WL, resulting in balanced power and\nperformance outcomes. We evaluate our framework using the EPFL benchmark suites\nwith ASAP7 technology, using the OpenROAD tool for place-and-route. Compared\nwith OpenROAD flow scripts, performance mode reduces delay by 14% while\nincreasing power consumption by only 6%. Meanwhile, power mode achieves a 3%\nimprovement in delay and a 9% reduction in power consumption.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
