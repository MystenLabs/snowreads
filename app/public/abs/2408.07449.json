The system describes a diffuse interface model for a two-phase flow\nof viscous incompressible fluids on an evolving surface. We also establish the\nvalidity of the instantaneous strict separation property from the pure phases.\nTo show these results we use our previous achievements on local well-posedness\ntogether with suitable novel regularity results for the convective\nCahn-Hilliard equation. The latter allows to obtain higher-order energy\nestimates to extend the local solution globally in time. To this aim the time\nevolution of energy type quantities has to be calculated and estimated\ncarefully.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"L-Tc1NlCBIhtKftDMdWaHqQ7yu8BN0R41A7s5Iw6Gf0","pdfSize":"401109"}
