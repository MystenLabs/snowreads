We address the challenge of also capturing rich structured\ninformation about the local neighbourhood of entities and their relations, by\nintroducing a Transformer-based approach that effectively integrates textual\ndescriptions with graph structure, reducing the reliance on resource-intensive\ntext encoders. Our experiments on three challenging datasets show that our\nFast-and-Frugal Text-Graph (FnF-TG) Transformers achieve superior performance\ncompared to the previous state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining efficiency\nand scalability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
