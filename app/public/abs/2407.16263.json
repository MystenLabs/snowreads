We formulate sufficient conditions under which the existence of a\ncharacteristic conic connection implies the existence of a torsion-free\nprincipal connection. We verify these conditions for adjoint varieties of\nsimple Lie algebras, excluding those of type $\\textsf{A}_{\\ell \\neq 2}$ or\n$\\textsf{C}_{\\ell}$. As an application, we give a complete classification of\nthe germs of minimal rational curves whose VMRT at a general point is such an\nadjoint variety: nontrivial ones come from lines on hyperplane sections of\ncertain Grassmannians or minimal rational curves on wonderful group\ncompactifications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_qA4fz4Q0XLP9jA5LDQY0Vyagnqt9bflnN1K4_RYUv0","pdfSize":"485297"}
