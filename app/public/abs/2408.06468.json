It advances over prior works by enhancing all\nspeakers within any given FoV, with a hybrid signal processing and deep\nlearning approach designed with high computational efficiency. The neural\nnetwork component is designed with ultra-low computation (about 50 MMACS). A\nmulti-channel Wiener filter and a post-processing module are further used to\nimprove perceptual quality. We evaluate our algorithm with a microphone array\non smart glasses, providing a configurable, efficient solution for augmented\nhearing on energy-constrained devices. FoVNet excels in both computational\nefficiency and speech quality across multiple scenarios, making it a promising\nsolution for smart glasses applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
