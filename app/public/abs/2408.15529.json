Our approach replaces the continuous bath\nwith an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we\nfurther relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master\nequation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this\nquasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the\nbath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex\nexponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice\nand thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation\nis not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be\nsimulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the\nspecific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the\nstability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when\nthe global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase\nthe performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both\nbosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over\nconventional pseudomode formulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
