However, it is challenging to understand the complex\ninteractions among its biophysical, social, and economic components. Predictive\nmachine learning (ML), with its capacity to learn from data, is leveraged in\nsustainable agriculture for applications like yield prediction and weather\nforecasting. Nevertheless, it cannot explain causal mechanisms and remains\ndescriptive rather than prescriptive. To address this gap, we propose causal\nML, which merges ML's data processing with causality's ability to reason about\nchange. This facilitates quantifying intervention impacts for evidence-based\ndecision-making and enhances predictive model robustness. We showcase causal ML\nthrough eight diverse applications that benefit stakeholders across the\nagri-food chain, including farmers, policymakers, and researchers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
