We\nbegin by fixing a spheroid in a prolate spheroidal coordinate system, and\nattain the expansion of the scalar Green's function in this space. The\nexpansion is firstly based on spheroidal wave functions, and then we transform\nit into the expansion of spherical wave functions. Next, we average the Green's\nfunction over the orientations of the spheroid to get the averaged transition\noperator. Finally, we calculate the transport mean free path and anisotropy\nfactor for the spheroidal particles group, based on the irreducible vertex in\nthe Bethe-Salpeter equation. The approaches to get the average transition\noperator and the mean free paths in this manuscript will be of benefit to the\nresearch area of multiple scattering by non-spherical particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
