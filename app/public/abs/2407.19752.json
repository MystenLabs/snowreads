Drawing inspiration\nfrom human cognition's ability to recognize objects within their context, we\npropose a dual-context based method.\n  Our model integrates two levels of contextuality: instance-level, where\nnearest-neighbor contexts are utilized for contrastive learning, and\ncluster-level, employing prototypical contrastive learning based on category\nprototypes. The integration of the contextual information effectively improves\nthe feature learning and thereby the classification accuracy of all categories,\nwhich better deals with the real-world datasets. Different from the traditional\nsemi-supervised and novel category discovery techniques, our model focuses on a\nmore realistic and challenging scenario where both known and novel categories\nare present in the unlabeled data. Extensive experimental results on several\nbenchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art.
