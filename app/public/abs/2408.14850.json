This new approach can deal with the case when $f$ is of weaker\nregularity. As a result, we prove that the $C^{1,1}$ modules of the solutions\ndepend only on the Lipschitz modules of $f(x)$, instead of the $\\|f\\|_{C^k}$\nfor some $k\\geq 2$ in all the papers we have known up to now.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
