The\ncluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several\nsupergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one\nyellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average\ngrain-size ($R_{5495} \\sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its\ncore radius is $0.84\\pm0.19$ pc.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
