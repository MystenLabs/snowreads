We develop an algebraic approach to address\nthis question and we use it to derive several necessary and sufficient\nconditions for definability (but unfortunately no condition that is both). The\nmain difference of our results to those from the literature is that our\nconditions are decidable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
