By means\nof perturbation techniques we prove that several properties of the problem with\nno potential are preserved. We also prove continuous dependence of solutions\nwith respect to perturbations. To carry out the analysis a general abstract\nperturbation approach is developed, which broadens the results known in the\nliterature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
