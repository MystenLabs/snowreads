The polynomial algebra $P_k$ is\nconsidered as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, $\\mathcal A$. Let\n$GL_k$ be the general linear group over the field $\\mathbb F_2$. This group\nacts naturally on $P_k$ by matrix substitution. Since the two actions of\n$\\mathcal A$ and $GL_k$ upon $P_k$ commute with each other, there is an inherit\naction of $GL_k$ on $\\mathbb F_2{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal A}P_k$. Denote by $(\\mathbb\nF_2{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal A}P_k)_n^{GL_k}$ the subspace of $\\mathbb\nF_2{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal A}P_k$ consisting of all the $GL_k$-invariant classes of\ndegree $n$. In 1989, Singer [24] defined the homological algebraic transfer\n$$\\varphi_k :\\mbox{Tor}^{\\mathcal A}_{k,k+n}(\\mathbb F_2,\\mathbb F_2)\n\\longrightarrow (\\mathbb F_2{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal A}P_k)_n^{GL_k},$$ where\n$\\mbox{Tor}^{\\mathcal{A}}_{k, k+n}(\\mathbb{F}_2, \\mathbb{F}_2)$ is the dual of\nExt$_{\\mathcal{A}}^{k,k+n}(\\mathbb F_2,\\mathbb F_2)$, the $E_2$ term of the\nAdams spectral sequence of spheres. In general, the transfer $\\varphi_k$ is not\na monomorphism and Singer made a conjecture that $\\varphi_k$ is an epimorphism\nfor any $k \\geqslant 0$. The conjecture is studied by many authors. It is true\nfor $k \\leqslant 3$ but unknown for $k \\geqslant 4$. In this paper, by using a\ntechnique of the Peterson hit problem we prove that Singer's conjecture is not\ntrue for $k=5$ and the internal degree $n = 108$. This result also refutes a\none of Ph\\'uc in [19].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uZ4z-r4gkD519-rc5q_3q4eQyoNzklkIdtGgOniBeM0","pdfSize":"453549"}
