It outlines the\nhistorical evolution of LLMs from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nmodels to their pivotal role in AI. A comparison of fine-tuning methodologies,\nincluding supervised, unsupervised, and instruction-based approaches,\nhighlights their applicability to different tasks. The report introduces a\nstructured seven-stage pipeline for fine-tuning LLMs, spanning data\npreparation, model initialization, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.\nEmphasis is placed on managing imbalanced datasets and optimization techniques.\nParameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Half\nFine-Tuning are explored for balancing computational efficiency with\nperformance. Advanced techniques such as memory fine-tuning, Mixture of Experts\n(MoE), and Mixture of Agents (MoA) are discussed for leveraging specialized\nnetworks and multi-agent collaboration. The report also examines novel\napproaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), which align LLMs with human preferences, alongside pruning\nand routing optimizations to improve efficiency. Further sections cover\nvalidation frameworks, post-deployment monitoring, and inference optimization,\nwith attention to deploying LLMs on distributed and cloud-based platforms.\nEmerging areas such as multimodal LLMs, fine-tuning for audio and speech, and\nchallenges related to scalability, privacy, and accountability are also\naddressed. This report offers actionable insights for researchers and\npractitioners navigating LLM fine-tuning in an evolving landscape.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
