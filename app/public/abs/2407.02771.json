However, this\nsimplification can potentially lead to identifiability issues (lack of\nuniqueness of parameter estimates). Methods have been developed to\nalgebraically and numerically determine the identifiability of a model, as well\nas resolve identifiability issues. This specific type of simplification\npresents an alternate opportunity to instead use this information to resolve\nthe unidentifiability. Given that re-parameterizing, collecting more data, and\nadding inputs can be potentially costly or impractical, this could present new\nalternatives.\n  We present a method for resolving unidentifiability in a system by\nintroducing a new data stream correlated with a parameter of interest. First,\nwe demonstrate how and when non-constant input data can be introduced into any\nrational function ODE system without worsening the model identifiability. Then,\nwe prove when these input functions improve structural and potentially also\npractical identifiability for a given model and relevant data.\n  By utilizing pre-existing data streams, these methods can potentially reduce\nexperimental costs, while still answering key questions. By connecting\nmathematical proofs to application, our framework removes guesswork from when,\nwhere, and how researchers can best introduce new data to improve model\noutcomes.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
