Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the\n(1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still\nabsent. In this letter, we propose to realize the tricritical Ising transition\nwith Rydberg atom arrays, taking advantage of the reconfigurability of these\nsystems. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective\ncorrelation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the\ncorrelation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string\noperator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting.\nHere, we utilize the analog--digital hybrid nature of the Rydberg atom arrays,\nwhich can simulate a physical Hamiltonian and perform a digital quantum circuit\non the same platform, to measure the correlation function of the fermionic\nmode. This hybridized protocol provides an experimentally feasible way to\nreveal the hidden structure of the spacetime SUSY that emerges at the\ntricritical Ising transition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kyihVnnl22XmhdDjUc4wiWDfbOP0mRftHvki_SdiXqU","pdfSize":"1664032"}
