The proposed methods automatically adapt\nnot only to the oracle's noise (in the stochastic setting of the problem) but\nalso to the Holder continuity of the operator without having prior knowledge of\neither the problem class or the nature of the operator information. We analyzed\nthe proposed algorithms in both deterministic and stochastic settings and\nobtained estimates for the required number of iterations to achieve a given\nquality of a solution to the variational inequality. We showed that, without\nknowing the Holder exponent and Holder constant of the operators, the proposed\nalgorithms have the least possible in the worst case sense complexity for the\nconsidered class of variational inequalities. We also compared the resulting\nstochastic algorithm with other popular optimizers for the task of image\nclassification.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vCGbkE7tqEUwt_voRlGx6zJFlREMUeJs7a-aHX_FXUM","pdfSize":"566865"}
