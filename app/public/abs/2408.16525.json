We show precise representation formulas\nand comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we\ncall \"infinitesimally strict concavity\" (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian\nstructures and established here for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the\nassociated distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts\nformula. This treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric\ngeometry expands upon its recent elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth\ncase, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut\nlocus. Two central ingredients our contribution unifies are the localization\nparadigm of Cavalletti-Mondino and the Lorentzian Sobolev calculus of Beran et\nal.\n  In the second part of our work, we present several applications of these\ninsights. First, we show the equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension\ncondition with a Bochner-type inequality. Second, we set up synthetic mean\ncurvature (and barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove volume and area\nestimates of Heintze-Karcher-type, which enable us to show several synthetic\nvolume singularity theorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
