Dani et\nal.\\@ (Inf.\\@ and Comp., 2018) suggested a novel setting in which the amount of\nnoise is unbounded and can significantly exceed the length of the (noise-free)\ncomputation. While no solution is possible in the worst case, under the\nrestriction of oblivious noise, Dani et al.\\@ designed a coding scheme that\nsucceeds with a polynomially small failure probability.\n  We revisit the question of conducting computations under this harsh type of\nnoise and devise a computationally-efficient coding scheme that guarantees the\nsuccess of the computation, except with an exponentially small probability.\nThis higher degree of correctness matches the case of coding schemes with a\nbounded fraction of noise.\n  Our simulation of an $N$-bit noise-free computation in the presence of $T$\ncorruptions, communicates an optimal number of $O(N+T)$ bits and succeeds with\nprobability $1-2^{-\\Omega(N)}$. We design this coding scheme by introducing an\nintermediary noise model, where an oblivious adversary can choose the locations\nof corruptions in a worst-case manner, but the effect of each corruption is\nrandom: the noise either flips the transmission with some probability or\notherwise erases it. This randomized abstraction turns out to be instrumental\nin achieving an optimal coding scheme.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
