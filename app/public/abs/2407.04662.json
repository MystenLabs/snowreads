However, the research on KWS has\ntraditionally focused on new model topologies, putting little emphasis on other\naspects like feature extraction. This paper investigates the use of the\nmultitaper technique to create improved features for KWS. The experimental\nstudy is carried out for different test scenarios, windows and parameters,\ndatasets, and neural networks commonly used in embedded KWS applications.\nExperiment results confirm the advantages of using the proposed improved\nfeatures.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
