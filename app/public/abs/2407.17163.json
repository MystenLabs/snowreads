Developed using\nPyTorch as underlying framework, it implements the top performing\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques for ordinal classification problems.\nOrdinal approaches are designed to leverage the ordering information present in\nthe target variable. Specifically, it includes loss functions, various output\nlayers, dropout techniques, soft labelling methodologies, and other\nclassification strategies, all of which are appropriately designed to\nincorporate the ordinal information. Furthermore, as the performance metrics to\nassess novel proposals in ordinal classification depend on the distance between\ntarget and predicted classes in the ordinal scale, suitable ordinal evaluation\nmetrics are also included. dlordinal is distributed under the BSD-3-Clause\nlicense and is available at https://github.com/ayrna/dlordinal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
