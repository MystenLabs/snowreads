The\nresults show that the most stable structure is a bipyramidal configuration\nformed by a B$_7$ ring coordinated with two metallic atoms, similar to recently\nreported B$_7$M$_2$ analogues. The structural and electronic properties reveal\nremarkable differences between the global minimum and the higher energy\nisomers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
