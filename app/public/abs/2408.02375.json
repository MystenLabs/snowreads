In this\npaper, we calculate a contribution to the electron EDM at three-loop level,\nintroducing the CP-violating Yukawa couplings of new SU(2)$_L$ multiplets. At\ntwo-loop level, the Yukawa interactions generate a CP-violating dimension-six\noperator, composed of three SU(2)$_L$ field strengths, called the electroweak\nWeinberg operator. Another one-loop diagram with the operator inserted induces\nthe electron EDM. We find that even if new SU(2)$_L$ particles have masses\naround TeV-scale, the electron EDM may be larger than the Standard Model\ncontribution to the paramagnetic atom or molecule EDMs. We also discuss the\nrelation between the Barr-Zee diagram contribution at two-loop level and the\nthree-loop one, assuming that the SM Higgs has new Yukawa interactions with the\nSU(2)$_L$ multiplets.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
