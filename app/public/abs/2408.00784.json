The first one is a microscopic\napproach, where the components of the index are modeled individually, and the\nindex price is derived from their combination. The second one is a macroscopic\napproach, where the index is modeled directly. While the microscopic approach\noffers greater flexibility, its calibration results to be more challenging,\nthus leading practitioners to favor the macroscopic approach. However, in the\nmacroscopic model, the lack of explicit futures curve dynamics raises questions\nabout its ability to accurately capture the behavior of the index and its\nsensitivities. In order to investigate this, we calibrate both models using\nderivatives of the S\\&P GSCI Crude Oil excess-return index and compare their\npricing and sensitivities on path-dependent options, such as autocallable\ncontracts. This research provides insights into the suitability of macroscopic\nmodels for pricing and hedging purposes in real scenarios.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
