Automata models over infinite alphabets, such as\nclassical register automata or, equivalently, nominal orbit-finite automata,\ntend to have computationally hard or even undecidable reasoning problems unless\nstringent restrictions are imposed on either the power of control or the number\nof registers. This has been shown to be ameliorated in automata models with\nname allocation such as regular nondeterministic nominal automata, which allow\nfor deciding language inclusion in elementary complexity even with unboundedly\nmany registers while retaining a reasonable level of expressiveness. In the\npresent work, we demonstrate that elementary complexity survives under\nextending the power of control to alternation: We introduce regular alternating\nnominal automata (RANAs), and show that their non-emptiness and inclusion\nproblems have elementary complexity even when the number of registers is\nunbounded. Moreover, we show that RANAs allow for nearly complete\nde-alternation, specifically de-alternation up to a single deadlocked universal\nstate.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
