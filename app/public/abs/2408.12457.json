We rigorously show recursive feasibility and prove practical\nasymptotic stability w.r.t. the approximation accuracy. To this end,\nfinite-data error bounds are employed. The construction of the terminal\nconditions is based on recently derived proportional error bounds to ensure the\nrequired Lyapunov decrease. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed data-driven predictive controller including the design procedure to\nconstruct the terminal region and controller.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
