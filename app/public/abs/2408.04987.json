Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are\nparticularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically\nnontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We\naddress this question by examining a general class of models involving a\ntwo-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions\nfrom the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a\nguaranteed steady state -- a dark state -- with a completely filled lower band\nand an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations\ngoverning the dynamics of the fermion densities over long length and time\nscales. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov\nreaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered\ndark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a\nfinite density of particles in the upper band. Our results suggest that\nnumber-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool\nfor stabilizing dark states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
