We obtain explicit bounds on the relative\nentropy between the conditional Liouville equation and the stochastic\nFokker--Planck equation with an interaction kernel \\(k\\in L^2(\\R^d) \\cap\nL^\\infty(\\R^d)\\), extending far beyond the Lipschitz case. Our method relies on\nreducing the problem to the idiosyncratic setting, which allows us to utilize\nthe exponential law of large numbers by Jabin and Wang~\\cite{JabinWang2018} in\na pathwise manner.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
