Remarkably, it turns out that in both the models,\nbecause of the conservation laws of charge and energy, the exact solutions we\nfind seem to not depend on how we parameterize them, and the charge density of\nthese solutions is related to the charge density of the single field solutions\nfound earlier by a subset of the present authors. In both the models, a\nnonrelativistic reduction of the equations leads to the same conclusion that\nthe solutions are proportional to those found in the one component field case.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
