In\nthis case, in addition to quark loops, it is also necessary to take into\naccount meson loops corresponding to the next order in $1/N_c$. These loops\nmust be taken into account when describing the $\\gamma (W) \\to \\rho$\ntransition, as well as in interaction of mesons in the final state.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
