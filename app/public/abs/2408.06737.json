The study covers various activities, including dataset\ncollection, dataset pre-processing, architecture selection, setup of settings,\nmodel training (fine-tuning), model testing, and implementation. The study\nincludes a comprehensive analysis of different models, with a special focus on\nmultilingual models where the same model is capable of processing social media\nposts in both English and in low-resource languages such as Arabic, Bulgarian,\nDutch, Polish, Czech, Slovak. The results obtained from the study were\nvalidated against state-of-the-art models, and the comparison demonstrated the\nrobustness of the proposed models. The novelty of this work lies in the\ndevelopment of multi-label multilingual classification models that can\nsimultaneously detect harmful posts and posts that contain verifiable factual\nclaims in an efficient way.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zEdR0D8VMjEXZg3_0VSFLYIFWMmXYyDQT0CT20-WrpQ","pdfSize":"834990"}
