It was demonstrated that all generated states depend on two types of\nparameters: some parameters are responsible for Gaussian characteristics, while\nother parameters are responsible for non-Gaussian characteristics. Among all\ngenerated states, we identified those optimally generated in terms of the\ngeneration probability and the magnitude of non-Gaussianity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
