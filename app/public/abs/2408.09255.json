Qualitatively, this is the same as the calculation\nperformed by Gopakumar and Vafa, but we find that the final expression must be\nmodified due to a subtlety with poles induced by non-perturbative physics.\nAccounting for this modification leads to a Gopakumar-Vafa-like formula, which\nwe propose as the exact formulation of the integrating out procedure.\nEvaluating the formula necessarily requires a contour integral in a\ncomplexified Schwinger proper time parameter. We show that this evaluation\nyields the full non-perturbative topological string free energy, and can be\napplied to an arbitrary compact, or non-compact, Calabi-Yau threefold.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ieQMHbkHKrte3XXGs7AAr4dDSGwn1SIbq9jewJnZ92I","pdfSize":"402650"}
