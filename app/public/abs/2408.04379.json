This action supposedly corrects the observed\nabsorption spectrum, leaving the sole atmospheric absorption signature free\nfrom the biases induced by stellar rotation and centre-to-limb variations. We\naim to show that while this practice is beneficial, it does not completely\ncorrect the absorption spectrum from the stellar distortions and that some\nresidual biases remain, leaving a possibly altered atmospheric signature. By\nreducing the problem to its most basic form, we show that dividing the observed\nabsorption spectrum by a synthetic absorption spectrum of the planet does not\nisolate the pure atmospheric absorption signature. We also used simulated\nsynthetic transit observations to assess the magnitude of these residual biases\nin typical transit observations. We show that dividing the observed absorption\nspectrum by the planetary absorption spectrum results in an atmospheric\nsignature modulated by the ratio of the flux behind the atmosphere and the flux\nbehind the planet. Depending on the non-homogeneity of the stellar spectrum,\nthis leads to distorted atmospheric signatures. Eventually, directly analysing\nthese biased signatures will lead to wrong estimates of planetary atmosphere\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
