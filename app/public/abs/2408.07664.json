It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron oscillating\nunder the field is asymmetric with respect to the direction of its forward\nmovement. Since emission of each photon is accompanied by momentum transfer to\nthe electron, such a skew emission leads to the quantum recoil force\ndecelerating the electron. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are\ndiscussed for various electronic systems driven by laser irradiation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O2Nr8ML-vKvLT6JnyK3A95uURald1pRUz0LsR8sXO_s","pdfSize":"197895"}
