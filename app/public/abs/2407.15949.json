In this\npaper, we extend the program by computing the boundary representation of\nmassless fields in an Achucarro-Ortiz black hole spacetime. We obtain analytic\nexpressions for smearing functions in both the exterior and interior of the\nblack hole. We also obtain expressions for Papadodimas-Raju mirror operators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
