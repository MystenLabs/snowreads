Let \\(\\tau(n)\\) denote the total number of divisors of\n\\(n\\), and \\(\\sigma(n)\\) denote the summation of all divisors of \\(n\\). Using\nthese functions, we derive a formula for the number of subgroups in the group\n\\(T_{4n} \\times C_p\\). We then use the computer program GAP to find all\n\\(T_{4n} \\times C_p\\) with exactly \\(|T_{4n} \\times C_p| - t\\) cyclic subgroups\nfor \\(t \\geq 1\\).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
