We assume a dual chiral density wave as an\ninhomogeneous chiral condensate, and obtain the dispersion relations of the\nNambu-Goldstone modes in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase. We use a low\nenergy effective Lagrangian based on the O(4) symmetry which is expanded by the\norder parameter up to the sixth order. The obtained dispersion relations are\nanisotropic and quadratic for the momentum. We evaluate the electron-positron\nproduction rates by charged pion-pair annihilations as functions of an\ninvariant mass using the obtained dispersion relations. Basically, the\nproduction rate in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase has a steeper\noverall slope with respect to an invariant mass than that in the homogeneous\nchiral condensed phase. Also, there may be a possibility that the production\nrate diverges when the invariant mass is just twice the pion mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
