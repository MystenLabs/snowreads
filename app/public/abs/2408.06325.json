We write an explicit reduction resulting from partial\nfractioning the high-multiplicity integrands to a finite basis of topologies at\nany given loop order. We find all of these finite basis topologies at two loops\nin four external dimensions. Their maximal cut and the leading singularity are\nexpressed in terms of the Gram determinant and Baikov polynomial. By performing\nan Integration-By-Parts reduction without any cut constraint on a numerical\nprobe for one of these topologies, we show that the computational complexity\ndrops significantly compared to the Conventional Dimensional Regularization\nscheme. Formally, our work implies an upper bound on the rigidity of special\nfunctions appearing in the iterated integral solutions at each loop order in\nperturbative Quantum Field Theory. Phenomenologically, the integrand-level\nreduction we present will substantially simplify the task of providing\nhigh-precision predictions for future high-multiplicity collider observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
