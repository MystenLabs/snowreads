However, prolonged scanning\ndurations, among other issues, can limit availability and accessibility. In\nthis work, we aim to substantially reduce scan times by leveraging prior scans\nof the same patient. These prior scans typically contain considerable shared\ninformation with the current scan, thereby enabling higher acceleration rates\nwhen appropriately utilized. We propose a prior informed reconstruction method\nwith a trained diffusion model in conjunction with data-consistency steps. Our\nmethod can be trained with unlabeled image data, eliminating the need for a\ndataset of either k-space measurements or paired longitudinal scans as is\nrequired of other learning-based methods. We demonstrate superiority of our\nmethod over previously suggested approaches in effectively utilizing prior\ninformation without over-biasing prior consistency, which we validate on both\nan open-source dataset of healthy patients as well as several longitudinal\ncases of clinical interest.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
