Naturally, industry practitioners play\na decisive role in our collective ability to achieve the goals of RAI.\nUnfortunately, we do not yet have consolidated educational materials and\neffective methodologies for teaching RAI to practitioners. In this paper, we\npropose a novel stakeholder-first educational approach that uses interactive\ncase studies to achieve organizational and practitioner -level engagement and\nadvance learning of RAI. We discuss a partnership with Meta, an international\ntechnology company, to co-develop and deliver RAI workshops to a diverse\naudience within the company. Our assessment results indicate that participants\nfound the workshops engaging and reported a positive shift in understanding and\nmotivation to apply RAI to their work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
