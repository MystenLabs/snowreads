We calculate the absolute and relative\nexcitation functions for $T_{{\\bar c}{\\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production off $^{12}$C\nand $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 30--38\nGeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these\ntarget nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\\circ}$--10$^{\\circ}$ as well\nas the A and momentum dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross\nsections for $T_{{\\bar c}{\\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production at photon energy of 35\nGeV within the adopted scenarios for the $T_{{\\bar c}{\\bar c}}(3875)^-$ meson\nintrinsic structure. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables\nconsidered show a certain sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the\nmeasurement of such observables in future experiments at the proposed\nhigh-luminosity electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC in the US and China in the\nnear-threshold energy region might shed light on the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ internal\nstructure.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
