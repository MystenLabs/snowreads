We introduce an involutive\naugmentation H = (f, g_f) of a measurable function f and relate the IP property\nof H to f-generated reversible Markov kernels. Various examples appeared in the\nliterature are presented as particular cases of the construction. In\nparticular, we prove that the IP property generated by the (reversible) Markov\nkernel of random walk with a reflecting barrier at the origin characterizes\ngeometric-type laws\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ST68of20Qgcnuoc3VZQ45SENLikHyAD6OGO55uP7EAA","pdfSize":"221319"}
