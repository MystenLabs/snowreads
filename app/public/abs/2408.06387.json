The height and rate of global sea-level rise will be about 9.11\ncm and 3.22 mm/a in 2020. Based on the study and the actual land subsidence in\nShanghai Lingang New City, the rate of relative sea-level rise near Lingang New\nCity is calculated to be 12.68 mm/a in 2009. Then, through setting up the\nextrapolation prediction model with a linear trend term and a significant tidal\ncycle, the rise rate of average sea-level near Lingang New City was predicted.\nThe result showed it will be 0.33 mm/a in 2020.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
