For\npolynomials, this establishes a new class of known cases of a conjecture of\nAndrews-Petsche. Together with a result of Ferraguti-Ostafe-Zannier, this\nresult implies that counterexamples to the conjecture, if they exist, are\nsparse. We also prove an auxiliary result on places of periodic reduction for\nrational maps, which may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
