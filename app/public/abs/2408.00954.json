{"id":"2408.00954","title":"Digital capabilities assessment for supporting the transformation of the\n  customer experience","authors":"Munoz Leonardo and Oscar Avila","authorsParsed":[["Leonardo","Munoz",""],["Avila","Oscar",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2024 23:26:48 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-05","timestamp":1722554808000,"abstract":"  Most of organizations are increasingly investing huge amounts of money today\nin order to have the right digital capabilities required for their industry.\nThe area where organisations feel they have made the most progress is in\nimproving the customer experience, which encompasses aspects such as data\nanalytics, social media, location-based marketing, mobile channels among\nothers. This aspect became the most important for the survival of organisations\nsince the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. While much has been achieved, many\norganisations are still not satisfied. One of the major problems in moving\nforward is the lack of literature in both academia and industry on maturity\nmodels allowing organisations to understand their current state in terms of\ndigital capabilities to engage with customers, as well as to plan the\nevolutionary path to improve in this area. To fulfil this lack, this paper\npresents the design and validation of a maturity model that enables\norganizations to assess their digital capabilities in order to improve customer\nexperience and engagement throughout the customer lifecycle.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
