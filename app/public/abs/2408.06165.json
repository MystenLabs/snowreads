We show that, the logarithmic divergent\nterm of the one loop partition function computed using the DHS formula agrees\nwith the heat kernel method. Using the same formula, we also evaluate the one\nloop partition function of scalar field in the near extremal Kerr Newman black\nhole and observe that it reduces to the same in the near horizon $AdS_2\\times\nS^2$ geometry of the extremal Reissner Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole when the\nangular velocity at the horizon is tuned to $2\\pi T_{BH}$ value. We observe\nthat, for higher spin fields, the mode functions become irregular at the\nhorizon for certain quasinormal frequencies and therefore we remove them to\nobtain the one loop determinant.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
