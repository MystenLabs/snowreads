With increasing instrument\ncapabilities, large quantities of high precision optical components are\nrequired to guide, manipulate, and analyze the light from astronomical sources.\nPhotonic integrated circuits (PICs) and fiber-based devices offer enormous\npotential for astronomical instrumentation, as they can reduce the amount of\nbulky free-space optics and pave the way for innovative solutions.\nAstrophotonic devices are particularly interesting for interferometry due to\ntheir compact design on the centimeter scale, even for a large number of\ntelescope inputs. Already, astrophotonic components are integrated in high-end\ninstruments at the VLTI and at the CHARA Array. Photonic beam combiners at\nwavelengths from visible to mid-infrared have been fabricated using\nlithographic techniques or ultrafast-laser inscription, with several components\ntested on-sky. This paper will provide a glimpse into the growing field of\nastrophotonics, its current status and potential for new technologies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
