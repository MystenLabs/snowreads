If\nthe surface is not smooth, the micro discharge probability and spurious pulses\nincrease, which leads to the deterioration in the performance of the detector.\nWe have developed a new method of linseed oil coating for the bakelite based\ndetectors to avoid the surface roughness issue. The detector is characterised\nwith Tetrafluoroethane based gas mixture. The detector is also tested with a\nhigh rate of gamma radiation environment in the lab for the radiation hardness\ntest. The detailed measurement procedure and test results are presented in this\narticle.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
