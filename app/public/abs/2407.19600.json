I don't see how this representation of\nchess data can be used productively. It's unlikely that these vector models\nwill help engines or people choose the best move. But in a purely academic\nsense, it's clear that such methods of information representation capture\nsomething important about the very nature of the game, which doesn't\nnecessarily lead to a win.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1tz2_s5hIdLISK05xT4QePMStz2BIrPUbTcxVcrRgxo","pdfSize":"8576237"}
