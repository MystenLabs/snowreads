A disequality test is a guard that\nprohibits a specified counter value. This reachability problem has been known\nto be NP-hard and in PSPACE, and characterising its computational complexity\nhas been left as a challenging open question by Almagor, Cohen, P\\'erez,\nShirmohammadi, and Worrell (2020). We reduce the complexity gap, placing the\nproblem into the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, namely into the\nclass $\\mathsf{coNP}^{\\mathsf{NP}}$. In the presence of both equality and\ndisequality tests, our upper bound is at the third level,\n$\\mathsf{P}^{\\mathsf{NP}^{\\mathsf{NP}}}$.\n  To prove this result, we show that non-reachability can be witnessed by a\npair of invariants (forward and backward). These invariants are almost\ninductive. They aim to over-approximate only a \"core\" of the reachability set\ninstead of the entire set. The invariants are also leaky: it is possible to\nescape the set. We complement this with separate checks as the leaks can only\noccur in a controlled way.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
