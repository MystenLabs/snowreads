One of the roles expected for\ndomestic robots is caregiving for a human. In particular, we focus on\nrepositioning care because repositioning plays a fundamental role in supporting\nthe health and quality of life of individuals with limited mobility. However,\ngenerating motions of the repositioning care, avoiding applying force to\nnon-target parts and applying appropriate force to target parts, remains\nchallenging. In this study, we proposed a DNN-based architecture using visual\nand somatosensory attention mechanisms that can generate dual-arm repositioning\nmotions which involve different sequential policies of interaction force;\ncontact-less reaching and contact-based assisting motions. We used the humanoid\nrobot Dry-AIREC, which features the capability to adjust joint impedance\ndynamically. In the experiment, the repositioning assistance from the supine\nposition to the sitting position was conducted by Dry-AIREC. The trained model,\nutilizing the proposed architecture, successfully guided the robot's hand to\nthe back of the mannequin without excessive contact force on the mannequin and\nprovided adequate support and appropriate contact for postural adjustment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
