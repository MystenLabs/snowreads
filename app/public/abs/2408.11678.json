Whilst the maximal time of\nexistence is typically characterised by blow-up in the energy norm of\nsolutions, we show instead that solutions exist until blow-up in the larger\nspaces of the variational framework. The result is applied to show that\nsolutions of 2D and 3D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations retain the higher\norder regularity of the initial condition on their time of existence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
