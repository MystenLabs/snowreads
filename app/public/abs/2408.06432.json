BFTBrain adapts to system conditions and application\nneeds by switching between a set of BFT protocols in real-time. Two main\nadvances contribute to BFTBrain's agility and performance. First, BFTBrain is\nbased on a systematic, thorough modeling of metrics that correlate the\nperformance of the studied BFT protocols with varying fault scenarios and\nworkloads. These metrics are fed as features to BFTBrain's RL engine in order\nto choose the best-performing BFT protocols in real-time. Second, BFTBrain\ncoordinates RL in a decentralized manner which is resilient to adversarial data\npollution, where nodes share local metering values and reach the same learning\noutput by consensus. As a result, in addition to providing significant\noperational benefits, BFTBrain improves throughput over fixed protocols by\n$18\\%$ to $119\\%$ under dynamic conditions and outperforms state-of-the-art\nlearning based approaches by $44\\%$ to $154\\%$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ouulavK6oH4i_W-G6hAUYY6OKpL0pMbPaGwlSX5wqac","pdfSize":"2982634"}
