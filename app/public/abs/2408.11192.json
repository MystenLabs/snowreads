We study bright\nsolitary waves with smooth profiles which extend from the limit where the\ndependence of the dispersion coefficient on the wave intensity is negligible to\nthe limit where the solitary wave becomes singular due to vanishing dispersion\ncoefficient. We analyze and numerically explore the stability for such smooth\nsolitary waves, showing with the help of numerical approximations that the\nfamily of solitary waves becomes unstable in the intermediate region between\nthe two limits, while being stable in both limits. This bistability, that has\nalso been observed in other NLS equations with the generalized nonlinearity,\nbrings about interesting dynamical transitions from one stable branch to\nanother stable branch, that are explored in direct numerical simulations of the\nNLS equation with the intensity-dependent dispersion term.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
