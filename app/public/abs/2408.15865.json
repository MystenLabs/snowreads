Single-shot object\ndetectors like YOLO are widely used, however due to their complexity mainly on\nlarger GPU-based platforms. We present microYOLO, which can be used on Cortex-M\nbased microcontrollers, such as the OpenMV H7 R2, achieving about 3.5 FPS when\nclassifying 128x128 RGB images while using less than 800 KB Flash and less than\n350 KB RAM. Furthermore, we share experimental results for three different\nobject detection tasks, analyzing the accuracy of microYOLO on them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
