In this paper, we\ntheoretically reveal a mechanism in Heisenberg spin chains at low temperatures,\nwherein subsystems resist entanglement despite the onset of entangling effects\nin quench scenarios. This mechanism is attributed to destructive interference\namong quasi-particles outside an effective light cone. Furthermore, we\nestablish a necessary condition for the occurrence of the destructive\ninterference phenomenon. We demonstrate that for 1-D power-law decay\ninteractions, specifically those following $|d_{ij}|^{-p}$, destructive\ninterference occurs when $p>2$. As shown through theoretical and numerical\nanalysis, this destructive interference results in an unexpected acceleration\nof entanglement propagation when the interaction range is truncated. This\nprediction is proposed to be observable experimentally in chains of trapped\nions as a direct manifestation of the destructive interference effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3-zptXZGbr425fYKBYIYQNrYgjEuJqLxrMS7JQT25o0","pdfSize":"412307"}
