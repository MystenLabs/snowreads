Our results on multipole moments are compared with the\npredictions of light-cone helicity formalism within SU(3) flavor symmetry, and\nit is observed that the results in both approaches are quite compatible with\neach other. The obtained multipole moments of tensor mesons provide deeper\ninsights into their properties and understanding of the strong and\nelectromagnetic decay channels of these mesons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
