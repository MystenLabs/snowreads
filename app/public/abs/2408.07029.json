This set is\nknown to be finite for any finite permutation group $G$ and $X \\geq 1$. In this\npaper, we give a lower bound for the cases $G=\\text{GL}_2(\\mathbb{F}_\\ell), \\;\n\\text{PGL}_2(\\mathbb{F}_\\ell)$ for primes $\\ell \\geq 13$. We also provide a\nmethod to compute lower bounds for any permutation representations of these\ngroups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
