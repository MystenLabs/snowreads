This study explores the use of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)\nfor autonomous spacecraft control, using the Kerbal Space Program Differential\nGames suite (KSPDG) as a testing environment. Traditional Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) approaches face limitations in this domain due to insufficient\nsimulation capabilities and data. By leveraging LLMs, specifically fine-tuning\nmodels like GPT-3.5 and LLaMA, we demonstrate how these models can effectively\ncontrol spacecraft using language-based inputs and outputs. Our approach\nintegrates real-time mission telemetry into textual prompts processed by the\nLLM, which then generate control actions via an agent. The results open a\ndiscussion about the potential of LLMs for space operations beyond their\nnominal use for text-related tasks. Future work aims to expand this methodology\nto other space control tasks and evaluate the performance of different LLM\nfamilies.
