While the most\nnatural context is extended supersymmetry, where the number of BPS states\nscales as ${\\rm e}^{S_0}$, where $S_0$ is the $T{=}0$ entropy, it is a robust\nfeature that a large gap will appear whenever there is a mechanism producing a\nhigh degree of degeneracy. In random matrix model terms, the phenomenon is\nsimply an extreme case of eigenvalue repulsion in the effective log gas\ndescription. We exhibit several examples for illustration, starting with the\nsimple Wishart model, continuing with extensions of it that incorporate\nmulticritical behaviour allowing for the emergence of gravity, and culminating\nin using such models to non-perturbatively construct ${N}{=}2$ and ${N}{=}4$ JT\nsupergravity theories, the latter of which is new.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
