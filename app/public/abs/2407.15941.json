We propose a\nnovel approach to measure the hadronic cross section $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{had}}$ as\nan alternative to the initial-state radiation and energy scan techniques, which\nrelies on positron annihilation off atomic electrons of a high $Z$ target\n($^{238}$U, $Z=92$). We show that by leveraging the relativistic electron\nvelocities of the inner atomic shells, a high-intensity $12\\,$GeV positron\nbeam, such as the one foreseen at JLab, can allow to measure\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{had}}$ with high statistical accuracy from the two-pion\nthreshold up to above $\\sqrt{s} \\sim 1\\,$GeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
