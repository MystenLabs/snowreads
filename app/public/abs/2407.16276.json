As such, all the uncertainties which could appear should be\nconsidered into an extended model of the plant. After such an uncertain plant\nis formed, an adequate controller which ensures a minimum set of performances\nfor each situation should be computed. As such, the continuous-time robust\ncontrol paradigm is suitable for such scenarios. However, the problem is\ngenerally solved only for linear and time invariant plants. The main focus of\nthe current paper is to include m-link serial surgical robots into Robust\nControl Framework by considering all nonlinearities as uncertainties. Moreover,\nthe paper studies an incipient problem of numerical implementation of such\ncontrol structures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
