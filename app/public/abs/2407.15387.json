Achieving quantum control of\nsingle-phonons in these devices has so far relied on nonlinearities enabled by\ncoupling to ancillary qubits. In this work, we propose using atomic forces to\nrealize a silicon nanomechanical qubit without coupling to an ancillary qubit.\nThe proposed qubit operates at 60 MHz with a single-phonon level anharmonicity\nof 5 MHz. We present a circuit quantum acoustodynamics architecture where\nelectromechanical resonators enable dispersive state readout and multi-qubit\noperations. The combination of strong anharmonicity, ultrahigh mechanical\nquality factors, and small footprints achievable in this platform could enable\nquantum-nonlinear phononics for quantum information processing and\ntransduction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
