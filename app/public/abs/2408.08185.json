To mitigate this, we\npresent a data-driven system identification framework that derives models in\nthe port-Hamiltonian (pH) formulation. This formulation is suitable for\nmulti-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoretical\nproperties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear and\nnonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification.\nIn this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinear\nsystems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i)\nnonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensional\nlatent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pH\nproperties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neural\nnetwork. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matrices\nthrough Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinate\ntransformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization process\nto match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system in\nthe latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe even\nnonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size. The method\nis exemplified by a parametric mass-spring-damper and a nonlinear pendulum\nexample, as well as the high-dimensional model of a disc brake with linear\nthermoelastic behavior.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
