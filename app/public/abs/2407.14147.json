This bound was derived in a classical context, and\ncan be violated in the quantum regime due to coherent effects. However, the\nprecise connection between KUR violations and quantum coherence has so far\nremained elusive, despite significant investigation. In this work, we solve\nthis problem by deriving a modified bound that exactly pinpoints how, and when,\ncoherence might lead to KUR violations. Our bound is sensitive to the specific\nkind of unraveling of the quantum master equation. It therefore allows one to\ncompare quantum jumps and quantum diffusion, and understand, in each case, how\nquantum coherence affects fluctuations. We illustrate our result on a double\nquantum dot, where the electron current is monitored either by electron jump\ndetection or with continuous diffusive charge measurement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cZs-vTUIq2XHme_foP9Km6Uvy2jJ0yeQMoSA6xLF8OE","pdfSize":"960520","objectId":"0x1ea8ed1fd59aa34fe851c03b16d32031fd9cac92984cb3ac6a00351e94525842","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
