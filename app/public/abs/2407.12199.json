We extend this definition to infinite\nGelfand--Tsetlin schemes, which in turn parameterize elements of the\nGelfand--Tsetlin basis of an irreducible representation of an\ninfinite-dimensional complete linear group. Using the properties of colimits of\nrepresentations with the highest weight, we present an explicit form of the\nGelfand--Tsetlin basis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
