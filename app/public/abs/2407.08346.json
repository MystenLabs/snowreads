In\nparticular, we treat the Cauchy problem on the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation\nunder the compressible Euler scaling in case of three-dimensional whole space.\nUp to a finite time we construct the Boltzmann solution around a local\nMaxwellian corresponding to small-amplitude classical solutions of the full\ncompressible Euler system around constant states. We design a new energy\nfunctional which can capture the convergence rate in the small Knudsen number\n$\\varepsilon$ and allow the microscopic part of solutions to decay polynomially\nin large velocities. Moreover, the energy norm of perturbations can be of the\norder $\\varepsilon^{1/2}$ which the usual method of Hilbert expansion fails to\nobtain. As a byproduct of the proof, our estimates immediately yield a\nglobal-in-time existence result when the Euler solutions are taken to be\nconstant states.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
