Sheehy's\nsubdivision-Rips bifiltration $\\mathcal{SR}(-)$ is a density-sensitive\nrefinement that is robust to outliers in a strong sense, but whose 0-skeleton\nhas exponential size. For $X$ a finite metric space of constant doubling\ndimension and fixed $\\epsilon>0$, we construct a $(1+\\epsilon)$-homotopy\ninterleaving approximation of $\\mathcal{SR}(X)$ whose $k$-skeleton has size\n$O(|X|^{k+2})$. For $k\\geq 1$ constant, the $k$-skeleton can be computed in\ntime $O(|X|^{k+3})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WhgFf92d3gDAClPvpR8NVzLRdHzVD-WpH12leQxUhlI","pdfSize":"305820"}
