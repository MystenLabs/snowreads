Our method also\nyields an analogous result for rank-one CAT(0) groups and hierarchically\nhyperbolic groups with Morse elements. Finally, we prove that Morse elements\nare generic in every Cayley graph of groups that are quasi-isometric to\n(well-behaved) hierarchically hyperbolic groups. This gives a quasi-isometry\ninvariant theory of counting group elements in groups beyond relatively\nhyperbolic groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
