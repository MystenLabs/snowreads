It is a fast-slow phenomenon characterized by a recurrent sequence of\nfast transitions between distinct and slowly evolving quasi-stationary states.\nIn this letter, we uncover the dynamical mechanisms behind CC, using an\nillustrative example of globally and adaptively coupled semiconductor lasers,\nwhere CC represents sequential switching on and off the lasers. Firstly, we\nshow that CC is a robust and truly adaptive network effect that is scalable\nwith network size and does not occur without adaptation. Secondly, we uncover\nmultiple saddle slow manifolds (unstable quasi-stationary states) linked by\nheteroclinic orbits (fast transitions) in the phase space of the system. This\nallows us to identify CC with a novel heteroclinic canard orbit that organises\ndifferent unstable quasi-stationary states into an intricate fast-slow limit\ncycle. Although individual quasi-stationary states are unstable (saddles), the\nCC cycle as a whole is attractive and robust to parameter changes.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
