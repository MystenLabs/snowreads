These techniques have been actively developed over the past\nfew decades. By combining insights from GPU benchmarking to understand\napplication power profiles, we present a telemetry data-driven approach for\nderiving energy savings projections. This approach has been demonstrably\napplied to the Frontier supercomputer at scale. Our findings based on three\nmonths of telemetry data indicate that, for certain resource-constrained jobs,\nsignificant energy savings (up to 8.5%) can be achieved without compromising\nperformance. This translates to a substantial cost reduction, equivalent to\n1438 MWh of energy saved. The key contribution of this work lies in the\nmethodology for establishing an upper limit for these best-case scenarios and\nits successful application. This work sheds light on potential energy savings\nand empowers HPC professionals to optimize the power-performance trade-off\nwithin constrained power budgets, not only for the exascale era but also\nbeyond.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
