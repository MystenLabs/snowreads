We consider an interacting\ntwo-site Kitaev chain coupled to a single-mode cavity and show that the sweet\nspot condition can be controlled with the cavity frequency and the hopping\nbetween sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that photon-mediated effective\ninteractions can be used to screen intrinsic interactions, improving the\noriginal quality of the MBS. We describe experimental signatures in the cavity\ntransmission to detect their presence and quality. Our work proposes a new way\nto tune poor man's MBS in a quantum dot array coupled to a cavity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
