When applying this method to fractional Brownian motion\nand the solutions of some stochastic differential equations driven by it, we\ntheoretically proved that the $L_2$ errors converge to 0, and we further\ndiscussed the scope of the method. With the frequency of discrete observations\ntending to infinity, the predictions based on discrete observations converge to\nthe predictions based on continuous observations, which implies that we can\nmake approximations by the method. We apply the method to the fractional\nBrownian motion and the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as examples.\nComparing the results with the theoretical optimal predictions and taking the\nmean square error as a measure, the numerical simulations demonstrate that the\nmethod can generate accurate results. We also analyze the impact of factors\nsuch as prediction period, Hurst index, etc. on the accuracy.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
