A novel Plus One Adder design is proposed as an incremental adder\nin the RCA chain, incorporating a Full Adder with an excess 1 alongside inputs\nA, B, and Cin. The design approximates outputs to 2 bit values to reduce\nhardware complexity and improve resource efficiency. The Plus One Adder is\nintegrated into a dynamically reconfigurable HOAA, allowing runtime\ninterchangeability between accurate and approximate overestimation modes. The\nproposed design is demonstrated for multiple applications, such as Twos\ncomplement subtraction and Rounding to even, and the Configurable Activation\nfunction, which are critical components of the Processing engine. Our approach\nshows 21 percent improvement in area efficiency and 33 percent reduction in\npower consumption, compared to state of the art designs with minimal accuracy\nloss. Thus, the proposed HOAA could be a promising solution for\nresource-constrained environments, offering ideal trade-offs between hardware\nefficiency vs computational accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OUaQ7tprJ3BtsB8ib4NRrxdpjjtgULneWXHd4AXox2U","pdfSize":"433537"}
