To address these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised\napproach for KIE with Class-Rebalancing and Merged Semantic Pseudo-Labeling\n(CRMSP). Firstly, the Class-Rebalancing Pseudo-Labeling (CRP) module introduces\na reweighting factor to rebalance pseudo-labels, increasing attention to tail\nclasses. Secondly, we propose the Merged Semantic Pseudo-Labeling (MSP) module\nto cluster tail features of unlabeled data by assigning samples to Merged\nPrototypes (MP). Additionally, we designed a new contrastive loss specifically\nfor MSP. Extensive experimental results on three well-known benchmarks\ndemonstrate that CRMSP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, CRMSP\nachieves 3.24% f1-score improvement over state-of-the-art on the CORD.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
