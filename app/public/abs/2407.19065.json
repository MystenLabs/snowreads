However, cooking often requires\nmultitasking between cooking tasks and following instructions, which can be\nchallenging to cooks with vision impairments if recipes or other instructions\nare inaccessible. To explore the practices and challenges of recipe access\nwhile cooking, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 people with\nvision impairments who have cooking experience and four cooking instructors at\na vision rehabilitation center. We also asked participants to edit and give\nfeedback on existing recipes. We revealed unique practices and challenges to\naccessing recipe information at different cooking stages, such as the heavy\nburden of hand-washing to interact with recipe readers. We also presented the\npreferred information representation and structure of recipes. We then\nhighlighted design features of technological supports that could facilitate the\ndevelopment of more accessible kitchen technologies for recipe access. Our work\ncontributes nuanced insights and design guidelines to enhance recipe\naccessibility for people with vision impairments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"izpPCEdH83eDzpGnfvmOj6hTC5nA9FCJVE_RcqrYTj8","pdfSize":"1370045"}
