In particular, we show the relation between the kinematic\ncharacteristics of timelike congruences (observers) and the existence of\nfoliations orthogonal to them. We then explore how local Lorentz\ntransformations acting on observers affect the existence of transversal\nfoliations, provide examples and discuss about the implications of these\nresults for the 3+1 formulation of tetrad modified theories of gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
