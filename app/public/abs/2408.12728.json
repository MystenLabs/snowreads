Nowadays, these changes are shaping the new\npost-pandemic environments and continue to impact software teams. In this\ncontext, our study explores the characteristics and challenges of remote\ncommunication between software developers and software testers. We investigated\nhow these professionals have adapted to the unique circumstances imposed by\nCOVID-19, especially because many of them have now become permanent in the\nsoftware industry. In this process, we explored their communication practices\nand interaction dynamics and how they potentially affect software evolution and\nquality. Our findings reveal that the transition to remote and hybrid work has\nresulted in notable changes in communication patterns and task coordination,\nwhich could potentially affect the overall quality of project deliverables.\nAdditionally, we highlight the importance of adapting existing workflows,\nintroducing new management practices, and investing in technology to facilitate\nremote interaction among developers and testers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UN5cwjV8zVi8Nj9R2qSjajaC2LuBOPUh7s0N7fUADRI","pdfSize":"117591"}
