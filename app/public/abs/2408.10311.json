However, its applicability is limited due to the requirement of\nparticle-number conservation after Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. In\ngoing beyond the conventional DQMC, one encouraging development occurred when\nMajorana fermions were introduced for QMC [1,2]. But in previous Majorana-based\nQMC, Boltzmann weight is determined often with a sign ambiguity. Here we\nsuccessfully resolved this ambiguity by deriving a closed-form Pfaffian formula\nfor the weight, enabling efficient calculation of the weight with its sign in\npolynomial time. We call it ''Pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo'' (PfQMC), which can\nbe applied to generic interacting fermion models. We have successfully employed\nPfQMC to explore how robust Majorana edge modes in Kitaev chain are against\nstrong interactions. By offering greater flexibility, PfQMC can potentially\nenhance existing sign-mitigating and approximation methods and help address\nchallenging issues such as the ground-state properties of the doped Hubbard\nmodel.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
