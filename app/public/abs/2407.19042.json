The perturbative triples correction to CCSD, CCSD(T),\nconstitutes an important component of all high-accuracy composite model\nchemistries that obtain this accuracy, but can be a roadblock in the\ncalculation of medium to large systems due to its $\\mathcal{O}(N^7)$ scaling,\nparticularly in HEAT-like model chemistries that eschew separation of core and\nvalance correlation. This study extends the work of Lesiuk [J. Chem. Phys. 156,\n064103 (2022)] with new approximate methods and assesses the accuracy of five\ndifferent approximations of (T) in the context of a subset of molecules\nselected from the W4-17 dataset. It is demonstrated that all of these\napproximate methods can achieve sub-0.1 kJ mol${}^{-1}$ accuracy with respect\nto canonical, density-fitted (T) contributions with a modest number of\nprojectors. The approximation labeled $\\tilde{Z}T$ appears to offer the best\ntrade-off between cost and accuracy and shows significant promise in an\norder-of-magnitude reduction in the computational cost of the CCSD(T) component\nof high-accuracy model chemistries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
