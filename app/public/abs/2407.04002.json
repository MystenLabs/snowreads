The identification and the meaning of these thermodynamic coordinates\ndepend on the gravity theory under consideration. For example, the existence of\ndimensionful coupling constants, such as the cosmological constant, changes the\nscaling properties of the theory, its solutions, and the laws of\nthermodynamics. Here we show, using the background Killing charge method which\napplies to any gravity theory, how the thermodynamics of black holes such as\nthe $D$ dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes in cosmological Einstein's theory and\nthe spherically symmetric black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory\nchanges. We give the effective volume of black holes which are regular in every\ndimension even in the absence of a cosmological constant. The methods applied\nhere can be used in any geometric theory of gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
