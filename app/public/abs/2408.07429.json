The weak dependence condition for arrays of random fields is\nproved to be inherited through transformation and infinite shift. This paves a\nway to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood\nestimation for dynamic spatio-temporal models (i.e. so-called ultra\nhigh-dimensional time series models) when the sample size and/or dimension go\nto infinity. Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network\nautoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
