One description, provided by the Hamiltonian dynamics of the full\ntransmitter/receiver optical system, incurs an exponential cost in transmitter\nintensity for a given estimation sensitivity but is linearly improved with the\nintensity of the thermal background. The other description, based on optical\nquantum circuits, exhibits sensitivity around a factor of 1/2 of the optimal\nentanglement-assisted scheme, but incurs an inverse linear reduction in\nsensitivity with increasing thermal background. The results have applications\nfor the design of optically active receivers based on combining echo-seeded\nspontaneous parametric downconversion and induced coherence due to photon\nindistinguishability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V8odQKyxhzcM0FU1gSM6jw-vzMGlFXoKe471uIrxlOk","pdfSize":"559056"}
