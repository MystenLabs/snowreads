Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 235204 (2024)], a\ncandidate Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\\'olya Conjecture was introduced. Here,\nwe elegantly demonstrate that the corresponding eigenfunctions are\nsquare-integrable and, crucially, that the eigenvalues are real. The latter\nrepresents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
