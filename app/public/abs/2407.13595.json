Our model consists of an inert doublet\nscalar, a dark singlet scalar $S$, a spurion scalar $\\varphi$ and right-handed\nneutrinos beyond the Standard Model (SM), which transform nontrivially under\n$Z_4$. Once the $Z_4$ symmetry is broken to $Z_2$ by the VEV of $\\varphi$, much\nbelow the mass scale of the singlet scalar $S$, a small quartic coupling\nbetween SM Higgs and inert doublets, which violates both $Z_4$ and lepton\nnumber, is generated at tree level, so small neutrino masses are obtained at\none-loops. We discuss the consistent parameter space for neutrino masses,\ndirect detection and thermal leptogenesis in the model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
