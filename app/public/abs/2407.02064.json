Rev. C93.014001\n(2016)]. An important prerequisite for including these three-body forces in\nfew- and many-body calculations is the accuracy and efficiency of their\npartial-wave decomposition. A careful benchmark of the {\\Lambda}NN potential\nmatrix elements, computed using two robust and efficient partial-wave\ndecomposition methods, is presented. In addition, results of a first\nquantitative assessment for the contributions of $\\Lambda$NN forces to the\nseparation energies in A=3-5 hypernuclei are reported.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZeiKMpo52HMSo2KdLzR0cxrH0ie2mXFU9zBhj_DCauQ","pdfSize":"604798"}
