Historically,\nthis numerical technique has been limited to situations in which the inclusions\n(particles) can be covered by nonoverlapping disks in two dimensions or spheres\nin three dimensions. This allows for the use of separation of variables in\ncylindrical or spherical coordinates to represent the solution to the governing\npartial differential equation. Here, we provide a more flexible approach,\napplicable to a much larger class of geometries. We use a Green's\nrepresentation formula and the associated layer potentials to construct\nincoming and outgoing solutions on rectangular enclosures. The performance and\nflexibility of the resulting scattering operator formulation in two-dimensions\nis demonstrated via several numerical examples for multi-particle scattering in\nfree space as well as in layered media. The mathematical formalism extends\ndirectly to the three dimensional case as well, and can easily be coupled with\nseveral commercial numerical PDE software packages.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
