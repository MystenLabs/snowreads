The existing results on the\nproblem suggest that the weak solution will blow up in finite time if\n$I(u_0)<0$ and the initial energy satisfies some appropriate assumptions, here\n$I(u_0)$ is the initial Nehari functional. In this paper, we extend the\nprevious blow-up conditions with proving that those assumptions on the energy\nfunctional are superfluous and only $I(u_0)<0$ is sufficient to ensure the weak\nsolution blowing up in finite time. Our conclusion depicts the significant\ninfluence of mass conservation on the dynamic behavior of solution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
