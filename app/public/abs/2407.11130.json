A prime example is the\nmodular commutator, which can extract a topological invariant from a single\nwave function. Here, we unveil novel geometric properties of many-body\nentanglement via a modular commutator of two-dimensional gapped quantum\nmany-body systems. We obtain the geometric additivity of a modular commutator,\nindicating that modular commutator for a multipartite system may be an integer\nmultiple of the one for tripartite systems. Using our additivity formula, we\nalso derive a curious identity for the modular commutators involving\ndisconnected intervals in a certain class of conformal field theories. We\nfurther illustrate this geometric additivity for both bulk and edge subsystems\nusing numerical calculations of the Haldane and $\\pi$-flux models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XbKFOd50IMzG5F3zA1zt9XV2O29M7HBVnF6AFFOOlUY","pdfSize":"1310411","objectId":"0xde79a493ba5b9a88831348da1e2f6985851b5c585f9dee0548e686397e0c5430","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
