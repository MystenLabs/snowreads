For the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^r\\mathbb{Z}$, $p$ a prime and\n$r\\in\\mathbb{N}$ we obtain closed formulae for all heights. These may be\ninterpreted as formulae for the numbers of certain relations in quotients of\nthe modular group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
