This work explains why these\nGLEs provide solutions suitable for MOR by showing that the image set of the\nsolutions of the two GLEs always encloses the reachable and observable set of a\nsuitably defined switched system with the same input to output map of the\nswitched DAE system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
