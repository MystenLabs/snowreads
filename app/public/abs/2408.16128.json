For a thermal state with mean occupation $\\bar{n}\\gg 1$ the\nmethod attains a reduction to 0.632 of the initial thermal oscillator\noccupation for two repumps of the two-level spin state. This is within a factor\nof 2.53 of the optimum that might be expected due to the reduction of the\noscillator entropy by $2 \\ln(2)$. We show that the method, which is based on\nencoding the value of the modular-variable of the oscillator into the spin, has\na simple semi-classical description in terms of a Bayesian update. We\ndemonstrate the method experimentally using the internal and motional states of\na single trapped ion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wCZjHXhlRuDX-USMXDXiK8fMIl0OBdz7NHwzTT-RuKs","pdfSize":"1031724"}
