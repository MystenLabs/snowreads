The CHF has no closed form expression, but instead is\nmost commonly expressed as an infinite sum of ratios of rising factorials,\nwhich makes its precise and efficient calculation challenging. It is a function\nof three parameters, the first two being the rising factorial base of the\nnumerator and denominator, and the third being a scale parameter. Accurate and\nefficient calculation for large values of the scale parameter is particularly\nchallenging due to numeric underflow and overflow which easily occur when\nsumming the underlying component terms. This work presents an elegant and\nprecise mathematical algorithm for the calculation of the CHF, which is of\nparticular advantage for large values of the scale parameter. This method\nmassively reduces the number and range of component terms which need to be\nsummed to achieve any required precision, thus obviating the need for the\ncomputationally intensive transformations needed by current algorithms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"NAxOW86b1TkqJDgGVMw-NaCHSo3jHb3wh0Jr_gR1WMY","pdfSize":"1344895"}
