Typical kinds of such partial\norders are the total, stratified and interval orders. In this paper, we\nintroduce quasi-stratified orders - positioned in-between the stratified and\ninterval orders - which are tailored for transaction-like or hierarchical\nconcurrent executions.\n  Dealing directly with the vast number of executions of concurrent system is\nfar from being practical. It was realised long time ago that it can be much\nmore effective to consider behaviours at a more abstract level of behavioural\nspecifications (often based on intrinsic relationships between events such as\nthose represented by causal partial orders), each such specification -\ntypically, a relational structure - encompassing a (large) number of\nexecutions.\n  In this paper, we introduce and investigate suitable specifications for\nbehaviours represented by quasi-stratified orders. The proposed model of\nquasi-stratified relational structures is based on two relationships between\nevents - the 'before' and 'not later' relationships - which can be used to\nexpress and analyse causality, independence, and simultaneity between events.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
