Under the two-bubble energy\nthreshold assumption on the initial data, we prove the dichotomy that every\nsolution converges uniformly, in terms of relative error, to either a steady\nstate or a blowing-up bubble.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
