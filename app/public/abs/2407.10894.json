The goal of this note is to formulate a conjectural\ncharacterization of the subvarieties of $S \\times\\mathbb{P}^N$ containing a\nZariski-dense set of preperiodic points, where the parameter space $S$ is a\nquasiprojective complex algebraic variety; the characterization is given in\nterms of the non-vanishing of a power of the invariant Green current associated\nto the family of maps. This conjectural characterization is inspired by and\ngeneralizes the Relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture for families of abelian\nvarieties, recently proved by Gao and Habegger, and it includes as special\ncases the Manin-Mumford Conjecture (theorem of Raynaud) and the Dynamical\nManin-Mumford Conjecture (posed by Ghioca, Tucker, and Zhang). We provide\nexamples where the equivalence is known to hold, and we show that several\nrecent results can be viewed as special cases. Finally, we give the proof of\none implication in the conjectural characterization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
