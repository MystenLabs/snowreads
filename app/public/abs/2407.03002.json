We prove that $h_n(v)$ has a pole at\n$v=\\frac{1}{n}$ if and only if $n$ is a sum of two squares of integers.\nMoreover, if $r_2(n)=\\#\\{(a,b)\\in \\mathbb Z^2: a^2+b^2=n\\}$, then we derive the\nformula $$ \\underset{v=1/n}{\\mathrm{Res}}h_n(v)=\\frac{(-1)^{n-1}r_2(n)}{n16^n}.\n$$ The results are then generalized to arbitrary modular forms with respect to\n$\\Gamma(2)$ and as a consequence we obtain a new criterion for Lehmer's\nconjecture for Ramanujan's $\\tau$-function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
