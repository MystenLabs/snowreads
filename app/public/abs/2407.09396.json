These models\nexhibit an expansion using chord diagrams, which can be solved by combinatorial\nmethods. We describe exact results in these models, including their spectrum,\ncorrelation functions, and Lyapunov exponent. In a certain limit, these\ntechniques manifest the relation to the Schwarzian quantum mechanics, a theory\nof quantum gravity in $AdS_2$. More generally, the theory is controlled by a\nrigid algebraic structure of a quantum group, suggesting a theory of quantum\ngravity on non-commutative $q$-deformed $AdS_2$. We conclude with discussion of\nrelated universality classes, and survey some of the current research\ndirections.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lRlH-u3tNWMwwxNFa_-zU7tPlFqbgmkO8KdXcSZ7RNk","pdfSize":"1273036"}
