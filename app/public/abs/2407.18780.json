These measurements were conducted in runaway\nelectron scenarios and in the presence of Electron Cyclotron Current Drive.\nMeasured intensities of linearly polarised X- and O-mode radiation from fast\nelectrons allow the analysis of the energy distribution. The measurements were\nmade possible through the creation of an operational regime for the diagnostic\nthat is free of thermal background radiation, in relaxed electron density\noperations. This operational regime notably enables the cross-calibration of\nthe diagnostic system, relying on thermal plasma measurements and modeling with\nthe ray-tracing code SPECE.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
