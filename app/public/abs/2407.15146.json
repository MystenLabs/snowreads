B. Crittenden and C. L. Vanden Eynden\\cite{CV1970} proved that\nany system of $n$ congruence classes covering positive integers $1,2,... 2^n$\ncovers all integers, which was originally conjectured by P.\nErd\\H{o}s\\cite{Erdos1962} in 1962, who first proved a weaker version of this\nconjecture, replacing $2^n$ with $C(n)$, where $C(n)$ is a constant determined\nby $n$. The constant $2^n$ here cannot be improved, since one can find $n$\ncongruences covering any given $2^n$ consecutive integers with any one given\nexception among them exactly. In 2019, P. Balister, B. Bollob\\'as, R. Morris,\nJ. Sahasrabudhe and M. Tiba\\cite{BBST2020} gave a simpler proof of this\nconjecture also by the proof by contradiction,including constructing polymials\nusing parameters from the counter-example congruences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
