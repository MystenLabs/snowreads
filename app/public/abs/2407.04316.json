It is the dS\ncounterpart of the AdS Janus deformation and interpolates two asymptotically dS\nspaces in the far past and the far future with a single deformation parameter.\nThe Penrose diagram can be elongated along the time direction indefinitely as\nthe deformation becomes large. After studying the classical properties of the\ngeometry such as the area theorem and the fluctuation by a matter field, we\nexplore the algebraic structure of the field operators on the deformed\nspacetime. We argue that the algebra is a von Neumann factor of type\nII$_\\infty$ for small deformations, but there occurs a transition to type\nI$_\\infty$ as the deformation increases so that the neck region of the deformed\nspace becomes a Lorentzian cylinder.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
