For its high nutritional value\non the one hand, and because it is an adequate species for insects in\ncontrolled environmental agriculture systems, on the other. Therefore, several\nmodels describing this larvae's behaviour have been developed in the\nliterature. Due to the complex nature of living organisms, systems of\ncontrolled environment agriculture are characterised by their strong\nnonlinearities. In this paper, we present a three dimensional nonlinear model\ndescribing the black soldier fly dry biomass weight dynamic changes due to the\ntemperature's influence. In practice, this biomass weight is not measured in\nreal time. This becomes problematic for applying feedback control strategies\nthat assume full information of the states. Thus, this work investigates the\nobservability of the dry biomass of a Hermetia illucens farming batch. The\ninstantaneous and global observability of the aforementioned model is proven by\nconstructing an injective transformation between the state space and a higher\ndimensional space where the transformed states are observable.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
