For the first\ntime, we derive bounds on the axion-photon coupling from polarization\nmeasurements of GRB 221009A, performing a full calculation of the Stokes\nparameters, as it is typically done in the astrophysics community. Within\nastrophysical uncertainties, our limits on the axion-photon coupling are\ncompetitive with complementary probes in the axion mass range $10^{-9}$ eV\n$\\lesssim m_a \\lesssim 10^{-8}$ eV, further allowing to probe motivated\nparameter space of ALP dark matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
