Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for\npreserving privacy, enabling private data to remain on local IIoT clients while\ncooperatively training models to detect network anomalies. However, both\nsynchronous and asynchronous FL architectures exhibit limitations, particularly\nwhen dealing with clients with varying speeds due to data heterogeneity and\nresource constraints. Synchronous architecture suffers from straggler effects,\nwhile asynchronous methods encounter communication bottlenecks. Additionally,\nFL models are prone to adversarial inference attacks aimed at disclosing\nprivate training data. To address these challenges, we propose a Buffered FL\n(BFL) framework empowered by homomorphic encryption for anomaly detection in\nheterogeneous IIoT environments. BFL utilizes a novel weighted average time\napproach to mitigate both straggler effects and communication bottlenecks,\nensuring fairness between clients with varying processing speeds through\ncollaboration with a buffer-based server. The performance results, derived from\ntwo datasets, show the superiority of BFL compared to state-of-the-art FL\nmethods, demonstrating improved accuracy and convergence speed while enhancing\nprivacy preservation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
