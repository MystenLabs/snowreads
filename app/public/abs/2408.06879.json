However, the relationship\nbetween the density dependence of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and\nforce-controlled ordered structure remains poorly understood. In this study, we\nmeasured contraction-driven flow generation by varying the concentration of\ncell extracts containing the actomyosin cytoskeleton and associated nucleation\nfactors. We observed continuous actin flow toward the center at a critical\nactomyosin density in cell-sized droplets. Notably, the actin flow demonstrated\nemergent oscillations, in which tracer advection periodically changed in a\nstop-and-go fashion in bulk solution. Near the onset of flow, the viscous drag\nof the actin cytoskeleton decreased the particle transport, after which it\nrapidly increased. These results indicate that the density-dependent actin flow\nis generated by a balance between viscous friction and contractile force.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
