By transitioning from\nparamagnetic to nonmagnetic states below 90 K, we clarified this behavior\nthrough combined nuclear magnetic resonance and low-temperature X-ray\ndiffraction studies, pointing to charge disproportionation as the driving\nforce. Subsequent investigations via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nand first-principles calculations have disclosed topologically flat bands,\nconfirming advanced electronic characteristics in Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. These\ndiscoveries not only deepen our comprehension of Mott insulators but also\nbroaden our grasp of the dynamic interrelations among topology, electron\ninteractions, and quantum phenomena in two-dimensional systems. The research on\nNb$_3$Cl$_8$ thus lays foundational knowledge for advancing the exploration of\nquantum states in complex material systems, marking it as a critical model in\nthe ongoing evolution of condensed matter physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
