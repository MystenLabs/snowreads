The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nstreamlined document coding, enabling simple automatic text labeling with\nvarious schemes. This has the potential to make color-coding more accessible\nand benefit more users. However, the impact of color choice on information\nseeking is understudied. We conducted a user study assessing various color\nschemes' effectiveness in LLM-coded text documents, standardizing contrast\nratios to approximately 5.55:1 across schemes. Participants performed timed\ninformation-seeking tasks in color-coded scholarly abstracts. Results showed\nnon-analogous and yellow-inclusive color schemes improved performance, with the\nlatter also being more preferred by participants. These findings can inform\nbetter color scheme choices for text annotation. As LLMs advance document\ncoding, we advocate for more research focusing on the \"color\" aspect of\ncolor-coding techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
