For in-the-wild inputs, the\nresearch community has predominantly relied on a single training set of\nsemi-synthetic nature. This paper suggest the combination of different flavors\nof synthetic data in order to achieve better generalization to natural images.\nMoreover, additional expansion of the data volume using traditional\nout-of-plane rotation synthesis is considered. Together with a novel\ncombination of losses and a network architecture with a standard\nfeature-extractor, a competitive model is obtained, both in accuracy and\nefficiency, which allows full 6 DoF pose estimation in practical real-time\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
