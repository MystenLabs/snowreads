After introducing these concepts we will first\nconsider adaptations of CAD inspired by computational logic, in particular the\nalgorithms which underpin modern SAT solvers. CAD theory has found use in\ncollaboration with these via the Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) paradigm;\nwhile the ideas behind SAT/SMT have led to new algorithms for Real QE. Second\nwe will consider the optimisation of CAD through the use of Machine Learning\n(ML). The choice of CAD variable ordering has become a key case study for the\nuse of ML to tune algorithms in computer algebra. We will also consider how\nexplainable AI techniques might give insight for improved computer algebra\nsoftware without any reliance on ML in the final code.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a1OhfKMR_D4puXJ-GVQq_4kzwXfT1ntc7Jy89MhJrlE","pdfSize":"1133573"}
