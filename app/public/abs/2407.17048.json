AI will either increase systemic financial risk or act to\nstabilise the system, depending on endogenous responses, strategic\ncomplementarities, the severity of events it faces and the objectives it is\ngiven. AI's ability to master complexity and respond rapidly to shocks means\nfuture crises will likely be more intense than those we have seen so far.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ug7f8VsJes8Vs5t6ruFY0s5Ub58g1nqy6BiJZJ-6cXs","pdfSize":"203250"}
