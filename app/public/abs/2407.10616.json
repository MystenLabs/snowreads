Its symmetries are generated by a 14-parameter nonlinear algebra.\n  In this paper, we discuss a generalization of the original model and\nconstruct its realizations on a canonical phase space. We also investigate in\nmore detail its classical limit, obtained by replacing the commutators by\nPoisson brackets.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sh2T0YGUt8mA8RuJyEullQ1tfkg_eChZ3xzGPxbI62w","pdfSize":"118757"}
