[Kontsevich--Tschinkel'19],\n[Nicaise--Shinder'19], [Nicaise--Ottem'21]). This method requires the explicit\nconstruction of degeneration families of curves with favorable properties.\nWhile the specific construction is generally difficult, [Nicaise--Ottem'22]\ncombines combinatorial methods to construct degeneration families of\nhypersurfaces in toric varieties and mentions the stable rationality of a very\ngeneral hypersurface in projective spaces. In this paper, we substitute mock\ntoric varieties for toric varieties and we prove the following theorem from the\nmotivic method: If a very general hypersurface of degree $d$ in\n$\\mathbb{P}^{2n-5}_\\mathbb{C}$ is not stably rational, then a very general\nhypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathrm{Gr}_\\mathbb{C}(2, n)$ is not stably\nrational.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w2gWD6AQN-k0W7rTOhuRDixg0VHWRv0vqkQ9cTkHowo","pdfSize":"482353"}
