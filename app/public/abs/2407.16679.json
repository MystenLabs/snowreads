To make it a homotopy functorial invariant we characterize\nit as a particular instance of the exterior sectional category of an exterior\nmap, an invariant of the exterior homotopy category which is also deeply\nanalyzed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
