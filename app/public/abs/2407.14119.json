However, collecting training data in this application field is\nparticularly challenging and costly due to the need of acquiring information\nduring the different growing stages of the cultivation of interest. In this\npaper, we present a method for data augmentation that uses two GANs to create\nartificial images to augment the training data. To obtain a higher image\nquality, instead of re-creating the entire scene, we take original images and\nreplace only the patches containing objects of interest with artificial ones\ncontaining new objects with different shapes and styles. In doing this, we take\ninto account both the foreground (i.e., crop samples) and the background (i.e.,\nthe soil) of the patches. Quantitative experiments, conducted on publicly\navailable datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The\nsource code and data discussed in this work are available as open source.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"usVKka7RuNSCthK6QLew6fNgsRuq43Z_xUuIHr_Opus","pdfSize":"4084383"}
