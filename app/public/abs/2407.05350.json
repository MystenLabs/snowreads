In this paper, we investigate the\nmultiple boundary states within the two kinds of extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\n(SSH) models. The coexistence of boundary states that exist both in the bulk\nand band gaps is realized based on the bilayer SSH-like model, which consists\nof two conventional square-root SSH models that are directly coupled. We\nfurther show the square-root topology within the decorated SSH-like model,\nwhich supports multiple boundary states that could be embedded into the bulk\ncontinuum by tuning the hopping parameters. In addition, the connection between\nthe decorated SSH-like model and its effectively decomposed counterparts is\nrevealed. Our results broaden insight into the multiple boundary states and\nopen up an exciting avenue for the future exploration of square-root topology.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
