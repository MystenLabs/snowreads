The IRP enhances defect detection accuracy through a cyclic data\nrefinement strategy, iteratively removing misleading data points to improve\nmodel performance and robustness. We validate the IRP's effectiveness using two\nbenchmark datasets, Kolektor SDD2 (KSDD2) and MVTec AD, covering a wide range\nof industrial products and defect types. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the IRP consistently outperforms traditional anomaly detection models,\nparticularly in environments with high noise levels. This study highlights the\nIRP's potential to significantly enhance anomaly detection processes in\nindustrial settings, effectively managing the challenges of sparse and noisy\ndata.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
