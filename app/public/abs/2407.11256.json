We investigate the\nrelationship between robust and probabilistic invariance, leveraging this\nrelationship to design state-feedback controllers that maximize the probability\nof the system staying within the probabilistic controlled invariant set. We\npropose a semi-definite-programming-based optimization scheme for designing the\nstate-feedback controllers subject to input constraints. The effectiveness of\nour results are demonstrated and validated on a quadrotor, both in simulation\nand on a physical platform.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
