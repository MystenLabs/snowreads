To\nthis end, we propose an indirect data-driven predictive control approach using\nModel Predictive Control (MPC) capable of handling temperature constraints and\nheating-power saturation while delivering enhanced precision, overshoot\ncontrol, and settling times compared to state-of-the-art methods. We employ a\nNon-linear Auto-Regressive with Exogenous inputs (NARX) model to define a\nlinear control-oriented model at each operating point. Using a high-fidelity\nsimulator, several simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the\nproposed method's robustness and performance under parametric uncertainty,\nindicating overshoot and average steady-state error less than $2^\\circ\n\\mathrm{C}$ and $0.7^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ ($7^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and $2^\\circ\n\\mathrm{C}$) for the nominal (worst-case) scenario. Finally, we applied the\nproposed method to a lab-scale thermoforming platform, resulting in a close\nresponse to the simulation analysis with overshoot and average steady-state\nerror metrics less than $5.3^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and $1^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
