In the\norientable and smooth category, we determine the smallest possible $m$ when\n$n\\geq 3g$. We show that for each integer $k>1$ there exist infinitely many\nperiodic maps such that the smallest possible $m$ is equal to $k$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
