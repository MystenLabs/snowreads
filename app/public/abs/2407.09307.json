After correction for instrument systematics the measured\ncoupling is within 5% of theory, with an uncertainty of 7.2%. The OAM in our\nsetup is transverse to the propagation direction and scales linearly with\nwavelength (4 A - 12.75 A), hence the coupling can be varied, without\nmechanically rotating the device. Therefore, the systematic error is lower than\nin previous experiments. The detected transverse OAM of our beam corresponds to\n4098 +- 295 hbar A-1, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous neutron\nexperiments, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of using the Sagnac effect\nto definitively measure neutron OAM and paving the way towards observations of\nthe quantum Sagnac effect\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
