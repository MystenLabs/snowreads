This paper addresses these industrial needs by introducing\na novel lightweight aerial platform (3.12kg) designed to exert high pushing\nforces on non-horizontal surfaces. To increase maneuverability, the proposed\nplatform incorporates tiltable rotors with 5-DoF (Degree of Freedom) actuation.\nMoreover, it has an innovative shifting-mass mechanism that dynamically adjusts\nthe system's CoM (Center of Mass) during contact-based task execution. A\ncompliant EE (End-Effector) is applied to ensure a smooth interaction with the\nwork surface. We provide a detailed study of the UAV's overall system design,\nhardware integration of the developed physical prototype, and software\narchitecture of the proposed control algorithm. Physical experiments were\nconducted to validate the control design and explore the force generation\ncapability of the designed platform via a pushing task. With a total mass of\n3.12kg, the UAV exerted a maximum pushing force of above 28N being almost equal\nto its gravity force. Furthermore, the experiments illustrated the benefits of\nhaving displaced CoM by benchmarking with a fixed CoM configuration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
