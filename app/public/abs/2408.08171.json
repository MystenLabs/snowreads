Lutwak following the work of H. Busemann, and plays a central\nrole in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. We show that when $n \\geq 3$, $I^2 K =\nc K$ iff $K$ is a centered ellipsoid, and hence $I K = c K$ iff $K$ is a\ncentered Euclidean ball, answering long-standing questions by Lutwak, Gardner,\nand Fish-Nazarov-Ryabogin-Zvavitch. To this end, we recast the iterated\nintersection body equation as an Euler-Lagrange equation for a certain volume\nfunctional under radial perturbations, derive new formulas for the volume of $I\nK$, and introduce a continuous version of Steiner symmetrization for Lipschitz\nstar-bodies, which (surprisingly) yields a useful radial perturbation exactly\nwhen $n\\geq 3$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
