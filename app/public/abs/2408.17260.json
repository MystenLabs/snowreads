In particular, in Josephson junctions with three and four\nsuperconductors, we find stable lines and surfaces of exceptional points\nprotected by non-Hermitian topology and highly tuneable by the superconducting\nphases. We also discover that, in Josephson junctions formed by laterally\ncoupled superconductors, exceptional points can result from hybridized Andreev\nbound states and lead to the enhancement of supercurrents controlled by\ndissipation. Our work unveils the potential of multi-terminal Josephson\njunctions for realizing higher dimensional topological non-Hermitian\nsuperconducting phenomena.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
