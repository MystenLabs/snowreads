Two important examples are hypothesis testing in latent\nvariables models, and model comparison in Bayesian statistics. In both\nexamples, the likelihood ratio and the Bayes factor are defined as the ratio of\nthe normalizing constants of posterior distributions. We propose in this\narticle a novel methodology that estimates this ratio using stochastic\napproximation principle. Our estimator is consistent and asymptotically\nGaussian. Its asymptotic variance is smaller than the one of the popular\noptimal bridge sampling estimator. Furthermore, it is much more robust to\nlittle overlap between the two unnormalized distributions considered. Thanks to\nits online definition, our procedure can be integrated in an estimation process\nin latent variables model, and therefore reduce the computational effort. The\nperformances of the estimator are illustrated through a simulation study and\ncompared to two other estimators : the ratio importance sampling and the\noptimal bridge sampling estimators.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
