However,\nVEC networks still face challenges such as high vehicle mobility. Digital twin\n(DT), an emerging technology, can predict, estimate, and analyze real-time\nstates by digitally modeling objects in the physical world. By integrating DT\nwith VEC, a virtual vehicle DT can be created in the VEC server to monitor the\nreal-time operating status of vehicles. However, maintaining the vehicle DT\nmodel requires ongoing attention from the VEC server, which also needs to offer\ncomputing services for the vehicles. Therefore, effective allocation and\nscheduling of VEC server resources are crucial. This study focuses on a general\nVEC network with a single VEC service and multiple vehicles, examining the two\ntypes of delays caused by twin maintenance and computational processing within\nthe network. By transforming the problem using satisfaction functions, we\npropose an optimization problem aimed at maximizing each vehicle's resource\nutility to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy. Given the\nnon-convex nature of the issue, we employ multi-agent Markov decision processes\nto reformulate the problem. Subsequently, we propose the twin maintenance and\ncomputing task processing resource collaborative scheduling (MADRL-CSTC)\nalgorithm, which leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Through\nexperimental comparisons with alternative algorithms, it demonstrates that our\nproposed approach is effective in terms of resource allocation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
