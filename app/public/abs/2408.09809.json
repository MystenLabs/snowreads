Our approach yields, for\ninstance, a new formula for the cardinality of a Smolyak grid, which is based\non Chebyshev nodes of the first kind and it allows to recover certain\ncounting-formulas previously found by Bungartz-Griebel, Kaarnioja,\nM\\\"uller-Gronbach, Novak-Ritter and Ullrich.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
