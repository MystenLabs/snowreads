Since chemical bonds between atoms of the same elements favor\ncentrosymmetric crystal structures and symmetrically distributed electron\ncharges, elemental ferroelectrics are extremely rare. In comparison to atoms,\nelemental clusters are less symmetric and typically have various preferred\norientations in crystals. Consequently, the assembly of clusters with different\norientations tends to break the inversion symmetry. Based on this concept, we\nshow that sliding ferroelectricity naturally emerges in trilayer\nquasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) C60, a cluster-assembled carbon allotrope recently\nsynthesized. Trilayer qHP C60's have several stable polar structures, which are\ndistinguishable in second-harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Compared to\npreviously found elemental ferroelectrics, trilayer qHP C60's have sizable band\ngaps and some of them have both switchable out-of-plane and in-plane\npolarizations. Remarkably, the out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations are\ndecoupled, enabling an easy-to-implement construction of Van der Waals\nhomostructures with ferroelectrically switchable chirality.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
