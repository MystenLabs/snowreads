We analyzed the outputs of six state-of-the-art AI models, including\nvariations of ChatGPT, Coral, and Gemini, using 14 different honorific forms.\nOur findings reveal that honorifics significantly affect the quality,\nconsistency, and formality of AI-generated responses, demonstrating LLMs'\nability to interpret and adapt to social context cues embedded in language.\nNotable variations were observed across different models, with some emphasizing\nhistorical context and derivations, while others focused on intuitive\nexplanations. The study highlights the potential for using honorifics to adjust\nthe depth and complexity of AI-generated explanations in educational contexts.\nFurthermore, the responsiveness of AI models to cultural linguistic elements\nunderscores the importance of considering cultural factors in AI development\nfor educational applications. These results open new avenues for research in\nAI-assisted education and cultural adaptation in AI systems, with significant\nimplications for personalizing learning experiences and developing culturally\nsensitive AI tools for global education.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
