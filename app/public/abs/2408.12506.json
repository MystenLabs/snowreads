We investigate this connection for a water molecule moving\nin liquid water using all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and linear\nhydrodynamic theory. We analytically calculate the frequency-dependent friction\nof a sphere with finite surface slip moving in a viscoelastic compressible\nfluid by solving the linear transient Stokes equation, including\nfrequency-dependent shear and volume viscosities, both determined from MD\nsimulations of bulk liquid water. We also determine the frequency-dependent\nfriction of a single water molecule moving in liquid water, as defined by the\ngeneralized Langevin equation from MD simulation trajectories. By fitting the\neffective sphere radius and the slip length, the frequency-dependent friction\nand velocity autocorrelation function from the transient Stokes equation and\nsimulations quantitatively agree. This shows that the transient Stokes equation\naccurately describes the important features of the frequency-dependent friction\nof a single water molecule in liquid water and thus applies down to molecular\nlength and time scales, provided accurate frequency-dependent viscosities are\nused. The frequency dependence of the shear viscosity of liquid water requires\ncareful consideration of hydrodynamic finite-size effects to observe the\nasymptotic hydrodynamic power-law tail. In contrast, for a methane molecule\nmoving in water, the frequency-dependent friction cannot be predicted based on\na homogeneous model, which suggests, supported by the extraction of a\nfrequency-dependent surface-slip profile, that a methane molecule is surrounded\nby a finite-thickness hydration layer with viscoelastic properties that are\nsignificantly different from bulk water.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
