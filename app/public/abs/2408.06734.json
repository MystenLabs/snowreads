Our method first identifies potential structures that can afford the\naction of hanging by analyzing the hanging mechanics and geometric properties.\nThen 6D poses are detected for a parallel gripper retrofitted with an extending\nbar, which when closed forms loops to hook each hangable structure. Finally, an\nevaluation policy qualities and rank grasp candidates for execution attempts.\nCompared to the traditional physical model-based and deep learning-based\nmethods, our approach is closer to the human natural action of grasping unknown\nobjects. And it also eliminates the need for a vast amount of training data. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments\nwith a real robot. Experimental results indicate that the grasping accuracy and\nstability are significantly higher than the state-of-the-art learning-based\nmethod, especially for thin and flat objects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
