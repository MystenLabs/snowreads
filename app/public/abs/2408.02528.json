We prove that two such branching\nprocesses have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons\nare fractionally isomorphic, a notion introduced by Greb\\'ik and Rocha.\n  A different class of branching processes was introduced by Hladk\\'y,\nNachmias, and Tran in relation to uniform spanning trees in finite graphs\napproximating a given connected graphon. We prove that two such branching\nprocesses have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons\nare fractionally isomorphic up to scalar multiple. Combined with a recent\nresult of Archer and Shalev, this implies that if uniform spanning trees of two\ndense graphs have a similar local structure, they have a similar scaling limit.\n  As a side result we give a characterization of fractional isomorphism for\ngraphs as well as graphons in terms of their connected components.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eSK4ZrMlKA-kjXT96jCghhGlIvRhwUaW57wDgrbNjiI","pdfSize":"1030457","txDigest":"EiNUBbbBGdURUk1NvBGgXTRnoYzjewBJMKBBrERvN6Tz","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
