Each of them is further developed to arithmetic gamma\nvalues and multiple zeta values by Goss and Thakur respectively. In this paper,\nby generalizing a result of Chang-Papanikolas-Thakur-Yu (2010), we obtain the\nalgebraic independence of certain arithmetic gamma values, positive\ncharacteristic multiple zeta values of restricted indices and hyperderivatives\nof their deformations. We prove this by using Chang-Papanikolas-Yu's\nderivation, Maurichat's prolongation, Namoijam's formula and Papanikolas'\ntheory of $t$-motivic Galois group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
