Recently, a nonempirical\nWannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH)\nfunctional has been shown to accurately produce the fundamental band gaps of a\nwide set of semiconductors and insulators, including lead halide perovskites.\nHere we apply the WOT-SRSH functional to five halide double perovskites, and\ncompare the results with those obtained from other known functionals and\nprevious $GW$ calculations. We also use the approach as a starting point for\n$GW$ calculations and we compute the band structures and optical absorption\nspectrum for Cs\\textsubscript{2}Ag{Bi}Br\\textsubscript{6}, using both\ntime-dependent DFT and the $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. We show that\nthe WOT-SRSH functional leads to accurate fundamental and optical band gaps, as\nwell as optical absorption spectra, consistent with spectroscopic measurements,\nthereby establishing WOT-SRSH as a viable method for the accurate prediction of\noptoelectronic properties of halide double perovskites.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
