By interleaving this forcing with other\nforcing notions, a model containing a $(2, {\\aleph}_{0})$-selective\nultrafilter, but no nowhere dense ultrafilters is produced. It is thus proved\nthat the existence of $(2, {\\aleph}_{0})$-selective ultrafilters does not imply\nthe existence of nowhere dense ultrafilters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
