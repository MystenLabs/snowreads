This\nwork focuses on characterizing iPIC3D's communication efficiency through\nstrategic measures like optimal node placement, communication and computation\noverlap, and load balancing. Profiling and tracing tools are employed to\nanalyze iPIC3D's communication efficiency and provide practical\nrecommendations. Implementing optimized communication protocols addresses the\nGeospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) magnetic reconnection challenges in\nplasma physics with more precise simulations. This approach captures the\ncomplexities of 3D plasma simulations, particularly in magnetic reconnection,\nadvancing space and astrophysical research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
