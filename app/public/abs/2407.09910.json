Let\n$\\Gamma_p(G)$ be the common divisor graph built on the set of non-central\nconjugacy classes of $p$-regular elements of $G$: this is the graph whose\nvertices are the conjugacy classes of those non-central elements of $G$ such\nthat $p$ does not divide their orders, and two distinct vertices are adjacent\nif and only if the greatest common divisor of their lengths is strictly greater\nthan one. The aim of this paper is twofold: to positively answer an open\nquestion concerning the maximum possible distance in $\\Gamma_p(G)$ between a\nvertex with maximal cardinality and any other vertex, and to study the\n$p$-structure of $G$ when $\\Gamma_p(G)$ has diameter three.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
