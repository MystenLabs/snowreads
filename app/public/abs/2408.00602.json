The test that is\nconsidered is from the class of test problems in which some parameters are not\nidentifiable under the null hypothesis. The classic exponential average tests\ndo not work well in practice. To overcome this drawback, a novel test statistic\nis proposed by taking the weighted average of the squared score test statistic\n(WAST) over the grouping parameter's space, which has a closed form from the\nperspective of the conjugate priors when an appropriate weight is chosen. The\nWAST significantly improves the power in practice, particularly in cases where\nthe number of the grouping variables is large. The asymptotic distributions of\nthe WAST are derived under the null and alternative hypotheses. The\napproximation of critical value by the bootstrap method is investigated, which\nis theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, the proposed test method is naturally\nextended to the generalized estimating equation (GEE) framework, as well as\nmultiple change planes that can test if there are three or more subgroups. The\nWAST performs well in simulation studies, and its performance is further\nvalidated by applying it to real datasets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
