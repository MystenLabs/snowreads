We focus on the\ntwo-point correlation function in momentum space when the undeformed theory is\na conformal field theory. The large momentum behavior of the correlation\nfunction is computed and compared to that of\n$\\textrm{T}\\bar{\\textrm{T}}$-deformed field theories defined on a plane. For\nthe latter, the behavior found was $|q|^{-\\frac{tq^2}{\\pi}}$, where $q$ is the\nmomentum and $t$ is the deformation parameter. For a torus, the same behavior\nis found for $|q|<<L/t$, where $L$ is the torus' length scale. However, for\n$|q|>>L/t$, a different behavior is found: $\\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{t}^5q^2}{\\pi e\nL^3|T|^2}\\right)^{\\frac{tq^2}{\\pi}}$, where $T$ is the modular parameter of the\ntorus. Hence, at large momentum, the correlator decays and then grows. This\nbehavior suggests that operators carrying momentum $q$ are smeared on a\ndistance scale $t|q|$. The difference from the plane's result illustrates the\nnon-locality of the theory and the UV-IR mixing.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
