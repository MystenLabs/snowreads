This includes\nusing AI to improve the efficiency of the wireless transmission and supporting\nAI deployment with wireless networks. In this article, the latest progress of\nthe Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards development is\nintroduced. Concentrating on AI model distributed transfer and AI for Beam\nManagement (BM) with wireless network, we introduce the latest studies and\nexplain how the existing standards should be modified to incorporate the\nresults from academia.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
