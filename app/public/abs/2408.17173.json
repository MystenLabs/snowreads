We establish sufficient conditions for the existence\nand approximate controllability of a unique mild solution to time-fractional\nstochastic Navier-Stokes equations. Using a fixed point technique, we first\ndemonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to the equation\nunder consideration. We then establish approximate controllability results by\nusing the concepts of fractional calculus, semigroup theory, functional\nanalysis and stochastic analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
