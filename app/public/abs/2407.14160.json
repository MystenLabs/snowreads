Here, we employ a two-harmonic RABITT (Reconstruction of\nAttosecond Beating by Interference of Two-photon Transitions) configuration to\nisolate the multiphoton pathways and measure the ionization time delays as a\nfunction of the dressing field intensity. We show that the validity of the\nasymptotic theory can be extended to the threshold or to higher-order\ncontributions by rigorously treating the angular-momentum dependence of the\ncontinuum-continuum transitions into universal and easily computable\npartial-wave-specific correction factors. Our asymptotic treatment is also\nvalid for higher-order interfering amplitudes while significantly simplifying\ntheir evaluation and providing a transparent physical interpretation. The\nvalidity of the method for atomic and molecular targets in the vicinity of\nresonances, ionization thresholds, and for both the emission-integrated and\nangularly resolved signal is confirmed by comparison to ab initio calculations\nover a wide energy range.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
