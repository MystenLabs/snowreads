For instance, in medicine, effective analysis of diverse\nphysiological signals is crucial for patient monitoring and clinical\ndecision-making and yet highly challenging. We introduce MedTsLLM, a general\nmultimodal large language model (LLM) framework that effectively integrates\ntime series data and rich contextual information in the form of text to analyze\nphysiological signals, performing three tasks with clinical relevance: semantic\nsegmentation, boundary detection, and anomaly detection in time series. These\ncritical tasks enable deeper analysis of physiological signals and can provide\nactionable insights for clinicians. We utilize a reprogramming layer to align\nembeddings of time series patches with a pretrained LLM's embedding space and\nmake effective use of raw time series, in conjunction with textual context.\nGiven the multivariate nature of medical datasets, we develop methods to handle\nmultiple covariates. We additionally tailor the text prompt to include\npatient-specific information. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,\nincluding deep learning models, other LLMs, and clinical methods across\nmultiple medical domains, specifically electrocardiograms and respiratory\nwaveforms. MedTsLLM presents a promising step towards harnessing the power of\nLLMs for medical time series analysis that can elevate data-driven tools for\nclinicians and improve patient outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
