Using previous\nresults, it is known that there exists a distribution $\\mathcal{D}_R$ of rank\n$(n+1)$ defined on the configuration space $Q(M,\\widehat{M})$ of the rolling\nsystem, encoding the no-slip and no-twist conditions. Our objective is to study\nthe problem of complete controllability of the control system associated with\n$\\mathcal{D}_R$. The key lies in examining the holonomy group of the\ndistribution $\\mathcal{D}_R$ and, following the approach of \\cite{ChKok},\nestablishing that the rolling problem is completely controllable if and only if\nthe holonomy group of $(M,g)$ equals $SO_0(n,1)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W5Gl5-U8a50M-C8a-J8oWZ4zDH_YYMbl_uWkr6Hq93E","pdfSize":"214162"}
