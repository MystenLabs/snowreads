When \\(Y\\) is equipped with a Hamiltonian \\(G\\)-action, we\nprove that its mirror determines a canonical complex Lagrangian subvariety in\nthe Coulomb branch of the 3d \\(\\mathcal{N}=4\\) pure \\(G\\)-gauge theory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
