We\ndemonstrate fiber-based magnetic imaging based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) sensor\nspins at the tip of a fiber-coupled diamond nanobeam. We incorporated angled\nion implantation into the nanobeam fabrication process to realize a small\nensemble of NV spins at the nanobeam tip. By gluing the nanobeam to a tapered\nfiber, we created a robust and transportable probe with optimized optical\ncoupling efficiency. We demonstrate the imaging capability of the fiber-coupled\nnanobeam by measuring the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire.\nWith its robust coupling and efficient readout at the fiber-coupled interface,\nour probe could allow new studies of (quantum) materials and biological\nsamples.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qxf4I7CxiF9vGzBy_wjvl574-8MMo2mqrKhnio87Q94","pdfSize":"1460412"}
