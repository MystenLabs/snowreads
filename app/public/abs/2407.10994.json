Two key desiderata for such assistants are\npersonalization-in the sense that the assistant should reflect the user's own\nstyle-and privacy-in the sense that users may prefer to always store their\npersonal data locally, on their own computing device. We present a new design\nfor such an automated assistant, for the specific use case of personal\nassistant for email generation, which we call Panza. Specifically, Panza can be\nboth trained and inferenced locally on commodity hardware, and is personalized\nto the user's writing style. Panza's personalization features are based on a\nnew technique called data playback, which allows us to fine-tune an LLM to\nbetter reflect a user's writing style using limited data. We show that, by\ncombining efficient fine-tuning and inference methods, Panza can be executed\nentirely locally using limited resources-specifically, it can be executed\nwithin the same resources as a free Google Colab instance. Finally, our key\nmethodological contribution is a careful study of evaluation metrics, and of\nhow different choices of system components (e.g. the use of Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration or different fine-tuning approaches) impact the system's\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
