We\nleverage autoencoders to discover a one-dimensional neural active manifold\n(NeurAM) capturing the model output variability, plus a simultaneously learnt\nsurrogate model with inputs on this manifold. The proposed dimensionality\nreduction framework can then be applied to perform outer loop many-query tasks,\nlike sensitivity analysis and uncertainty propagation. In particular, we prove,\nboth theoretically under idealized conditions, and numerically in challenging\ntest cases, how NeurAM can be used to obtain multifidelity sampling estimators\nwith reduced variance by sampling the models on the discovered low-dimensional\nand shared manifold among models. Several numerical examples illustrate the\nmain features of the proposed dimensionality reduction strategy, and highlight\nits advantages with respect to existing approaches in the literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
