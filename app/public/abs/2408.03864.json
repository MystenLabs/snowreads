We design parameterized quantum query algorithms for $k$-vertex\ncover and $k$-matching problems, and present lower bounds on the parameterized\nquantum query complexity. Then, we show that our quantum query algorithms are\noptimal up to a constant factor when the parameters are small.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
