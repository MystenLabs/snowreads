This finding is in contrast to the common Janssen\neffect, for which the force on the base is smaller than the particle weight,\nillustrating one of the best-known differences between granular and liquid\nsystems. We find that the reverse Janssen effect is strongly influenced by the\npouring protocol: under Earth's gravitational field, and for pouring heights\nthat are measured in tens of particle diameters, dynamic reverse Janssen effect\nis found. Dynamic reverse Janssen effect is an order of magnitude stronger than\nstatic one, found for small pouring heights. This differentiation between\nstatic and dynamic effects allows for the development of a better understanding\nof the general features of reverse Janssen effect, and of the comparison\nbetween experiments and simulations reported in this and previous works.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
