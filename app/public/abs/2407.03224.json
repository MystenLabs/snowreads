However, controlling\nthese platforms in zero-gravity environments presents unique challenges,\nincluding uncertainties and disturbances. This paper introduces an innovative\napproach that combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Model Predictive\nControl (MPC) in the zero-gravity laboratory (Zero-G Lab) at the University of\nLuxembourg. This approach leverages PPO's reinforcement learning power and\nMPC's precision to navigate the complex control dynamics of floating platforms.\nUnlike traditional control methods, this PPO-MPC approach learns from MPC\npredictions, adapting to unmodeled dynamics and disturbances, resulting in a\nresilient control framework tailored to the zero-gravity environment.\nSimulations and experiments in the Zero-G Lab validate this approach,\nshowcasing the adaptability of the PPO agent. This research opens new\npossibilities for controlling floating platforms in zero-gravity settings,\npromising advancements in space exploration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
