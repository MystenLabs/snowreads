This deformation incorporates\nmonopole superpotential terms, which have recently played interesting roles in\nexploring possible RG fixed points of 3d supersymmetric gauge theories.\nEmploying this confining phenomenon in 3d $\\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$ theories, we\nalso propose a deconfined version of the Kim-Park duality, an IR duality for 3d\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ adjoint SQCDs, where an adjoint matter field is replaced by a\nlinear quiver tail of $\\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$. Surprisingly, both the confinement\nof deformed $\\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$ and the deconfined Kim-Park duality can be\nproven only assuming some basic 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ IR dualities. Finally, we\npropose a variant of the Kim-Park duality deformed by a single monopole\nsuperpotential term, which can also be derived using the same method.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
