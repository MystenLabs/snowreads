While such an assumption can\nbe tested using a Wald-type test, the performance of such a test deteriorates\nas the dimensionality increases. This paper introduces a novel test for testing\nextreme value indices in a high dimensional setting. We show the asymptotic\nbehavior of the test statistic and conduct simulation studies to evaluate its\nfinite sample performance. The proposed test significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in high dimensional settings. We apply this test to examine two\ndatasets previously assumed to have identical extreme value indices across all\ndimensions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
