Utilizing a discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation with Kerr-type nonlinearity and a random coefficient, we compute the\naverages and variances of the transmittance, $T$, and its logarithm, as\nfunctions of the system size $L$, while maintaining constant intensity for the\nincident wave. In cases of purely nonlinear disorder, we observe power-law\nlocalization characterized by $\\langle T \\rangle \\propto L^{-\\gamma_a}$ and\n$\\langle \\ln T \\rangle \\approx -\\gamma_g \\ln L$ for sufficiently large $L$. At\nlow input intensities, a transition from exponential to power-law decay in\n$\\langle T \\rangle$ occurs as $L$ increases. The exponents $\\gamma_a$ and\n$\\gamma_g$ are nearly identical, converging to approximately 0.5 as the\nstrength of the nonlinear disorder, $\\beta$, increases. Additionally, the\nvariance of $T$ decays according to a power law with an exponent close to 1,\nand the variance of $\\ln T$ approaches a small constant as $L$ increases. These\nfindings are consistent with an underlying log-normal distribution of $T$ and\nsuggest that wave propagation behavior becomes nearly deterministic as the\nsystem size increases. When both linear and nonlinear disorders are present, we\nobserve a transition from power-law to exponential decay in transmittance with\nincreasing $L$ when the strength of linear disorder, $V$, is less than $\\beta$.\nAs $V$ increases, the region exhibiting power-law localization diminishes and\neventually disappears when $V$ exceeds $\\beta$, leading to standard Anderson\nlocalization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RnyVlYD3EJKmeNuGTKHhquaZGvgPKcACTnAfM8TFnu0","pdfSize":"711073"}
