The Higgs boson decay into a bottom quark-antiquark pair (H $\\to$\n$\\mathrm{b\\bar{b}}$) is targeted, and three different final states of the top\nquark decays are considered, defined by the number of leptons (electrons or\nmuons) in the event. The analysis utilises proton-proton collision data\ncollected at the CERN LHC with the CMS experiment at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in\n2016-2018, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The\nobserved $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$H production rate relative to the standard model\nexpectation is 0.33 $\\pm$ 0.26 = 0.33 $\\pm$ 0.17 (stat) $\\pm$ 0.21 (syst).\nAdditionally, the $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$H production rate is determined in\nintervals of Higgs boson transverse momentum. An upper limit at 95% confidence\nlevel is set on the tH production rate of 14.6 times the standard model\nprediction, with an expectation of 19.3$^{+9.2}_{-6.0}$. Finally, constraints\nare derived on the strength and structure of the coupling between the Higgs\nboson and the top quark from simultaneous extraction of the\n$\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$H and tH production rates, and the results are combined with\nthose obtained in other Higgs boson decay channels.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SjOI866AcCmciNU4ro-qr4kG_XTh8kVEaQLIqtZaQLo","pdfSize":"5997239"}
