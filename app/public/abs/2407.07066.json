However, this integration introduces significant data privacy\nconcerns, such as data leakage, sensor data compromise, and model inversion\nattacks, revealing critical details about part design, material composition,\nand machine parameters. Differential Privacy (DP) models, which inject noise\ninto data under mathematical guarantees, offer a nuanced balance between data\nutility and privacy by obscuring traces of sensing data. However, the\nintroduction of noise into learning models, often functioning as black boxes,\ncomplicates the prediction of how specific noise levels impact model accuracy.\nThis study introduces the Differential Privacy-HyperDimensional computing\n(DP-HD) framework, leveraging the explainability of the vector symbolic\nparadigm to predict the noise impact on the accuracy of in-situ monitoring,\nsafeguarding sensitive data while maintaining operational efficiency.\nExperimental results on real-world high-speed melt pool data of AM for\ndetecting overhang anomalies demonstrate that DP-HD achieves superior\noperational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and robust privacy protection,\noutperforming state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models. For example, when\nimplementing the same level of privacy protection (with a privacy budget set at\n1), our model achieved an accuracy of 94.43%, surpassing the performance of\ntraditional models such as ResNet50 (52.30%), GoogLeNet (23.85%), AlexNet\n(55.78%), DenseNet201 (69.13%), and EfficientNet B2 (40.81%). Notably, DP-HD\nmaintains high performance under substantial noise additions designed to\nenhance privacy, unlike current models that suffer significant accuracy\ndeclines under high privacy constraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
