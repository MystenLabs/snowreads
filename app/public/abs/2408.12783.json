In this paper, we determine the\nmedian of Sierpi\\'{n}ski triangle graphs. Sierpi\\'{n}ski triangle graphs, also\nknown as Sierpi\\'{n}ski gasket graphs of order $n$ are graphs formed by\ncontracting all non-clique edges from the Sierpi\\'{n}ski graphs of order\n($n+1$).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
