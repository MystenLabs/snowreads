These are analogues of Schneider's formula in the number field\nsetting. We also prove that the validity of the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer\nconjecture (including the leading coefficient formula) over function fields is\ninvariant under isogeny, without using the result of Kato--Trihan.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
