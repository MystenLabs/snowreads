Tree-child networks are a particular class of\nrooted phylogenetic networks that has been extensively investigated in recent\nyears. In this paper, we give a novel characterisation of a tree-child network\n$\\mathcal{R}$ in terms of cherry-picking sequences that are sequences on the\nleaves of $\\mathcal{R}$ and reduce it to a single vertex by repeatedly applying\none of two reductions to its leaves. We show that our characterisation extends\nto unrooted tree-child networks which are mostly unexplored in the literature\nand, in turn, also offers a new approach to settling the computational\ncomplexity of deciding if an unrooted phylogenetic network can be oriented as a\nrooted tree-child network.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
