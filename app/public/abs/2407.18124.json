Here, we\nintroduce a similar generalization of PIR codes that we call\nUnequal-Data-Demand (UDD) PIR codes. These codes are PIR-type codes designed\nfor the scenario where some parts of the encoded data are in higher demand than\nother parts. We generalize various results for PIR codes to UDD codes. Our main\ncontribution is a new approach to the Griesmer bound for linear EC codes\ninvolving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that generalizes to\nlinear UEP codes and linear UDD PIR codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rCbstmJ0faD2BaR-S0F_I4sVHz_lgSRFIIa8pX_4A7o","pdfSize":"214407","objectId":"0x382499eb31447ab4bc3efcb9c280cbd647d42e3ac10cea35971d15d68cfa6ceb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
