The calculation is based on proposed by us previously method of\nimposing boundary conditions by convolution of the free particle Wigner\nfunction with some time independent function, defined by the shape of the\nbilliard. This method allowed to greatly simplify the general expression for\nthe Wigner current, representing its $\\mathbf{p}$-component as a surface\nintegral of the product of the shifted free particle wave functions (the\ninverse Fourier transform of the free particle Wigner function). The results\nare also connect to an alternative approach, which takes into account the\nboundary conditions by adding the $\\propto \\delta'(x)$ term to the Hamiltonian.\nThe latter is also generalized to the multidimensional case.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
