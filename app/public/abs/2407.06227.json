The control performance optimization\nconfronts the technical challenges that arise from the intricate interactions\nbetween communication and control sub-systems, asking for a co-design.\nAccounting for the system dynamics, we formulate the sequential co-design\ndecision-makings of communication and control over the discrete time horizon as\na Markov decision process, for which a practical offline learning framework is\nproposed. Our proposed framework integrates large language models into the\nelements of reinforcement learning. We present a case study on the age of\nsemantics-aware communication and control co-design to showcase the potentials\nfrom our proposed learning framework. Furthermore, we discuss the open issues\nremaining to make our proposed offline learning framework feasible for\nreal-world implementations, and highlight the research directions for future\nexplorations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
