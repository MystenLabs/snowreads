Considering the\nnonstationarity of the environment, we adopt the duality gap and the dynamic\nNash equilibrium regret as performance metrics for algorithm design. We present\nthree variants of the proximal point method: the Online Proximal Point\nMethod~(OPPM), the Optimistic OPPM~(OptOPPM), and the OptOPPM with multiple\npredictors. Each algorithm guarantees upper bounds for both the duality gap and\ndynamic Nash equilibrium regret, achieving near-optimality when measured\nagainst the duality gap. Specifically, in certain benign environments, such as\nsequences of stationary payoff functions, these algorithms maintain a nearly\nconstant metric bound. Experimental results further validate the effectiveness\nof these algorithms. Lastly, this paper discusses potential reliability\nconcerns associated with using dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as a performance\nmetric.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
