However, the current formulation of GDL is limited to global symmetries\nthat are not often found in real-world problems. We propose to relax GDL to\nallow for local symmetries, specifically fibration symmetries in graphs, to\nleverage regularities of realistic instances. We show that GNNs apply the\ninductive bias of fibration symmetries and derive a tighter upper bound for\ntheir expressive power. Additionally, by identifying symmetries in networks, we\ncollapse network nodes, thereby increasing their computational efficiency\nduring both inference and training of deep neural networks. The mathematical\nextension introduced here applies beyond graphs to manifolds, bundles, and\ngrids for the development of models with inductive biases induced by local\nsymmetries that can lead to better generalization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IWT6dp55eIusuHDYIsNAvc81fkjbClBGWsFNULppBsY","pdfSize":"12255156"}
