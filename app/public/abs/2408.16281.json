Using smeared three-quark operators in a correlation matrix analysis,\nwe report masses for the ground, first and second excited states of the $ J^P =\n1/2^\\pm,\\, 3/2^\\pm $ spectra across a broad range in the light quark mass. We\ninvestigate the parity and spin quantum numbers for the states observed on the\nlattice, looking to reconcile these with the resonances encountered in\nexperiment. We find that the $ \\Omega^-(2012) $ as reported by the Particle\nData Group corresponds to two overlapping resonances with $ J^P = 1/2^- $ and $\n3/2^- $. We also propose quantum number assignments for the higher energy\nresonances, and identify successive radial excitations within the spectra.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
