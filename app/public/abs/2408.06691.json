We establish all the ergodic rules in CA with 3, 4, and 5\nstates. We analytically prove the ergodicity for 12 rules in 3-state CA and\n118320 rules in 5-state CA with any ergodic and periodic boundary condition,\nand numerically confirm all the other rules non-ergodic with some boundary\ncondition. We classify ergodic rules into several patterns, which exhibit a\nvariety of ergodic structure.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
