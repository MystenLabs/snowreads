However, they\noften lack measurable experimental signals due to their secluded nature.\nIncluding a feeble interaction with the visible sector through a Higgs portal\nleads not only to potential detection avenues and richer thermal production\ndynamics, but also to a possible explanation of the initial dark sector\npopulation through the freeze-in mechanism. In this work we study, by solving\nthe full system of coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities and\ntemperatures of all the involved states, three scenarios of this type where the\nDM is: a real scalar with broken $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, a complex scalar with unbroken\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$, and a $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ scalar with an additional scalar mediator.\nAll of these models have viable dark matter candidates in a cannibal phase\nwhile having different detection profiles. We show that cosmological bounds can\nbe either exacerbated or evaded by changing the dark sector interactions,\nleading to potential signatures in long-lived particle and indirect detection\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
