It is thus important to control such\nsystems to maintain or restore their stability. Traditional approaches rely on\nreal-time state measurements for feedback control, but this can be challenging\nin many real-world systems, such as the brain, due to their complex and dynamic\nnature. This paper utilizes vibrational control -- an open-loop strategy -- to\nregulate network stability. Unlike conventional methods targeting network\nnodes, our approach focuses on manipulating network edges through vibrational\ninputs. We establish sufficient graph-theoretic conditions for\nvibration-induced functional modifications of network edges and stabilization\nof network systems as a whole. Additionally, we provide methods for designing\neffective vibrational control inputs and validate our theoretical findings\nthrough numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
