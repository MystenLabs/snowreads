Throughout\nthis work we seek a controller that is, robust to the uncertainty and\ndisturbance, accurate, and implementable. To perform these requirements, we use\na nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach for designing the controller and\nguaranteeing its stability. MATLAB-SIMULINK software is used to validate the\napproach and demonstrate the performance of the controller. Simulation results\nshow that the derived controller is stable, robust to the disturbance and\nuncertainties, accurate, and implementable.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
