The variability in text reports, due to multiple authors,\ncomplicates semantic consistency. To tackle these issues, we propose a two-step\napproach. Initially, text reports are converted into a standardized triplet\nformat, laying the groundwork for our novel concept of ``observations'' and\n``verdicts''. This approach refines the {Entity, Position, Exist} triplet into\nbinary questions, guiding towards a clear ``verdict''. We also innovate in\nvisual pre-training with a Meijering-based masking, focusing on features\nrepresentative of medical images' local context. By integrating this with our\ntext conversion method, our model advances cross-modal representation in a\nmultimodal contrastive learning framework, setting new benchmarks in medical\nimage analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
