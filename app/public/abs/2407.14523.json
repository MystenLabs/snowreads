The boundary is marked most sharply\nby abundant spherules containing unaltered grains of magnesioferrite spinel.\nHere we predict for the first time the sequential condensation of solids and\nliquids from the plume of vaporized rock expected from oblique K-T impacts. We\npredict highly oxidizing plumes that condense silicate liquid droplets bearing\nspinel grains whose compositions closely match those marking the actual\nboundary. Systematic global variations in spinel composition are consistent\nwith higher condensation temperatures for spinels found at Atlantic and\nEuropean sites than for those in the Pacific.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"PynDMFN9YLhY6EYddns_u7iV9qg7YC0EBwiWfsKoxtA","pdfSize":"2000247","objectId":"0x1e0a8423ba5edee1f3be574bfd041dbee2feae35f4af142d2bcc6fcd4f9f5a41","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
