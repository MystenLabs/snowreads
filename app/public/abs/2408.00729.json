However a naive treatment leads to singularities\nwhen considering the scattering of three or more particles. It is shown in\ndetail how the approach can be applied to multi-particle scattering in various\nmassive scalar theories in 1+1d, with or without integrability. The results for\nthe sinh-Gordon, Lieb-Liniger, and $O(N)$ non-linear sigma models are compared\nto exact results. It is shown how bound states can be considered in this\napproach by considering the attractive Lieb-Liniger model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
