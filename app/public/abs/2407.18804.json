Here, we present high-resolution imaging with the HST and\nVLT of the LyC, Ly$\\alpha$, rest-UV, and optical emission of J1316+2614.\nDetailed analysis of the LyC and UV light distributions reveals compact yet\nresolved profiles, with LyC and UV morphologies showing identical half-light\nradii of $\\simeq$ 220 pc. The continuum-subtracted Ly$\\alpha$ emission reveals\nan extended filamentary structure of $\\simeq$ 6.0 kpc oriented south-north with\nonly weak/residual flux within the stellar core, suggesting a Ly$\\alpha$\n\"hole\". J1316+2614 presents remarkably high SFR and stellar mass surface\ndensities of log($\\Sigma_{SFR}$ [$M_{\\odot}$/yr/kpc^2]) = 3.47$\\pm$0.11 and\nlog($\\Sigma_{M}$ [$M_{\\odot}$/pc^2]) = 4.20$\\pm$0.06, respectively, which are\namong the highest observed in star-forming galaxies. Our findings indicate that\nJ1316+2614 is a powerful, young, and compact starburst, leaking significant LyC\nphotons due to the lack of gas and dust within the starburst. We explore the\nconditions for gas expulsion using a simple energetic balance and find that,\ngiven the strong binding force in J1316+2614, a high star formation efficiency\n($\\epsilon_{SF} \\geq 0.7$) is necessary to remove the gas and explain its\nexposed nature. Our results thus suggest a close link between high\n$\\epsilon_{SF}$ and high $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. This high efficiency can also\nnaturally explain the remarkably high SFR, UV-luminosity, and efficient mass\ngrowth of J1316+2614, where at least 62% of its mass formed in the last 6 Myr.\nJ1316+2614 may exemplify an intense, feedback-free starburst with a high\n$\\epsilon_{SF}$, similar to those proposed for UV-bright galaxies at high\nredshifts.
