Several correction factors like polarization\ncorrection, relativistic effects (R) of the target wave function,\nCoulomb-deflection factor (C) due to the effect of the repulsion between the\nprojectile and the target nucleus, correction for projectile energy loss have\nbeen introduced. The mean charge state of the projectiles inside the target\nmaterial has been estimated using suitable empirical models and the fractional\ncharge state distribution has been calculated considering Lorentz distribution.\nFractional distribution of charge state of the projectile ions is used to\nobtain the charge state contributions of the electron capture cross-sections.\nThe effect of Simultaneous Multiple Ionization (SMI) has been considered in the\ntheory of Direct Coulomb Ionization (DCI). The theoretically obtained total\ncross-sections have been compared with the experimental findings obtained from\nvarious literature. The computation scheme has been depicted through sample\ncalculations of ionization cross-sections through electron capture mechanism.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6EwHmWFpAQp-LoxZ7smnVq7B3Ym4YHVB3WlN3LoDR6U","pdfSize":"458385"}
