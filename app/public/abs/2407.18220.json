We present an implementation of the\nframework and evaluate it on large data sets collected within educational\nsupport systems. Even though the equivalence problem for context-free languages\nis undecidable in general, the framework is able to handle a large portion of\nthese datasets. It introduces and combines techniques from several areas, such\nas an abstract grammar transformation language to identify equivalent grammars\nas well as sufficiently similar inequivalent grammars, theory-based comparison\nalgorithms for a large class of context-free languages, and a\ngraph-theory-inspired grammar canonization that allows to efficiently identify\nisomorphic grammars.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
