This is not a given, especially in disaster response and\nmilitary operations. We propose that, in these scenarios, decisions made by\ncore functions can be effectively delegated to the RAN by leveraging the RAN's\ncomputing resources and the micro-service programmability of the O-RAN system\narchitecture. This paper presents several concrete designs of core-RAN decision\ndelegation, including caching of core decisions and replicating some of the\ncore decision logic. Each design has revealed interesting performance and\nsecurity trade-offs that warrant further investigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2F-w5Z5PvS4dB-TfcIEf_-Axsz0MaiZnXIYQfNyEKl8","pdfSize":"339041"}
