Here, we apply the cumulant expansion to study non-equilibrium\nBose-Fermi mixtures, which allows us to explicitly include the missing\nnon-Gaussian quantum correlations, leading to a consistent dynamical theory of\na Bose-Fermi mixture near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. We first apply\nour theory to a study of atom-pair coherence in the gas, which is significantly\nenhanced by the competing influences of the Fermi sea and Bose-Einstein\ncondensation, in agreement with analytical calculations. Then, we study the\ndepletion of a degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture following a quench to the unitary\nregime, characterizing the resulting depletion of the Bose-Einstein condensate,\nthe deformation of the Fermi surface, and the production of molecules. We find\nthat at early times, the population dynamics scale quadratically with the hold\ntime, and define an associated characteristic timescale set by the parameters\nof the mixture and the width of the Feshbach resonance.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tkTBi9i0nnuro13lJ-07e9kQOylGbC3TK_y_cGHbV8s","pdfSize":"1279619"}
