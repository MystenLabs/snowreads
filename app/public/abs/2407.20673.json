Sentences often contain many category-independent\nwords, which leads to suboptimal performance of keyword-based methods. Instead\nof directly extracting keywords, we propose a label-guided prompt method to\nrepresent sentences and categories. To be specific, we design label-specific\nprompts to represent sentences by combining crucial contextual and semantic\ninformation. Further, the label is introduced into a prompt to obtain category\ndescriptions by utilizing a large language model. This kind of category\ndescriptions contain the characteristics of the aspect categories, guiding the\nconstruction of discriminative category prototypes. Experimental results on two\npublic datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art\nmethods with a 3.86% - 4.75% improvement in the Macro-F1 score.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kFf4H1AfdaEYt6qi6iTFxEevSPQk0nYDDPmQ_8AEd2Q","pdfSize":"777863"}
