However, there is still a lack of neural\nnetwork-based methods for point source identification, mainly due to the\ninherent solution singularity. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm to\nidentify point sources, utilizing a neural network combined with a singularity\nenrichment technique. We employ the fundamental solution and neural networks to\nrepresent the singular and regular parts, respectively, and then minimize an\nempirical loss involving the intensities and locations of the unknown point\nsources, as well as the parameters of the neural network. Moreover, by\ncombining the conditional stability argument of the inverse problem with the\ngeneralization error of the empirical loss, we conduct a rigorous error\nanalysis of the algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with\nseveral challenging experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
