Let $X$ be a random point\nwith uniform distribution in $[0,1]^d$. Consider the value $X_C$ equal to the\nnumber of lattice points $\\mathbb Z^d$ inside the body $C$ shifted by $X$. It\nis well known that $\\mathbb E X_C = \\mathrm{vol}(C)$. The question arises: what\ncan be said about the variance of this random variable? This paper answers this\nquestion in the case when $C$ is a polygon with vertices at integer points.\nMoreover, an explicit distribution of $X_T$ is given for the integer triangle\n$T$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
