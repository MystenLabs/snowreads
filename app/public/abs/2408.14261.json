To\nimprove the physical-layer security (PLS) of the considered downlink multiuser\ncommunications, we propose the fully-connected reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface aided round-robin scheduling (FCR-RS) and the FC-RIS and ground channel\nstate information (CSI) aided proportional fair scheduling (FCR-GCSI-PFS)\nschemes. Thereafter, we derive closed-form expressions of the zero secrecy rate\nprobability (ZSRP). Numerical results not only validate the closed-form ZSRP\nanalysis, but also verify that the proposed GCSI-PFS scheme obtains the same\nperformance gain as the full-CSI-aided PFS in FC-RIS-aided communications.\nFurthermore, optimizing the hovering altitude remarkably enhances the PLS of\nthe FC-RIS and UAV empowered multiuser communications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
