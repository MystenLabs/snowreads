However,\nopportunities to learn more about bug removal are limited. When students\nperform debugging tasks, they often use print statements because students do\nnot know how to use a debugger or have never used one.In this study, among\nvarious debugging methods, we focused on debugging using breakpoints. We\nimplemented a function in Scratch, a visual programming language, that allows\nfor self-learning of correct breakpoint placement and systematic debugging\nprocedures.In this paper, we discuss experimental results that clarify the\nchanges that occur in subjects when they learn debugging in Scratch.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
