Building on prior work of Bost we obtain an algebraicity\ncriterion for those curves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eqjThNTTskXJvHz2uG8g6zf3f1_AgCmRRv56jkAcnhs","pdfSize":"243055","objectId":"0x114ab8e13f56918ed33f5a62db700d27187ddb4dff3b01d178310e6042a2ec59","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
