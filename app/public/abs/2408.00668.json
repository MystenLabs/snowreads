Such interactions and $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupercurrents exist only for $\\mathbf{s_1}\\geq 2 \\mathbf{s_2}$. These\nsupercurrents are the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric extension of\nBerends-Burgers-van Dam higher-spin currents and generalize the linearized\nBel-Robinson tensor. The relevant $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents can be\nconsidered as the descendants of the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ primary supercurrent,\nwhich has a simple universal structure. An important feature of our outcomes is\nthat, ultimately, all $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents are built from the\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield strengths, which are constructed from the\nunconstrained analytical higher-spin prepotentials.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tQ9LT5iD5z3S_wF4e_g5P8xgISAPgHDIcJdtjtYO1U4","pdfSize":"663375","txDigest":"6dBSUD2s1H3G8sEDSJwCadCj6Bfy4YzNf7Z9zNuoW5bG","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
