We introduce a coupled climate-energy model for cascading power\noutages, which comprehensively captures the impacts of evolving climate\nextremes on renewable generation, and transmission and distribution networks.\nThe model is validated by the 2022 Puerto Rico catastrophic blackout during\nHurricane Fiona, the first-ever system-wide blackout event with complete\nweather-induced outage records. The model presents a novel resilience pattern\nthat was not captured by the present state-of-the-art models and reveals that\nearly failure of certain critical components surprisingly enhances overall\nsystem resilience. Sensitivity analysis of various behind-the-meter solar\nintegration scenarios demonstrates that lower integration levels (below 45%,\nincluding the current level) exhibit minimal impact on system resilience in\nthis event. However, surpassing this critical level without additional\nflexibility resources can exacerbate the failure probability due to\nsubstantially enlarged energy imbalances.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
