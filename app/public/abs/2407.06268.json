The\nDirichlet boundary condition cannot exist at arbitrarily large radius because\nit would give rise to colored asymptotic states in flat space. As observed in\n[1] this implies a deconfinement-confinement transition as the radius is\nincreased. We gather hints on the nature of this transition using perturbation\ntheory. We compute the anomalous dimensions of the lightest scalar operators in\nthe boundary theory, which are negative for the singlet and positive for\nnon-trivial representations. We also compute the correction to the coefficient\n$C_J$ and we estimate that the singlet operator reaches marginality before the\nvalue of the coupling at which $C_J=0$. These results favor the scenario of\nmerger and annihilation as the most promising candidate for the transition. For\nthe Neumann boundary condition, the lightest scalar operator is found to have a\npositive anomalous dimension, in agreement with the idea that this boundary\ncondition extrapolates smoothly to flat space. The perturbative calculations\nare made possible by a drastic simplification of the gauge field propagator in\nFried-Yennie gauge. We also derive a general result for the leading-order\nanomalous dimension of the displacement operator for a generic perturbation in\nAnti-de Sitter, showing that it is related to the beta function of bulk\ncouplings.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
