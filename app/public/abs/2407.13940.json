Many complex systems for which data-driven modeling and\ncontrol are sought provide streaming sensor data, the abundance of which can\npresent computational challenges but cannot be ignored. Streaming data can\nintermittently sample dynamically different regimes or rare events which could\nbe critical to model and control. Using ideas from subspace identification, we\npresent a method where the Grassmannian distance between the subspace of an\nextended observability matrix and the streaming segment of data is used to\nassess the `novelty' of the data. If this distance is above a threshold, it is\nadded to an archive and the Koopman operator is updated if not it is discarded.\nTherefore, our method identifies data from segments of trajectories of a\ndynamical system that are from different dynamical regimes, prioritizes\nminimizing the amount of data needed in updating the Koopman model and\nfurthermore reduces the number of basis functions by learning them adaptively.\nTherefore, by dynamically adjusting the amount of data used and learning basis\nfunctions, our method optimizes the model's accuracy and the system order.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ox-EfIzV1NsyDoYaFXdNjtLbIo7S_3l6MoPV29yiwCY","pdfSize":"462512"}
