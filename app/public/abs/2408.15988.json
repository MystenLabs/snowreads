Non-trivial polyharmonic Maa{\\ss} forms exist for zero,\nnegative and positive integer modular weights. Employing the finite modula\ngroup $S_4$ as a flavour symmetry group and assuming that the three left-handed\nlepton doublets furnish a triplet irreducible representation of $S_4$, we\nconstruct all possible 7- and 8-parameter lepton flavour models in which the\nneutrino masses are generated either by the Weinberg effective operator or by\nthe type I seesaw mechanism. We identify the phenomenologically viable models\nand obtain predictions for each of these models for the neutrino mass ordering,\nthe absolute neutrino mass scale, the Dirac and Majorana CP-violation phases\nand, correspondingly, for the sum of neutrino masses and the neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay effective Majorana mass. We comment on how these models can\nbe tested and conclude that they are all falsifiable. Detailed analyses are\npresented in the case of three representative benchmark lepton flavour\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
