The key step in achieving these results is deriving a physical-space\nMorawetz estimate for the associated generalized Regge-Wheeler system, without\nrelying on spherical harmonic decomposition.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
