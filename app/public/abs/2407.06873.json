In the $p$-adic setting, Orlik-Strauch constructed functors from the BGG\ncategory $\\mathcal{O}$ associated to the Lie algebra of $G$ to the category of\nlocally analytic representation of $G$. We generalize these functors to such\ngroups over non-archimedean local fields of arbitrary characteristic. To this\nend, we introduce the hyperalgebra of a non-archimedean Lie group $G$, which\ngeneralizes its Lie algebra, and consider topological modules over the algebra\nof locally analytic distributions on $G$ and subalgebras related to this\nhyperalgebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
