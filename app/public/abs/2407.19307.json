As an\napplication, we prove that every Feigin-Odesskii Poisson bracket on a\nprojective space can be included into a 5-dimensional linear space of\ncompatible Poisson brackets. We also construct new examples of linear spaces of\ncompatible Feigin-Odesskii Poisson brackets of dimension $>5$, coming from del\nPezzo surfaces of degree $>4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7tcw3LoRFoeCrhfJgVx7_QuXujd1hTsUGafPFBBxaqY","pdfSize":"261247"}
