In the present study, we evaluated the\nusability of various experimental methods for studying surface roughness. Our\nfindings indicated that height data obtained from optical methods often lack\naccuracy and should not be utilized for calculating surface roughness power\nspectra. Conversely, engineering stylus instruments and atomic force microscopy\n(AFM) typically yield reliable results that are consistent across the\noverlapping roughness length scale region. For surfaces with isotropic\nroughness, the two-dimensional (2D) power spectrum can be derived from the\none-dimensional (1D) power spectrum using several approaches, which we explored\nin this paper.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
