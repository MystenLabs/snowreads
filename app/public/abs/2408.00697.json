The satellite is modeled as a rigid body\nsubject to electromagnetic actuation. We focus on the underactuated scenario\nwhere the control torque is generated solely by magnetorquers. The main\ncontributions of this work include proving small-time local controllability\naround the relative equilibrium under some natural assumptions on the mass\ndistribution of the rigid body. This result is based on the Lie algebra rank\ncondition and Sussmann's controllability condition. Furthermore, it is shown\nthat the linearized system is not controllable in a neighborhood of the\nconsidered equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mb4r0KkjfZCwA_cpb3AcxYQrbLIMtuvwKL5iZQssOqM","pdfSize":"129497"}
