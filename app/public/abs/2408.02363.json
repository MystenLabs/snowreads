The mechanism includes two platforms, which are connected in\nparallel by three linear springs. The capability of deformation by manipulating\nboth platforms exceptionally complicates the problem. The analysis aims to\ndetermine all equilibrium configurations for two different cases: FIRST CASE\nall three springs have zero free lengths and SECOND CASE only two of the\nsprings have zero free lengths. The proposed procedure calculates the pose of\nthe top platform when it is not in contact with the surface, and then detects\nif the top platform is in contact to determine the equilibrium configurations.\nTo solve the geometric equations of the mechanism, we use Sylvester method of\nelimination. The approach obtains 4th and 48th degree polynomial equations for\nthe first and second cases, respectively. Numerical examples have been applied\nto verify the process of analysis. The results, which are numerically\ncalculated by software Maple, prove the validity of the analysis.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
