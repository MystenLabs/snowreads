Bulavka, Goodarzi, and Tancer\nrecently established the optimal bound for the unified generalization of the\nfractional and the colorful Helly theorems using a colored extension of the\nexterior algebra. In this paper, we combinatorially reduce both the fractional\nHelly theorem and its colorful version to a classical problem in extremal\ncombinatorics known as {weak saturation}. No such results connecting the\nfractional Helly theorem and weak saturation are known in the long history of\nliterature. These reductions, along with basic linear algebraic arguments for\nthe reduced weak saturation problems, let us give new short proofs of the\noptimal bounds for both the fractional Helly theorem and its colorful version\nwithout using exterior algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
