These artifacts were meticulously organized,\nreproduced, and copied by the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics.\nHowever, because of their ancient origins and severe ink erosion, identifying\ncharacters in the Houma Alliance Book is challenging, necessitating the use of\ndigital technology. In this paper, we propose a new ancient handwritten\ncharacter recognition database for the Houma alliance book, along with a novel\nbenchmark based on deep learning architectures. More specifically, a collection\nof 26,732 characters samples from the Houma Alliance Book were gathered,\nencompassing 327 different types of ancient characters through iterative\nannotation. Furthermore, benchmark algorithms were proposed by combining four\ndeep neural network classifiers with two data augmentation methods. This\nresearch provides valuable resources and technical support for further studies\non the Houma Alliance Book and other ancient characters. This contributes to\nour understanding of ancient culture and history, as well as the preservation\nand inheritance of humanity's cultural heritage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
