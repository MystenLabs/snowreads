In this paper, we propose a novel state\nrepresentation for Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents centered around the\ninformation perceivable by an autonomous agent, enabling the safe navigation of\npreviously uncharted road maps. Our approach surpasses several baseline models\nby a sig nificant margin in terms of safety and energy consumption metrics.\nThese improvements are achieved while maintaining a competitive average travel\nspeed. Our findings pave the way for more robust and reliable autonomous\nnavigation strategies, promising safer and more efficient urban traffic\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
