However, recent adversarial\nnoise-combating methods overlook the long-tailed distribution of real data,\nwhich can significantly harm the effect of denoising strategies. Meanwhile, the\nmismanagement of noisy labels further compromises the model's ability to handle\nlong-tailed data. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach to manage\ndata characterized by both long-tailed distributions and noisy labels. First,\nwe introduce a loss-distance cross-selection module, which integrates class\npredictions and feature distributions to filter clean samples, effectively\naddressing uncertainties introduced by noisy labels and long-tailed\ndistributions. Subsequently, we employ optimal transport strategies to generate\npseudo-labels for the noise set in a semi-supervised training manner, enhancing\npseudo-label quality while mitigating the effects of sample scarcity caused by\nthe long-tailed distribution. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, and the comprehensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method surpasses current state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be\navailable in the future.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
