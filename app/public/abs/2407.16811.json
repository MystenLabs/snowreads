Specifically, assumptions such as constant centroidal inertia have\nintroduced significant challenges and limitations in locomotion tasks. To\nenhance the agility and versatility of full-body humanoid robots, we formalize\na Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem that accounts for the variable\ncentroidal inertia of humanoid robots within a convex optimization framework,\nensuring computational efficiency for real-time operations. In the proposed\nformulation, we incorporate a centroidal inertia network designed to predict\nthe variable centroidal inertia over the MPC horizon, taking into account the\nswing foot trajectories -- an aspect often overlooked in ROM-based MPC\nframeworks. By integrating the MPC-based contact wrench planning with our\nlow-level whole-body controller, we significantly improve the locomotion\nperformance, achieving stable walking at higher velocities that are not\nattainable with the baseline method. The effectiveness of our proposed\nframework is validated through high-fidelity simulations using our full-body\nbipedal humanoid robot DRACO 3, demonstrating dynamic behaviors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
