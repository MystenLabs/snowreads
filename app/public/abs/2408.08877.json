Due to\nthe limited volume of domestic literature on MEG, this analysis focuses solely\non the global research landscape, providing insights from the past decade as a\nrepresentative sample. This study utilized bibliometric methods to explore and\nanalyze the progress, hotspots and developmental trends in international MEG\nresearch spanning from 1995 to 2022. The results indicated a dynamic and steady\ngrowth trend in the overall number of publications in MEG. Ryusuke Kakigi\nemerged as the most prolific author, while Neuroimage led as the most prolific\njournal. Current hotspots in MEG research encompass resting state, networks,\nfunctional connectivity, phase dynamics, oscillation, and more. Future trends\nin MEG research are poised to advance across three key aspects: disease\ntreatment and practical applications, experimental foundations and technical\nadvancements, and fundamental and advanced human cognition. In the future,\nthere should be a focus on enhancing cross-integration and utilization of MEG\nwith other instruments to diversify research methodologies in this field\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
