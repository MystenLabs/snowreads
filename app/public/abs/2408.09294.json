Action a' improves upon a in this manner if the set of beliefs at\nwhich a is preferred to b is a subset of the set of beliefs at which a' is\npreferred to b, irrespective of the risk-averse agent's utility function (in\nmoney). We provide a full characterization of this relation and discuss\napplications in politics, bilateral trade and insurance.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uysmVLexF3KFNtwqhEXkVAKcgq3axyijklHjhysexpk","pdfSize":"646474"}
