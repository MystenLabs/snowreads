Leveraging its structure for direct EM signal processing alongside its\nlow-power consumption, SIM holds promise for enhancing system performance\nwithin wireless communication systems. In this paper, we focus on SIM-assisted\nmulti-user multi-input and single-output (MU-MISO) system downlink scenarios in\nthe transmitter. We proposed a joint optimization method for SIM phase shift\nconfiguration and antenna power allocation based on the twin delayed deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to efficiently improve the sum\nrate. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms both deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and alternating optimization (AO)\nalgorithms. Furthermore, increasing the number of meta-atoms per layer of the\nSIM is always beneficial. However, continuously increasing the number of layers\nof SIM does not lead to sustained performance improvement.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
