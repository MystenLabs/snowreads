Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the \\textit{greybody} factors, emission rate, and partial\nabsorption cross section. It is shown that the Lorentz-violating parameter\n\\(\\bar{l}\\) has an important effect on the absorption cross section. Our\nanalysis also includes an examination of the topological charge,\ntemperature-dependent topology, and generalized free energy. In particular, we\nregard the AdS charged black hole with an antisymmetric tensor background as a\ntopological defect in the thermodynamic space, then the system has the same\ntopological classification to the charged RN-AdS black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
