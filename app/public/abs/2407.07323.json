After their birth, their orbits evolve, driven by\nsmall- or large-scale perturbations in the Galactic disk's gravitational\npotential. Here, we study the vertical motions of young stars over their first\nfew orbital periods, using a sample of OBA stars from \\textit{Gaia} E/DR3,\nwhich includes radial velocities and ages $\\tau$ from LAMOST. We constructed a\nparametric model for the time evolution of the stellar orbits' mean vertical\nactions $J_z$ as a function of Galactocentric radius, $R_{\\mathrm{GC}}$.\n  Accounting for data uncertainties, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nanalysis in annuli of Galactocentric radius to constrain the model parameters.\nOur best-fit model shows a remarkably linear increase of vertical actions with\nage across all Galactocentric radii examined. Orbital \\textit{heating} by\nrandom scattering could offer a straightforward interpretation for this trend.\nHowever, various other dynamical aspects of the Galactic disk, such as stars\nbeing born in a warped disk, might offer alternative explanations that could be\ntested in the future.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
