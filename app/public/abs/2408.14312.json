In this context, we\npropose a multi-beam object-localization (MBOL) model for enhancing the sensing\nbeampattern (SBP) gain of adjacent objects in CAV scenarios. Given the\nultra-narrow beams of mmWave MIMO systems, a single pencil beam is unsuitable\nfor closely located objects, which tend to require multiple beams. Hence, we\nformulate the SBP gain maximization problem, considering also the constraints\non the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) of the communication users\n(CUs), on the transmit power, and the constant modulus of the phase-shifters in\nthe mmWave hybrid transceiver. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a\npenalty-based triple alternating optimization algorithm to design the hybrid\nbeamformer. Finally, simulation results are provided for demonstrating the\nefficacy of the proposed model.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
