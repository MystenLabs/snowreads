Spatial distributions of electron concentrations,\nvelocities, Hall currents and voltages in the short FET channels are\ndetermined. The basic properties of current-voltage characteristics of\nquasi-ballistic FETs in magnetic field are analyzed, among these the kink-like\ncharacteristics of the near-ballistic device. Peculiarities of\nmagnetoresistance of such FETs are studied for low and high magnetic fields,\nand different current regimes. For nonlinear current regimes we revealed\nsignificantly larger magnetoresistance for the devices with higher\nballisticity. Numerical estimates of studied effects are presented. We suggest,\nthat the found results contribute to the physics of short FETs and can be used\nfor developing nanoscale devices for particular applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
