A\ndirected acyclic graph is designed to describe human's nature. Nurture beliefs\nare incorporated to connect outside events and the human's nature graph. No\nannotation resources are required due to the power of large language models.\nAmazon Fine Foods Reviews dataset is used as corpus and food-related\nmotivations are focused. Totally 92,990 relationship graphs are generated, of\nwhich 63% make logical sense. We make further analysis to investigate error\ntypes for optimization direction in future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
