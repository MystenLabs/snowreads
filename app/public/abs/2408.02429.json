Here we describe a neural-network force field parametrized to\nreproduce the r2SCAN potential energy landscape of HfO$_2$. Based on an\nautomatic differentiable implementation of the isothermal-isobaric (NPT)\nensemble with flexible cell fluctuations, we study the phase space of HfO$_2$.\nWe find excellent predictive capabilities regarding the lattice constants and\nexperimental X-ray diffraction data. The phase transition away from monoclinic\nis clearly visible at a temperature around 2000 K, in agreement with available\nexperimental data and previous calculations. Another abrupt change in lattice\nconstants occurs around 3000 K. While the resulting lattice constants are\ncloser to cubic, they exhibit a small tetragonal distortion, and there is no\nassociated change in volume. We show that this high-temperature structure is in\nagreement with the available high-temperature diffraction data.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nrLC-sE7l9OYJMnnSzNZCT2zeyVfEkB3FNHTmksrNSQ","pdfSize":"962498"}
