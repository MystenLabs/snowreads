This property makes them highly appealing\nfor designing control, estimation, and optimization algorithms in applications\nwith stringent performance requirements. However, the set of tools available\nfor analyzing the interconnection of fixed-time stable systems is rather\nlimited compared to their asymptotic counterparts. In this paper, we address\nsome of these limitations by exploiting the emergence of multiple time scales\nin nonlinear singularly perturbed dynamical systems, where the fast dynamics\nand the slow dynamics are fixed-time stable on their own. By extending the\nso-called composite Lyapunov method from asymptotic stability to the context of\nfixed-time stability, we provide a novel class of Lyapunov-based sufficient\nconditions to certify fixed-time stability in a class of singularly perturbed\ndynamical systems. The results are illustrated, analytically and numerically,\nusing a fixed-time gradient flow system interconnected with a fixed-time plant\nand an additional high-order example.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
