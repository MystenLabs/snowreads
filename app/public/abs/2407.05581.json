More precisely, we prove that all\nsuch symmetric biderivations are trivial. As applications, we determine all\nbiderivations on Takiff algebras and symplectic oscillator algebras, as well as\nall supersymmetric biderivations over some Lie superalgebras including all\nfinite-dimensional classical simple Lie superalgebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
