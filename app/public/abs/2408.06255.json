We also show how various degeneracies involving nonstandard\nneutrino interaction parameters are broken in a combined analysis of the three\ndatasets.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
