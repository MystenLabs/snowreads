In addition to a systematic\nreview of the foundations, and an attempt to put in order examples and several\nelementary constructions, we detail several recent tools developed for\nnon-commutative geometry, in particular the holonomy groupoid of Androulidakis\nand Skandalis and various methods for resolving singularities. We also\nintroduce various homotopic notions, and end with a series of open questions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
