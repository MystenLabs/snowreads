However, they often\nunderestimate how varied our usage of words is. In this paper, we take the\nfirst steps in exploring the contextual nuances of words by creating conceptual\nlandscapes -- 2D surfaces representing the pragmatic usage of words -- that\nconceptual engineers can use to inform their projects. We use the spoken\ncomponent of the British National Corpus and BERT to create contextualised word\nembeddings, and use Gaussian Mixture Models, a selection of metrics, and\nqualitative analysis to visualise and numerically represent lexical landscapes.\nSuch an approach has not yet been used in the conceptual engineering literature\nand provides a detailed examination of how different words manifest in various\ncontexts that is potentially useful to conceptual engineering projects. Our\nfindings highlight the inherent complexity of conceptual engineering, revealing\nthat each word exhibits a unique and intricate landscape. Conceptual Engineers\ncannot, therefore, use a one-size-fits-all approach when improving words -- a\ntask that may be practically intractable at scale.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wh5bA51kGPgU2Y75Uxgifs4_BxsFMo1vke84htFWPbE","pdfSize":"7159092"}
