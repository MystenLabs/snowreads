The biases are measured by the mismatch between the\nrisk factor distribution and the $K$ data-generating distributions with respect\nto an optimal transport (OT) distance. In this situation the decision-maker can\nexploit the information contained in the biased samples by solving a\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem, where the ambiguity set is\ndefined as the intersection of $K$ OT neighborhoods, each of which is centered\nat the empirical distribution on the samples generated by a biased data source.\nWe show that if the decision-maker has a prior belief about the biases, then\nthe out-of-sample performance of the DRO solution can improve with $K$ --\nirrespective of the magnitude of the biases. We also show that, under standard\nconvexity assumptions, the proposed DRO problem is computationally tractable if\neither $K$ or the dimension of the risk factors is kept constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
