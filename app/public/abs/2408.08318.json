It is a key piece of legislation both for the\ncitizens at the heart of AI technologies and for the industry active in the\ninternal market. The AI Act imposes progressive compliance on organisations -\nboth private and public - involved in the global value chain of AI systems and\nmodels marketed and used in the EU. While the Act is unprecedented on an\ninternational scale in terms of its horizontal and binding regulatory scope,\nits global appeal in support of trustworthy AI is one of its major challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
