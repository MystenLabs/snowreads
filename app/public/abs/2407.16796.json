These infrastructure systems generally\nconsist of multiple types of infrastructure assets that are interdependent. In\nthe event of a disaster, some of the infrastructure assets can be damaged and\ndisabled, creating failures that propagate to other assets that depend on the\ndisabled assets and cause a cascade of failures that may lead to a potential\nsystem collapse. We present a bilevel interdiction model in this paper to study\nthis problem of cascading failures in a system of interdependent infrastructure\nsystems with a nondeterministic dependency graph. We also propose a\ncomputationally tractable reformulation of the proposed bilevel model and\nutilize a Benders-type decomposition algorithm to solve the resulting\nformulation. Computational experiments are performed using infrastructure\nnetworks generated from anonymized real-world data to validate the performance\nof this algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
