However, it remains an open\nquestion how this individualization can be implemented. To tackle this question\nwe conduct a randomized controlled trial on a large digital self-learning\nplatform. We develop an algorithm based on two convolutional neural networks\nthat assigns tasks to $4,365$ learners according to their learning paths.\nLearners are randomized into three groups: two treatment groups -- a\ngroup-based adaptive treatment group and an individual adaptive treatment group\n-- and one control group. We analyze the difference between the three groups\nwith respect to effort learners provide and their performance on the platform.\nOur null results shed light on the multiple challenges associated with the\nindividualization of learning paths.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
