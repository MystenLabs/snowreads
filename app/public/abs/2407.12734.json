Previous works have proposed corpora with\nvarying complex structures, and human written instructions. We instead attempt\nto provide a comprehensive synthetic benchmark for testing builder agents over\na series of distinct tasks that comprise of common building operations. We\nbelieve this approach allows us to probe specific strengths and weaknesses of\ndifferent agents, and test the ability of LLMs in the challenging area of\nspatial reasoning and vector based math.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
