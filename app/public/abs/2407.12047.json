These sums\nconverge, but converge very slowly. They are transformed into sums involving\nMertens' prime product with the remainder term which are estimated by means of\nChebyshev's {\\theta}-function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
