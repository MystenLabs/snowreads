The design maneuvers minority carrier injection through a\nthin p-GaN base region, while the majority carrier holes for base current are\ninjected from thick p-GaN regions adjacent to the thin p-GaN base. The design\nis realized using a regrowth emitter approach with SiO$_2$ as a spacer between\nthe emitter layer and the thick p-GaN base contact regions. The fabricated\ndevice demonstrated state-of-art output current density (I$_{C, max}$) ~275\nkA/cm$^2$ with a current gain ($\\beta$) of 9, and 17 for the planar HBT design\n(I$_{C, max}$ =150 kA/cm$^2$). The reported results highlight the potential of\nthe selective injection design to overcome the persistent GaN HBT design\ntradeoff between base resistance and current gain, paving the way for\nnext-generation radio frequency and mm-Wave applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
