An Empirical Study on Extraction\n  of Inter-demographic Sentiments","authors":"Kunitomo Tanaka, Ryohei Sasano, Koichi Takeda","authorsParsed":[["Tanaka","Kunitomo",""],["Sasano","Ryohei",""],["Takeda","Koichi",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2024 08:13:25 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-09","timestamp":1723104805000,"abstract":"  Large language models (LLMs) are supposed to acquire unconscious human\nknowledge and feelings, such as social common sense and biases, by training\nmodels from large amounts of text. However, it is not clear how much the\nsentiments of specific social groups can be captured in various LLMs. In this\nstudy, we focus on social groups defined in terms of nationality, religion, and\nrace/ethnicity, and validate the extent to which sentiments between social\ngroups can be captured in and extracted from LLMs. Specifically, we input\nquestions regarding sentiments from one group to another into LLMs, apply\nsentiment analysis to the responses, and compare the results with social\nsurveys. The validation results using five representative LLMs showed higher\ncorrelations with relatively small p-values for nationalities and religions,\nwhose number of data points were relatively large. This result indicates that\nthe LLM responses including the inter-group sentiments align well with actual\nsocial survey results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
