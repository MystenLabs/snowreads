Such\nregularity is commonly known as Zipf's law, and plenty of problem-specific\nexplanations for its emergence have been provided in different fields. Yet, an\nexplanation for Zipf's law ubiquity is currently lacking. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate from first principles that Zipf's behavior naturally emerges as a\nlocal approximation to the order statistics generated by any ranking process.\nWe validate our results against several relevant examples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MgAItPMFIug-NN9kWhkuhU_jtCuYGBNq4xcJOjjeWtE","pdfSize":"505992"}
