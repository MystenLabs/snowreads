Here, we report the\ndiscovery of giant room temperature odd-parity magnetoresistance (OMR) in a\nbilayer graphene (BLG) heterostructure interfaced with Cr$_2$Te$_2$Ge$_6$\n(CGT). Using magnetotransport measurements, we demonstrate that the BLG/CGT\nheterostructure exhibits a significant antisymmetric longitudinal\nmagnetoresistance, indicative of intrinsic time-reversal symmetry (TRS)\nbreaking in the system. We show that the OMR is tunable via electrostatic\ngating. Additionally, the OMR is pronounced near the band edges and diminishes\nwith increasing charge carrier density in graphene. Our theoretical analysis\nreveals that this phenomenon arises from the coupling of the out-of-plane\ncomponents of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment to the applied\nmagnetic field in a TRS-broken system. Our findings establish OMR as a\nsignificant probe for TRS breaking in quantum materials in which the crystal\nsymmetries preclude the appearance of anomalous Hall effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
