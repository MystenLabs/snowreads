Such systems aim to use the order of interactions in a user's history\nto predict future interactions. The premise is that the order of interactions\nand sequential patterns play an essential role. Therefore, it is crucial to use\ndatasets that exhibit a sequential structure to evaluate sequential\nrecommenders properly.\n  We apply several methods based on the random shuffling of the user's sequence\nof interactions to assess the strength of sequential structure across 15\ndatasets, frequently used for sequential recommender systems evaluation in\nrecent research papers presented at top-tier conferences. As shuffling\nexplicitly breaks sequential dependencies inherent in datasets, we estimate the\nstrength of sequential patterns by comparing metrics for shuffled and original\nversions of the dataset. Our findings show that several popular datasets have a\nrather weak sequential structure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
