This symmetry acts on spacetime fields only up to homotopy, and the\nextension is only visible at the level of higher components of the action. We\nexplicitly compute this for the holomorphic twist of ten-dimensional\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, which produces a nontrivial action of a\nhigher $L_\\infty$-algebra on (a graded version) of five-dimensional affine\nspace.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
