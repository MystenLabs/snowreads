The brown dwarf desert is the lack of brown\ndwarfs around main sequence stars within $\\sim3$~AU and is thought to be caused\nby differences in formation mechanisms between a star and planet. To date, only\n$\\sim40$ transiting brown dwarfs have been confirmed. \\systemt is a\n$73.6\\pm2.4$ \\mjupnospace, $1.00\\pm0.02$ \\rjup brown dwarf orbiting a\n$1.004_{-0.022}^{+0.031}$ \\msunnospace, $1.105_{-0.012}^{+0.012}$ \\rsun\nsun-like star on a 60.33~d orbit with an eccentricity of $0.77989\\pm0.00049$.\nThe discovery was detected within \\tess sectors 5 (30 minute cadence) and 32 (2\nminute and 20 second cadence). It was then confirmed with 31 radial velocity\nmeasurements with \\feros by the WINE collaboration and photometric observations\nwith the Next Generation Transit Survey. Stellar modelling of the host star\nestimates an age of $\\sim8$~Gyr, which is supported by estimations from\nkinematics likely placing the object within the thin disc. However, this is not\nconsistent with model brown dwarf isochrones for the system age suggesting an\ninflated radius. Only one other transiting brown dwarf with an eccentricity\nhigher than 0.6 is currently known in the brown dwarf desert. Demographic\nstudies of brown dwarfs have suggested such high eccentricity is indicative of\nstellar formation mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
