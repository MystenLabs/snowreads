Although quantum noise\nhas been widely addressed, effectively reducing thermal noise remains\nchallenging in detecting weak magnetic fields. We employ an anisotropic\nelliptical YIG sphere as a magnetic field probe to establish a parametric\namplification interaction of magnons and induce magnon squeezing effects. These\neffects can effectively suppress thermal noise in the magnon mode and amplify\nweak magnetic field signals from external sources. Specifically, complete\nsuppression of thermal noise can be achieved by placing the YIG sphere in a\nsqueezed vacuum reservoir. Our scheme has the potential to inspire advancements\nin thermal noise suppression for quantum sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uCsp4D9LF5GbF8lqMIyPwT05-SBpd4M70EXjCm37YPo","pdfSize":"857567","txDigest":"2zRCiGza9YqGpsii9X8Kp9gJUZCwSFxTesK27B26DiAY","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
