Traditionally considered distinct paradigms, connectionist AI\nfocuses on neural networks, while symbolic AI emphasizes symbolic\nrepresentation and logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs),\nexemplified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, highlight the potential of connectionist\narchitectures in handling human language as a form of symbols. The study argues\nthat LLM-empowered Autonomous Agents (LAAs) embody this paradigm convergence.\nBy utilizing LLMs for text-based knowledge modeling and representation, LAAs\nintegrate neuro-symbolic AI principles, showcasing enhanced reasoning and\ndecision-making capabilities. Comparing LAAs with Knowledge Graphs within the\nneuro-symbolic AI theme highlights the unique strengths of LAAs in mimicking\nhuman-like reasoning processes, scaling effectively with large datasets, and\nleveraging in-context samples without explicit re-training. The research\nunderscores promising avenues in neuro-vector-symbolic integration,\ninstructional encoding, and implicit reasoning, aimed at further enhancing LAA\ncapabilities. By exploring the progression of neuro-symbolic AI and proposing\nfuture research trajectories, this work advances the understanding and\ndevelopment of AI technologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
