This phenomenon is popularly known as\nsuperradiance. In addition to rotation in the spacetime, charge plays a crucial\nrole in the amplification process. In the present study, we have considered the\nspacetime of a magnetically charged rotating black hole emerging from the\ncoupling of nonlinear electromagnetic field configuration to gravity. Due to\nthis black hole spacetime, we have studied the scattering states of a massive\nscalar field and investigated the superradiant amplification process. We find\nthat the magnetic charge of the spacetime affects the magnitude of the\namplification and also significantly enlarges the allowed frequency ranges for\nwhich superradiance happens. In comparison, our analysis reveals that some of\nthe behaviours are quite similar to what has been found in the case of the\nKerr-Newmann black hole. Moreover, in specific parameter spaces, we observe\nexact similarities, which could imply a probable correspondence between the\nmagnetically charged black hole and the Kerr-Newman black hole in certain\nscenarios. In addition to this, we have investigated the superradiant\ninstability regime due to the massive potential barrier and also compared our\nresults with that of the Kerr-Newmann black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
