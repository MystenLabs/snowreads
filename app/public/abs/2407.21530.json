The workshop fostered a shared task to collect evidence on data\ncontamination in current available datasets and models. The goal of the shared\ntask and associated database is to assist the community in understanding the\nextent of the problem and to assist researchers in avoiding reporting\nevaluation results on known contaminated resources. The shared task provides a\nstructured, centralized public database for the collection of contamination\nevidence, open to contributions from the community via GitHub pool requests.\nThis first compilation paper is based on 566 reported entries over 91\ncontaminated sources from a total of 23 contributors. The details of the\nindividual contamination events are available in the platform. The platform\ncontinues to be online, open to contributions from the community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
