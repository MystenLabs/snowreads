A new accuracy\nschedule is proposed to improve the sampling quality by significantly reducing\nthe reconstruction loss. We show evidence that our method is appropriate for\ngenerating molecules with satisfied diversity even when a smaller number of\nsampling steps is used. A classifier-free guidance method is adapted for\nconditional generation. It is also worthwhile to point out that after\ngenerative training, our model can be fine-tuned on regression and\nclassification tasks with the state-of-the-art performance, which opens the\ngate of building all-in-one models in a single module style.
