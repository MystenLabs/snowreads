In particular we show how inaccurately\nevaluated integrands can lead to severe precision problems. The tricky and\nserious part of the problem is especially in its detection, when for example a\nsimple macroscopic visualization of the integrand does not indicate any\npotential problems and obtained results are often wrongly treated as correct.\nTo solve the problem, it is crucial to decide if it is sufficient to evaluate\nthe integrand in the standard double arithmetic or if a higher precision\narithmetic has to be used. We compare and recommend numerical quadratures for\nselected examples and different parameter values, especially for problematic\ncases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
