In particular, we obtain simple bounds (both upper and lower)\nfor $\\nu_p$, using the Legendre-de Polignac formula. Other iterated quantities\nsuch as the Berezin function, are also considered. Beyond their recreational\ncharacter, such quantities, often related to very large numbers, may find\napplications for cryptography purposes. Finally, lower and upper bounds for the\n$p$-adic valuation of Stirling numbers of the first kind and Catalan numbers\nare briefly discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
