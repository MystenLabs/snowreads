Along the domain-wall, the rotors polarize in opposite directions,\ncausing the electron to localize along a particular lattice direction. The\nrotor-electron coupling is identified as the origin of a structural instability\nin the crystal that leads to the domain-wall formation via a symmetry-breaking\nprocess. Our results provide the first theoretical description of ferroelectric\npolarons, as discussed in the context of soft semiconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
