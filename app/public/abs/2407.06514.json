Although the\nintroduction of blind spot operations can prevent identity mapping from noise\nto noise, it imposes stringent requirements on the receptive fields in the\nnetwork design, thereby limiting overall performance. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a single mask scheme for self-supervised denoising\ntraining, which eliminates the need for blind spot operation and thereby\nremoves constraints on the network structure design. Furthermore, to achieve\ndenoising across entire image during inference, we propose a multi-mask scheme.\nOur method, featuring the asymmetric mask scheme in training and inference,\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on existing real noisy image datasets.\nAll the source code will be made available to the public.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
