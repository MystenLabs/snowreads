The associated code can solve both linear and non-linear\nproblems, and examples for incompressible flow equations are considered. The\nsoftware, which is based on a Python interface to the Firedrake system, allows\nfor a compact definition of the problem considered by providing a few lines of\ncode in a high-level language. The software is provided with efficient\niterative linear solvers for optimal control problems with PDEs as constraints.\nThe use of advanced preconditioning techniques results in a significant\nspeed-up of the solution process for large-scale problems. We present numerical\nexamples of the applicability of the software on classical control problems\nwith PDEs as constraints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
