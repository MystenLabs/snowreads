Among these devices, memristive transistors have attracted\nsignificant attention due to their superior symmetry, stability, and retention\ncharacteristics compared to two-terminal memristors. However, the lack of a\nrobust model that accurately captures their complex electrical behavior has\nhindered further exploration of their potential. In this work, we present the\nGEneral Memristive transistor model (GEM), a comprehensive voltage-controlled\nmodel that addresses this gap. The GEM model incorporates a state-dependent\nupdate function, a voltage-controlled moving window function, and a nonlinear\ncurrent output function, enabling precise representation of the electrical\ncharacteristics of memristive transistors. In experiments, the GEM model not\nonly demonstrates a 300% improvement in modeling the memory behavior but also\naccurately captures the inherent nonlinearities and physical limits of these\ndevices. This advancement significantly enhances the realistic simulation of\nmemristive transistors, thereby facilitating further exploration and\napplication development.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
