Our study begins by exploring\nthe geometrical and dynamical properties of the Kerr-MOG spacetime. We employ\nthe numerical kludge (NK) method for waveform simulations and reveal that the\nparameter $\\alpha$, representing deviations from general relativity (GR),\nsignificantly impacts the frequencies of geodesic orbits and, consequently, the\nEMRI waveforms. However, the waveform confusion problem remains mainly\nunresolved, posing a challenge in distinguishing between the underlying\ngravitational theories based on the observed EMRI waveforms. Notably, by\nincorporating the effects of radiation reaction, we observe a substantial\nreduction in the waveform overlap over time. This reduction could enhance our\nability to discern between different waveforms over an extended period.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ttaFYns5NlxntpveF7cfQn8MaNde8uJsOV5t4gfxX6g","pdfSize":"1420860"}
