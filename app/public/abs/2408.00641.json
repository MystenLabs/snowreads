To address this, we\nfirst propose the concept of meta-interactions to refine interaction behaviors\nin Ethereum, and based on this, we present a dual self-supervision enhanced\nEthereum fraud detection framework, named Meta-IFD. This framework initially\nintroduces a generative self-supervision mechanism to augment the interaction\nfeatures of accounts, followed by a contrastive self-supervision mechanism to\ndifferentiate various behavior patterns, and ultimately characterizes the\nbehavioral representations of accounts and mines potential fraud risks through\nmulti-view interaction feature learning. Extensive experiments on real Ethereum\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in\ndetecting common Ethereum fraud behaviors such as Ponzi schemes and phishing\nscams. Additionally, the generative module can effectively alleviate the\ninteraction distribution imbalance in Ethereum data, while the contrastive\nmodule significantly enhances the framework's ability to distinguish different\nbehavior patterns. The source code will be released on GitHub soon.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
