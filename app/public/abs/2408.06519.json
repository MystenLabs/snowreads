In contrast to an\norderly point process, for which the probability of observing more than one\nevent over a short time interval is negligible, the bursting intensity causes\nan extreme clustering of events around the singularity. We propose a\nnonparametric approach to detect such bursts in the intensity. It relies on a\nheavy traffic condition, which admits inference for point processes over a\nfinite time interval. With Monte Carlo evidence, we show that our testing\nprocedure exhibits size control under the null, whereas it has high rejection\nrates under the alternative. We implement our approach on high-frequency data\nfor the EUR/USD spot exchange rate, where the test statistic captures abnormal\nsurges in trading activity. We detect a nontrivial amount of intensity bursts\nin these data and describe their basic properties. Trading activity during an\nintensity burst is positively related to volatility, illiquidity, and the\nprobability of observing a drift burst. The latter effect is reinforced if the\norder flow is imbalanced or the price elasticity of the limit order book is\nlarge.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
