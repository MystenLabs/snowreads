This\nfunction acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient\nsystems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood\ntransition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here,\nwe leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven\ntechniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to\nobtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first\nto determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the\nunderlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the\ndownhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are\nregressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show\nthat our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an\narchetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a\nnanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the\nstability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant\ncomputational advantages. Our data-driven approach is of interest for a wide\nrange of applications in which to assess the fluctuating dynamics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Computational Physics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
