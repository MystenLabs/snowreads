The optimization problem is primarily complicated by the\nhyperbolic character and the second-order bilinear structure in the governing\nwave equation. While the control parameter is discretized using the piecewise\nconstant elements, the state discretization is realized through an auxiliary\nfirst-order system along with the leapfrog time-stepping method and continuous\npiecewise linear elements. The resulting fully discrete minimization problem\n($\\text{P}_h$) is shown to be well-defined. Furthermore, building upon a\nsuitable CFL-condition, we prove stability and uniform convergence of the state\ndiscretization. Our final result is the strong convergence result for\n($\\text{P}_h$) in the following sense: Given a local minimizer $\\overline \\nu$\nof (P) satisfying a reasonable growth condition, there exists a sequence of\nlocal minimizers of ($\\text{P}_h$) converging strongly towards $\\overline \\nu$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
