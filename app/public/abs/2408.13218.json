It increases the signal from possible\naxions and axion-like particles in the experiment by nearly four orders of\nmagnitude. The total round-trip optical losses of the power circulating in the\ncavity must be minimized in order to maximize the resonant enhancement of the\ncavity, which is an important figure of merit for ALPS II. Lower optical losses\nalso increase the cavity storage time and with the 123 meter long ALPS II RC we\nhave demonstrated the longest storage time of a two-mirror optical cavity. We\nmeasured a storage time of $7.17 \\pm 0.01$ ms, equivalent to a linewidth of\n44.4 Hz and a finesse of 27,500 at a wavelength of 1064 nm.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yugSwiMLtPUlg26bi47_mC8iyUGdExA9qsn3CxbY7HU","pdfSize":"4602588"}
