This\nstudy delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics\ncommonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via\nAtomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and\ndielectric strength (EBD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on\nmetal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of\nHfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter\nshows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of\nthe relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K.\nAdditionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked\ntheir properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the\nimpact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography\n(acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
