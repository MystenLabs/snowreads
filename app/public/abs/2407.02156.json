As an alternative, we investigate the extent to which synthetically\ngenerated music excerpts can improve tagging systems when only small annotated\ncollections are available. To this end, we release GTZAN-synth, a synthetic\ndataset that follows the taxonomy of the well-known GTZAN dataset while being\nten times larger in data volume. We first observe that simply adding this\nsynthetic dataset to the training split of GTZAN does not result into\nperformance improvements. We then proceed to investigating domain adaptation,\ntransfer learning and fine-tuning strategies for the task at hand and draw the\nconclusion that the last two options yield an increase in accuracy. Overall,\nthe proposed approach can be considered as a first guide in a promising field\nfor future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JrsReVasnyszYqmJhjPn4pxuoZo6esCp91Hjey2qpH0","pdfSize":"1164983"}
