Simulations were performed for two types of vacancy structures,\n$\\mathrm{V}_9 + \\mathrm{W}_1 + \\mathrm{V}_9$ and $\\mathrm{V}_{10} +\n\\mathrm{W}_4 + \\mathrm{V}_{10}$ ($\\mathrm{V}_{n}$ means that a vacancy\ncorresponds to the absence of $n$ W atoms, and $\\mathrm{W}_{m}$ indicates that\nthere are $m$ W atoms between two vacancies) in various cases of temperature\nand hydrogen atom concentration. Under the vacancy structure $\\mathrm{V}_9 +\n\\mathrm{W}_1 + \\mathrm{V}_9$, we observed vacancy coalescence for all the cases\nof the temperature and the number of hydrogen atoms. Evaluating the potential\nenergy required for removing one of the W atoms between two vacancies, we found\nthat high temperature and existing hydrogen atoms in the vacancies facilitate\nvacancy coalescence, and that under the structure $\\mathrm{V}_{10} +\n\\mathrm{W}_4 + \\mathrm{V}_{10}$, hydrogen atoms facilitate vacancy coalescence\nmost strongly when the number is around 45 to 54 in each vacancy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
