We find that the appropriate loop\ndecay process could develop a triangle singularity in the invariant mass\n$M_{\\pi\\Lambda}$ around $1.35$ GeV, with the shape depending on the quantum\nnumbers of $\\Sigma^*$ states that couple to the final $\\pi\\Lambda$ system.\nEspecially, the $\\Sigma(1380)1/2^-$ state newly predicted in the pentaquark\nmodel, if exists, significantly enhances the TS contribution and sharpens the\nTS peak due to the $S$-wave $\\Sigma^*\\pi\\Sigma$ vertex in the loop. Therefore,\nthe existence of the $\\Sigma(1380)1/2^-$ state can be examined by measuring the\nTS signal in $\\Lambda^+_c \\to \\gamma \\pi^+ \\Lambda$. Considering also possible\ntree-level diagrams, we additionally obtain the branching ratio ${\\rm\nBr}(\\Lambda^+_c \\to \\gamma \\pi^+ \\Lambda)\\simeq 1.5\\times 10^{-5}$. We suggest\nthe investigation of this reaction by future BESIII, LHCb, and Belle\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
