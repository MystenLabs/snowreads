We consider two classical\nproblems, ski rental and non-clairvoyant job scheduling, and obtain new online\nalgorithms that use predictions to make their decisions. These algorithms are\noblivious to the performance of the predictor, improve with better predictions,\nbut do not degrade much if the predictions are poor.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
