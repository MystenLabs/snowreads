Currently, ground-based CMB telescopes are mainly\nlocated in the southern hemisphere, leaving an untapped potential for\nobservations in the northern hemisphere. In this work, we investigate the\nperspective of a northern hemisphere CMB polarization telescope (NHT) to detect\nPGWs and present mock data for such a project. We forecast the detection\nsensitivity on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r of NHT and compare it with the\nexisted ground-based experiments, also search for optimal experimental\nconfigurations that can achieve the best sensitivity of r. Our results indicate\nthat, considering realistic experimental conditions, the first year of NHT\nobservations combined with Planck can achieve a precision of \\sigma (r)= 0.015,\nreaching the level of BICEP2/Keck, with significant potential for improvement\nwith subsequent instrumentation parameter enhancements.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_YDZnitlKfGOnGoi0Q9d-96tC6WyaG5xp_AHfVUHfIo","pdfSize":"766535","txDigest":"6hALy649BGnUXzUzZ3houZFPZ55ZwQeYdCxH464yqLBv","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
