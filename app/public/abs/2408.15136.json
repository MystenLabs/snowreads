Under\nthese circumstances, the inference network is particularly prone to\noverfitting, and using it without accounting for the computational uncertainty\narising from the lack of identifiability of the network weights can lead to\nunreliable results. To address this issue, we propose using Bayesian neural\nnetworks in low-budget simulation-based inference, thereby explicitly\naccounting for the computational uncertainty of the posterior approximation. We\ndesign a family of Bayesian neural network priors that are tailored for\ninference and show that they lead to well-calibrated posteriors on tested\nbenchmarks, even when as few as $O(10)$ simulations are available. This opens\nup the possibility of performing reliable simulation-based inference using very\nexpensive simulators, as we demonstrate on a problem from the field of\ncosmology where single simulations are computationally expensive. We show that\nBayesian neural networks produce informative and well-calibrated posterior\nestimates with only a few hundred simulations.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
