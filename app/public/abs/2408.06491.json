Accurate identification of gravitational wave\ncandidates and rapid release of sky localization information are crucial for\nthe success of these electromagnetic follow-up observations. However, searches\nfor gravitational wave candidates in real time suffer a non-negligible false\nalarm rate. By leveraging the sky localization information and other metadata\nassociated with gravitational wave candidates, GWSkyNet, a machine learning\nclassifier developed by Cabero et al. (2020), demonstrated promising accuracy\nfor the identification of the origin of event candidates. We improve the\nperformance of the classifier for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run by\nreviewing and updating the architecture and features used as inputs by the\nalgorithm. We also retrain and fine-tune the classifier with data from the\nthird observing run. To improve the prospect of electromagnetic follow-up\nobservations, we incorporate GWSkyNet into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's low-latency\ninfrastructure as an automatic pipeline for the evaluation of gravitational\nwave alerts in real time. We test the readiness of the algorithm on a\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA mock data challenge campaign. The results show that by\nthresholding on the GWSkyNet score, noise masquerading as astrophysical sources\ncan be rejected efficiently and the majority of true astrophysical signals\ncorrectly identified.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
