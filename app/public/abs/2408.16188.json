This model enables\nefficient computation of interatomic distances using what we call the Conformal\nCoordinate Matrix (C-matrix). The C-matrix not only simplifies the mathematical\nframework but also reduces the number of operations required for distance\ncalculations compared to traditional methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
