We study in particular convexity, Legendre conjugacy,\ndifferentiability, Moreau envelopes, coercivity, minimizers, recession\nfunctions, and perspective functions of these constructs, as well as their\nasymptotic behavior as the parameter varies. The special case of the proximal\nexpectation of a family of functions is also discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
