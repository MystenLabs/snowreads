The asymptotic distributions of the test statistics\nunder both the null and alternative hypotheses are obtained. The performance of\nthe proposed tests is evaluated and compared with existing tests through a\nMonte Carlo simulation experiment. The newly proposed tests exhibit greater\npower than existing tests for the Pareto type-I distribution. Finally, the\nmethodology is applied to real-world data sets.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
