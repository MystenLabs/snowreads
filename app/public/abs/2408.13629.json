Such 3D information is beneficial for analyzing the bird's behavior and\nphysiological shape, for example by tracking motion, shape, and appearance\nchanges. From a computer vision perspective birds are especially challenging\ndue to their rapid and oftentimes non-rigid motions. We propose an approach to\nreconstruct the 3D pose and shape from monocular videos of a specific breed of\nseabird - the common murre. Our approach comprises a full pipeline of\ndetection, tracking, segmentation, and temporally consistent 3D reconstruction.\nAdditionally, we propose a temporal loss that extends current single-image 3D\nbird pose estimators to the temporal domain. Moreover, we provide a real-world\ndataset of 10000 frames of video observations on average capture nine birds\nsimultaneously, comprising a large variety of motions and interactions,\nincluding a smaller test set with bird-specific keypoint labels. Using our\ntemporal optimization, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for the\nchallenging sequences in our dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
