The\npaper studies different ticketing regimes that allow parallelism, yet prevent\nslow nodes from hampering overall progress. It introduces a hybrid scheme which\ncombines managed and unmanaged ticketing regimes, striking a balance between\nadaptivity and resilience. The performance evaluation demonstrates how managed\nand unmanaged ticketing regimes benefit throughput in systems with\nheterogeneous resources both in static and dynamic scenarios, with the managed\nticketing regime performing better among the two as it adapts better. Finally,\nit demonstrates how using the hybrid ticketing regime performance can enjoy\nboth the adaptivity of the managed regime and the liveness guarantees of the\nunmanaged regime.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
