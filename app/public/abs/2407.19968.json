Icosahedral quasicrystals, aperiodic in all\ndirections, represent one of the most challenging targets that have yet to be\nexperimentally realized at the colloidal scale. Previous attempts have required\nmeticulous human-designed building blocks and often resulted in interactions\nbeyond current experimental capabilities. In this work, we introduce a\nframework for generating experimentally accessible designs that self-assemble\ninto quasicrystalline arrangements. We present a design for icosahedral\nDNA-origami building blocks and demonstrate, through molecular simulations,\ntheir successful assembly into the target quasicrystalline structure. Our\nresults highlight the feasibility of using automated design protocols to\nachieve complex quasicrystalline patterns, paving the way for new applications\nin material science and nanotechnology.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
