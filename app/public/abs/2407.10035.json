We\ninvestigate the scenario where a voter adopts the mass media's opinion with a\nprobability $p$ when there is no unanimity among a group of $q$ agents. Through\nnumerical simulation, we identify a critical probability threshold, $p_t$, at\nwhich the system consistently reaches complete consensus. This threshold\nprobability $p_t$ decreases as the group size $q$ increases, following a\npower-law relation $p_t \\propto q^{\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma \\approx -1.187$.\nAdditionally, we analyze the system's relaxation time, the time required to\nreach a complete consensus state. This relaxation time increases with the\npopulation size $N$, following a power-law $\\tau \\propto N^{\\nu}$, where $\\nu\n\\approx 1.093$. Conversely, an increase in the probability $p$ results in a\ndecrease in relaxation time following a power-law relationship $\\tau \\propto\np^{\\delta}$, with $\\delta \\approx -0.596$. The value of the exponent \\( \\nu \\)\nis similar to the exponents obtained in the voter and $q$-voter models across\nvarious network topologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZGnbAxnZMjvHtmTS8dRoA5CnGTUY-WuPeZONIkks2pw","pdfSize":"1989939"}
