As the number of GNNs approaches\nrises, some works have started questioning the theoretical and empirical\nreasons behind their superior performance. Nevertheless, this investigation\nstill disregards that GNNs treat the recommendation data as a topological graph\nstructure. Building on this assumption, in this work, we provide a novel\nevaluation perspective on GNNs-based recommendation, which investigates the\nimpact of the graph topology on the recommendation performance. To this end, we\nselect some (topological) properties of the recommendation data and three\nGNNs-based recommender systems (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN). Then,\nstarting from three popular recommendation datasets (i.e., Yelp2018, Gowalla,\nand Amazon-Book) we sample them to obtain 1,800 size-reduced datasets that\nstill resemble the original ones but can encompass a wider range of topological\nstructures. We use this procedure to build a large pool of samples for which\ndata characteristics and recommendation performance of the selected GNNs models\nare measured. Through an explanatory framework, we find strong correspondences\nbetween graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation\nperspective on these models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
