Despite observing lower\nrates of substrate turnover and relatively smaller enhancement of passive\ntracer diffusion in artificial crowded media compared to those in aqueous\nsolutions, we found a significantly higher relative diffusion enhancement in\ncrowded environments in the presence of enzymatic activity. Our experimental\nobservations, coupled with supporting analytical estimations, underscored the\ncritical role of the intervening media in facilitating mechanical energy\ndistribution around active enzymes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O5zsaarNVFGGgoNBQFsUj22QNGVf6Mf_WpdMsPrMHuM","pdfSize":"2486857","txDigest":"CDmDGzTKysA8wBSKmf2Jq3ZppZcyTSnDKyAPUy51NCyU","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
