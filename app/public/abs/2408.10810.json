We study second-order MFG PDI with convex, Lipschitz\ncontinuous, but possibly nondifferentiable Hamiltonians, and their\napproximation by systems of classical MFG PDE with regularized Hamiltonians.\nUnder very broad conditions on the problem data, we show that, up to\nsubsequences, the solutions of the regularized problems converge to solutions\nof the MFG PDI. In particular, we show the convergence of the value functions\nin the $H^1$-norm and of the densities in $L^q$-norms. Under stronger\nhypotheses on the problem data, we also show rates of convergence between the\nsolutions of the original and regularized problems, without requiring any\nhigher regularity of the solutions. We give concrete examples that demonstrate\nthe sharpness of several aspects of the analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
