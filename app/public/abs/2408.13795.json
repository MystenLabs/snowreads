In\nthis paper we present second-order characterizations of these properties, i.e.,\nconditions using first-order generalized derivatives of the subgradient\nmapping. Up to now, such characterizations are only known under the assumptions\nof prox-regularity and subdifferential continuity and in this paper we discard\nthe latter. To this aim we slightly modify the definitions of the generalized\nderivatives to be compatible with the $f$-attentive convergence appearing in\nthe definition of subgradients. We formulate our results in terms of both\ncoderivatives and subspace containing derivatives. We also give formulas for\nthe exact bound of variational convexity and study relations between\nvariational strong convexity and tilt-stable local minimizers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
