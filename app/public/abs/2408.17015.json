Motivated by\nrecent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic\natoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states,\nconfined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic\nvariational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis\nset, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural\nproperties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a\nfinite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to\nmodel realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation\nspectrum, pair correlation function, and paired fraction as a function of\nincreasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the\nground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well\nbelow the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding\nexperiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi\nsurface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291\n(2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at\nlow momenta through Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to\ntwelve particles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
