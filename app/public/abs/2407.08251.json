However,\nachieving this is generally challenging, in particular at nanoscale, due to\ntheir 3D nature. In our study, we successfully determined the grain boundary\ncharacteristics of an annealed nickel-tungsten alloy (NiW) nanocrystalline\nneedle-shaped specimen (tip) containing twins using Scanning Precession\nElectron Diffraction (SPED) Tomography. The presence of annealing twins in this\nface-centered cubic (fcc) material gives rise to common reflections in the SPED\ndiffraction patterns, which challenges the reconstruction of\norientation-specific virtual dark field (VDF) images required for tomographic\nreconstruction of the 3D grain shapes. To address this, an automated\npost-processing step identifies and deselects these shared reflections prior to\nthe reconstruction of the VDF images. Combined with appropriate intensity\nnormalization and projection alignment procedures, this approach enables\nhigh-fidelity 3D reconstruction of the individual grains contained in the\nneedle-shaped sample volume. To probe the accuracy of the resulting boundary\ncharacteristics, the twin boundary surface normal directions were extracted\nfrom the 3D voxelated grain boundary map using a 3D Hough transform. For the\nsub-set of coherent Sigma 3 boundaries, the expected {111} grain boundary plane\nnormals were obtained with an angular error of less than 3{\\textdegree} for\nboundary sizes down to 400 nm${}^2$. This work advances our ability to\nprecisely characterize and understand the complex grain boundaries that govern\nmaterial properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
