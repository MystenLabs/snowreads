The nonlinearity is assumed to be subcritical, defocusing\nand analytic. Under geometric control condition on both coupling and damping\nregions, we establish the exponential energy decay rate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
