This\nproblem consists in identifying the set of initial data driven by the\ncorresponding $AB$-entropy solution to a given target profile~$\\omega^T$, at a\ntime horizon $T>0$. We provide a full characterization of such a set in terms\nof suitable integral inequalities, and we establish structural and geometrical\nproperties of this set. A distinctive feature of the initial set is that it is\nin general not convex, differently from the case of conservation laws with\nconvex flux independent on the space variable. The results rely on the\nproperties of the $AB$-backward-forward evolution operator introduced\nin~\\cite{talamini_ancona_attset}, and on a proper concept of\n$AB$-genuine/interface characteristic for $AB$-entropy solutions provided in\nthis paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
