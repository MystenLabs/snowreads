Much of the prior algorithmic work on this topic\nfocuses on the perfect (complete and deterministic) information scenario,\nespecially in the context of fixed-parameter algorithm design. Our\ncontributions constitute the first fixed-parameter tractability results\napplicable to more general settings of SE tournament design with potential\nimperfect information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
