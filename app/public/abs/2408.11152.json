For the conventional deepfake detection task, we use\nResNet18 and self-supervised models for the closed and open conditions,\nrespectively. In addition, we analyze and visualize different combinations of\nspeaker information and spoofing information as label schemes for training. For\nspoofing-robust automatic speaker verification (SASV), we introduce effective\npriors and propose using logistic regression to jointly train affine\ntransformations of the countermeasure scores and the automatic speaker\nverification scores in such a way that the SASV LLR is optimized.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
