Multiple testing approaches utilize query plans for finding\nbugs. However, query plans are represented in a database-specific manner, so\nimplementing these testing approaches requires a non-trivial effort, hindering\ntheir adoption. We envision that a unified query plan representation can\nfacilitate the implementation of these approaches. In this paper, we present an\nexploratory case study to investigate query plan representations in nine\nwidely-used database systems. Our study shows that query plan representations\nconsist of three conceptual components: operations, properties, and formats,\nwhich enable us to design a unified query plan representation. Based on it,\nexisting testing methods can be efficiently adopted, finding 17 previously\nunknown and unique bugs. Additionally, the unified query plan representation\ncan facilitate other applications. Existing visualization tools can support\nmultiple database systems based on the unified query plan representation with\nmoderate implementation effort, and comparing unified query plans across\ndatabase systems provides actionable insights to improve their performance. We\nexpect that the unified query plan representation will enable the exploration\nof additional application scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
