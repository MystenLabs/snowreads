NS matter is described within a relativistic mean field (RMF)\napproximation, including both models with non-linear meson terms or with\ndensity dependent nucleon-meson couplings. We first study the effect of\nmagnetic fields and finite temperature on the EoS separately, finding that the\neffect of the latter to be significantly stronger than the one of the former.\nWe then study the combined effect of magnetic fields and temperature on the\ninternal composition. We show how both factors cause an increase in the proton\nfraction at low density and that, as long as the temperatures considered are\nnot higher than 10 MeV, the effect of the magnetic field on the proton fraction\nis not small enough to be neglected.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
