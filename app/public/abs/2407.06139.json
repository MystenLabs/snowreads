A particularly challenging background to\nreactor antineutrino detection is from cosmogenically induced fast neutrons,\nwhich can mimic the characteristics of an IBD signal. In this work, we explore\ntwo methods of machine learning -- a tree-based classifier and a\ngraph-convolutional neural network -- to improve rejection of fast\nneutron-induced background events in a water Cherenkov detector. The tree-based\nclassifier examines classification at the reconstructed feature level, while\nthe graphical network classifies events using only the raw signal data. Both\nmethods improve the sensitivity for a background-dominant search over\ntraditional cut-and-count methods, with the greatest improvement being from the\ntree-based classification method. These performance enhancements are relevant\nfor reactor monitoring applications that make use of deep underground oil-based\nor water-based kiloton-scale detectors with multichannel, PMT-based readouts,\nand they are likely extensible to other similar physics analyses using this\nclass of detector.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
