It is also a crucial aspect\nof nuclear physics with widespread applications in nuclear waste management and\nenergy production. This paper introduces CNUCTRAN, a novel computer program\nthat employs a probabilistic approach to estimate nuclide concentrations in\ntransmutation problems. CNUCTRAN directly simulates nuclei transformations\narising from various nuclear reactions, diverging from the traditional\ndeterministic methods that solve the Bateman equation using matrix exponential\napproximation. This approach effectively addresses numerical challenges\nassociated with solving the Bateman equations, therefore, circumventing the\nneed for matrix exponential approximations that risk producing nonphysical\nconcentrations. Our sample calculations using CNUCTRAN shows that the\nconcentration predictions of CNUCTRAN have a relative error of less than 0.001%\ncompared to the state-of-the-art method, CRAM, in different test cases. This\nmakes CNUCTRAN a valuable alternative tool for transmutation analysis\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
