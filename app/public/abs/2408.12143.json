This Perspective\nexamines the integration of GenAI as a tool for human learning, addressing its\npromises and challenges from a holistic viewpoint that integrates insights from\nlearning sciences, educational technology, and human-computer interaction.\nGenAI promises to enhance learning experiences by scaling personalised support,\ndiversifying learning materials, enabling timely feedback, and innovating\nassessment methods. However, it also presents critical issues such as model\nimperfections, ethical dilemmas, and the disruption of traditional assessments.\nCultivating AI literacy and adaptive skills is imperative for facilitating\ninformed engagement with GenAI technologies. Rigorous research across learning\ncontexts is essential to evaluate GenAI's impact on human cognition,\nmetacognition, and creativity. Humanity must learn with and about GenAI,\nensuring it becomes a powerful ally in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation,\nrather than a crutch that undermines our intellectual abilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
