This is believed to lead to a light singlet scalar meson in the\nlow-energy spectrum, a dilaton, which is the pseudo Nambu--Goldstone boson for\nthe approximate scale symmetry. Extending chiral perturbation theory to include\nthe dilaton requires a new small parameter to control the dilaton mass and its\ninteractions. In our previous work we derived a systematic power counting for\nthe dilaton couplings by matching the effective low-energy theory to the\nunderlying theory using mild assumptions. In this paper we examine two\nalternative power countings which were proposed in the literature based on a\nphenomenological picture for the conformal transition. We find that one of\nthese power countings fails, in fact, to generate a systematic expansion; the\nother coincides with the power counting we derived. We also point out that the\nso-called $\\Delta$-potential coincides with the tree-level potential of the\nformer, invalid, power counting.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xl144exhT_8OC9mzDKpwhhyTOaSp3MLVffLqbH5BK-M","pdfSize":"233382"}
