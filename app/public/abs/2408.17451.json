Devices\nsuch as undulators and wigglers, which are used widely for photon production,\ne.g., in synchrotron radiation facilities, inherently possess strong magnetic\nfields, making them potential sources for ALP production. In this paper, we\nestablish formalisms and formulas for studying ALP production in the\nALP-photon-charged current system based on quantum field theory. We demonstrate\nthat ALP production is inevitable in any undulator with the standard designs\ndue to the electron Coulomb potential as well as a resonance effect depending\non the ALP mass. In particular, ALPs are predominantly produced in a direction\nslightly misaligned with the photons' main direction. We propose placing\ndetectors in the desired directions during operations of the originally planned\nexperiments as an efficient approach to simultaneously probing ALPs. The\ncalculation methods and formulas developed in this study are applicable to ALP\nproduction from other environments and productions of other particles beyond\nthe standard model relevant to synchrotron radiations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
