The investment problem for\neach generation company (Genco) is a bi-level problem with the investment\ndecision made in the upper level and market clearing condition in the lower\nlevel, which traditionally is represented as a Mathematical Program with\nEquilibrium Constraint (MPEC). The predictive model is trained for estimating\nthe system-wide revenues for each technology type across energy, ancillary\nservices and capacity markets given the amount of technology-specific installed\ncapacity on the grid. The profit maximization investment problem for each Genco\nis solved using a global search algorithm, which uses the predictive model to\nevaluate the objective function. To solve for the strategic equilibrium, each\nGenco's problem is plugged into a diagonalization algorithm that is generally\nused in multi-leader, single-follower bi-level problems. The methodology\npresented here enables significant computational improvements while still\ncapturing the desired market characteristics and dynamics of traditional\nequilibrium modeling approaches\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SDG4PVEddYMfYYtZ2J_4h2EV9MNSbZM_0B4wFBuB2WA","pdfSize":"462509"}
