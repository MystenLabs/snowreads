However, their expensive computation costs,\ni.e., throughput and delay, impede potentials in the real-world scenarios. To\nachieve acceleration for VLMs, most existing methods focus on the model\nperspective: pruning, distillation, quantization, but completely overlook the\ndata-perspective redundancy. To fill the overlook, this paper pioneers the\nseverity of data redundancy, and designs one plug-and-play Turbo module guided\nby information degree to prune inefficient tokens from visual or textual data.\nIn pursuit of efficiency-performance trade-offs, information degree takes two\ncrucial factors into consideration: mutual redundancy and semantic value.\nConcretely, the former evaluates data duplication between sequential tokens;\nwhile the latter evaluates each token by its contribution to the overall\nsemantics. As a result, tokens with high information degree carry less\nredundancy and stronger semantics. For VLMs' calculation, Turbo works as a\nuser-friendly plug-in that sorts data referring to information degree,\nutilizing only top-level ones to save costs. Its advantages are multifaceted,\ne.g., being generally compatible to various VLMs across understanding and\ngeneration, simple use without re-training and trivial engineering efforts. On\nmultiple VLMs benchmarks, we fully experiment to demonstrate the good\nacceleration of Turbo, under negligible performance drop.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
