We demonstrate that the two new chemical encodings can provide\nadditional information about the interactions of amino acids in sequences that\nan LSTM-based model cannot capture with one-hot encoding alone. Compared to the\nlatest LSTM-based model used in the single-sequence-based method\nSPOT-1D-Single, our ensemble model utilizing one-hot and chemical encodings\nachieves better accuracy across most test sets while requiring approximately\nnine times fewer trainable parameters for each encoding model. Our\nsingle-sequence-based method is valuable for its simplicity, lower resource\nrequirements, and independence from external sequence data. It is beneficial\nwhen quick or preliminary predictions are needed or when data on homologous\nsequences is scarce.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
