For the first time in NLO inclusive UPC dijet\npredictions, we take into account also the modelling of the forward-neutron\nevent class required in the experimental measurements. We show that since the\ndijet photoproduction at forward rapidities requires an energetic photon in the\ninitial state, this biases the cross section to be dominated by events with\nrelatively small impact parameters between the nuclei, of the order of a few\nnuclear radii. This leads to a sensitivity to the transverse-plane collision\ngeometry, which we take properly into account by including effects from the\nfinite extent of both the photon-emitting and the target nucleus. We also test\nthe potential sensitivity to the spatial dependence of nuclear parton\ndistribution functions in connection with this finding.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
