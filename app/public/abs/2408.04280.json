Superradiance is a typical\nexample in which the decay rate of the system is enhanced via a collective\nsystem-bath coupling that respects permutation symmetry. Such model has also\nbeen applied to heat engines. However, a generic framework that addresses the\nimpact of symmetry in finite-time thermodynamics is not well established. Here,\nwe show a symmetry-based framework that describes the fundamental limit of\ncollective enhancement in finite-time thermodynamics. Specifically, we derive a\ngeneral upper bound on the average jump rate, which quantifies the fundamental\nspeed set by thermodynamic speed limits and trade-off relations. We identify\nthe symmetry condition which achieves the obtained bound, and explicitly\nconstruct an open quantum system model that goes beyond the enhancement\nrealized by the conventional superradiance model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
