Let $X$ be a simplicial complex on vertex set $V$ of size $n$, and\nlet $X(k)$ denote the set of all $k$-dimensional simplices of $X$. The $k$-th\nspectral gap $\\mu_k(X)$ is the smallest eigenvalue of the reduced\n$k$-dimensional Laplacian of $X$. For any $k\\geq -1$, Lew [J. Combin. Theory\nSer. A 169 (2020) 105127] established a lower bound for $\\mu_k(X)$:\n$$\\mu_k(X)\\geq (d+1)\\left(\\min_{\\sigma\\in X(k)}\\deg_X(\\sigma)+k+1\\right)-dn\\geq\n(d+1)(k+1)-dn,$$ where $\\deg_X(\\sigma)$ and $d$ denote the degree of $\\sigma$\nin $X$ and the maximal dimension of a missing face of $X$, respectively. In\nthis paper, we identify the unique simplicial complex that achieves the lower\nbound of the $k$-th spectral gap, $(d+1)(k+1)-dn$, for some $k$, thereby\nconfirming a conjecture proposed by Lew.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
