London\nMath. Soc. 42 (2010), 467-477] for proving the neo-classical inequality. We\nintroduce a new fractional analogue of the binomial distribution on the basis\nof the generalized binomial theorem and study its properties. They include the\nlaw of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and the law of small numbers,\nthe last of which leads to a fractional analogue of the Poisson distribution.\nAs an application of the fractional binomial distribution, a fractional\nanalogue of the Bernstein operator is proposed, which acts on the space of\ncontinuous functions on the unit interval. We show that the fractional\nBernstein operator uniformly approximates every continuous function on the unit\ninterval. Some limit theorems for its iterates are discussed as well. In\nparticular, a generalization of the Wright--Fisher diffusion process arising in\nthe study of population genetics is captured as a certain limit of the\niterates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
