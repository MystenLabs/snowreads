This allows us to easily construct\nspectral measures with and without compact supports in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\nAccording to a result on the relation between supports of infinite convolutions\nand sets of infinite sums, we systematically study the Hausdorff and packing\ndimensions of infinite sums of finite sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. As an\napplication, we give concrete formulae for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions\nof the supports of a class of spectral measures in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with the form\nof infinite convolutions generated by specific sequences of nearly $d$-th power\nlattices, and finally we deduce that there are spectral measures with and\nwithout compact supports of arbitrary Hausdorff and packing dimensions in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
