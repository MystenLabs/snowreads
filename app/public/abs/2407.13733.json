Some of the generalizations such\nas generalized CW and next-to-nearest neighbour interaction CW have already\nbeen explored by a few authors. In this study, we studied non-local CW for the\nfermionic case and found that non-local models relax the $\\left| q \\right| > 1$\nconstraint to produce localization of the zero mode. We also made a comparison\namong them and have shown that for some parameter ranges, non-local variants of\nCW are more efficient than ordinary CW in generating the hierarchy required for\nthe $\\nu$ mass scale. Finally, phenomenological constraints from $BR(\\mu\n\\rightarrow e \\gamma )$ FCNC process and Higgs decay width have been imposed on\nthe parameter space in non-local and both-sided clockwork models. We have\nlisted benchmark points which are surviving current experimental bounds from\nMEG and are within the reach of the upcoming MEG-II experiment.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
