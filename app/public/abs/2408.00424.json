This gauged supergravity admits a supersymmetric $N=3$ $AdS_4$\nvacuum with the full $SO(3)\\times SU(3)$ symmetry unbroken and a family of\nsupersymmetric $N=1,2,3$ and non-supersymmetric $AdS_4$ vacua with different\nresidual symmetries. These are expected to be dual to supersymmetric\nChern-Simons-Matter (CSM) theories in three dimensions via the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. By considering a truncation to three complex scalar fields, we\nfind a number of Janus solutions preserving $N=1$ supersymmetry that describes\nconformal interfaces within $N=3$ CSM theories with $SO(3)\\times SU(3)$ and\n$SU(2)_{\\textrm{diag}}\\times U(1)$ symmetries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"roC6Wm99L55kWwVmfMduULP7cl0wjOmMgSdNebk1VoQ","pdfSize":"918791"}
