The enhanced\nsensitivity of this transition to the large class of dark matter models\ndominantly coupling to quarks and gluons will ultimately allow us to probe\ncoupling strengths eight orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds\nfrom optical atomic clocks, which are mainly sensitive to dark matter couplings\nto electrons and photons. We argue that, with increasing precision,\nobservations of the Th-229 excitation spectrum will soon give world-leading\nconstraints. Using data from the pioneering laser excitation of Th-229 by\nTiedau et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 182501 (2024)], we present a first dark\nmatter search in the excitation spectrum. While the exclusion limits of our\ndetailed study of the lineshape are still below the sensitivity of currently\noperating clock experiments, we project the measurement of Zhang et al.\n[arXiv:2406.18719 [physics.atom-ph]] to surpass it.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
