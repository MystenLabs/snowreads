In this study, we demonstrate that SBM software\napplied to various real-world and synthetic networks produces poorly-connected\nto disconnected clusters. We present simple modifications to improve the\nconnectivity of SBM clusters, and show that the modifications improve accuracy\nusing simulated networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IpyUZlhyVMUWfx3qwM4lX5KYKkshEiO5tsfJ6rC226Q","pdfSize":"216338"}
