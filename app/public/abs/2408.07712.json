An overview of RL is provided in\nthis paper, which discusses its core concepts, methodologies, recent trends,\nand resources for learning. We provide a detailed explanation of key components\nof RL such as states, actions, policies, and reward signals so that the reader\ncan build a foundational understanding. The paper also provides examples of\nvarious RL algorithms, including model-free and model-based methods. In\naddition, RL algorithms are introduced and resources for learning and\nimplementing them are provided, such as books, courses, and online communities.\nThis paper demystifies a comprehensive yet simple introduction for beginners by\noffering a structured and clear pathway for acquiring and implementing\nreal-time techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
