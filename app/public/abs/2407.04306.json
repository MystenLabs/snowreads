The method is based on the methodology given by Ammari,\nNicaise and Pignotti in \"Stabilization by switching time-delay, Asymptot.\nAnal., 83 (2013), 263--283\". This method is then implemented in 1D by suitable\nnumerical approximation techniques. Numerical experiments complete this study\nto confirm the theoretical announced results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
