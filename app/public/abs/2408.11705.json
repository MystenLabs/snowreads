However, this insight that\nphysical quantities must be gauge-invariant is not well-reflected in standard\napproaches to particle physics. For instance, each and every elementary\nfield/particle of the Standard Model fails to be gauge-invariant! The main\nobjective of this paper is to offer an accessible, concise, and convincing\nanalysis of why philosophers and physicists should devote more of their energy\nto working on gauge-invariant approaches. Correspondingly, the thesis of this\npaper is that pursuing gauge-invariant approaches has several virtues. For\ninstance, gauge-invariant reformulations allow us to make particle physics\nconsistent with the mathematical framework in which it is formulated. This is\nillustrated by how mathematical theorems such as Elitzur's theorem, the Gribov\nambiguity, and Haag's theorem pose problems for standard approaches but are\navoided by gauge-invariant approaches.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
