In this study, we developed\na method for trapping a gold nanoparticle in an air-filled gold nanowell\n(particle-in-well) to stabilize the particle and provide a powerful platform\nfor continuous single molecule readout. The unlimited resident time of the\nparticle-in-well device with single-molecule level sensitivity elevates\nnucleobase detection to a new level. We present a technique capable of\ndetecting and monitoring solid-phase molecule diffusion within the plasmonic\nhotspot. Furthermore, the measured spectra were employed as input data for the\nvalidation of the plasmonic hotspot size and, consequently, the distance\nbetween the particle and the well. The obtained results form the statistical\nand experimental base for molecular translocation and DNA sequencing\ntechnologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"irTIoTLqwCEt6XL8hjlzUQv8jFhi6eNDsNgq6Bt3iF4","pdfSize":"667650"}
