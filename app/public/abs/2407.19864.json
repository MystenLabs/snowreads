The\nposition and number of the actually used data points is not trivial, and many\ncases like Moving Least Squares require point selections that guarantee local\nrecovery of polynomials up to a specified order. This paper suggests a\nkernel-based greedy local algorithm for point selection that has no such\nconstraints. It realizes the optimal $L_\\infty$ convergence rates in Sobolev\nspaces using the minimal number of points necessary for that purpose. On the\ndownside, it does not care for smoothness, relying on fast $L_\\infty$\nconvergence to a smooth function. The algorithm ignores near-duplicate points\nautomatically and works for quite irregularly distributed point sets by proper\nselection of points. Its computational complexity is constant for each\nevaluation point, being dependent only on the Sobolev space parameters. Various\nnumerical examples are provided. As a byproduct, it turns out that the\nwell-known instability of global kernel-based interpolation in the standard\nbasis of kernel translates arises already locally, independent of global kernel\nmatrices and small separation distances.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Psv3HoeqtwRtzA4ZkJB6PcDXhhBXKD6GSyfzIoBrmbs","pdfSize":"8214465"}
