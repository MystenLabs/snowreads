We express the number of\nrepresentations of an integer by a positive definite binary quadratic form of\ndiscriminant $-D$ with an odd class number $h(-D)$ as a rational linear\nexpression involving the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{-D}{.}\\right)$ and the\nFourier coefficients of certain cusp forms. We prove these cusp forms have eta\nquotient representations only if $D=23$. This provides, using theta functions,\na generalization of a result of F. van der Blij from 1952 for binary quadratic\nforms of discriminant $-23$ to the case of forms of discriminant $-D$ with odd\n$h(-D)$. We also study the eta quotient representations of some related theta\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AoAgUa6WxMDTMwwuKCeNZOgqpz0QWYcXxsCZuNNdy1s","pdfSize":"266297","txDigest":"AUssGYdGC35Yc2vXtGLpDXZuypSoPDNceS2sW2rSUW4","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
