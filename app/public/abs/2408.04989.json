We explore how different Grothendieck topologies on one category\ncan be related, and, more general, how functors between categories can preserve\nthem. As applications of locality, we review geometric objects such as sheaves,\ngroupoids, functors, bibundles, and anafunctors internal to an arbitrary\nGrothendieck site. We give definitions such that all these objects are\ninvariant under equivalences of Grothendieck topologies and certain functors\nbetween sites. As examples of sites, we look at categories of smooth manifolds,\ndiffeological spaces, topological spaces, and sheaves, and we study properties\nof various functors between those.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
