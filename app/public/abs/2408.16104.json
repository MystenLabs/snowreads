Yet, at the energetic level of stochastic\nthermodynamics, changes in kinetic energy must be considered to accurately\npredict the heat exchanged with the thermal bath. On the other hand, in the\npresence of external driving forces, one would expect the effects of kinetic\nenergy fluctuations to be reduced, as thermal noise becomes comparatively less\nrelevant. Here, we investigate the competition between the kinetic energy and\nthe external work contributions to the heat statistics of passive and active\noverdamped Brownian particles subject to external driving forces. We find that\nkinetic energy effects cause fluctuations in the exchanged heat to become\nnon-Gaussian. To evaluate the relevance of these effects, we compute the excess\nkurtosis and the Pearson correlation. For fixed parameter values adapted from\nexperiments, we identify a crossover transition from a regime in which the\nstochastic heat of overdamped particles is dominated by external work, where\nkinetic energy changes can be safely ignored, to a regime dominated by kinetic\nenergy effects. Our results also provide a quantitative analytical way to\nassess how deep into a particular regime the system is.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
