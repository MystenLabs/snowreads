However, the nature of THS propagation remains\nelusive. Although it is widely believed that they form a two-dimensional (2D)\ntriangular network, a few argue that they self-organize into 1D topological\nzigzag modes (TZMs) that propagate independently. In this Letter, we propose a\nprotocol based on a two-terminal TBG nanoflake transport device and resolve\nthis issue. Through rigorous calculations on the differential conductance and\nthe nonequilibrium local density of states, we show that, these THSs indeed\nself-construct the 1D distorted TZMs, each bypassing the AA-stacking spots and\npropagating independently. By considering a long TBG nanoflake, we obtain a\nnearly quantized conductance plateau with its value close to 1, 2, and 3 (in\nunits of $2e^2/h$), which serves as a strong experimental sign for the\nexistence of TZMs. Our work not only clarifies the propagation nature of the\nTHSs, but also realizes an array of 1D conducting channels on a 2D platform.\nThis work provides an unprecedented way to engineering topological states\nintrinsic in TBG.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
