In these cases, the use of link functions\nbased on the cumulative distribution function of a skewed and heavy tailed\ndistribution can be useful. The most popular choice is some scale mixtures of\nskew-normal distribution. This family of distributions can have some\nidentifiability problems, caused by the so-called direct parameterization.\nAlso, in the binary modeling with skewed link functions, we can have another\nidentifiability problem caused by the presence of the intercept and the\nskewness parameter. To circumvent these issues, in this work we proposed link\nfunctions based on the scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions under the\ncentered parameterization. Furthermore, we proposed to fix the sign of the\nskewness parameter, which is a new perspective in the literature to deal with\nthe identifiability problem in skewed link functions. Bayesian inference using\nMCMC algorithms and residual analysis are developed. Simulation studies are\nperformed to evaluate the performance of the model. Also, the methodology is\napplied in a heart disease data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
