However, to date, all non-Abelian topological\nmaterials are restricted to systems with time-reversal symmetry (T). Here,\nstarting from a Kagome lattice inspired by Haldane model and designer\ngyromagnetic photonic crystals (PhCs), we show that T breaking can lead to rich\nnon-Abelian topological physics, particularly the emergence of multigap\nantichiral edge states. Simply changing the magnetic flux of the Kagome\nlattice, or in-situ tuning the local magnetic field of the gyromagnetic PhCs,\ncan lead to the unconventional creation, braiding, merging, and splitting of\nnon-Abelian charged band nodes, alongside with the direct manipulation of the\nmultigap antichiral edge states. Particularly, the quadratic point can be split\ninto four Dirac points, a phenomenon unique in T-broken systems. Our\ntheoretical and experimental findings will inspire a new direction in the study\nof non-Abelian physics in T-broken systems and open an unprecedent pathway for\ntopological manipulation of electromagnetic waves.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
