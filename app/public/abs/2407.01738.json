Lack of Internet access hinders economic growth,\neducational opportunities, and access to information and services. Recent\ninitiatives to ``connect the unconnected'' have either failed (project Loon and\nAquila) or are characterized by exorbitant costs (Starlink and similar), which\nare unsustainable for users in developing regions. This paper proposes SONIC, a\nnovel connectivity solution that repurposes a widespread communication\ninfrastructure (AM/FM radio) to deliver access to pre-rendered webpages. Our\nrationale is threefold: 1) the radio network is widely accessible -- currently\nreaching 70% of the world -- even in developing countries, 2) unused\nfrequencies are highly available, 3) while data over sound can be slow, when\ncombined with the radio network, it takes advantage of its broadcast nature,\nefficiently reaching a large number of users. We have designed and built a\nproof of concept of SONIC which shows encouraging initial results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"88hhkUSO7oJMqMq1jlXkY2K1PVJnIaVwpoMBT8jjTWE","pdfSize":"3277020"}
