For a commutative ring R and a multiplicatively closed\nsubset S, we show that many properties of J-ideals apply to S-J-ideals and\nexamine their characteristics in various ring constructions, such as\nhomomorphic image rings, quotient rings, cartesian product rings, polynomial\nrings, power series rings, idealization rings, and amalgamation rings. In\nnoncommutative rings, where S is an m-system, we define right S-J-ideals. We\ndemonstrate the equivalence of S-J-ideals and right S-J-ideals in commutative\nrings with identity and provide examples to illustrate the connections between\nright S-prime ideals and J-ideals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8FJgGl0ZGDq93SyKnqX_dM6yST2sQUH3iyfitlxWh9U","pdfSize":"212831"}
