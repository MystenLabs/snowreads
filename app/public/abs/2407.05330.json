The two long-standing approaches to estimate causal effects are\nobservational and experimental (randomized) studies. Observational studies can\nsuffer from unmeasured confounding, which may render the causal effects\nunidentifiable. On the other hand, direct experiments on the target variable\nmay be too costly or even infeasible to conduct. A middle ground between these\ntwo approaches is to estimate the causal effect of interest through proxy\nexperiments, which are conducted on variables with a lower cost to intervene on\ncompared to the main target. Akbari et al. [2022] studied this setting and\ndemonstrated that the problem of designing the optimal (minimum-cost)\nexperiment for causal effect identification is NP-complete and provided a naive\nalgorithm that may require solving exponentially many NP-hard problems as a\nsub-routine in the worst case. In this work, we provide a few reformulations of\nthe problem that allow for designing significantly more efficient algorithms to\nsolve it as witnessed by our extensive simulations. Additionally, we study the\nclosely-related problem of designing experiments that enable us to identify a\ngiven effect through valid adjustments sets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
