Initially created for\nmusicological applications, it is equally applicable in any area where precise\ntime and frequency information is required from a signal, without encountering\nthe problems associated with the uncertainty principle. By constructing a bank\nof non-linear tuned resonators (`detectors'), each of which operates at a Hopf\nbifurcation, it is possible to detect frequencies within half a period of\noscillation, even in the presence of wideband noise. The time and frequency\nresponse characteristics of these detectors will be examined here.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
