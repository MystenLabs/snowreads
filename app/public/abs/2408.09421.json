To mimic the effect of external physical\npressures, the application of chemical pressure via replacing La$^3$$^+$ with\nsmaller rare-earth R$^3$$^+$ has been considered as a potential route. Here we\nclarify the distinct effects of chemical and physical pressures on the\nstructural transition of bilayer nickelates through a combined experimental and\ntheoretical investigation. Contrary to general expectations, we find that\nsubstitutions of smaller R$^3$$^+$ for La$^3$$^+$ in\nLa$_{3-x}$R$_x$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\\delta}$, despite of an overall lattice contraction,\nproduce stronger orthorhombic structural distortions and thus require higher\npressures to induce the structural transition. We established a quantitative\nrelationship between the critical pressure $P_c$ for structural transition and\nthe average size of $A$-site cations. A linear extrapolation of $P_c$ versus\n<$r_A$> yields a putative critical value of <$r_A$>$_c$ ~ 1.23 angstrom for\n$P_c$ ~ 1 bar. The negative correlation between $P_c$ and <$r_A$> indicates\nthat it is unlikely to reduce $P_c$ to ambient by replacing La$^3$$^+$ with\nsmaller R$^3$$^+$ ions. Instead, partial substitution of La$^3$$^+$ with larger\ncations such as alkaline-earth Sr$^2$$^+$ or Ba$^2$$^+$ might be a feasible\napproach. Our results provide valuable guidelines in the quest of\nambient-pressure HTSC in bilayer nickelates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fcgtg8wekx5-GDyngLb6dqu_g1Oz-4SWA8mVHWEq9oU","pdfSize":"2438673"}
