Our\nmethod begins by constructing for every point in time a posterior probability\nthat this point partitions the forecasts into two sets which are distributed\ndifferently. These posterior probabilities are then integrated to give a\ncumulative mass function from which a weighted median forecast is calculated.\nKairosis outperforms standard methods, and is especially suitable for\ngeopolitical forecasting tournaments because it is observed to be robust across\ndisparate questions and forecaster distributions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
