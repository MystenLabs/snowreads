The\nhigh speed of trains creates rapidly time-varying wireless channels, increases\nthe signaling overhead, and reduces the system throughput, making it difficult\nto meet the growing and stringent needs of HSR applications. In this article,\nwe explore artificial intelligence (AI)-based beam-level and cell-level\nmobility management suitable for HSR communications, including the use cases,\ninputs, outputs, and key performance indicators (KPI)s of AI models.\nParticularly, in comparison to traditional down-sampling spatial beam\nmeasurements, we show that the compressed spatial multi-beam measurements via\ncompressive sensing lead to improved spatial-temporal beam prediction.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the performance gains of AI-assisted cell handover\nover traditional mobile handover mechanisms. In addition, we observe that the\nproposed approaches to reduce the measurement overhead achieve comparable radio\nlink failure performance with the traditional approach that requires all the\nbeam measurements of all cells, while the former methods can save 50% beam\nmeasurement overhead.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
