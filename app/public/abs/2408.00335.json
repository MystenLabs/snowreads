Our focus is to determine the static and dynamic\nproperties such as ground state masses, magnetic moment, transition magnetic\nmoment, radiative decay and heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rates including\ntheir corresponding branching fractions. The ground state masses are calculated\nby solving the six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. The\nmagnetic moments and transition magnetic moments for $J^P=\\frac{1}{2}^+$ and\n$J^P=\\frac{3}{2}^+$ baryons are also calculated. In addition, radiative M1\ndecay widths are computed from the transition magnetic moment. We have employed\nthe Isgur-Wise function(IWF) to analyse the semileptonic decay widths of the\ndoubly heavy baryons. The obtained results are compared with other theoretical\npredictions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5nASWdcB7oUUrV2eH3FkdhWqE0OBisw_8JRCl2buQAE","pdfSize":"229519"}
