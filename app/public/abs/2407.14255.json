However, there appears to be limited awareness among practitioners of\nacademic contributions in this domain, creating a significant gap between\nindustry and academia's contributions to EH tools. This research paper aims to\nsurvey the current state of EH academic research, primarily focusing on\nresearch-informed security tools. We categorise these tools into process-based\nframeworks (such as PTES and Mitre ATT\\&CK) and knowledge-based frameworks\n(such as CyBOK and ACM CCS). This classification provides a comprehensive\noverview of novel, research-informed tools, considering their functionality and\napplication areas. The analysis covers licensing, release dates, source code\navailability, development activity, and peer review status, providing valuable\ninsights into the current state of research in this field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
