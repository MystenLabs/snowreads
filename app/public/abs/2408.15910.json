Different from previous studies, we find that there is still viable\nparameter space in this model to explain the discrepancy $\\Delta\na_\\mu=a_{\\mu}(\\mathrm{Exp})-a_{\\mu}(\\mathrm{SM})$. While being consistent with\nthe current data of neutrino mass, electroweak precision measurements and the\nperturbativity of couplings, our model can provide new physics contribution\n$a_\\mu^\\textrm{NP}$ to cover the central region of $\\Delta a_\\mu$ with new\nscalar and lepton mass as low as around TeV. This mass scale is allowed by the\ncurrent collider searches for doubly charged scalars and the lepton triplet,\nand they can be tested at future high energy and/or high luminosity colliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
