To do so, we\nemploy standard radiation and matter as barotropic background, speculating on\nthe existence of a further real fluid, interpreted as a possible matter with\npressure constituent. We thus illustrate its main characteristics, showing how\nit may face the flatness and horizon problems, yielding an equivalent number of\ne-foldings, compatible with theoretical expectations. Moreover, we calculate\nthe associated equilibrium and kinetic temperatures, and compute\nout-of-equilibrium properties, in terms of particle production and effective\nreheating mechanism. Accordingly, we revise how inflation ends and how to fix\nthe free parameters of our model from observations. Last but not least, we\npropose how to obtain a bare cosmological constant that could relate the\nlate-time acceleration to inflation, aiming to unify the two approaches.\nFinally, we discuss the corresponding theoretical implications of our treatment\nin contrast to the standard approach reliant on scalar field potentials,\nemphasizing the main advantages and disadvantages.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
