By incorporating\nthe contrastive loss from the CURL algorithm and a reconstruction loss from\nautoencoder, Curled-Dreamer achieves significant improvements in various\nDeepMind Control Suite tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that\nCurled-Dreamer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving\nhigher mean and median scores across a diverse set of tasks. The results\nindicate that the proposed approach not only accelerates learning but also\nenhances the robustness of the learned policies. This work highlights the\npotential of combining different learning paradigms to achieve superior\nperformance in reinforcement learning applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DGVF9zQxIBh5bVd3huVmukclfKg5E88ZNr5OsnShV2k","pdfSize":"2983126"}
