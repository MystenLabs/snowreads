The control commands generated\nthrough BMI for robot operation face issues of low input frequency,\ndiscreteness, and uncertainty due to noise. To address these challenges, our\nmethod estimates the user's intended goal from their commands and uses this\ngoal to generate auxiliary commands through the autonomous system that are both\nat a higher input frequency and more continuous. Furthermore, by defining the\nconfidence level of the estimation, we adaptively calculated the weights for\ncombining user and autonomous commands, thus achieving shared control.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
