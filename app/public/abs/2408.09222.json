As an application, we extract a constructive proof of the fact that\nevery ring $A$ satisfying $\\forall x\\in A. x^3=x$ is commutative from a\nclassical proof. We also prove a similar result for semiprime ideals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
