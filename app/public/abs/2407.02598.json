We propose AutoSplat, a framework employing Gaussian\nsplatting to achieve highly realistic reconstructions of autonomous driving\nscenes. By imposing geometric constraints on Gaussians representing the road\nand sky regions, our method enables multi-view consistent simulation of\nchallenging scenarios including lane changes. Leveraging 3D templates, we\nintroduce a reflected Gaussian consistency constraint to supervise both the\nvisible and unseen side of foreground objects. Moreover, to model the dynamic\nappearance of foreground objects, we estimate residual spherical harmonics for\neach foreground Gaussian. Extensive experiments on Pandaset and KITTI\ndemonstrate that AutoSplat outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scene\nreconstruction and novel view synthesis across diverse driving scenarios.
