Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion\nprocess over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models\nby minimising the weighted Kullback-Leibler divergence to each of the experts'\nmodels. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and proof an\nexplicit representation of the Radon-Nikodym derivative relative to the average\ndrift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, which\nresults in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts'\nbarycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints.\n  Two deep learning algorithms are proposed to find the optimal drift of the\ncombined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at\nlearning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the\nsecond algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the\nvalue function. The paper concludes with a extended application to combine\nimplied volatility smiles models that were estimated on different datasets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Po07lsLkbDPkEJ1wNO1csd2j_NSM4x4dITW1sE8mCUw","pdfSize":"6074639"}
