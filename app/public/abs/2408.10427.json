We give two\nbounded-error quantum algorithms in the adjacency list model that solve the\nproblem on structured instances. The first approach is based on sparsifying the\noriginal graph via sampling the quantum flow state and running a classical\nalgorithm on the smaller problem. It has time complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(l^2\\sqrt{m})$ and uses $O(\\log{l})$ space, where $l$ is the length\n(or total weight, in case of weighted graphs) of the shortest $s$-$t$ path. The\nmain result is the second approach which is based on a divide and conquer\nprocedure that outputs the shortest path in $\\tilde{O}(l\\sqrt{m})$ steps when\nusing $O(\\log{l})$ space, and can be parallelised to $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{lm})$\ncircuit depth when using $O(l\\log{l})$ space. With the latter we partially\nresolve with an affirmative answer the open problem of whether a path between\ntwo vertices can be found in the time required to detect it.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
