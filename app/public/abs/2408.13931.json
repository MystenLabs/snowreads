The\nclassification is achieved by enumerating 2+1 dimensional oriented topological\nquantum field theories that cancel the 't Hooft anomaly associated with the\nsymmetry. This framework is rigorously formulated using twisted crossed\nextensions of modular fusion categories and projective 3-representations.\nAdditionally, we explore the resulting fusion 2-category symmetries and argue\nthat this framework captures all possible categorical symmetries in 2+1\ndimensional oriented field theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
