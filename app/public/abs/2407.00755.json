We describe an effective\nway of constructing such solutions using square-free 2-reductive solutions and\ntwo bijections. We present an algorithm how to obtain all such finite\nsolutions, up to isomorphism. Using this algorithm, we enumerate all solutions\nof multipermutation level 2 up to size 6.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
