The networks are poised on the verge of a\nlocalized instability, and the model allows unique access to both local and\nglobal properties associated with marginal stability. We directly measure\npseudo-gaps in the spectrum of local excitations, as well as diverging\nfluctuations under shear. The networks also host quasi-localized, low-frequency\nvibrational modes, and scale-free avalanches of instabilities. We propose a\ncorrection to the scaling between the pseudo-gap exponent and avalanche\nstatistics based on diverging length fluctuations. Crucially, the dynamics are\ndominated by a small population of bonds which are locally unstable. Our model\ncombines a coarse-grained view with a continuous, real-space implementation,\nproviding novel insights to a wide class of amorphous solids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
