To address this\nlimitation, we propose SliceMamba, a simple and effective locally sensitive\nMamba-based medical image segmentation model. SliceMamba includes an efficient\nBidirectional Slice Scan module (BSS), which performs bidirectional feature\nslicing and employs varied scanning mechanisms for sliced features with\ndistinct shapes. This design ensures that spatially adjacent features remain\nclose in the scanning sequence, thereby improving segmentation performance.\nAdditionally, to fit the varying sizes and shapes of lesions and organs, we\nfurther introduce an Adaptive Slice Search method to automatically determine\nthe optimal feature slice method based on the characteristics of the target\ndata. Extensive experiments on two skin lesion datasets (ISIC2017 and\nISIC2018), two polyp segmentation (Kvasir and ClinicDB) datasets, and one\nmulti-organ segmentation dataset (Synapse) validate the effectiveness of our\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
