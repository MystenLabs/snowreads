The inversion graph of a graph $G$, denoted by\n$\\mathcal{I}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are orientations of $G$ in which\ntwo orientations $\\overrightarrow{G_1}$ and $\\overrightarrow{G_2}$ are adjacent\nif and only if there is an inversion $X$ transforming $\\overrightarrow{G_1}$\ninto $\\overrightarrow{G_2}$. The inversion diameter of a graph $G$ is the\ndiameter of its inversion graph $\\mathcal{I}(G)$ denoted by\n$diam(\\mathcal{I}(G))$. Havet, H\\\"orsch, and Rambaud~(2024) first proved that\nfor $G$ of treewidth $k$, $diam(\\mathcal{I}(G)) \\le 2k$, and there are graphs\nof treewidth $k$ with inversion diameter $k+2$. In this paper, we construct\ngraphs of treewidth $k$ with inversion diameter $2k$, which implies that the\nprevious upper bound $diam(\\mathcal{I}(G)) \\le 2k$ is tight. Moreover, for\ngraphs with maximum degree $\\Delta$, Havet, H\\\"orsch, and Rambaud~(2024) proved\n$diam(\\mathcal{I}(G)) \\le 2\\Delta-1$ and conjectured that $diam(\\mathcal{I}(G))\n\\le \\Delta$. We prove the conjecture when $\\Delta=3$ with the help of computer\ncalculations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
