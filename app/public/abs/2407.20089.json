End-to-end effective signal to interference and noise ratios (SINRs) and\nachievable rates are derived for these different types of relay nodes.\nPerformance and complexity tradeoffs are discussed with a simulation over a\nManhattan topology setting. Over-the-air (OTA) test results corroborates the\nfindings in this paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"_wTDxHvjtYXdCIDrnx16_UgeSEwvpK17SrW7NbgRYJ8","pdfSize":"1687610"}
