However, due to the influence of\nlight and medium, the underwater environment undergoes a distinctive imaging\nprocess, which presents challenges in accurately estimating depth from a single\nimage. The existing methods fail to consider the unique characteristics of\nunderwater environments, leading to inadequate estimation results and limited\ngeneralization performance. Furthermore, underwater depth estimation requires\nextracting and fusing both local and global features, which is not fully\nexplored in existing methods. In this paper, an end-to-end learning framework\nfor underwater monocular depth estimation called UMono is presented, which\nincorporates underwater image formation model characteristics into network\narchitecture, and effectively utilize both local and global features of\nunderwater image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is\neffective for underwater monocular depth estimation and outperforms the\nexisting methods in both quantitative and qualitative analyses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
