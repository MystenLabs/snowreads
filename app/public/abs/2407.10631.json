This method relies on the assumption\nthat the tree-level Higgs-top Yukawa coupling strength is the same for on-shell\nand off-shell Higgs boson production processes. The result is based on up to\n140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\nCollider. The observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit on\n$\\Gamma_H$ is 450 MeV (75 MeV). Additionally, considering the constraint on the\nHiggs-top Yukawa coupling from loop-induced Higgs boson production and decay\nprocesses further yields an observed (expected) upper limit of 160 MeV (55\nMeV).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
