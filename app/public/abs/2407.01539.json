Specifically, induced by net export\ngrowth, credit expansion in private-label mortgages, rather than\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise mortgages, causes a much stronger boom and bust\ncycle in household leverage in the high net-export-growth areas. In addition,\nsuch a stronger household leverage cycle creates a stronger boom and bust cycle\nin the local economy, including housing prices, residential construction\ninvestment, and house-related employment. Thus, our results are consistent with\nthe credit-driven household demand channel (Mian and Sufi, 2018). Further, we\nshow multiple pieces of evidence against the corporate channel, which is\nemphasized by other business cycle theories (hypotheses).\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
