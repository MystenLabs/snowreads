Let $C$ be a non-degenerate, reduced\nand irreducible complex projective curve in $\\mathbb P^r$, of degree $d$, not\ncontained in a hypersurface of degree $\\leq i$. Let $p_a(C)$ be the arithmetic\ngenus of $C$. Continuing previous research, under the assumption $d\\gg\n\\max\\{r,i\\}$, in the present paper we exhibit a Castelnuovo bound $G_0(r;d,i)$\nfor $p_a(C)$. In general, we do not know whether this bound is sharp. However,\nwe are able to prove it is sharp when $i=2$, $r=6$ and $d\\equiv 0,3,6$ (mod\n$9$). Moreover, when $i=2$, $r\\geq 9$, $r$ is divisible by $3$, and $d\\equiv 0$\n(mod $r(r+3)/6$), we prove that if $G_0(r;d,i)$ is not sharp, then for the\nmaximal value of $p_a(C)$ there are only three possibilities. The case in which\n$i=2$ and $r$ is not divisible by $3$ has already been examined in the\nliterature. We give some information on the extremal curves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
