Firstly, we\ntranscribe Chalendar, Chevrot and Partington's result to vector-valued Hardy\nspace $H^{2}_{\\ma{H}}(\\mathbb{D})$ when $\\ma{H}$ is an infinite dimensional\nseparable complex Hilbert space. Secondly, we explore the definition of nearly\ninvariant subspaces on Hardy space over the bidisk, and apply it to\ncharacterize kernels of Toeplitz operators. Finally, we define the nearly\ninvariant subspaces for commutative isometric tuples, which allows us to show\nthat the kernel of general Toeplitz operators is also nearly invariant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
