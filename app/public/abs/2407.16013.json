The\nspike train of a visual neuron is recorded simultaneously with the stimulus\npresentation. The neuron's STRF is estimated by averaging the stimulus frames\nthat coincide with spikes at fixed latencies. Although this is a widely used\ntechnique, an analytical method for determining the statistical significance of\nthe estimated value of the STRF pixels seems to be lacking. Such a significance\ntest would be useful for identifying the significant features of the STRF and\ninvestigating their relationship with experimental variables. Here, the\ndistribution of the estimated STRF pixel values is derived for given spike\ntrains, under the null hypothesis that spike occurrences and stimulus values\nare statistically independent. This distribution is then used for computing\namplitude thresholds to determine the STRF pixels where the null hypothesis can\nbe rejected at a desired two-tailed significance level. It is also proposed\nthat the size of the receptive field may be inferred from the significant\npixels. The application of the proposed method is illustrated on spike trains\ncollected from individual mouse retinal ganglion cells.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uP_TzvdF7OZvBKf5MEMe2MQDfesWdLE_T62HefHLM5Q","pdfSize":"566465"}
