It contains two\noverlapping tiers. The Wide tier ($\\sim 400~{\\rm arcmin}^2$) performs\nNIRCam/WFSS 2.4-5 micron grism spectroscopy with three epochs over 3 years\n(final continuum ${\\rm S/N/pixel>3}$ at F444W$<22.2$). The Deep tier ($\\sim\n50~{\\rm arcmin}^2$) performs high-multiplexing NIRSpec 0.6-5.3 micron MOS/PRISM\nspectroscopy for $\\sim 10,000$ targets, over 18 epochs with a 2-month cadence\n(epoch/final continuum ${\\rm S/N/pixel>3}$ at F200W$\\lesssim 27/29$). All\nepochs have simultaneous multi-band NIRCam and MIRI imaging ($5\\sigma$ final\ndepths of $\\sim 28-29$ in NIRCam and $\\sim 25$ in MIRI). The field is within\nthe continuous viewing zone of JWST, and is fully covered by the Euclid\nUltra-Deep Field, with 0.9-2 micron deep Euclid spectroscopy and cadenced\nphotometry. NEXUS has three science pillars. First, with its massive and nearly\ncomplete (flux-limited) spectroscopic samples and deep photometry, it will\nperform efficient classification and physical characterization of galaxies and\nAGNs from $z\\sim 1$ to Cosmic Dawn. With the large contiguous area coverage, it\nwill measure the spatial clustering and demography of the first galaxies and\nSMBHs at $z>6$. Second, multi-epoch observations enable systematic time-domain\ninvestigations, focusing on $z>3$ transients and low-mass AGN reverberation\nmapping. Third, the comprehensive data set will enable knowledge transfer to\nother legacy fields, create data challenges, and initiate benchmark work for\nfuture space missions. With rapid public releases of processed data and an open\ninvitation for collaboration, NEXUS aims for broad and swift community\nengagement, to become a powerhouse to drive transformative advancements in\nmultiple key science areas of astronomy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
