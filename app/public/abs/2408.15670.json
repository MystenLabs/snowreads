In this paper, we focus on randomized designs for estimating\nthe total treatment effect (TTE), defined as the average difference in\npotential outcomes between fully treated and fully controlled groups. We\npropose a simple design called weighted random isolation (WRI) along with a\nrestricted difference-in-means estimator (RDIM) for TTE estimation.\nAdditionally, we derive a novel mean squared error surrogate for the RDIM\nestimator, supported by a network-adaptive weight selection algorithm. This can\nhelp us determine a fair weight for the WRI design, thereby effectively\nreducing the bias. Our method accommodates directed networks, extending\nprevious frameworks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method\noutperforms nine established methods across a wide range of scenarios.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
