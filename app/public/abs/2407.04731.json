It is envisioned that the deployment of numerous RISs in a\nmobile network will serve user equipments (UEs) to boost various key\nperformance indicators (KPIs), with lower energy consumption compared to\nalternative solutions (e.g., relays, and network-controlled repeaters).\nHowever, the knowledge of whether or not a UE is being served through an RIS\nand if so, which RIS it is being served by is crucial and beneficial for\nvarious network planning and operational reasons. In this paper, we address the\nimportance and the benefits of RIS identification in a mobile network.\nAdditionally, we guide the readers and researchers by introducing alternative\nmethods to enable RIS identification. Through the lens of this research, we\nunveil and shed light to various benefits, the challenges, and future\nopportunities in the identification of RISs serving mobile users in complex\nnetwork environments, highlighting the necessity for advanced identification\nstrategies to fully harness the potential of RIS technology in next-generation\nwireless systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VphHqrkUcR0KnohBo-XKx0jmHp3Gq2wilSIxRb0be2Y","pdfSize":"3025853"}
