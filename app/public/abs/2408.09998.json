This is a prominent\nproblem in healthcare logistics, where specimens (blood, plasma, urin etc.)\ncollected from patients in doctor's offices and hospitals are transported to a\ncentral laboratory for advanced analysis. To the best of our knowledge,\navailable exact solution approaches for CDSP have been able to solve only small\ninstances with up to 9 delivery requests. In this paper, we propose a two-index\nmixed-integer programming formulation that, when used with an off-the-shelf\nsolver, results in a fast exact solution approach. Computational experiments on\na benchmark data set confirm that the proposed formulation outperforms both the\nstate-of-the-art model and the state-of-the-art metaheuristic from the\nliterature, solving 80 out of 168 benchmark instances to optimality, including\na significant number of instances with 100 delivery requests.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
