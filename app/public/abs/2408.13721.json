In this work, we\npresent a novel algorithmic framework for estimating quantum amplitudes by\ntransforming pure states into their matrix forms and encoding them into density\nmatrices and unitary operators. Our framework presents two specific estimation\nprotocols, achieving the standard quantum limit $\\epsilon^{-2}$ and the\nHeisenberg limit $\\epsilon^{-1}$, respectively. Our approach significantly\nreduces the complexity of estimation when states exhibit specific entanglement\nproperties. We also introduce a new technique called channel block encoding for\npreparing density matrices, providing optimal constructions for gate-based\nquantum circuits and Hamiltonian simulations. The framework yields considerable\nadvancements contingent on circuit depth or simulation time. A minimum of\nsuperpolynomial improvement can be achieved when the depth or the time is\nwithin the range of $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{poly}\\log(n))$. Moreover, in certain\nextreme cases, an exponential improvement can be realized. Based on our\nresults, various complexity-theoretic implications are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
