{"id":"2407.11198","title":"A Framework For Discussing LLMs as Tools for Qualitative Analysis","authors":"James Eschrich, Sarah Sterman","authorsParsed":[["Eschrich","James",""],["Sterman","Sarah",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 19:34:12 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-17","timestamp":1721072052000,"abstract":"  We review discourses about the philosophy of science in qualitative research\nand evidence from cognitive linguistics in order to ground a framework for\ndiscussing the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to support the qualitative\nanalysis process. This framework involves asking two key questions: \"is the LLM\nproposing or refuting a qualitative model?\" and \"is the human researcher\nchecking the LLM's decision-making directly?\". We then discuss an implication\nof this framework: that using LLMs to surface counter-examples for human review\nrepresents a promising space for the adoption of LLMs into the qualitative\nresearch process. This space is promising because it is a site of overlap\nbetween researchers working from a variety of philosophical assumptions,\nenabling productive cross-paradigm collaboration on tools and practices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
