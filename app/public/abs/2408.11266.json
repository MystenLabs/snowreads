This work introduces the basic principles of deep\nlearning and the Deep Galerkin method, which uses deep neural networks to solve\ndifferential equations. This primer aims to provide technical and practical\ninsights into the Deep Galerkin method and its implementation. We demonstrate\nhow to solve the one-dimensional heat equation step-by-step. We also show how\nto apply the Deep Galerkin method to solve systems of ordinary differential\nequations and integral equations, such as the Fredholm of the second kind.\nAdditionally, we provide code snippets within the text and the complete source\ncode on Github. The examples are designed so that one can run them on a simple\ncomputer without needing a GPU.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"LKnsctpwct6zl7GIvhBNCvZ8GtrgItORcW_PwXE01aQ","pdfSize":"1368467"}
