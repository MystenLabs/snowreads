The quantum behaviour was derived from Fisher\ninformation terms which were added to the classical Lagrangian. It was thus\nshown that a quantum mechanical system is drived by information and not only\nelectromagnetic fields.\n  This program was applied also to Pauli's equations by removing the\nrestriction of potential flow and using the Clebsch formalism. Although the\nanalysis was quite successful there were still terms that did not admit\ninterpretation, some of them can be easily traced to the relativistic Dirac\ntheory. Here we repeat the analysis for a relativistic flow, pointing to a new\napproach for deriving relativistic quantum mechanics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ofWewnjgOvEGa_-62p_Jnxl3IA3T6II_AjF1N4XWL4s","pdfSize":"149643"}
