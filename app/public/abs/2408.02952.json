{"id":"2408.02952","title":"A neo-Kantian explanation of the applicability of mathematics to physics","authors":"Jorge Manero","authorsParsed":[["Manero","Jorge",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2024 04:33:41 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-07","timestamp":1722918821000,"abstract":"  Various 'optimistic' attempts have been made to reasonably explain the\nundeniable effectiveness of mathematics in its application to physics. They\nrange over retrospective, historical accounts of mathematical applicability\nbased on pragmatic considerations, on the one side, and prospective accounts\nbased on indispensability considerations, on the other. In view of some\nobjections that I will raise against these accounts, I would like to propose a\nthird alternative based on Ernst Cassirer's neo-Kantian view which can overcome\nthese objections and embrace both pragmatic and indispensability\nconsiderations. According to this view, mathematics and physics are seen as\ndifferent modes of a basic process of cognitive synthesis that are essentially\napplied to each other according to a priori principles of theory development\ninherently incorporated into scientists' minds. As emphasised by Cassirer,\nthese principles have a constitutive role (i.e., they explain the relevant\nphenomena across scientific change) and a regulative role (i.e., they\nincorporate the ideal of unity, permanence and generality at each stage of\nknowledge), both of which have been captured through a functional (i.e.,\nstructural) understanding of concepts. As a particular case study, these\nprinciples shall be instantiated by invariance groups responsible for the\neffectiveness of applying Lie group theory to physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gxPa27TED78YmM9k6wh4mJh0kWwz-knf4TwiNNoNDhU","pdfSize":"261956"}
