One can try to weaken\nthe coupling between the device and the system, in order to avoid the veto. We\ndemonstrate, however, that a weak pointer is at the same time an inaccurate\none, and the information about the path taken by the system in each individual\ntrial is inevitably lost. We show also that a similar problem occurs if a\nclassical system is monitored by an inaccurate quantum meter. In both cases one\ncan still determine some characteristic of the corresponding statistical\nensemble, a relation between path probabilities in the classical case, and a\nrelation between the probability amplitudes if a quantum system is involved.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
