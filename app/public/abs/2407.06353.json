We establish that the generalized\nAuslander-Reiten conjecture implies the Wakamatsu tilting conjecture.\nFurthermore, we prove that any Wakamatsu tilting R-module of finite projective\ndimension that is tensorly faithful is projective. By utilizing this result, we\nshow the validity of the Wakamatsu tilting conjecture for R in two cases: when\nR is a left Artinian local ring or when it is the group ring of a finite group\nG over a commutative Artinian ring.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
