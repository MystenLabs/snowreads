Previous approaches face the challenges of not\nutilizing experience during testing and relying on a single short-term history,\nwhich limits adaptation to evolving data. In this paper, we introduce the\nOnline Neural-Symbolic Event Prediction (ONSEP) framework, which innovates by\nintegrating dynamic causal rule mining (DCRM) and dual history augmented\ngeneration (DHAG). DCRM dynamically constructs causal rules from real-time\ndata, allowing for swift adaptation to new causal relationships. In parallel,\nDHAG merges short-term and long-term historical contexts, leveraging a\nbi-branch approach to enrich event prediction. Our framework demonstrates\nnotable performance enhancements across diverse datasets, with significant\nHit@k (k=1,3,10) improvements, showcasing its ability to augment large language\nmodels (LLMs) for event prediction without necessitating extensive retraining.\nThe ONSEP framework not only advances the field of TKGF but also underscores\nthe potential of neural-symbolic approaches in adapting to dynamic data\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
