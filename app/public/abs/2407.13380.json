Duan, W. Barsukow, C. Klingenberg,\narXiv:2405.02447]. The FVS-based point value update is shown to address the\nmesh alignment issue that appeared in a quasi-2D Riemann problem along one axis\ndirection on Cartesian meshes. Consequently, the AF methods based on the FVS\noutperform those using Jacobian splitting, which are prone to transonic and\nmesh alignment issues. A shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the\nconvex limiting for the cell average, which can reduce oscillations well. Some\nbenchmark problems are tested to verify the accuracy, BP property, and\nshock-capturing ability of our BP AF method. Moreover, for the double Mach\nreflection and forward-facing step problems, the present AF method can capture\ncomparable or better small-scale features compared to the third-order\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method with the TVB limiter on the same mesh resolution,\nwhile using fewer degrees of freedom, demonstrating the efficiency and\npotential of our BP AF method for high Mach number flows.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
