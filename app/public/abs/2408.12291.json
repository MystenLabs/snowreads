We prove that\nthese retractions uniquely extend to any parabolic subgroup. We use retractions\nto generalize the results of Antol\\'in and Foniqi that reduce the problem of\nintersection of parabolic subgroups to weaker conditions. As a corollary, we\ncharacterize coherence for the FC case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
