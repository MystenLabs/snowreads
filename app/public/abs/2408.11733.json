We introduce\ncompositionality as an inductive bias in a cross-modal segmentation network to\nimprove segmentation performance and interpretability while reducing\ncomplexity. The proposed network is an end-to-end cross-modal segmentation\nframework that enforces compositionality on the learned representations using\nlearnable von Mises-Fisher kernels. These kernels facilitate content-style\ndisentanglement in the learned representations, resulting in compositional\ncontent representations that are inherently interpretable and effectively\ndisentangle different anatomical structures. The experimental results\ndemonstrate enhanced segmentation performance and reduced computational costs\non multiple medical datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate the interpretability\nof the learned compositional features.
