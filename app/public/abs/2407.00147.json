These diagnostic errors imply a failure to recognize the need for\nhospitalization and deliver appropriate care, and thus also bear important\nconnotations for patient safety. In this paper, we show how data mining\ntechniques can be applied to a large existing hospitalization data set to learn\nuseful models that predict these upcoming hospitalizations with high accuracy.\nSpecifically, we use an ensemble of logistics regression, na\\\"ive Bayes and\nassociation rule classifiers to successfully predict hospitalization within 3,\n7 and 14 days of an emergency department discharge. Aside from high accuracy,\none of the advantages of the techniques proposed here is that the resulting\nclassifier is easily inspected and interpreted by humans so that the learned\nrules can be readily operationalized. These rules can then be easily\ndistributed and applied directly by physicians in emergency department settings\nto predict the risk of early admission prior to discharging their emergency\ndepartment patients.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
