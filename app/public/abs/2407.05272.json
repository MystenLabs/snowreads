Then we applied $6^{\\rm{th}}$ order WKB approximation to analyze\nquasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black hole in the Cold Dark Matter halo in\nperturbed fields with different spins and derived quasinormal frequencies.\nFurther, to study the relation between quasinormal frequencies and optics, we\ncompare the results of WKB method with eikonal limit formula. At last, we\ndiscussed greybody factor in different perturbed fields under this spacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
