By using a tight-binding model with\nintersite hopping matrix element dependent on the interatomic distance, we find\nmass-dependent backscattering probability by single and pairs of isotopic\nimpurities. For the pairs, in addition to the mass, the distance between the\nisotopes plays the critical role. Single impurities effectively attract\nelectrons and can produce localized weakly bound electron states. In the\npresence of disorder, the electron free path at positive energies becomes\nfinite and the corresponding Anderson localization at the spatial scale greatly\nexceeding the distance between the impurities becomes possible.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q_FhqycBaVENp6UU_klyquboTF7npOIvp6mxGU7PATc","pdfSize":"2525448"}
