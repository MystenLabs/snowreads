This paper proposes a new, universal definition\nby tracing the evolution of interoperability and identifying challenges posed\nby varying definitions. This definition addresses these inconsistencies,\noffering a robust solution applicable across diverse fields. Adopting this\nunified approach will enhance global collaboration and drive innovation by\nremoving obstacles to interoperability posed by conflicting or incomplete\ndefinitions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
