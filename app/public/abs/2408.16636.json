For\neach unit vector $\\bf\\ell$, we prove sharp asymptotics for the probability that\nthis cluster contains a vertex $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfies $x \\cdot\n\\bf\\ell \\geq u$. For an axially aligned $\\bf\\ell$, we find this probability to\nbe of the form $\\kappa \\exp \\{ - \\zeta u \\}(1+ {\\rm err})$ for $u \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$, where $\\vert {\\rm err} \\vert$ is at most $C \\exp \\{ - c u^{1/2}\n\\big\\}$; for general $\\bf\\ell$, the form of the asymptotic depends on whether\n$\\bf\\ell$ satisfies a natural lattice condition. To obtain these results, we\nprove that renewal points in long clusters are abundant, with a renewal block\nlength whose tail is shown to decay as fast as $C \\exp \\big\\{ - c u^{1/2}\n\\big\\}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
