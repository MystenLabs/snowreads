For the Wald inference, we\nshow that our wild bootstrap Wald test, with or without studentization using\nthe cluster-robust covariance estimator (CRVE), controls size asymptotically up\nto a small error as long as the parameter of endogenous variable is strongly\nidentified in at least one of the clusters. We further show that the wild\nbootstrap Wald test with CRVE studentization is more powerful for distant local\nalternatives than that without. Last, we develop a wild bootstrap\nAnderson-Rubin (AR) test for the weak-identification-robust inference. We show\nit controls size asymptotically up to a small error, even under weak or partial\nidentification for all clusters. We illustrate the good finite-sample\nperformance of the new inference methods using simulations and provide an\nempirical application to a well-known dataset about US local labor markets.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
