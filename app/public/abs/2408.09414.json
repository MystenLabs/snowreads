However, little is known about how these\nalgorithms emerge during training. In this article, we study the training\ndynamics of a simplified transformer with 2-dimensional embeddings on the\nproblem of modular addition. We observe that embedding vectors tend to organize\ninto two types of structures: grids and circles. We study these structures and\nexplain their emergence as a result of two simple tendencies exhibited by pairs\nof embeddings: clustering and alignment. We propose explicit formulae for these\ntendencies as interaction forces between different pairs of embeddings. To show\nthat our formulae can fully account for the emergence of these structures, we\nconstruct an equivalent particle simulation where we find that identical\nstructures emerge. We use our insights to discuss the role of weight decay and\nreveal a new mechanism that links regularization and training dynamics. We also\nrelease an interactive demo to support our findings:\nhttps://modular-addition.vercel.app/.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"avLiAfdZ-V3x8pr13WCK57SHUF0ZPB1J8HFbpx_qB6Y","pdfSize":"9703221"}
