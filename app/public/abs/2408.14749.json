Decomposing the system into actuated (output) and unactuated (zero)\ncoordinates provides useful insight as to how input enters the system dynamics.\nIn this work, we leverage the structure of this decomposition to formalize the\nidea of Zero Dynamics Policies (ZDPs) -- a mapping from the unactuated\ncoordinates to desired actuated coordinates. Specifically, we show that a ZDP\nexists in a neighborhood of the origin, and prove that combining output\nstabilization with a ZDP results in stability of the full system state. We\ndetail a constructive method of obtaining ZDPs in a neighborhood of the origin,\nand propose a learning-based approach which leverages optimal control to obtain\nZDPs with much larger regions of attraction. We demonstrate that such a\nparadigm can be used to stabilize the canonical underactuated system of the\ncartpole, and showcase an improvement over the nominal performance of LQR.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
