The $k$-token graph of $G$ is the graph $F_k(G)$ whose vertices are\nall the $k$-subsets of vertices of $G$, two of which are adjacent whenever\ntheir symmetric difference is an edge of $G$. Every automorphism of $G$ induces\nan automorphism of $F_k(G)$ in a natural way. Suppose that $S:=\\{x,y\\}$ is a\ncut set of $G$, such that $x$ and $y$ have the same neighbours in $G\\setminus\n\\{x,y\\}$. In this paper we show that there exist a large number of\nautomorphisms of $F_k(G)$ defined by $S$ that are not induced by automorphisms\nof $G$. We also describe the group produced by all such $2$-cuts of $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
