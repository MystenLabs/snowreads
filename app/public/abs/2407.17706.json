Similar to classic\nmachine-learning models, VQCs can be optimized through gradient-based\napproaches. However, the gradient variance of VQCs may dramatically vanish as\nthe number of qubits or layers increases. This issue, a.k.a. Barren Plateaus\n(BPs), seriously hinders the scaling of VQCs on large datasets. To mitigate the\nexponential gradient vanishing, extensive efforts have been devoted to tackling\nthis issue through diverse strategies. In this survey, we conduct a systematic\nliterature review of recent works from both investigation and mitigation\nperspectives. Besides, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize most existing\nmitigation strategies. At last, we provide insightful discussion for future\ndirections of BPs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
