These lethal non-trackable objects will\nonly become more numerous as more payloads and debris are launched into orbit\nand increase the collision rate. In this paper, the long-term effect of\ncollisions is simulated with an efficient Monte-Carlo method to simulate the\nfuture LEO environment including lethal non-trackable objects, which is\ntypically ignored due to the large computational resources required. The\nresults show that simulations that do not incorporate lethal non-trackable\ndebris would be omitting a large number of debilitating collisions with active\npayloads and catastrophic collisions to a smaller effect. This shows the\nimportance of simulating small debris in the long-term evolution of the orbital\npopulation, which is often omitted in the literature. This increased debris\npopulation and consequentially the risk to orbital payloads diminishes as\nsmaller lethal non-trackable objects are considered. An efficient and validated\nmodel is used to simulate these numerous small objects. Several future cases\nsuch as launches of registered megaconstellations, improved post-mission\ndisposal rates and no-future launches are explored to understand the effect of\nthe inclusion or exclusion of lethal non-trackable objects.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
