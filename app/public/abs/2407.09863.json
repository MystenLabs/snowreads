Due to this and various other applications,\nobstacle problems become an important part of our literature. A lot of work is\ndedicated to the solution of the obstacle problems. However, obstacle problems\nare not solved by the considered method in the literature we have visited. In\nthis work, we have investigated the finding of the exact solution to several\nobstacle problems using the optimal homotopy asymptotic method (OHAM). The\ngraphical representation of results represents the symmetry among them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6q-J0-v7BPpCJpRk8XRpFHSl5NCTW4fUJItQxh4V7B4","pdfSize":"739129","objectId":"0xdff9894cbb48a643f38ed606379e82d5576695ad0be093cc54a2f8f309d96d49","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
