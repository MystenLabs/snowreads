Naive\nintegrands are inflicted with $1/0$ ambiguities associated with tadpoles and\nmassless external bubbles, which destroy integrand-level gauge invariance as\nwell as consistent on-shell factorization on single loop-cuts. In this letter,\nwe show that this essentially kinematical obstruction to defining \"the\"\nintegrand for Yang-Mills theory has a structural solution, handed to us by the\nformulation of gluon amplitudes in terms of curves on surfaces. This defines\n\"surface kinematics\" generalizing momenta, making it possible to define \"the\"\nintegrand satisfying both a (surface generalized) notion of gauge-invariance\nand consistent loop-cuts. The integrand also vanishes at infinity in\nappropriate directions, allowing it to be recursively computed for\nnon-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in any number of dimensions. We illustrate\nthese ideas through one loop for all multiplicity, and for the simplest\ntwo-loop integrand.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
