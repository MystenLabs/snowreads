Although Angantyr is still under development, the existing\nimplementation is enough to study the particle production in systems where\nmedium effects are absent. Firstly, ALICE data on pseudorapidity distributions\nas a function of the forward multiplicity (V0M), as well as transverse momentum\ndistributions of identified particles in non-single diffractive p-Pb\ncollisions, are compared with Angantyr. Secondly, the average number of binary\nnucleon-nucleon ($N_{\\rm coll}$) collisions for different \"centrality\"\nestimators are compared. The studies include the following \"centrality\"\nestimators: V0M, $\\rho$ and midrapidity multiplicity (CL1). On one hand, the\n\"centrality\" dependence of $\\langle N_{\\rm coll} \\rangle$ for the $\\rho$\nselection shows the smallest deviations ($<8$ %) with respect to that obtained\nusing impact parameter $b$; on the other hand, the V0M and CL1 yield huge\ndeviations (up to a factor 2) with respect to the results using $b$. The\nparticle ratios and nuclear modification factors ($Q_{\\rm pPb}$) as a function\nof $p_{\\rm T}$ are also studied. The proton-to-pion ratio exhibits a flow-like\npeak at intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$ (2-8 GeV/$c$) with little or no \"centrality\"\ndependence for V0M, $\\rho$ and $b$ selections. The kaon-to-pion ratio as a\nfunction of $p_{\\rm T}$ is \"centrality\" independent for the same selections. On\nthe contrary, for the CL1 class the ratios exhibit the typical behaviour\nassociated with hard physics. Regarding $Q_{\\rm pPb}$, a peak at intermediate\n$p_{\\rm T}$ ($2-8$ GeV/$c$) for different particle species is observed when the\n\"centrality\" is obtained with $b$ or $\\rho$. The observed features diminish for\nthe selections based on V0M and CL1.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
