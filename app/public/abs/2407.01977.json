We propose and analyze a new conforming\naugmented mixed finite element method and a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method\nfor the velocity-vorticity-pressure formulation. The continuous formulation,\nwhich incorporates least-squares terms from both the constitutive equation and\nthe incompressibility condition, is well-posed under certain assumptions on the\nviscosity parameter. The CG method is divergence-conforming and suits any\nStokes inf-sup stable velocity-pressure finite element pair, while a generic\ndiscrete space approximates vorticity. The DG scheme employs a stabilization\ntechnique, and a piecewise constant discretization estimates the control\nvariable. We establish optimal a priori and residual-based a posteriori error\nestimates for the proposed schemes. Finally, we provide numerical experiments\nto showcase the method's performance and effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
