However, the most popular and practical\nnonadiabatic molecular dynamics techniques, Tully's fewest-switches surface\nhopping and Ehrenfest mean-field dynamics, are unable to describe the dynamics\nproceeding from an initial electronic coherence. While such issues are not\nencountered with the analogous coupled-trajectory algorithms or numerically\nexact quantum dynamics methods, applying such methods necessarily comes with a\nhigher computational cost. Here we show that a correct description of initial\nelectronic coherence can indeed be achieved using methods that are based on an\nensemble of independent trajectories. The key is the introduction of an initial\nsampling over the electronic phase space and the use of the correct observable\nmeasures, both of which are naturally achieved when working within the\nsemiclassical mapping framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ngPxPMytKopFF8Kr7RJzOMlW_DQ5S4W-wUaH__ilbKU","pdfSize":"5160739"}
