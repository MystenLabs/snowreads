However, the\nlimited FOV interrupts the generation of descriptions and impacts place\nrecognition adversely. Therefore, we suffer from correcting accumulated drift\nerrors in a consistent map using LiDAR-based place recognition with limited\nFOV. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition\nmethod for handling narrow FOV scenarios. The proposed method establishes\nspatial organization based on the range-elevation bin and azimuth-elevation bin\nto represent places. In addition, we achieve a robust place description through\nreweighting based on vertical direction information. Based on these\nrepresentations, our method enables addressing rotational changes and\ndetermining the initial heading. Additionally, we designed a lightweight and\nfast approach for the robot's onboard autonomy. For rigorous validation, the\nproposed method was tested across various LiDAR place recognition scenarios\n(i.e., single-session, multi-session, and multi-robot scenarios). To the best\nof our knowledge, we report the first method to cope with the restricted FOV.\nOur place description and SLAM codes will be released.
