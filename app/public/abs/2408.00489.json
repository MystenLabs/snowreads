To solve this problem, a multi-label pipe defect recognition method is\nproposed based on mask attention guided feature enhancement and label\ncorrelation learning. The proposed method can achieve current approximate\nstate-of-the-art classification performance using just 1/16 of the Sewer-ML\ntraining dataset and exceeds the current best method by 11.87\\% in terms of F2\nmetric on the full dataset, while also proving the superiority of the model.\nThe major contribution of this study is the development of a more efficient\nmodel for identifying and locating multiple defects in sewer pipe images for a\nmore accurate sewer pipeline condition assessment. Moreover, by employing class\nactivation maps, our method can accurately pinpoint multiple defect categories\nin the image which demonstrates a strong model interpretability.
