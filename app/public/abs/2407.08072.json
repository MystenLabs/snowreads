Results are presented for two nylon textiles\ncommonly used in parachute systems, MIL-C-7020H Type III and MIL-C-44378(GL)\nType II. Textiles are subjected to incremental tension using a custom apparatus\nthat loads the fabric radially, and the microstructure is imaged sequentially\nat steady load conditions. Micro-tomography images are processed using\nlearning-aided segmentation and a custom processing pipeline that tracks the\nlocations and morphological properties of individual tows on 3-D datasets.\nResults are used to reconstruct tow micro-scale properties and meso-scale\nstrains. Our findings reveal a direct relation between the fabric architecture\nand the meso-scale mechanics. Warp tow pretensioning during manufacturing is\nfound to affect decrimping and the anisotropy of the textile strains. Areal\nporosity increase with tension is quantified and a geometric model for pore\nopening under incremental load is validated.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
