We compare the simplest job-based model, its variant\nwith task clustering, and finally we propose a cloud-native model based on\nmicroservices comprising auto-scalable worker-pools. We implement the proposed\nmodels in the HyperFlow workflow management system, and evaluate them using a\nlarge Montage workflow on a Kubernetes cluster. The results indicate that the\nproposed cloud-native worker-pools execution model achieves best performance in\nterms of average cluster utilization, resulting in a nearly 20\\% improvement of\nthe workflow makespan compared to the best-performing job-based model. However,\nbetter performance comes at the cost of significantly higher complexity of the\nimplementation and maintenance. We believe that our experiments provide a\nvaluable insight into the performance, advantages and disadvantages of\nalternative cloud-native execution models for scientific workflows.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
