Based on measured time series, the\nquantitative characterization of dynamical phase transitions at bifurcation\npoints of the underlying chaotic systems is a notoriously difficult task.\nBuilding on prior theoretical studies that focus on the discontinuities at\n$q=1$ in the order-$q$ R\\'enyi-entropy of the trajectory space, we measure the\nderivative of the spectrum. We derive within the general context of Markov\nprocesses a computationally efficient closed-form expression for this measure.\nWe investigate its properties through well-known dynamical systems exploring\nits scope and limitations. The proposed mathematical instrument can serve as a\npredictor of dynamical phase transitions in time series.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7nUNMC4j2GL4FT1GiGW6YYSdf9Ex1ZW9RQ-VSUCJYTg","pdfSize":"6188285"}
