Ordinal games provide an attractive alternative:\nthey require specifying only which outcomes are preferred to which other ones.\nUnfortunately, they provide little guidance for how to play unless there are\npure Nash equilibria; evaluating mixed strategies appears to fundamentally\nrequire cardinal utilities.\n  In this paper, we observe that we can in fact make good use of mixed\nstrategies in ordinal games if we consider settings that allow for folk\ntheorems. These allow us to find equilibria that are robust, in the sense that\nthey remain equilibria no matter which cardinal utilities are the correct ones\n-- as long as they are consistent with the specified ordinal preferences. We\nanalyze this concept and study the computational complexity of finding such\nequilibria in a range of settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
