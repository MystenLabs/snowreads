We identify shifts in energy, transport, entertainment,\nand computing domains, revealing connections between language and societal\nchanges.\n  Our approach consisted in using diachronic word embeddings trained using\nword2vec with skipgram and aligning them using orthogonal Procrustes. We\ndiscuss possible difficulties linked to the relationships the method\nidentifies. Moreover, we look at the ethical aspects of interpreting results,\nhighlighting the need for expert insights to understand the method's\nsignificance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
